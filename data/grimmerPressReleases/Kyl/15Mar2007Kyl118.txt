SEN. KYL ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR BORDER PORTS OF ENTRY
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today announced over $55 million in new federal funding for border projects along Arizona's southern border. Kyl, who was integral in securing the funds, was informed today by the General Services Administration that his request had been fulfilled.  
   "As I've always contended, the federal government must expend whatever resources are necessary to gain operational control of our border, and that includes taking the steps necessary to help streamline the flow of traffic coming across our borders," said Kyl. "Unless adequate resources are appropriated to help improve ports of entry, economic growth and security in the entire region could be adversely affected." 
   The Nogales-Mariposa port of entry will receive $13.694 million to help reconfigure its infrastructure to better handle the increased traffic coming through the port. The port was initially intended to handle 400 trucks per day but currently processes in excess of 1,400 trucks per day. 
   Kyl also secured $42.029 million for construction of a new port of entry, San Luis II. The current San Luis station has experienced a 235 percent increase in commercial traffic since its initial construction. 
   Kyl has collaborated for many years with federal, state and local leaders to secure adequate funding to complete San Luis II and Nogales projects so that the Yuma and Nogales areas, as well as the entire, state can benefit from the latest advances in port technology.
