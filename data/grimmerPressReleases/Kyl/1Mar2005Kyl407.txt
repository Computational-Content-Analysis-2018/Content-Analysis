SEN. KYL BILL WOULD LIMIT 'GOVERNMENT BY JUDICIAL DECREE'
  Sen. Jon Kyl today introduced legislation, with bipartisan co-sponsorship, that would curb the ability of judges to exercise "government by judicial decree" over long periods of time and through multiple administrations of elected officials.  
   "When self-appointed activist groups persuade judges to impose public policy over the heads of elected officials, there should be two presumptions," Kyl said. "The first is that it should only be for a very, very good reason, and correspondingly rare. The second is that it should be for no longer than absolutely necessary." 
   The bill would make it easier for state and local governments to amend federal court consent decrees - the typical vehicle for judicial intervention - to which they are a party, and require plaintiffs to justify the continued existence of consent decrees after four years or six months after the election of new administrative officials. 
   "There are instances in which consent decrees have served useful purposes, for example by forcing balky bureaucracies to improve care for foster children and the disabled," Kyl said. "But more often, they have the effect of cementing policies for years or decades after political and other circumstances have changed, hamstringing state and local governments that want to pursue new and better approaches." 
   Examples include a 30-year-old consent decree in New York that has forced Hispanic children into bilingual education programs, over the objections of many of their parents, and rulings that have forced the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Los Angeles to spend nearly half of its budget on city buses, at the expense of all the city's other transportation needs. Other sponsors of the bill include senators Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Mark Pryor (D-AR), John Cornyn (R-TX) and Ben Nelson (D-NE).
