SEN. KYL, SESSIONS ADD $2 BILLION FOR BORDER FENCING
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) successfully added a measure to the Department of Defense funding bill that will provide over $2 billion for the construction of 370 miles of triple-layered fencing, and 461 miles of vehicle barriers along the southwest border. The amendment was adopted 94 to 3.  
   "Unlike a previous attempt to provide this type of fencing, today's amendment fully funds the needed fence along our border without having to cut funding from other vital border security efforts," said Kyl. "We must continue devoting the resources necessary to gain control of our borders - and this amendment today takes us one step closer to accomplishing exactly that." 
   Kyl also introduced today an amendment with Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) that will provide $3.9 billion to fund border security efforts including: an additional 500 border patrol agents; funds an increase of 1,300 detention spaces; provides $400 million for the implementation of an employer verification system; $60 million to accelerate the development of US VISIT Entry-Exit system; 800 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agents; and $7.8 million for additional U.S. Attorneys to provide support for increased enforcement activities on the border. 
   "We must put our money where our mouth is," said Kyl. "That is to say that all the things that we've authorized and requested to secure the border we actually fund so we can get the job done. This amendment will help close that gap." 
   A vote is expected on the Kyl-Cornyn amendment later today.
