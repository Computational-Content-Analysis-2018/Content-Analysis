SEN. KYL, SENATE APPROVE SOUTHERN ARIZONA WATER RIGHTS LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today applauded the Senate's passage of legislation (H.R. 3739) that preserves the integrity of the Southern Arizona Water Rights Settlement Act.  
   "This legislation ensures that the intent of Congress will be carried out, and it provides increased certainty that the settlement on which the Nation and countless other parties worked so tirelessly will be effective," Kyl said. 
   The Southern Arizona Water Rights Settlement Act, which was included in the Arizona Water Rights Settlements Act, resolves the water rights claims of the Tohono O'odham Nation in southern Arizona and provides significant funding to enable the Nation to build water infrastructure to meet the needs of its reservation. 
   Senator Kyl supported the bill, originally introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), and worked hard to ensure that it won swift Senate approval before the end of 2007. 
   The House approved the bill earlier this week. It now goes to the President to be signed into law.
