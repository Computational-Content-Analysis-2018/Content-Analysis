SENS. KYL, GRASSLEY TO ELIMINATE PENALTIES SENIORS PAY FOR MEDICARE PART D
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today announced the introduction of a bipartisan bill that will eliminate the penalty seniors would have to pay for signing up late for the Medicare prescription drug benefit program through 2006. 
   "From the beginning, I've said that the penalty if left in place could deter seniors from enrolling," said Kyl. "I am pleased that we've been able to produce a bill that hopefully will provide an added incentive for seniors to sign up for the new Medicare drug program during the next open enrollment period. It's faster and easier than many may think."
   Under current law, seniors who currently are eligible and did not sign up by the May 15 deadline will face a one percent penalty per month on their premium for the duration of their enrollment. Under the proposed bill, the May 15 deadline would remain in place, but the penalty is waived through 2006.
   Arizona enjoys one of the highest national percentages for prescription drug coverage - 76 percent of beneficiaries in the state have prescription drug coverage through their retirement plans, Medicare, and other health care options. And they're seeing real savings.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce released a study recently showing that 84 percent of seniors enrolled in the Medicare prescription drug program are satisfied with the program and a majority report they are seeing significant cost savings. And 77 percent say that they would recommend the prescription plan to others.
   The bipartisan legislation, introduced by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-IA), is co-sponsored by Senators Kyl, Baucus (D-MT), DeWine (R-OH), Nelson (D-FL), Carper (D-DE), Talent (R-MO), Lincoln (D-AR), Snowe (R-ME), Cantwell (D-WA), Santorum (R-PA), Bayh (D-IN), and Burns (R-MT).
