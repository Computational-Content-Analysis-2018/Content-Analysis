SEN. KYL EXAMINES HOW TAX-CUT LAWS ARE ENCOURAGING SAVINGS, INVESTMENT
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight, held a hearing today to examine the need to extend certain tax provisions from the 2001 and 2003 tax laws. The hearing focused on how effective the provisions are for increasing savings and investment, and their overall economic benefit.  
   The provisions discussed included one that allows small businesses to expense (depreciate immediately) $100,000 of business investments, the Savers Credit for low income taxpayers that save money in a 401(k) or other qualified retirement savings vehicle, and the 15 percent tax rate for most dividends and long-term capital gains. 
   Speaking about the tax rate for dividends and capital gains, Kyl said "I think the trends we are seeing for revenues coming into the Treasury and the sustained economic growth we are experiencing argue strongly that these rates must be made permanent. In fact, the Republican leadership of the Senate is committed to extending the lower rates for dividends and capital gains as part of reconciliation later this fall, and to making these rates permanent as soon as possible." 
   David Malpass, Chief Economist of Bear Stearns, noted that Senator Kyl's support will send a very important signal to investors that Congress will work to extend the lower rates. And he argued that allowing the rates to increase, as they will under current law, would have a devastating impact on the economy. 
   "In the coming years, Congress will be faced with an avalanche of expiring tax provisions," said Kyl. "We must begin the process of deciding which provisions to keep and which should be allowed to expire." Most of the widely-used provisions - those applying to broad classes of taxpayers - will expire at the end of 2010, yet other provisions expire between 2006 and 2008.
