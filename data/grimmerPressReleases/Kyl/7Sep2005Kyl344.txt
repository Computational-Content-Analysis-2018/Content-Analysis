SEN. KYL TO JOIN TOP NASCAR DRIVERS AT WALTER REED VETERANS' EVENT
  Sen. Kyl will join a NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt Jr., numerous other drivers, and musicians Aaron Tippin and Lee Greenwood at an event today to show support for wounded U.S. veterans at Walter Reed Hospital and their families.  
   Kyl, a longtime racing fan, praised NASCAR Chairman Brian France for sponsoring the event, along with several corporations. "Our troops know the nation is behind them, but nothing beats a little tangible show of appreciation," he said. "We're very grateful to all of the drivers and musicians who have taken the time to visit hospital wards and show their support. From past experience, I can predict that after visiting with these troops, it will be the celebrities who will say they benefited the most." 
   Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice is also scheduled to speak at the event, slated for 200 soldiers and their families.
