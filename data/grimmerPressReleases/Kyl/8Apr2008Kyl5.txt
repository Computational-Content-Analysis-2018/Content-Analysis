SEN. KYL INTRODUCES U.S. AMBASSADOR NOMINATION BARRETT AT CONFIRMATION HEARING
  The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee today held a confirmation hearing on the nomination of Barbara Barrett to become U.S. ambassador to the Republic of Finland. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl (Ariz.) introduced Barrett at the hearing and made the following statement: 
   "Thank you very much for the courtesy of allowing me to introduce Mrs. Barbara Barrett. I want to assure you that my introduction is more than the obligatory introduction of a constituent. I've known Barbara for quite some time and she has a resume that I can't do justice to, but I will give you the highlights.
   "She has served as President of the International Women's Forum, she was senior advisor to the U.S. mission to the United Nations, and she was chairman of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, which examined U.S. efforts at diplomacy and made significant recommendations in that regard.
   "One of her current passions, which I really admire, is collaborating with the Thunderbird School of Management and the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council on a program to work with, mentor, and train Afghan women as entrepreneurs and effective members of their communities.
   "I can't think of anyone who could more effectively represent the interests of the United States government abroad. Barbara is obviously highly intelligent and has a broad background of experience, a tremendous personality, and great energy - all skills critical in representing the United States in a post abroad.
   "I urge the panel to quickly act on her nomination."
