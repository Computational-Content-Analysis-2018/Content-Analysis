   "I am very saddened to learn of Sam's passing. Sam was deeply committed to public service and to the state. Even after he left elective office, Sam continued serving the people of Arizona. I am grateful for his long-time service on the board of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District. It was an important contribution he made to the state, but may be less well-known by the public. Caryll and I offer his family our condolences."
