SEN. KYL LAUDS FISA BILL PASSAGE, URGES SWIFT HOUSE ACTION
  U.S. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) issued the following statement today regarding Senate passage of the FISA Amendments Act of 2007:  
   "I am pleased to see that the full Senate was able to come together and approve the bipartisan Intelligence Committee bill that modernizes the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   "Preventing terrorist attacks from occurring in the first place is better than having to respond after they have occurred. That is why it is critical that Congress legislatively confirm that the U.S. law enforcement community can engage in the kind of intelligence collection against al Qaeda that technology today allows. I believe the bipartisan Intelligence Committee bill adequately updates FISA, and I commend Chairman Rockefeller and Vice-Chairman Bond for their leadership. 
   "I urge the House of Representatives to quickly approve the Senate-passed bill and give the intelligence community the certainty it needs to track down al Qaeda and prevent terrorist attacks."
