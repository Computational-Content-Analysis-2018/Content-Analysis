SEN. KYL RELEASES KEY FINDINGS OF HEARING ON MOST PRESSING BORDER PROBLEMS
  Sen. Jon Kyl today released a number of startling findings from Tuesday's hearing on pressing issues facing the United States because of the failure to control the U.S.-Mexico border, held jointly by the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security, which he chairs, and the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship, chaired by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX).  
   "While public awareness of problems at the border is growing, most Americans do not yet realize the extent of the problem," Kyl said Wednesday. "Few people know that the fastest growing segment of illegal aliens is from countries other than Mexico and that the vast majority of those are released into the general population on their own recognizance simply because of a lack of detention space to keep them." 
   Witnesses at the hearing included: Border Patrol Chief David Aguilar; Wesley Lee, acting director of detention and removal operations for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and former DHS Assistant Secretary Assistant Secretary of Policy and Planning for Border and Transportation Security Stewart Verdery. They told the subcommittees that: 
   * "Other-than-Mexican" (OTM) illegal aliens crossing the southern border now come from over 100 different countries. 
   * The Border Patrol has apprehended 98,000 OTMs in FY05, 175 percent more than during the comparable period in FY04, which was itself a record year. 
   * Approximately 70 percent of those OTMs were released on their own recognizance, including many whose identities have not been verified because they lacked documentation, because there was no place to keep them. Fewer than one-third subsequently appear for their court hearings. 
   * Approximately 85 percent of OTMs ultimately ordered deported fail to comply and remain illegally in the United States. 
   "In addition to adequately funding the many requirements to secure our border and improve interior enforcement, the most important thing we can do now is to expand the expedited removal process that is currently used only in two of the southern border sectors - Tucson and Laredo," Kyl said. 
   "Expedited removal reduces the time that OTMs spend in the United States from about three months after apprehension to less than one month, thereby reducing the amount of detention space needed and, therefore, the number of illegal aliens released into our population who never return to their country of origin." 
   Cornyn and Kyl recently released details of Title I, which focuses on enforcement provisions and funding issues. It is expected to be part of a three-title comprehensive immigration reform bill to be introduced this summer, tentatively entitled the Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act. Tuesday's hearing, "The Southern Border in Crisis: Resources and Strategies to Improve National Security," is the latest in a series designed to thoroughly review America's immigration laws and the status of their enforcement.
