SEN. KYL ANNOUNCES DRAMATIC INCREASE IN BORDER PATROL AGENTS FOR ARIZONA
  Sen. Jon Kyl today announced that he has been informed that Arizona will receive the bulk of 1,700 new Border Patrol agents to be assigned by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by the end of this fiscal year.  
   Arizona is slated to gain a total of 643 new positions, which will raise the number of agents in Tucson from 2,339 to 2,779 and in Yuma from 554 to 804. 
   "For years we've been trying to get the federal government to understand the size and scope of our border problem in Arizona and commit the necessary resources to deal with it," Kyl said. "It's very gratifying to finally see all that effort begin to pay off, particularly in areas like Yuma, which have been slighted so often in the past." 
   Of the remaining new Border Patrol positions, Texas will receive 452, California 352 and New Mexico 253. Funding for the positions comes from both the FY 2006 DHS appropriations bill and the 2005 Iraq war supplemental appropriations bill.
