SEN. KYL APPLAUDS CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE CHERTOFF TO HEAD DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
  Sen. Jon Kyl today applauded the confirmation of Judge Michael Chertoff to head the Department of Homeland Security, and wished Chertoff well in "what is possibly the toughest job in Washington."  
   "It's reassuring to me that Secretary Chertoff has already demonstrated an awareness of one of the most important aspects of Homeland Security - tackling our nation's porous borders," Kyl said, noting that he and Chertoff discussed the border issue today. "There are lots of problems that need to be dealt with quickly, but few are quite as acute as the fact that every single day countless people enter the United States illegally and we really have no idea who many of them are or what they're up to."
