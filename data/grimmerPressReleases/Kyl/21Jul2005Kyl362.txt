SEN. KYL CO-SPONSORS AMENDMENT TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR ?UP-ARMORED' HUMVEES
  Sen. Jon Kyl cosponsored an amendment to the FY2006 Defense Authorization Bill that would increase funding for military vehicles, known as "up-armored Humvees," which have upgraded protection against explosive devices.  
 The amendment passed the Senate unanimously today. 
   "When the military commanders say they need more up-armored Humvees, we need to provide them," Kyl said. "Clearly, requirements on the battlefield can change quickly, and we need to respond just as quickly." Offered by Sen. John Warner (R-VA), the amendment authorized an additional $105 million for the Army and $340 million for the Marine Corps to meet new requests for up-armored Humvees in FY2006. Those requests were recently made by commanders in the field. The additional funds are on top of the $120 million for Army procurement and $89 million for Marine Corps procurement of up-armored Humvees already contained in the bill for next year. 
   "The folks we send into battle are absolutely incredible," Kyl said. "We owe it to them to provide the best possible training and equipment."
