SEN. KYL HAILS ENACTMENT OF CHILD PROTECTION ACT
  President George Bush today signed a sweeping piece of legislation to help protect children from abuse, neglect, and sexual predators. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), one of the principal sponsors of H.R. 4472, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, hailed the signing of the bill which was enacted into law today.  
   "A society is judged by how we treat the most vulnerable among us, and this new law will help protect children who suffer from abuse," said Kyl. "No child should ever have to face a life of abuse, and I am proud that today we've taken action to enact a law that will make a real difference in the lives of children." 
   "This law also sends a clear message to the predators that wish to prey on our children - no longer will you be able to hide from authorities. For too long, sexual predators and abusive parents have been able to hide from authorities simply by crossing state lines. I am hopeful this new law will provide authorities with the resources to bring these predators to justice." A bill authored by Kyl, the Childhelp National Registry Act, is included as a major provision of this new law. The measure specifically instructs the Health and Human Services Department to create a national registry of individuals who have been involved in substantiated cases of abuse or neglect of a child. The information will be compiled from state databases of child abuse or neglect, and will be made available to other states solely for the purpose of protecting children from abuse and neglect. 
   The law also includes significant portions of another bill authored by Kyl, the Internet SAFETY Act, which is intended to fight the rise of child pornography on the Internet, increase criminal penalties of those convicted of facilitating child pornographic transmission, and increase federal resources for prosecution and prevention of child sexual abuse.
