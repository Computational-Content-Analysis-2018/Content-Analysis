SEN. KYL CALLS FOR ?UP OR DOWN' VOTE ON JUDICIAL NOMINEES
  Sen. Jon Kyl today urged Democrats to abandon their historically unprecedented use of repeated filibusters of judicial nominees and allow up-or-down votes on President Bush's choices for the bench.  
   "All we seek is a return to 214 years of tradition in allowing presidential nominees the courtesy of an up-or-down vote," Kyl said, noting that Democrats first broke that tradition in 2003 when they began requiring sixty votes for approval of approximately one-third of President Bush's circuit court nominees. 
   "These men and women are great Americans who have devoted their lives to public service, universally regarded for their intelligence and integrity," Kyl said. "Calling them names like 'radical' and 'extreme' is a partisan affront not only to them personally but also to the voters who have supported them and organizations like the American Bar Association that have declared them well suited for the bench."
   Kyl is slated to deliver a floor statement Thursday reviewing the history of Senate procedure and tradition regarding presidential nominations and the use of the filibuster.
