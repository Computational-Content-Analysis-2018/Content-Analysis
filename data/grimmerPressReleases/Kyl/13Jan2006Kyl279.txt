SEN. KYL ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE ALITO
  Sen. Jon Kyl, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today announced that he will vote to confirm Samuel A. Alito as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  
   "The hearings this week showed the true character of Sam Alito," said Kyl. "The Committee heard from some of the people who know him best, and they were unreserved in their praise, not only of his considerable abilities, but of his character as a person. However, the most impressive witness was Judge Alito himself. He was forthright in his responses to questions, and demonstrated not only a tremendous command of the law, but a commitment to apply it impartially." 
   Kyl noted that Judge Alito has more judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years. As a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Alito has participated in the deciding of more than 4,500 cases and authored more than 360 opinions. 
   "Judge Alito deserves a fair, up-or-down vote by the Senate," said Kyl. "Certainly after this week, it's going to be difficult for opponents to come up with convincing arguments that he's not qualified to sit on the Supreme Court." 
   The Senate Judiciary Committee's vote on the nomination is scheduled for Tuesday.
