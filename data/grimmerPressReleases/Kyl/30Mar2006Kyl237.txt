SEN. KYL PRAISES PASSAGE OF LOBBYING REFORM LEGISLATION
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today praised Senate passage of S. 2349, the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act. 
   "I applaud the Senate for overwhelmingly passing lobbying reform legislation yesterday in a bipartisan vote," said Kyl. "While this legislation takes important first steps in limiting the influence of lobbyists, I agree with Senator McCain that we must remain committed to passing legislation that would bring greater transparency to the practice of 'earmarking' legislation. Earmark reform remains the best way to limit the influence of special interests and the invitation of corruption, and I will continue to work to pass a bill that will require public scrutiny of these pork-barrel projects so that legislators will be accountable to the taxpayers."
   The bill bans lobbyists from giving gifts and meals to lawmakers, and it would require lobbyists to file increased public reports about their activities in a searchable Internet database. It would also demand that lawmakers receive advance approval for trips paid with private money and would bar former lawmakers and senior aides from lobbying Congress for two years.
