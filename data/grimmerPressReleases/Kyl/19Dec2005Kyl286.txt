SEN. KYL ANNOUNCES NEW BORDER FUNDING IN DOD APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Jon Kyl today announced that the FY 2006 Appropriations bill for the Department of Defense (DOD) contains $1.14 billion in supplemental funding for investments in border security, including new vehicles, communications, aircraft and infrastructure construction.  
   "This money, supplementing the funding we added to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, marks another significant step in bringing the border under control," Kyl said. "It will pay for vital equipment and infrastructure that will have a multiplier effect on existing resources and manpower. It's also important to note that these legislative mechanisms reflect an increasing recognition that controlling the border is not just a law enforcement issue - it has serious defense and homeland security dimensions as well." 
   The FY 2006 DOD Appropriations Bill has already passed the House; Senate approval is expected shortly. President Bush has indicated he will sign the bill. Its provisions include $30 million for tactical infrastructure in the Tucson Sector, such as vehicle roads and barriers, as well as: 
   * $120 million for construction of new stations, checkpoints, and tactical infrastructure, including Tucson's $30 million and $20 million to continue construction of the San Diego Sector fence; 
   * $80 million for law enforcement communications procurement and radio/communications systems; 
   * $372 million for the CBP Air program's modernization of air fleet facilities, including hangars; 
   * $60 million to replace approximately 1,700 vehicles; 
   * $490 million to replace helicopters and recapitalize the air fleet; 
   * $17.9 million for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, to be used for a language arts facility to meet current and future border personnel Spanish and other language training requirements, and for needed information technology upgrades at the Center.
