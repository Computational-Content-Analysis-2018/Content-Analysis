SEN. KYL: SO-CALLED FAIRNESS DOCTRINE WOULD PUT GOVERNMENT IN CHARGE OF TALK RADIO
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today released the following statement on attempts to revive the so-called Fairness Doctrine:  
   "Some Democrats may not like talk radio, but that does not give them the right to use the heavy hand of government to regulate it. Americans have always fiercely believed in the fundamental importance of a free and independent press. As Thomas Jefferson once said, 'Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.' 
   "Unfortunately, some members of the Democratic Party appear to disagree with Jefferson and would prefer that government dictate what talk radio has to say. The Democrat proposal to reinstate the so-called Fairness Doctrine would seriously impinge on the freedom of Americans by putting government, not listeners and media outlets, in charge of determining what should appear on the airwaves. The Fairness Doctrine should not be resurrected and ought to be dead on arrival." 
   Democrat leaders in the House and Senate have expressed support for reinstating the Fairness Doctrine, which was last used during the 1980s.
