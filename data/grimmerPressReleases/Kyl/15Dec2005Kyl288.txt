SEN. KYL CITES EPA 'FLEXIBILITY' ON AZ WATER
  Sen. Jon Kyl today expressed cautious optimism after a meeting with Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Administrator Stephen Johnson on federal assistance for rural western water providers to meet new standards under the Clean Water Act.  
   The meeting focused on a new rule that lowers the limit for arsenic in drinking water from 50 to 10 parts per billion (ppb). The rule has vexed many Western water providers because arsenic occurs naturally in the ground, generally at higher levels than the rest of the United States. Residents there have been drinking local water for generations with no known health effects. Meanwhile, the infrastructure costs required to meet the 10 ppb standard have proven drastically higher than EPA estimates, and would result in monthly utility bill increases of up to 500 percent in some communities. 
   Arizona ranks second in the country in the number of systems affected by the new standard, which takes effect on January 23, 2006. Beyond securing federal assistance, Kyl and other western senators reached an agreement with Johnson that water providers working jointly and in good faith with the EPA will not be fined for missing the January 23 deadline. 
   "Stephen Johnson understands that one-size-fits-all approaches to implementation of the new standard don't work, and that we need a framework to protect public health while at the same time giving these communities the flexibility they need to comply," Kyl said.
