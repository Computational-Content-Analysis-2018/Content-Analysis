SEN. KYL ANNOUNCES AZ FUNDING IN ENERGY & WATER APPROPRIATIONS Bill
  Sen. Jon Kyl today announced that Arizona received funding in the final conference report on the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for a number of key projects.  
   "There are many aspects to protecting Arizona's often fragile environment," Kyl said. "This bill is full of good news, from Yuma to Flagstaff, for our efforts to restore riparian habitat, improve flood control and increase public recreation opportunities." 
   The bill includes the following Kyl-requested provisions, among others: 
   * $3 million for wash and tributary flood control in Nogales, to prevent flood damage and promote recreation to accommodate population growth; 
   * $718,000 to restore the riparian habitat of the Colorado River in Yuma's East Wetlands; 
   * $3.5 million for Rio de Flag flood control, in response to concerns that a large flood could displace nearly half of Flagstaff's more than 60,000 residents, threatening Northern Arizona University and parts of the city's historic downtown; 
   * $8 million for a longtime riparian habitat and nature trail program in the Phoenix and Tempe reaches of Rio Salado, which has brought back significant avian wildlife; 
   * $10 million for the Tucson Drainage Area; 
   * $4.5 million for a riparian habitat program at the Tres Rios project using treated wastewater; 
   * $400,000 for the Va Shly'Ay Akimel project restoring Salt River riparian habitat; 
   * $450,000 to monitor downstream riparian habitat from the Alamo Dam; and 
   * $359,000 for studies to improve water use efficiency in west-central Arizona;
   "This money represents an important investment in Arizona's future," Kyl said. "Life in the desert is all about water, and these projects demonstrate our commitment to sound management of this precious resource."
