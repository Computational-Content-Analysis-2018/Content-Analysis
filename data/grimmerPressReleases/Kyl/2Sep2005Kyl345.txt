SEN. KYL CRITICIZES DISASTER RELIEF PLANNING; VOWS TO HOLD HEARING ON PREPAREDNESS
  Sen. Jon Kyl today joined President Bush in criticizing the inadequate federal and state governments' level of preparedness for the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and the floods that followed.  
   "This damage could just as easily have been caused by a terrorist attack, and many if not most of the same elements are involved in responding to natural disasters," Kyl said. "There has to be a plan in place - along with adequate resources - to be able to evacuate people, or at least provide relief supplies before panic sets in. The vulnerabilities of various physical infrastructures must be assessed, and contingency plans prepared to keep critical systems operational, or restore them quickly. None of this appears to have been done in Louisiana." 
   Kyl, who chairs the Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he intends to hold hearings on the matter once the crisis has stabilized. "We need to understand from the key authorities what went wrong, what should have been done, and most importantly, what needs to be done so we're ready next time. We know there will be more natural disasters, and it's almost as certain that there will be additional attempts by terrorists to attack major American cities and do as much damage as possible. If we can learn from this experience, there will be at least one positive result of the disaster of Hurricane Katrina." 
   President Bush today acknowledged that the results of federal relief efforts "are not acceptable."
