SEN. KYL APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF YUMA IMPROVEMENT ACT
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) applauded today's unanimous approval by the House of Representatives of S. 1529, The City of Yuma Improvement Act. The bill, which was introduced by Kyl, authorizes the conveyance of seven orphan parcels of federal land that are currently held by the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to the City of Yuma to complete the Riverfront Master Redevelopment Plan. The Senate unanimously passed the bill late Thursday.  
   "The redevelopment of the riverfront in downtown Yuma is an important step in the city's future," said Kyl. "And today's final passage clears the way for the city's plan to move ahead sooner rather than later." Under the bill, six parcels of federal land held by the Bureau of Reclamation would be exchanged for two railroad parcels owned by the city on which a Bureau of Reclamation rail line exists. It would also authorize the direct sale of one parcel of land held by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to the city for fair market value. 
   The conveyances will enable the city to complete the riverfront redevelopment project, which is designed to connect the city's Main Street with the Heritage Area and the Colorado River to enhance both the quality of life for Yuma's residents, as well as one of its primary economic assets - tourism. 
   Agreement exists among all parties to exchange and sell the land, but until now, the two federal agencies lacked the authority to complete the deal, since congressional authorization was required. Kyl's bill provides that authorization. 
   The bill was co-sponsored by Senator John McCain (R-AZ). It will now be sent to President Bush for his signature.
