SEN. KYL JOINS SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN RELEASING TOP 10 PRIORITIES FOR 109TH
  Sen. Jon Kyl and other Senate GOP leaders released on Monday a Top Ten list of legislative priorities on domestic and foreign policy. Kyl is the primary sponsor of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act (S. 7), which would make permanent several major tax cuts passed into law during the first Bush Administration but due to expire in coming years. "It's critical to remove the uncertainty about these tax cuts quickly, because families, companies and financial markets all need to be able to plan with confidence," Kyl said. "It's also critical because if we don't get this done, the American people will be hit with an average tax increase of $1,184 per household, which is not going to go over well."  
   The expiring provisions that Kyl's bill would make permanent include: 
   * Individual Income Tax Rates. By far, the largest beneficiaries of lower individual tax rates are the nation's 23 million small businesses, the majority of which pay taxes at the individual level. Since most entrepreneurs reinvest their earnings back into their businesses, lower tax rates translate into more capital for small businesses to grow and provide valuable jobs. 
   * Dividends and Capital Gains. The reduced tax rate on dividends and capital gains has played a significant role in helping the economy recover from the 2001 recession, by lowering the cost of capital for American businesses, enabling them to invest in new equipment and create more jobs. 
   * The Death Tax: This burden, which falls on families least in a position to deal with it (after the death of a loved one), discourages hard work, entrepreneurship, and savings, while rewarding consumption. Without a permanent repeal, these families will once again be faced with confiscatory tax rates and tremendous planning costs, especially those owning a small business.
   Other priorities outlined by the Republican Senate leadership included Social Security, broader tax reform, terrorism, health care, class action legal reform, family and community protections, and education, among others.
