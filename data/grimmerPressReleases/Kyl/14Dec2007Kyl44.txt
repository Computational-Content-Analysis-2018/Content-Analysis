SENATE CONFIRMS DIANE HUMETEWA AS U.S. ATTORNEY FOR ARIZONA
  U.S. Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today hailed the confirmation of Diane J. Humetewa to the role of U.S. Attorney for Arizona. She will be the first Native American woman to serve in this role. She was confirmed late Thursday by the Senate.  
   "Diane Humetewa will be an excellent U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona. Her sound legal experience and expertise make her well suited to oversee the legal issues in the region," said Senator McCain. "She is an exceptional public servant, and I am pleased that she has been confirmed to serve the state of Arizona and our country." 
   Humetewa began her legal career in 1987 as a victim advocate for the U.S. Attorney's Office serving U.S. Attorney Stephen M. McNamee. After graduating from Arizona State University's College of Law in 1993, she served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and has served no less than six U.S. Attorneys. She left the U.S. Attorney's office for a short time in 2005 to work for Senator John McCain as a counsel to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, but returned earlier this year to the U.S. Attorney's Office as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. 
   "I congratulate Diane Humetewa on her confirmation today as the new U.S. Attorney for Arizona," said Senator Kyl. "Her background as a prosecutor, crime-victims advocate, and years of public service made her an outstanding nominee and will serve her well in this important position."
