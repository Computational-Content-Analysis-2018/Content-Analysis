SEN. KYL'S AMENDMENT ADDS FUNDING TO REIMBURSE STATES FOR INCARCERATING CRIMINAL ALIENS
  Sen. Jon Kyl, joined by Sens. John Sununu (R-NH) and Tom Coburn (R-OK), today introduced an amendment to the Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill that would add $40 million to the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), which reimburses states for costs related to incarceration of criminal aliens.  
   "Immigration policy and controlling our borders are, for the most part, federal responsibilities, and the federal government has not lived up to them," Kyl said. "The result is that state and local jails and prisons, particularly in states like Arizona, must bear the heavy cost of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens. They deserve more reimbursement than they are currently receiving." 
   The amendment also increases funding for: 
   * Methadone "Hot Spots" under the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), by $40 million; 
   * Justice Assistance Grants, by $21 million; 
   * Transitional housing for victims of domestic violence under the Violence Against Women Act, by $10 million; and 
   * The National Weather Service, for hurricane detection, by $3 million.
   The spending would be offset by eliminating the Advanced Technology Program, which subsidizes "high-risk" industrial research and development.
