SEN. KYL INTRODUCES BILL TO HELP DOWNTOWN YUMA IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
  Sen. Jon Kyl today introduced legislation to authorize the conveyance to the city of Yuma of six small parcels of federal land currently held by the Bureau of Reclamation, in exchange for two railroad parcels owned by the city on which a Bureau of Reclamation rail line exists.  
   "These land conveyances will enable the city to complete a redevelopment of the riverfront in downtown Yuma that has been in the works since 2001, to include a welcome center, a new hotel, a conference center, and mixed-use retail stores," Kyl said in a floor statement. "The project is designed to connect the city's Main Street with the Heritage Area and the Colorado River to enhance both the quality of life in Yuma as well as one of its primary economic assets - tourism." 
   "Essentially, the deal is complete - with one exception," Kyl said, "the authority to accomplish the conveyances. Currently, the Bureau of Reclamation does not have the authority to exchange the lands it possesses for the railroad parcels it seeks - this must be done legislatively. There is broad support in Yuma for this legislated land swap, given its public purpose objectives, thorough planning, and the economic opportunity it brings. I hope my colleagues agree and will work with me to pass this legislation this year." 
   Sen. John McCain co-sponsored the City of Yuma Improvement Act of 2005. Companion legislation has been introduced in the House by Reps. Raul Grijalva and Trent Franks.
