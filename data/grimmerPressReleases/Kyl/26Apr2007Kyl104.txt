SEN. KYL WILL OPPOSE EFFORTS TO REMOVE RESTRICTIONS ON ILLEGAL INTERNET GAMBLING
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today issued the following statement regarding legislation expected to be introduced by Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) that would remove restrictions on illegal Internet gambling:  
   "I was privileged last year to join with my colleagues in passing legislation that provides federal and state authorities with the power to enforce existing laws prohibiting Internet gambling. For far too long, illegal gambling outlets have circumvented our laws by moving their operations overseas and capitalizing on the anonymity, reach, and unregulated environment the Internet offers. 
   "The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act was signed into law on October 13, 2006, to enhance law enforcement tools for curtailing online gambling activities that violate federal and state gambling laws. Principally, the new law requires financial systems to block fund transfers associated with illegal Internet gambling, which is the most effective way to halt the illegal activities of offshore websites beyond the reach of traditional law enforcement. 
   "I will strongly oppose any efforts to ease or remove the mechanisms that our state and federal authorities have long sought to help enforce existing laws prohibiting online gaming."
