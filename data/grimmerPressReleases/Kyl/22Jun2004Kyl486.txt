SEN. KYL APPLAUDS DEFEAT OF AMENDMENT AIMED AT SLASHING MISSILE DEFENSE FUNDING
  Sen. Jon Kyl today praised the Senate's vote to defeat an amendment that would have reduced funding for ground-based midcourse interceptors for missile defense by $515.5 million and used the money for a patchwork of other federal spending.  
   "Like its two predecessors last week, this amendment amounted to another Catch-22," Kyl said. "Those who want to kill missile defense altogether have now made three attempts to write into law the notion that 'You can't deploy until you can operationally test it; but of course, you can't test it until you deploy it'." 
   Missile technology is improving so rapidly, Kyl said, that "It is never possible to wait until we know exactly what the enemy is going to throw at us and then begin work on a system to defeat it. You have to be working right alongside what the enemy is doing and developing your program as you go along, adding the technology as it develops. You cannot wait until you can develop the perfect system and then begin building it and deploying it. By the time you did that, you would already be way behind the progress your potential enemy is making.
   "We know that there are countries that have the capability to launch ballistic missiles at the United States today," Kyl said. "What we don't know is how safe and reliable those systems are, or how vulnerable they are to being accidentally launched - not to mention the potential for a terrorist group to take control and fire them on purpose. If there were such an incident, we would certainly want to have the capability to defend against it."
