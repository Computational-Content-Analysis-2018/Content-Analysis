SEN. KYL URGES QUICK PASSAGE OF YUMA IMPROVEMENT ACT
  Sen. Jon Kyl today urged members of the Subcommittee on Water and Power of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee to approve legislation that would facilitate the redevelopment of 22 acres along the city of Yuma's downtown riverfront by providing the framework for an exchange of lands between the city and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.  
   "These land conveyances will enable the city to complete a redevelopment of the riverfront in downtown Yuma that has been in the works since 2001, to include a welcome center, a new hotel, a conference center, and mixed-use retail stores," Kyl said. "The project is designed to connect the city's Main Street with the Heritage Area and the Colorado River to enhance both the quality of life in Yuma as well as one of its primary economic assets - tourism." 
   "Essentially, the deal is complete - with one exception," Kyl added, "the authority to accomplish the conveyances. Currently, the Bureau of Reclamation does not have the authority to exchange the lands it possesses for the railroad parcels it seeks - this must be done legislatively. There is broad support in Yuma for this legislated land swap, given its public purpose objectives, thorough planning, and the economic opportunity it brings." 
   Yuma Mayor Larry Nelson was scheduled to testify at today's subcommittee hearing, along with William Rinne, Deputy Commissioner of Reclamation. Sen. John McCain co-sponsored the City of Yuma Improvement Act of 2005 (S.1529). Companion legislation has been introduced in the House by Reps. Raul Grijalva and Trent Franks.
