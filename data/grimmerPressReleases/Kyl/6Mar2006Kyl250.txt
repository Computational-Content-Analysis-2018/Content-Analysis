SEN. KYL MEASURE ENSURES ARIZONA'S SHARE OF HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) introduced an amendment late last week that would distribute funds provided under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program in a way to ensure that Arizona receives its fair share of federal funding. The formula currently applied disproportionately skews the distribution of funds to cold-weather states, particularly in New England. 
   "If the Senate is going to add funds to this program, the funds should be distributed in a way that takes into account all of the factors affecting home energy costs," said Kyl. "Arizonans pay their tax dollars into this program just like everyone else, and we should be treated equitably under a federal program intended to assist low-income families with rising energy costs. My amendment goes a long way toward ensuring that every state in need receives its equitable share of the federal program."
   The current formula distributes in favor of health risks posed by extreme cold, and fails to adequately take into account the public health threat posed by extreme heat. The formula also is based on the 1980 census, and does not take into account the population shift to warm weather states like Florida and Arizona. The bill that Kyl's measure would amend, S.2320, would make $1 billion provided by the Deficit Reduction Act for fiscal year 2007, available this year instead.
   "The current formula and distribution method neglects the needs of hot-weather states, like Arizona, and their rising air-conditioning costs," said Kyl. "The Senate should recognize what Arizonans know all too well; extremely high temperatures can pose just as much of a risk to health as cold weather does."
   Consideration of Kyl's amendment continues on Tuesday.
