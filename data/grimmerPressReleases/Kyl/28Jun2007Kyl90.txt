SEN. KYL: BILL REPRESENTED BEST CHANCE TO REFORM IMMIGRATION LAWS
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today released the following statement regarding S. 1639, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. The Senate failed to adopt a procedural motion to conclude debate on the bill by a vote of 46 to 53.  
   "This immigration bill represented the best chance to pass legislation to help secure our borders and reform our immigration laws. I am disappointed that the Senate has rejected a motion to continue its consideration. 
   "The failure of this bill lies with people on both sides of the aisle. The result of our inaction regrettably means the status quo will continue, as thousands of illegal immigrants continue pouring across our borders every day and millions already here will continue receiving silent amnesty. 
   "While I am hopeful that consideration of a bill may come back up later in the year, I believe it will be very difficult given the impending legislative schedule. Regardless, I remain committed to finding ways to increase resources to help secure our borders and reform our immigration laws to restore the rule of law."
