A MAJOR WATER SETTLEMENT, 15 YEARS IN THE MAKING
  By Sen. Jon Kyl
   After hard, patient work by dozens of diverse groups, Congress last week gave final approval to legislation that would settle a long list of claims and disputes related to Indian tribal water rights, and allow the U.S. government and Arizona to settle repayments owed for construction of the Central Arizona Project (CAP).  
   The White House has signaled support for the bill, so President Bush's expected signature will complete the process of resolving amicably a complex problem that affects the very livelihoods of a significant portion of Arizona's population. It has been my great honor, along with Sen. John McCain, Rep. J.D. Hayworth and the bipartisan state delegation in the House of Representatives, to have helped lead this complicated and painstaking process, which began in earnest ten years ago, when then-Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt came to my office looking for help with what he described as a deadlocked situation. 
   The Arizona Water Settlements Act (S. 437) will bring long-sought certainty to cities and communities as they plan their growth and development, as well as provide a means for Indian tribes to bring into use water rights that, thus far, exist only on paper. It is a major component of a long-term water plan for Arizona. The bill also resolves a long-running disagreement between the state and the federal government over nearly $2 billion in repayments for construction of the Central Arizona Project. Its signatories include not only the Department of the Interior and the State of Arizona, but also the State of New Mexico, the Gila River Indian Community, the Tohono O'odham Nation, and approximately 35 organizations representing cities, counties, irrigation districts, utilities and mining companies from central, southern and eastern Arizona as well as western New Mexico. 
   The law is built around four titles: 
   * The first resolves the repayment issue for the CAP, and the allocation of the water it provides between state and federal interests, including the creation of a funding mechanism for current and future Indian water settlements. It also finalizes the reallocation of CAP water to a number of municipal, industrial and non-Indian agricultural users. 
   * The second covers significant claims by the Gila River Indian Community to water rights, ratifying agreements between the tribe and numerous other parties and communities. 
   * The third amends the 1982 Southern Arizona Water Rights Settlement Act, settling unresolved disputes between the Tohono O'odham Nation, the San Xavier District, the Schuk Toak District, the City of Tucson, the State of Arizona, Asarco, Farmers' Investment Company and two individual Indian allottees regarding the pumping of groundwater. 
   * The fourth protects the water rights claims of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, which remain in litigation but will hopefully be resolved within the next year.
   The bill includes $2.2 billion for the Lower Basin Development Fund to provide, over a 40-year period, benefits to parties of these and future settlements, with a particular focus on operation and maintenance charges for the delivery of CAP water to Indian tribes and related Indian expenses. 
   In plain English, this legislation demonstrates that even a vast array of diverse groups with divergent interests can resolve strong differences over scarce and critical resources, if they persevere and operate in good faith. I am grateful for the untiring efforts of all of those who worked on this settlement and legislation. Virtually every major water user and provider in central Arizona has devoted itself to the passage of this bill, and all are rightfully celebrating its passage. Looking ahead, this could ultimately be nearly as important to Arizona's future as was the authorization of the Central Arizona Project itself.
