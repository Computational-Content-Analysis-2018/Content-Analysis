SENATE APPROVES SEN. KYL AMENDMENT TO STOP SENATE PAY RAISE
  The U.S. Senate today overwhelmingly passed an amendment offered by Sen.  
 Jon Kyl that would eliminate members' 1.9 percent projected cost-of-living pay increase for FY 2006. "At a time when we're asking for spending cuts across the federal government to help offset the cost of Hurricane Katrina, it's important for the Senate to lead by example, even if the impact is mostly symbolic," Kyl said. 
   Kyl's amendment, offered to the Transportation, Treasury, HUD, Judiciary and District of Columbia Appropriations Act (H.R. 3058), would save the federal treasury approximately $2 million. Congress hopes to find at least $50 billion in savings to offset Katrina-related spending.
