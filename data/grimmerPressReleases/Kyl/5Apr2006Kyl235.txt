SEN. KYL CONDEMNS SENATE MINORITY'S OBSTRUCTION OF CRIMINAL ALIEN BAN
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today condemned the Senate Minority's obstruction to allow a vote on an amendment to the immigration bill before the Senate, that would bar criminal aliens from participating in a temporary worker program. 
   "Not allowing criminals the privilege of legally working and residing in our country is common sense," said Kyl. "Yet the Senate Minority not only objects to this amendment, but they will not even permit a vote to determine the will of the Senate on this issue."
   The Kyl amendment would bar applicants who are convicted of a felony or three misdemeanors from legally working or permanently residing in the United States, just as they were excluded from the 1986 grant of amnesty. Specifically, the amendment would exclude applicants who did not comply with a court-ordered deportation, or convicted of crimes such as involuntary manslaughter, assault and battery, burglary, and alien smuggling.
   "The Senate by its core, functions in a way that permits the opportunity for all Senators to express their ideas and suggestions in a deliberative environment," said Kyl. "Every member of this body is permitted to object and oppose any amendments, including the one I've introduced here; but it should be done so in a way that isn't counterproductive to the progress of the Senate, and this critically important bill."
   The Senate Minority today continues their blockade of a vote on this amendment.
