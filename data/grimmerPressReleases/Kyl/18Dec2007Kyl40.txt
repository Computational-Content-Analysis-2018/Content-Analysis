SENATE EXTENDS CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE, AVERTS MEDICARE PHYSICIAN PAYMENT CUTS
  The U.S. Senate today approved legislation that will avert a scheduled 10 percent payment reduction to doctors who provide Medicare services and temporarily extend funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).  
   The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 provides a half-percent physician payment increase from January 1, 2008 through June 30, 2008. 
   "Medicare currently relies on an antiquated payment system that does not appropriately reflect the cost of providing care to our nation's seniors," said U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.). "This legislation prevents a scheduled cut in physician payments, helping ensure Medicare beneficiaries' access to quality health care. While I am disappointed Congress was only able to pass a six-month 'fix,' I will work with my colleagues next year to extend the payment increase and ensure beneficiary access to care." 
   The legislation also extends SCHIP funding for 18 months to help states maintain their programs. 
   "SCHIP was originally designed to help states provide health coverage to children from low-income working families," said Kyl. "But recent attempts to reauthorize the program - all of which failed - would have expanded the program beyond its original intent, covering children from higher income families and even adults. The bill adopted today will preserve SCHIP coverage for over six million children, while Congress continues to work on a responsible SCHIP reauthorization." 
   The legislation now awaits final approval by the U.S. House of Representatives.
