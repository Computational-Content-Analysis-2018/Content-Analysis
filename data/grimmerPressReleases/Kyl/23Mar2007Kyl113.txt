SENATE REJECTS MEASURE PREVENTING TAXATION AFTER DEATH
  By a largely party line vote, the U.S. Senate today defeated a measure introduced by Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) that would provide for permanent reduction of the death tax.  
   The Kyl amendment would have provided budget authority to protect families, family farms, and small businesses by raising the death tax exemption to $5 million and reducing the maximum death tax rate to no more than 35 percent. Following the 2001 and 2003 tax relief initiatives, the death tax rate is 45 percent this year through 2009. It returns to its original levels in 2011 with the rate skyrocketing to as high as 60 percent and the exemption falling to $1 million. 
   "In an age where home prices have soared and more workers are enrolled in 401K and other retirement plans, many estates will subject to the death tax," said Kyl. "Unfortunately, half of the assets people may have wished to pass on to their children and grandchildren will be subject to government confiscation." 
   The Kyl amendment would have also extended a tax provision that allows teachers to deduct the costs of classroom materials paid for out of their own pockets. 
   "As the son and brother of public school teachers, I am very aware of the sacrifices teachers must make," said Kyl. "When I first came to the Senate, I proposed that teachers who spend their own money on classroom supplies receive a credit on their taxes for these expenses. I had hoped the Senate would have extended this much-needed tax provision for our school teachers." 
   The amendment was not agreed to 48 to 51.
