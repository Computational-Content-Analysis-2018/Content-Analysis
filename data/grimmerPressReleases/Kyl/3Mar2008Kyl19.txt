SEN. KYL ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.N. SANCTIONS ON IRAN
  The United Nations today approved new economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is the third Security Council resolution sanctioning Iran and calling on its regime to halt its illegal uranium enrichment program. This is one of the programs that could be used by the regime to produce the nuclear material needed for a weapon and has not been halted, according to the December 2007 National Intelligence Estimate. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) issued the following statement:  
   "The U.N.'s action today is a positive step toward stopping the dangerous activity by Iran. With this action, the U.S. government should take the opportunity to immediately sanction those banks that continue to support Iran's terrorism and weapons of mass destruction programs. And the Senate should act immediately and pass S. 970, the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act, which has 70 bipartisan cosponsors and provides the U.S. government with additional authorities to go after Iran and other nations who assist Iran with developing a nuclear program."
