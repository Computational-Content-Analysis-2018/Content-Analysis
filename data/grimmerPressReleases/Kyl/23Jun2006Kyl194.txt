SEN. KYL ANNOUNCES THREE NEW VETERANS CLINICS FOR ARIZONA
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, today announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has approved three new VA Community-based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) for Arizona. The new CBOCs, which will be located in Globe-Miami, Northwest Tucson, and Southwest Tucson, will benefit approximately 7,600 veterans.  
   "Congress has invested unprecedented resources to expand health care for veterans and directed the VA to ensure that necessary services can be provided to veterans in their communities," said Kyl. "This announcement is a result of that effort, and I am pleased that the work my colleagues and I have done has made it possible." 
   The new CBOCs are funded through the 2006 VA appropriations bill that Kyl supported.
