SENATE REAUTHORIZES BREAST CANCER STAMP
  Sen. Jon Kyl today announced the Senate approval, by unanimous consent, of the reauthorization of the breast cancer research stamp for two years.  
 Funding for the stamp had been set to expire at the end of this year. 
   "The Breast Cancer Research Stamp has been a resounding success, helping to save many lives," Kyl said, who cosponsored the bill. "The stamp has raised $45 million for breast cancer research, and is now cleared to raise millions more to help find a cure. That's more than money; it's a message of hope that someday we will find a cure."
