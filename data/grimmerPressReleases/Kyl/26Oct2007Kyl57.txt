SENATE CONFIRMS ARIZONA NATIVE ROBERT FANNIN AS U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
  The U.S. Senate today confirmed Arizona native Robert Fannin to become U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic. U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) released the following statement:  
   "Bob Fannin has demonstrated great patience, given the fact he was first nominated back in January. In that time, the United States has been without an ambassador to the Dominican Republic. It's a good thing he's finally been confirmed, so that he can get down there to represent our country. I congratulate Bob on his new post and know that he will do an outstanding job."
