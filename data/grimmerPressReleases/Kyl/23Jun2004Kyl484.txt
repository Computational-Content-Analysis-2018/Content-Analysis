SEN. KYL PRAISES NEW FOREST SERVICE FUNDING TO REDUCE FIRE THREAT, RESTORE FOREST HEALTH
  Sen. Jon Kyl today applauded the announcement by the U.S. Forest Service of plans to provide an additional $850,000 in grants to support Arizona county partnerships aimed at reducing wild fire threats and helping restore forest health in 5 million acres of federal land. 
   "These resources are desperately needed," Kyl said. "We're in the middle of what some call the worst drought in 500 years." The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest will receive $750,000 to thin more than 1,500 acres, as well as $100,000 in matching grant money to promote economic development through biomass utilization.
   Kyl also announced that the Department of Homeland Security plans to release its next round of FY2004 "Assistance to Firefighters Grants" on Friday. The Oracle Volunteer Fire District will receive $59,516.00, and the Clay Springs - Pinedale Fire District $189,783, for Operations and Firefighter Safety. This money can be used not only for fire emergencies but also for preparation and actual response to biological, nuclear, and radiological disasters.
