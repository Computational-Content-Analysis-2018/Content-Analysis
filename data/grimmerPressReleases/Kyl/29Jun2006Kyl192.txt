SENS. GRAHAM, KYL ISSUE STATEMENT ON HAMDAN RULING
  Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today issued the following statement on the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the Hamdan case:  
   "We are disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision. However, we believe the problems cited by the Court can and should be fixed. 
   "It is inappropriate to try terrorists in civilian courts. It threatens our national security and places the safety of jurors in danger. For those reasons and others, we believe terrorists should be tried before military commissions. 
   "In his opinion, Justice Breyer set forth the path to a solution of this problem. He wrote, 'Nothing prevents the president from returning to Congress to seek the authority he believes necessary.' 
   "We intend to pursue legislation in the Senate granting the Executive Branch the authority to ensure that terrorists can be tried by competent military commissions. Working together, Congress and the administration can draft a fair, suitable, and constitutionally permissible tribunal statute."
