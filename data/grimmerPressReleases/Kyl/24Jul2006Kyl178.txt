SENS. KYL, CORNYN URGE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT FOR EMERGENCY BORDER SECURITY FUNDING
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security Subcommittee, and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship Subcommittee today requested the President's support for an immigration and border security supplemental in order to fully fund enforcement priorities that Congress has authorized. 
   At a press conference on Capitol Hill today to announce this effort, Sen. Kyl said, "I continue to believe that Congress must address immigration reform in a comprehensive manner that starts with securing the border. There is much that Congress can do immediately to address our border security needs. That is why we are making this request to the President today. Emergency funding for border security will send a clear message that the government is seriously committed to the enforcement of its border."  
   Sen. Cornyn, said, "While I am still very much committed to a comprehensive immigration reform bill, I believe that for the legislative process to move forward, the White House and the Congress must restore public confidence in the government's ability - and will - to enforce the immigration laws. It is for this reason that we have sought the President's support for a supplemental in our letter today, and we are hopeful that it will re-energize discussions between all parties in our effort to reach a compromise on this very important issue." 
   AMONG THE AREAS THAT KYL AND CORNYN SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ARE: 
   * 500 Border Patrol Agents: $135 million 
   * 1,300 Detention Beds: $45.5 million 
   * Employee Verification System: $400 million 
   * Fencing and Vehicle Barriers: $1.829 billion 
   * USVISIT Entry-Exit: $193 million 
   * 800 Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agents: $100 million 
   * New Capital Equipment: $973 million 
   TOTAL: $3.676 BILLION
   Here is a copy of the letter's text: 
   July 24, 2006 
   Dear Mr. President: 
   We strongly support your commitment to gain control of the borders and to comprehensively reform our immigration laws. While the House and Senate both have passed immigration reform bills, there has been little progress in finding middle ground between the chambers. 
   We have encountered deep-rooted skepticism regarding the federal government's commitment to enforcing the immigration laws - and this public skepticism is warranted. In 1986, Congress promised Americans that there would be a "one-time" amnesty, pledging that increased enforcement would prevent another build-up of millions of illegal immigrants. The government delivered the amnesty, but not the enforcement. 
   We believe little progress will be made on legislation until Congress and the Administration restore public confidence in the government's ability - and will - to enforce the immigration laws. It is not surprising that almost all Members agree that the government must secure the border and stem the tide of illegal immigration. To build on that consensus, we believe that fully funding border security and immigration enforcement programs will demonstrate our commitment to end illegal immigration. Your support would assuage the concerns of those who believe that recent Administration efforts to improve border security will fall by the wayside once a bill is passed. 
   We therefore respectfully call on you to present an immigration and border security emergency spending measure that would fully fund enforcement priorities that Congress has authorized. The recent Department of Homeland Security appropriations request represents a good - but not complete - effort. We have compared current and proposed funding levels with prior authorizations and have identified some shortfalls in key areas that clearly need to be funded. We believe that, should you present such a request, it would be well received in both Houses of Congress and would facilitate discussions and movement toward a compromise. 
   We stand ready to work with you to advance this important goal.
