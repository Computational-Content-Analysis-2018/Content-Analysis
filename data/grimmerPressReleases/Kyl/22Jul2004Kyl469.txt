SEN. KYL CALLS ON CONGRESS TO MOVE QUICKLY ON 9-11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS
  Sen. Jon Kyl today thanked the members of the 9/11 Commission for providing a "great contribution to improving national security" and urged Congress to move quickly on consideration of the recommendations in the panel's report. 
   "Part of the value of this report is that it will finally galvanize us to move forward on a variety of fronts," Kyl said. "We can't put off action until next year. We may not all agree with every recommendation, but the commission has provided a solid and thoughtful starting point for reforming not only our national intelligence apparatus, but also the way Congress oversees it."
   Kyl noted the inevitable tension between the quantitative desire for the improved efficiency that comes with consolidation and centralization of operations and the qualitative value of innovative thinking that comes from the "creative chaos" of diverse approaches and competing ideas. The military faced a similar conundrum in the 1980s, he said, and managed to achieve a "jointness" of operations that has dramatically increased its effectiveness without smothering the individual strengths of each branch of service. "The intelligence community hasn't done that," Kyl said. "It needs to."
   At the same time, Kyl acknowledged, "A big part of this is up to Congress, because if we don't do a better job of coordinating and streamlining oversight, no one else will."
