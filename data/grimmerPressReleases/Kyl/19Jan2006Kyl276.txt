SEN. KYL COMMENTS ON NEW BIN LADEN TAPE
  U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security, made the following comments today after the release of a new tape by Osama bin Laden threatening attacks against the United States.  
   "The tape reminds us that terrorism remains a great threat to all Americans and Al Qaeda still poses an imminent danger to the United States. 
   "This threat to our very existence must inform how we look at the balance between privacy and national security, especially with respect to the Patriot Act and the NSA surveillance program. We cannot bind our hands in this fight. If we do, and terrorists launch more attacks against us, opponents of security tools such as the Patriot Act and NSA surveillance will have to answer for their opposition. 
   "The new bin Laden tape is also revealing about how Al Qaeda seeks to defeat America in the global war against terrorism. Specifically, bin Laden cites the will of the American people as our weakest spot, and suggests that the majority of Americans want to withdraw immediately from Iraq. 
   "It's clear that our enemies are listening. So it remains an important duty for those who serve in public office to clearly consider what signals are sent by calls for troop withdrawals or rigid withdrawal timetables."
