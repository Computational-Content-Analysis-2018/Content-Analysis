SEN. KYL SALUTES ARIZONA JOB GROWTH
 Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, today issued the following statement after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 9,200 new jobs were created in Arizona during the month of April:  
   "With 1.1 million new jobs generated nationwide in the last year, I'm confident that we are seeing a strong economic recovery in America. And these new numbers are a clear signal that the economy in Arizona is expanding too, beyond the experts' highest expectations. 
   "Despite this good news, we can't take our foot off the accelerator. I will vigorously fight any effort to repeal President Bush's tax cuts or wastefully spend the taxpayer's money."
