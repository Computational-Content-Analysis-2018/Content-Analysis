OFFICIALS TESTIFY: ILLEGAL ALIENS, GUEST WORKERS MUST NOT BYPASS CITIZENSHIP LINE
  Sen. Kyl applauded testimony by Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff today that neither illegal residency in the United States, nor participation in any future guest worker program, should provide a pathway to citizenship - applicants should return to their home countries to apply for permanent residency in the United States.  
   "The most fundamental principle here is that the American people do not want to see anyone rewarded for breaking the law and entering the country illegally," Kyl said. "Those who are currently residing unlawfully in the United States should have to return home to apply for permanent residency, and get in line along with everyone else who is doing so legally." 
   Also, he said, a successful program must link the number of guest workers directly to the needs of the U.S. economy, as Secretary Chao acknowledged in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. "While most economists acknowledge that the dynamic U.S. economy often creates a need for foreign labor, this fluctuates with the business cycle," Kyl said. "It's critical that any guest worker program contain a mechanism to accommodate this ebb and flow so that American workers are not pushed out of jobs during economic downturns. Allowing illegal immigrants to reside permanently in the U.S. would not allow a downward adjustment of foreign labor to reflect lower employment needs." 
   Kyl is the principal cosponsor, along with Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), of comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would combine dramatically increased border and workplace enforcement of immigration law with a guest worker program that would allow foreign nationals to apply to work in the United States for temporary periods
