SEN. KYL ISSUES STATEMENT ON REID-PELOSI LETTER
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today made the following statement regarding a letter sent to the President from Democratic leaders criticizing changes in military strategy:  
   "After a long period of study and deliberation, undertaken partially at the urging of Congress, the President is preparing to launch a major new initiative in Iraq early next week. 
   "In less than 24 hours after opening the new Congress, with calls of working together in the sprit of bipartisanship and putting aside divisive rhetoric, it is disappointing, and more than a touch ironic, that the Democratic leadership has decided to start criticizing this new approach even before it is announced. 
   "In the spirit of national unity, we should at least hear what the President proposes before we criticize it; and once we hear him out, work together in giving his proposals an opportunity to work."
