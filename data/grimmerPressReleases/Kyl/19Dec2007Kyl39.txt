SEN. KYL ON AMT RELIEF: 'BETTER LATE THAN NEVER'
  The U.S. Congress today approved temporary relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) for 2007. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) issued the following statement:  
   "In previous years under Republican-led Congresses, temporary legislation to shield millions of middle-income families from the AMT was always passed by June of the tax year in question. It is unconscionable that this year Congress has waited until late-December. Senate Republicans have forced votes on five separate amendments to address the AMT throughout 2007 in an effort to persuade the Democrat-led Congress to act responsibly, but each amendment was defeated largely along party lines. 
   "By finally passing legislation in the eleventh hour, over 50 million American families will have delayed refunds because the Internal Revenue Service will need to update its systems. Many American families count on these refunds in the early part of the year. By ensuring that 19 million middle-class families will not have this tax liability, the temporary relief is better late than never. I will continue to seek a permanent solution to shield middle-class Americans from a tax that was never supposed to affect them." 
   The AMT was first enacted in 1969 to prevent a small number of very wealthy individuals from using legitimate deductions and credits to eliminate their tax liability. At the time of its enactment, the tax was only intended to capture 155 people. But because the AMT is not adjusted for inflation, it now ensnares roughly 4 million Americans, and would have captured an additional 19 million middle-class families this year if Congress did not act. Congress repealed the AMT permanently in 1999, but then-President Bill Clinton vetoed the bill. Since then, Congress has passed annual, temporary AMT-relief bills.
