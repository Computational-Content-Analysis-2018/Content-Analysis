SEN. KYL ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONWIDE IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) issued the following statement on Wednesday's nationwide worksite enforcement arrests: 
   "I welcome the commitment shown by the Department of Homeland Security to take seriously the responsibility of enforcing our existing immigration laws and I hope this type of enforcement continues.
   "Compliance at the workplace is a key part of any comprehensive solution to our illegal immigration problem. While Wednesday's events are a good step toward that solution, we must demonstrate a consistent commitment to enforcing existing immigration law before we create any new laws through immigration reform.
   "Working in this spirit, part of my comprehensive immigration reform proposal would complement existing law and strengthen worksite enforcement even further. I have proposed that a workplace verification system, along with a cleaned-up Social Security database, be included in any comprehensive immigration reform."
