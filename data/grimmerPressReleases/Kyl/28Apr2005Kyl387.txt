SEN. KYL PROBES USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT BORDER AT JOINT SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING
  Sen. Jon Kyl today co-chaired a joint subcommittee hearing on the use of technology to improve border security between points of entry into the United States.  
   "The Federal government cannot continue to overlook its distinct and singular duty to maintain law and order on the border, and must commit itself to fully funding the agencies that make up our immigration system so that those agencies can effectively perform the work that we call on them to do," Kyl said Thursday. "The use of technology holds the promise to significantly improve our capabilities." 
   Kyl also used his opening remarks to highlight the need for the Mexican government to take greater responsibility for controlling illegal immigration, noting that Grupo Beta and possibly other organizations succeeded in reducing border crossings to a trickle during the Minuteman project, proving their previously unused capabilities. 
   The hearing was held jointly by the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security, which Kyl chairs, and the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship, which is chaired by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX). It was part of a larger effort by Kyl and Cornyn to help educate the Congress, the Administration, and the public on the need to enforce immigration laws in order to protect the United States from terrorist and criminal threats, as well as to restore integrity to the rule of law. 
   Testifying at the hearing were David Aguilar, former Tucson sector head and now Chief of the Border Patrol, and Kirk Evans, Director of the Mission Support Office, both of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). They cited a long list of budgetary, environmental and statutory constraints that prevent them from gaining control over the border, particularly between Arizona and Mexico, including: 
   * Lack of funding to implement existing technologies, from cameras to radar installations. 
   * Federal ownership of the vast majority of the Arizona desert, and the accompanying myriad environmental restrictions. Aguilar cited as examples the fact that it takes more than two years to get a permit to install a single camera atop a pole in some areas, and restrictions against government vehicular pursuit of illegal aliens and smugglers in desert areas. He also noted that the horses the Border Patrol is allowed to use must be given a special feed so that their waste does not introduce non-indigenous seeds to the area. 
   * Statutory restrictions against establishing permanent checkpoints on roads leading north from the Arizona border (as Texas and other states have). 
   * The prohibition, on religious grounds, by the Tohono O'odham Indian tribe against using hilltops on their reservation for cameras, radar or observation posts (the hilltops are regularly used by smugglers and illegal aliens). 
   * Limited cooperation from the Mexican government, which refuses to address (among other issues) well-known "staging" areas - towns on the Mexican side of the border in which literally thousands of transitory residents are preparing to attempt to cross illegally into the United States.
   Kyl thanked the witnesses for providing valuable information and pledged to work to remove as many such restrictions as possible within Congressional authority, and continue his efforts to provide more funding for the technology and related needs of DHS.
