SEN. KYL GARNERS $3.4 MILLION FOR ARIZONA HIGH-TECH TRAINING PROGRAM
  Sen. Kyl was informed by Department of Labor Secretary Elaine Chao today that his request for a $3.4 million educational training grant in software quality engineering has been granted to Arizona.  
   "This grant is designed to help make sure enough Americans are prepared and available to fill the growing demand for high-paying software quality engineering jobs," Kyl said. "It would be a great shame if employers had no alternative but to look overseas for qualified workers." 
   The grant will fund a new three-course curriculum in software quality engineering (SQE) and testing, which has been identified as a skill in critical short supply. The result of a collaborative effort by the State of Arizona, IBM, Northland Pioneer College and Mesa Community College, it is projected to offer industry-recognized SQE Certification to more than 1500 students, as well as provide training to 900 incumbent workers.
