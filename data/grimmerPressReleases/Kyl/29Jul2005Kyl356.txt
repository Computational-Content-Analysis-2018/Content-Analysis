SEN. KYL VOTES AGAINST HIGHWAY BILL, CITING 'FISCAL IRRESPONSIBILITY, BAD DEAL FOR ARIZONA'
  Sen. Jon Kyl today criticized the $286 billion Highway Bill as "fiscally irresponsible, packed with thousands of pork-barrel earmarks, and worst of all, unfair to Arizona."  
   Arizona would receive just over 91 cents back for every dollar it sends to Washington in taxes under the bill's funding formula, continuing a long-term trend of inequitable transportation funding in comparison with other states. "We worked very hard to get a fairer formula, and made some progress, but that's still a bad deal, any way you look at it," Kyl said. 
   Noting that "For the most part, officials at the Arizona Department of Transportation are best able to set priorities for highway improvements," Kyl directed that his so-called "project" allocation be sent directly to the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), with the exception of a small project he worked on with Rep. Rick Renzi. The ADOT notified Kyl that it plans to use federal funding to complete the ongoing construction of the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge. 
   "The Hoover Dam is one of America's most famous landmarks - and a vital commercial corridor for the entire American West. Unfortunately this makes it a potential target for terrorist attack," Kyl said. Because of this risk, transportation officials have rerouted traffic away from the dam until the bypass is completed. These federal funds ensure that the state will be able to retire the bond debt it issued to finance the portion of the project's cost not covered by prior federal and state appropriations. ADOT estimates that the bypass will be open in 2008. Sen. John McCain also voted against the bill.
