SEN. KYL ISSUES STATEMENT ON PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
  U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today released the following statement regarding the Senate vote on the Peru Free Trade Agreement:  
   "I have never opposed a free trade agreement, although I have in the past had reservations or concerns about different elements of the agreements. 
   "I believe free trade encourages economic growth, improves living standards by making a wider variety of goods and services available at more affordable prices, and creates good-paying jobs. In fact, exports from the U.S. account for more than 10 percent of our annual gross domestic product and one in six manufacturing jobs are related to exported products. 
   "I decided to oppose the Peru Free Trade Agreement today not because I have any quarrel with Peru or because I am in any way opposed to expanding our bilateral trade relations with Peru. In fact, I strongly support the original Peru Free Trade Agreement. 
   "My opposition is rooted entirely in the agreement reached by the U.S. Trade Representative and members of the U.S. House of Representatives, which forces the United States to renegotiate the Peru, Panama, and Colombia Free Trade Agreements by adding new requirements for labor and environmental protections and weakened traditional trade agreement protections for certain U.S. intellectual property related to pharmaceutical products."
