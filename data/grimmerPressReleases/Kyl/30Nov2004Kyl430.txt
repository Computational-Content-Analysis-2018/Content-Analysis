SEN. KYL PRAISES BUSH WILLINGNESS TO TAKE IRAN TO SECURITY COUNCIL OVER NUCLEAR PROGRAM
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), today applauded the Bush Administration's announcement that it is willing to take Iran's program to develop nuclear weapons directly to the United Nations Security Council, in the wake of reported praise by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Iran HAS signed a "voluntary, non-legally binding confidence-building measure" to suspend work on uranium enrichment.  
   "The leadership of the IAEA has no apparent grasp of either history or the darker side of human nature," Kyl said. "To believe that Iran has genuinely abandoned its longstanding ambition to become a nuclear power requires an almost willful ignorance of its history or an utterly breathtaking level of naivete on the part of those entrusted to monitor nuclear proliferation." 
   According to Reuters, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Hassan Rohani told a news conference that "Despite the U.S. propaganda, Iran has not relinquished its right to the (nuclear) fuel cycle and it never will." 
   Noting that Iran has built its program in secret for more than 18 years, Kyl added, "Any agreement should be built around an overwhelming system of verification, because Tehran's promises are as predictably empty as Saddam Hussein's. Certainly Iran's insistence on preserving the capacity to reverse course and start weaponizing on a moment's notice is yet more evidence of their ultimate goal. And yet the IAEA would not even agree to automatically refer any new violations to the Security Council, but only to meet and discuss them. What could possibly be left to discuss?"
