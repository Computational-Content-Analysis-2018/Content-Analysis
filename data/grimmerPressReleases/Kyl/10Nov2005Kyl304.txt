SEN. KYL AMENDMENT ON HUMVEE UPGRADE PASSES SENATE
  The U.S. Senate today approved an amendment offered by Sen.  
 Jon Kyl expressing the "Sense of the Senate" that an Army request for gunnery systems that better protect U.S. troops in Humvee vehicles should be fully funded at $206 million. 
   "The Humvee is the workhorse of the war against terrorism overseas," Kyl said. "It's become clear that we must do everything within our power to make Humvees as safe as possible for the men and women who depend on them." 
   The retrofitted technology, known as Common Remotely-Operated Weapons Stations (CROWS), allows service members to fire machine guns from inside their vehicles, using a variety of external sensors. The handful of models currently in use have already proven effective in protecting soldiers by eliminating the need for an exposed gunner's seat. 
   Also sponsored by Sen. Ken Salazar (D-CO), the amendment urges Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to seek the full amount in his supplemental Iraq/Afghanistan appropriations request, expected to be submitted early next year. 
   EOS Technologies, based in Tucson, is a subcontractor on the program, providing its optical, laser and thermal systems as well as its electronic interface.
