SEN. KYL APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF RURAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE BILL
  Sen. Jon Kyl today announced that the Senate has approved legislation he co-sponsored to authorize the U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation to establish a program to plan, design and construct rural water supply projects to reliably deliver potable water to rural communities, water associations, and Indian tribes.  
   "Many rural communities lack the money or bonding capacity to pay for new water projects," Kyl said, noting estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that more than 1 million Americans lack running water and 2.4 million have critical unmet drinking water needs. "That's inexcusable in a nation of our wealth and resources." 
   Also sponsored by New Mexico senators Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman, the Reclamation Rural Water Supply Act of 2005 (S.895) authorizes $20 million a year for planning new water delivery infrastructure, and would establish a loan guarantee program within the Bureau of Reclamation to help communities finance new water projects and pay for maintenance on existing systems. By expediting the Bureau's appraisal and feasibility study process, the bill would also help communities identify the best approaches to meet their specific water supply needs. 
   The program, developed in coordination with the Bush Administration, is limited to towns with populations below 50,000 that meet various loan criteria.
