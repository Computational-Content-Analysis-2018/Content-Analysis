SEN. KYL ISSUES STATEMENT ON BRINS FIRE, FEDERAL PREPAREDNESS
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz) today issued the following statement on the efforts to combat the "Brins Fire" currently burning near Oak Creek Canyon.  
   "First, we should thank the ground crews for their hard work. They are doing a tremendous job. 
   "Earlier today, my staff spoke with Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment Mark Rey, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to see if there was anything more that could be done right now to help fight the Brins Fire. He advised us that virtually all of the federal fire aviation resources in the nation are currently committed to our state, and federal officials are working with the state to ensure that these resources are used effectively to contain and suppress the fires. 
   "While I am pleased to see this federal commitment of fire-suppression resources, it highlights the forest-health crisis in our state. Making a greater investment up front in fuel-reduction treatments would reduce catastrophic wildfire threats to our communities and the environment. We have seen it time and again already this season, starting in February. When forests are managed properly, there is less risk of catastrophic wildfires." 
   "I again call on the administration to work with me and our state to get the most effective, science-based treatments on the ground now. Arizona's forests and communities can't wait."
