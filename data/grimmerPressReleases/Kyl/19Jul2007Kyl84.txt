SEN. KYL CHAMPIONS ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF
  U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today introduced a measure during a Senate Finance Committee meeting to waive the fees and penalties for families who are unknowingly hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in 2007 if Congress does not provide relief. Kyl also filed a second measure that would have completely repealed the AMT.  
   The AMT was enacted in 1969 to prevent very wealthy individuals from using legitimate deductions and credits to eliminate their tax liability. But because the AMT is not adjusted for inflation, it today ensnares millions of middle-class families. 
   "At the beginning of this year, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that 15 million additional American taxpayers will unknowingly be captured by the AMT," said Kyl. "And if Congress fails to act this year, 80 percent of all middle-class families will be hit by this sneaky tax provision by 2010." 
   Congress passed legislation in 1999 that repealed the AMT, but then-President Bill Clinton vetoed the bill. 
   Kyl filed the measures as amendments to pending legislation in the Finance Committee, but the relief amendment was withdrawn.
