SEN. KYL, SENATE PASS EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING BILL
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today voted for passage of H.R. 4939, The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery. The bill, which passed the Senate 78 to 20, provides emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006. 
   "It was important that the Senate act today to move this important legislation forward, even though its current cost is not acceptable," said Kyl. "Much must be done in conference to bring its final cost in-line with the level requested by the President. If its cost is not reduced, I will vote to sustain a veto."
   The Senate-passed version stands at $109 billion. The President has stated that he will veto a supplemental bill that exceeds his $94.5 billion request.
   The bill includes vital funding to aid American efforts in Iraq, provide hurricane disaster relief, and critical border security enhancements. It includes $1.9 billion to strengthen the nation's border security infrastructure. There is also $30 million additional dollars for forest hazardous fuel reduction and bark beetle work - important as the Southwest enters fire season.
   Last month, Kyl, and 34 of his colleagues, signed a letter to the President expressing their support to uphold his veto if the final version of the bill exceeds the limit he established.
