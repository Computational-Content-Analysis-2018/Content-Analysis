SEN. KYL CONGRATULATES NOBEL LAUREATE
  Sen. Jon Kyl commented today on the decision of the Bank of Sweden to award the Nobel Prize in Economics to Edward C. Prescott of Arizona State University and Finn E. Kydland of Norway. Sen.  
 Kyl said, "I join all Arizonans in congratulating Professor Prescott from Arizona State on this tremendous honor." 
   "I think it is particularly significant that the Nobel Prize committee cited their work demonstrating that 'shocks on the supply side may have far-reaching effects,' and that 'the higher taxation of capital households expect in the future, the less they save,'" said Kyl. 
   Senator Kyl continued, "One of the biggest 'shocks on the supply side' is the current uncertainty in our tax policy. Various tax cuts are scheduled to expire in the coming years if Congress does not act. This uncertainty is particularly harmful because it raises the threat of higher taxes on investment and capital accumulation, which weakens the incentives for businesses to grow and expand and for individuals to save and invest. This is why we must make permanent both the reduced rates for dividends and capital gains and the elimination of the death tax." 
   Kyl criticized proposals to raise taxes on dividends, capital gains, and on estates as exactly the wrong action to take. "Higher taxes on capital accumulation and their detrimental effects on our economy are something that we simply cannot afford," said Kyl. 
   Senator Kyl is the lead sponsor of legislation to make permanent both the reduced tax rates on dividends and capital gains, as well as the repeal of the death tax.
