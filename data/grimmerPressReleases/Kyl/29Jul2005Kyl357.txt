SEN. KYL CRITICIZES ENERGY BILL AS BAD FOR ARIZONA GAS PRICES, AIR QUALITY
  Sen. Jon Kyl today voted against Senate passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, warning that it will result in higher gas prices for Arizonans, among other negative effects.  
   "This bill is full of provisions that will distort competitive markets for energy through subsidies, tax breaks, loan guarantees, special projects, mandates and outlandish amounts of federal spending that government watchdog groups have estimated will cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars," Kyl said. "Meanwhile, it's unlikely to have any positive short-term effect on energy prices. It certainly does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country." 
   A prime example, Kyl said, is the bill's mandate that Americans use 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol annually by 2012 (the current rate is 3.4 billion gallons). "The ethanol mandate may be great news for states that grow corn, but it means higher gasoline costs and dirtier air for the rest of us." 
   Kyl thanked Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-NM), however, for granting his request to include a provision in the bill exempting Arizona from having to use ethanol during the summer months, when its environmental impact would have been heaviest. "At least we were able to get a summer exemption that will reduce pollution when it would have been the worst," Kyl said.
