SEN. KYL WORKS TO IMPROVE EMPLOYER VERIFICATION SYSTEM
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today issued the following statement on the employer verification system that was added to S. 2611, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006. The Senate voted Tuesday evening to approve the amendment, offered by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-IA), 58 to 40. 
   "Although the provision is imperfect, I appreciate Senator Grassley's efforts - like me, he too understands that the core of any immigration reform requires an enforceable employer verification system. While the provision now included in the bill makes numerous advancements for an interior enforcement mechanism at the workplace, it still has its major flaws.
   "A truly verifiable system must go beyond the current documentary requirements to ensure that those eligible to work here are legally allowed to. What good is an employer verification system based on documents that can easily be counterfeited? In an age where identify theft and document fraud is becoming more common, an employer verification system must not solely rely on documents to confirm a person's identity.
   "I will continue to work in the Conference Committee with the House to improve the identification requirements and other important components of a workable and enforceable employer verification system."
   Kyl and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) are the authors of S. 1438, the Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act of 2005, which ensures an effective employer verification system by replacing reliance on conventional documents with a fraud-proof hardened Social Security card. Their bill is also the only Senate proposal with a temporary worker program that does not place illegal immigrants on an automatic pathway to citizenship.
