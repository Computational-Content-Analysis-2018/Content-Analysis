SEN. KYL PRAISES SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE SUPPORT FOR CAFTA
  Sen. Jon Kyl today spoke in strong support of the Central-American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) at a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee, which later cast a preliminary vote of support for the measure.  
   "This agreement is a win-win for both the U.S. and Central America," Kyl said. "The University of Michigan has estimated that the U.S. will gain about $17 billion and Central America about $5 billion, supporting development, improved standards of living and democracy." 
   Acknowledging that the U.S. trade deficit remains a concern, Kyl added, "The present trade deficit is largely the result of strong economic growth in the United States compared with the rest of the developed world. The U.S. has the economic strength to purchase more goods and services from the global market than our competitors. Restricting the flow of trade would only make things worse: in fact, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan recently commented that efforts to do so, and hinder free markets generally, represent a 'truly worrisome' threat to global economic growth and prosperity." 
   Because the Senate can only vote trade agreements up or down, the Finance Committee held a "mock" markup on CAFTA to provide advisory input to Bush Administration trade negotiators. Formal action by the full Senate on CAFTA is expected within a few weeks. The result is uncertain, however, as many groups, particularly the sugar industry, remain opposed.
