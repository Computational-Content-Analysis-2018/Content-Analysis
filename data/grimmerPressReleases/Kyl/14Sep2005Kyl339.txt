SEN. KYL APPLAUDS DHS EXPANSION OF ?EXPEDITED REMOVAL' ALONG SOUTHWEST BORDER
  Sen. Jon Kyl today praised the announcement that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to expand "expedited removal" authority from three to nine Border Patrol sectors, effectively implementing the policy along the entire southwest border.  
   Under the expedited removal process, apprehended "other-than-Mexican" (OTM) illegal aliens are returned quickly to their country of origin and no longer released into the United States to await court processing of their cases. 
   "Expedited removal has proven extremely effective in reducing the number of OTMs attempting to enter the United States illegally in the three areas where it has been implemented," said Kyl, who called for the program to be expanded in June after co-chairing a hearing at which DHS and Border Patrol officials testified that the Border Patrol had apprehended 98,000 OTMs in FY05, 175 percent more than during the comparable period in FY04, which was itself a record year. 
   Despite the fact that many of the 100-plus countries from which they came are known to host terrorist organizations, officials also testified at the hearing, approximately 70 percent of those OTMs were released on their own recognizance in sectors without expedited removal, for lack of a place to keep them. 
   "Given the frightening scenario of a potential terrorist being caught and then simply released into the U.S., expanding expedited removal is an obvious priority," Kyl said. Along with Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), he has sponsored a comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes 10,000 new beds over 5 years to help deal with the increase in detentions. 
   The three sectors where expedited removal is already in place are Tucson, AZ, McAllen, TX and Laredo, TX.
