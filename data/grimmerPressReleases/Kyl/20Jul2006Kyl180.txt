SEN. JON KYL NAMED 'TAXPAYER SUPER HERO'
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) has once again received the top rating in the U.S. Senate from the nation's most respected taxpayer watchdog organization for his voting record against wasteful government spending.  
   Kyl received a 100 percent score for 2005, the highest of all 100 senators, and the only senator named a "Taxpayer Super Hero" by the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW). Kyl's lifetime rating is 93 percent. 
   "I am grateful for the recognition by Citizens Against Government Waste of my efforts to ease the cumbersome tax and regulatory burden imposed by a bloated federal government," Kyl said. "It's noteworthy that the average score for Republican Senators was 68 percent against wasteful spending, while the average score for Democrats was just 18 percent. Arizona's Senate team is working together on the side of fiscal responsibility." 
   The CCAGW ratings were based upon 24 key votes in the Senate. 
   "Talk is cheap," CCAGW President Tom Schatz said. "Sen. Kyl puts the national interest ahead of special interests. Thanks to leaders like Sen. Kyl, taxpayers have a fighting chance and will continue to score victories." 
   Arizona's senior Senator John McCain (R-AZ) also scored well, with a 91 percent rating and a lifetime CCAGW average of 87 percent.
