SEN. KYL URGES EPA TO 'CLOSE GAP' ON SUMMER-BLEND GAS WAIVER
  Sen. Kyl today sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Steve Johnson urging that a waiver on the specific volatility requirement for "summer-blend" gasoline, which expires nationally on September 15, be extended to September 30 for Arizona, which uses the summer blend through the end of the month because of high temperatures.  
   This two-week gap, Kyl's letter notes, "makes it difficult for refiners to take advantage of the waiver." Prices in the state have risen above $3 a gallon, creating a serious hardship for many working families. "Anything we can do to ease supply restrictions would help put downward pressure on those prices," the letter adds.
