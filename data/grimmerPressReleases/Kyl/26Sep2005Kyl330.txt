SEN. KYL PRAISES VOTE BY SAN CARLOS WATER DISTRICT TO APPROVE GILA RIVER AGREEMENT
  Sen. Kyl today praised the members of the San Carlos Irrigation and Drainage District (SCIDD) for overwhelmingly approving key provisions and agreements reached under the Arizona Water Settlements Act.  
   "As local leaders have noted, a 'settlement' means all parties have to be willing to give as well as take in order that the final result be acceptable to everyone," Kyl said. "The landowners of Pinal County have demonstrated their willingness to be reasonable with this vote, and everyone will be better off as a result." 
   After 15 years of complex negotiations among dozens of parties, the U.S. Senate approved legislation in October that would resolve Indian water rights claims and allow the U.S. and Arizona to settle repayments owed to the federal government for construction of the Central Arizona Project (CAP). The Arizona Water Settlements Act will also bring long-sought certainty to cities and communities as they plan their growth and development, as well as provide a means for Indian tribes to make use of water rights that have historically existed only on paper. 
   "I was proud to help shepherd into law the federal legislation that provided the necessary framework for this agreement, but ultimately it is up to the State of Arizona and the other parties to bring the settlement to closure," Kyl said. "I want to congratulate the members of SCIDD for doing their part to resolve a difficult issue and pave the way for economic development that's in everyone's interest."
