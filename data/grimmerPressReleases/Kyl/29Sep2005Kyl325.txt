CONFEREES APPROVE HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Kyl today praised House and Senate conferees on the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill for including funding for a number of his border control and immigration initiatives key to Arizona.  
   The bill includes a total of nearly $6 billion for securing the nation's borders, including $1.7 billion for border staffing between the ports of entry that will fund, among other things, 1,000 new Border Patrol agents. It also provides $1.4 billion for 20,000 new detention beds that will help eliminate the need for illegal alien detainees to be released in the United States simply for lack of a place to keep them. 
   "Making sure we have the capacity to detain apprehended illegal aliens is absolutely fundamental to controlling the border," said Kyl, who personally requested the funding. "Along with the expansion of expedited removal authority, these new beds should help us end the current practice of releasing into the U.S. illegal immigrants who should be detained pending their removal, but aren't because of a lack of necessary facilities." The appropriations bill also includes: 
   * $1.3 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigations and intelligence programs, including 250 additional immigration investigators; 
   * $536 million for air and marine operations across U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including $20 million for new helicopters, some of which are likely to be used in Arizona; 
   * $35 million for the construction of tactical infrastructure along the Arizona border, such as roads, barriers and lights; 
   * A total of $3.3 billion for first responder grants and assistance under the Office for Domestic Preparedness, including: 
   * $40 million for grants to States to implement the REAL ID Act of 2005; 
   * $550 million for state and local assistance grants; 
   * $765 million for high-threat urban areas; 
   * $400 million for local law enforcement terrorism prevention grants; 
   * $655 million for firefighter assistance grants;
   * $115 million to reduce application processing backlogs at Citizenship and Immigration Services; and 
   * A total of $340 million to continue the development of US Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator technology, which Kyl co-sponsored in 1996.
   "We don't have to wait for Congress to pass immigration reform to get control of our borders," Kyl said. "With the funding in this bill, we are finally getting the resources to do what we've been advocating for a long time. Reform must start with border security, and this bill demonstrates Congress's commitment to that goal."
