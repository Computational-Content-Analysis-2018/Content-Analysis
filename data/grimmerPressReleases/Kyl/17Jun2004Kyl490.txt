SEN. KYL APPLAUDS DEFEAT OF AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE HOBBLED MISSILE DEFENSE
  Sen. Jon Kyl today praised his Senate colleagues for decisively defeating two amendments that could have delayed deployment of a system to defend the United States from ballistic missile attack. 
   Sponsored by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Jack Reed (D-RI), the amendments to the Department of Defense authorization bill would have blocked the ground-based midcourse defense element of the national ballistic missile defense system from being deployed until undergoing "operationally realistic testing" - the certification of which would have been difficult without initial deployment. 
   "These amendments amounted to a classic Catch-22," Kyl said. "They essentially said: 'You can't deploy until you can operationally test it; but of course, you can't test it until you deploy it'. The point is to test under realistic conditions. To do that, the system must be in place. And the amendments would have prevented that. 
   "This is the first time that we've been in a position to take the research started by Ronald Reagan over two decades ago and actually put real ballistic missile interceptors out there," Kyl added. "It's certainly not the time to slam on the brakes. If a nuclear missile from a rogue nation hits Phoenix, I don't want to have to explain why we had a system that might have stopped it but we wanted to make sure it worked perfectly first."
