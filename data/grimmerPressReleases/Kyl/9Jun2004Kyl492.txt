SEN. KYL URGES WORLD COMMUNITY TO AID RECONSTRUCTION, DEMOCRATIZATION OF IRAQ
  Sen. Jon Kyl today congratulated President Bush for winning the unanimous approval of the U.N. Security Council for a resolution endorsing the transfer of sovereignty to Iraq's interim government by the end of June, and urged the community of nations to join in the task of rebuilding Iraq's economy and society.  
   "Those who have criticized the liberation of Iraq because it lacked the specific imprimatur of the United Nations now have no cause for complaint," Kyl said. "More importantly, our putative allies - all of whom have acknowledged the threat once posed by Saddam Hussein - no longer have any excuse not to pitch in and help with the reconstruction and democratization of Iraq. Given the Security Council's vote, there is simply no reason the United States should have to continue to shoulder the great majority of this considerable burden when the entire world shares our stake in the success of a free and stable Iraq." 
   Part of this contribution, Kyl said, should include relief from the G8 industrialized nations of Iraq's $120 billion external debt, as President Bush has urged. 
   Kyl also noted that the new interim Iraqi leadership has been considerably more supportive - and appreciative - of American and coalition efforts than an unfortunate number of other countries. "I believe history will vindicate the nobility of our purpose in Iraq, as well as our sacrifice," he said. "But much remains to be done. The sooner the rest of the world lends a hand, the sooner the Iraqi people can take full charge of their own affairs and the sooner we can bring our troops home."
