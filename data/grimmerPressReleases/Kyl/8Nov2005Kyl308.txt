SEN. KYL APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF DEFICIT REDUCTION BILL
  The U.S. Senate today passed a bill that would help to return the federal government to the path of reducing the federal budget deficit.  
 The Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, would cut federal outlays by more than $35 billion over the years 2006-2010. 
   "This is the first time we've taken such a dramatic step to cut both entitlement and discretionary spending in eight years," Kyl said, "but there's more to be done. We simply must get federal spending under control." 
   The Senate bill will be reconciled with similar legislation now under consideration in the House that is expected to reduce the deficit by $50 billion. Kyl said he hopes the final product move in the direction of the House bill's higher savings. 
   "Before Katrina hit, we were well on our way to President Bush's goal of cutting the deficit in half within two years," Kyl said. "Given the strong performance of the economy, there's still a good chance we can achieve that goal, as long as we avoid tax hikes that would slow the economy down."
