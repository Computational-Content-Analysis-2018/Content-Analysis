SEN. KYL CALLS TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM CRITICAL TOOL AGAINST TERROR
  Sen. Jon Kyl, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security, today expressed support for the NSA's terrorist surveillance program following a review hearing held by the Judiciary Committee to examine wartime executive power and NSA surveillance authority. 
   "This program is a critical and necessary tool in the defense of our nation against terrorist enemies, with whom we are at war" said Kyl. "Should the United States be attacked again in the future, the President would be roundly criticized if he had this program at his disposal and he failed to utilize it in order to protect the American people"
   At today's hearing, Senator Kyl asked Attorney General Alberto Gonzales if the administration would consider implementing a quarterly report on the surveillance program for appropriate Members of Congress. Kyl suggested that such a report would examine whether the program is utilized as intended and could identify any unintended incidents that may occur and what is done to prevent any mistakes in the future.
   "Americans expect their government to do all that it can to defend them - and our ability to do that requires our intelligence agencies to uncover what the terrorists are planning. That's why a program like this is indispensable to our intelligence-gathering efforts," said Kyl.
   Last week, testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, CIA Director Porter Goss stated that the public disclosure of the terrorist surveillance program and other once-secret projects has severely damaged U.S. intelligence-gathering abilities.
   Kyl condemned the disclosure of the program, saying "Those with knowledge of such programs must be committed to their protection."
