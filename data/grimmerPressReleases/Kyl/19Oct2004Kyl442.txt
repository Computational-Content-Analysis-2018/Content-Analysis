SEN. KYL URGES ARIZONANS TO REPORT FLU VACCINE PRICE GOUGING
  Noting recent news reports of vendors exploiting the current flu vaccine shortage to charge exorbitant prices, Sen. Jon Kyl today urged the people of Arizona to report such incidents to the proper authorities.  
   "Price gouging is indefensible and places lives in jeopardy by creating a barrier to access for those in need of the vaccine," Kyl said. "It can also be illegal under federal law. Those responsible must be held accountable." 
   Kyl's office has worked with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Arizona Attorney General and Arizona Department of Health Services to address the price gouging issues. "It is particularly important that we make sure high-risk individuals - adults over age 65 and children - have access to the vaccine," Kyl said. 
   In the wake of a national shortage of the influenza (flu) vaccine, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently announced a plan to limit the potential for such abuse by supplying the vaccine directly to pediatricians, nursing homes and other health care providers treating high-risk patients. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson sent a letter on the danger of price-gouging to the attorney general of each state. A copy of the October 14 press release can be found here. 
   While the state of Arizona has no law explicitly prohibiting price gouging, it can be prosecuted at the federal level. Hospital administrators and pharmacists can call the CDC at 800-311-3435. Consumer complaints can also be filed with the Arizona Attorney General's Phoenix office at (602) 542-5763, or in Tucson at 520-628-6504 and 800-352-8431 in the other parts of the state. "It's important to report this to prevent it from happening again," Kyl said. "If victims have trouble getting through, they can also call my office in Phoenix at 602-840-1891 or in Tucson at 520-575-8633."
