SEN. KYL CALLS FOR WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM
  Today, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz) questioned administration plans for an effective worker verification system at a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship hearing, of which he is a member. U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials, including Assistant Homeland Security Secretary for Policy Stewart Baker, testified before the committee.  
   "As Congress continues consideration of immigration reform, the backbone of any legislation, specifically an enforceable temporary worker program, will be the capacity of the federal government to determine whether someone who is offered a job is eligible to work in the country," said Kyl. "I have not heard today a description of a plan that will prevent employment of illegal immigrants." 
   "I am concerned that the worker verification title passed in the current Senate immigration bill only takes us halfway there, and will not eliminate the activity that currently allows millions of illegal immigrants to steal Social Security numbers and obtain work fraudulently," said Kyl. "It's important not only to stop illegal immigration, but to stop identity theft; there must be safeguards to ensure that someone is actually who he claims to be. If that means people applying for a job must show a hardened Social Security card, I believe most Americans would be willing to do it." 
   Kyl and Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) are the authors of S. 1438, the Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act of 2005, which replaces reliance on conventional documents with a fraud-proof hardened Social Security card. Their bill is the only Senate proposal with a temporary worker program that does not place illegal immigrants on an automatic pathway to citizenship.
