FINALLY, AN END TO SENATE GRIDLOCK?
  By Sen. Jon Kyl
   As Sen. Kerry rightly noted in his concession speech, now is a time for Americans to come together, accept the results of a hard-fought election and work to heal the wounds of personal bitterness and partisan division.  
   President Bush now has a clearer mandate, having won both the popular vote as well as an Electoral College victory free of litigation. On a practical level, we have a real chance for Congress to move past the relative gridlock of the past few years and govern more effectively. 
   Beyond providing Republicans with a larger majority of 55 votes in the Senate, yesterday's vote sends a clear message that voters are frustrated with the now-famous obstructionism that led people from all around the country to descend on South Dakota and unseat a sitting party leader for the first time since Barry Goldwater upset Ernest McFarland. 
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle had spearheaded a strategy of stalling judicial nominations and filibustering key legislation. It was largely successful, since accomplishing virtually anything in the Senate requires either unanimous consent or a super-majority of 60 votes for cloture, which is required to end debate. 
   In February 2003, Daschle launched the first filibuster designed to permanently deny an up-or-down vote on a judicial nomination. The target was Miguel Estrada, a Honduran immigrant and Harvard Law School graduate nominated to serve on the overworked D.C. Circuit. After two years, more than 100 hours of debate, and 7 failed cloture votes, Mr. Estrada withdrew in exasperation. 
   In the past session of Congress, 20 cloture votes were lost, on nominees Estrada, Priscilla Owen, Charles Pickering, Carolyn Kuhl, Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor, Bill Myers, Henry Saad, Richard Griffin, and David McKeague (all of whom had bipartisan, majority support and would have been confirmed by a simple majority vote). Only 69% of President Bush's nominees to the appeals courts have received up-or-down votes. By last summer, pending judicial nominees had been waiting an average of more than 18 months for an up-or-down vote, and appeals court nominees more than 25 months. 
   Major action also thwarted by filibuster included: 
   * The Class Action Fairness Act, which would close a loophole in federal court jurisdiction rules and create a consumer bill of rights in order to prevent trial lawyers from abusing class action procedures at the public's expense. 
   * The Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act, which would reduce the prevalence of attorney-driven fraud and manipulation in asbestos-related lawsuits by establishing a privately funded trust fund to compensate asbestos victims; 
   * The Patients First Act, which would help health care providers afford medical liability insurance coverage by setting sensible limits on compensation for non-economic damages; 
   * The Energy Policy Act, which would provide a comprehensive national energy policy that balances domestic energy production with conservation and efficiency efforts to enhance America's security and decrease our dependence on foreign sources of oil; 
   * The Personal Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone (PRIDE) Act, which would maintain the phenomenal success of the 1996 welfare reform law by continuing to give states flexibility in providing the services that low-income families need to become self-sufficient; and 
   * An open debate on the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would prevent activist judges from subverting the democratic process to redefine the fundamental institution of marriage for the entire nation. 
   Most of the above legislation, like all of the filibustered judicial nominations, had broad and bipartisan support. Freed from obstructionist tactics, most of it would have been passed into law, and the nation would be better off for it. 
   Hopefully, the message sent in South Dakota will resonate throughout the halls of the Senate, where voters will be watching for more cooperation and less confrontation when we gather again in January.
