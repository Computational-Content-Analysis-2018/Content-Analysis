SEN. KYL PUSHES NEW LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOLS AT TERRORISM SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING
  Senate Terrorism, Technology & Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairman Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today held a hearing to review ongoing legislative efforts to provide law enforcement authorities with more effective tools to fight terrorism. Of particular focus in the hearing was S. 2679, the Tools to Fight Terrorism Act, (TFTA) recently introduced by Kyl along with several other members of the subcommittee and the Senate leadership. 
   "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, congressional committees and executive agencies have conducted extensive reviews of our nation's antiterrorism safety net, and we've uncovered numerous flaws and gaps in our antiterrorism system," Kyl said. "We have found, for example, that in many cases anti-terror investigators still have less authority to access information than do investigators of other crimes, such as those involving mail fraud. We have also seen that some of the federal code's criminal offenses and penalties are far too light, or too narrow in their scope, in light of the contemporary terrorist threat. Yet, despite all of these hearings and inquiries, Congress has passed no major anti-terror legislation since the passage of the USA Patriot Act almost three years ago."
   TFTA is divided into five titles, which consist of all or part of 11 bills that currently are pending in the House or the Senate. Every provision of TFTA previously either has been introduced and is pending as a bill in Congress, or addresses a matter that has been explored in a congressional committee hearing. Among other things, the bill would:
   * Allow FBI agents to seek warrants for surveillance of suspected "lone-wolf" terrorists, such as alleged 20th hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui.
   * Improve information sharing among federal agencies and with state and local authorities, avoiding the types of barriers between criminal and intelligence investigators that impeded pre-September 11 searches in the United States for 9/11 hijackers Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.
   * Punish hoaxes about terrorist crimes or the death of a U.S. soldier, imposing penalties commensurate with the disruptions and trauma inflicted by such hoaxes.
   * Impose stiff 30-year mandatory-minimum penalties for possession of shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, atomic and radiologial bombs, and variola virus (smallpox) - penalties sufficient to deter middlemen who might help terrorists acquire these weapons.
   * Create a set of criminal offenses tailored to the unique challenges of guaranteeing the security of our nation's seaports.
   Witnesses at the hearing included: U.S. Assistant Attorney General Daniel J. Bryant; Barry Sabin, Chief of the Counterterrorism Section of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice; and Prof. Jonathan Turley of the George Washington University Law School. Turley, a respected constitutional scholar, testified that in his view all of the major provisions of the bill would likely withstand a Supreme Court challenge.
   "The third anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks serve as a timely reminder of the importance of providing law enforcement with the tools they need to do their jobs effectively," Kyl said. "Every provision in this bill has been vetted extensively and many have been languishing for months if not years. There's not excuse for Congress not to move quickly to make these improvements to our homeland security."
