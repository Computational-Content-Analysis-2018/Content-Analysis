SEN. KYL COSPONSORS BILL TO FIGHT CRIME, TERRORISM AT SEAPORTS
  Sen. Jon Kyl today joined a bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce legislation aimed at preventing terrorist attacks and other crimes at the nation's seaports, where studies have found security to be broadly lacking. The bill would create new offenses and broaden and increase penalties for existing crimes affecting the security of U.S. seaports. 
   "America's seaports are literally the gateway to our economy," Kyl said. "We've already seen how damaging a simple labor dispute can be, leaving millions of dollars worth of exports piled at the docks and imports rotting out at anchor. Terrorist attacks could have a much greater impact, crippling routine commerce and undermining our economic recovery. At a minimum, we need to do a better job of making sure that terrorists aren't using seaports to sneak dangerous contraband into the United States."
   The Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act would, among other provisions:
   * Clarify that existing law on fraudulent access to transport facilities includes seaports and waterfronts within its scope, and increase the maximum prison term for a violation from five to 10 years;
   * Toughen sanctions, including criminal charges, for failure to cooperate with the U.S. Coast Guard;
   * Amend current law to close loopholes and make it a crime - with stiff penalties - to willfully use a dangerous weapon (including chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear materials) or explosive with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person on board a passenger vessel;
   * Provide criminal sanctions for intentionally damaging any of the Coast Guard's 50,000-plus navigational aids, and make it a crime to knowingly place in waters any device or substance likely to damage a vessel or its cargo, or to willfully and maliciously discharge a hazardous substance into U.S. waters with the intent to cause death, serious bodily harm, or catastrophic economic injury;
   * Make it a crime to transport aboard any vessel an explosive, biological agent, chemical weapon, or radioactive or nuclear materials knowing they are intended for a terrorist act; and
   * Modernize current law to provide more sanctions to deter criminal or civil violations related to a range of offenses, including bribery, "stowaways," and theft of interstate or foreign shipments and goods from transportation facilities or instruments, including trailers, cargo containers, and warehouses.
