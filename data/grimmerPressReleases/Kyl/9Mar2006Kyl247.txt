SEN. KYL APPLAUDS TRIUMPH OF SECURITY OVER PARTISANSHIP AT SIGNING OF PATRIOT ACT
  President Bush today signed into law the reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) attended the White House signing ceremony and applauded the law's enactment.  
   "I am pleased that today national security has triumphed over months of partisanship," said Kyl. "Reauthorization of this critically important tool in the war on terror is long overdue; we can now assure our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that they will have the resources to continue doing their jobs to keep America safe." 
   Kyl was instrumental in securing a compromise which passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. The law now provides additional provisions designed to protect civil liberties while maintaining the government's ability to detect and detain terrorists. 
   Among key provisions of the bill, Kyl's efforts ensured that intelligence agencies would be able to seek warrants to monitor suspected lone-wolf terrorists, such as the 20th hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui, who is currently in the sentencing phase of his trial. Kyl also led the efforts in including provisions to control distribution and sale of chemicals involved in methamphetamine production.
