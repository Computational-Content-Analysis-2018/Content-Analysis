SEN. KYL APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF FT. MCDOWELL INDIAN COMMUNITY WATER RIGHTS ACT
  The U.S. House of Representatives approved Thursday, S. 2464, the Fort McDowell Indian Community Water Rights Settlement Revision Act of 2006, which forgives a long-term, no-interest loan made to the Yavapai Nation in return for relieving the U.S. government of conducting environmental mitigation on the reservation. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), a sponsor of the bill with Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), made the following statement:  
   "This legislation is a win-win and brings to a close the final stages of implementation of this important water settlement. It also shows how the federal government and Native American tribes can work together to reach a mutually beneficial resolution." 
   The U.S. Senate approved the bill on September 14, 2006 and is expected to be signed into law by the President.
