SENATE PASSES CONFERENCE REPORT ON ENERGY & WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Jon Kyl today announced that Arizona received significant for a number of key projects in the final version of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill that the Senate approved today by a vote of 84-4.  
   "Arizona's often fragile environment is a national treasure that deserves national protection," Kyl said. "This bill contains many provisions to help in our efforts to restore riparian habitat, improve flood control and increase public recreation opportunities." 
   The bill includes the following Kyl-requested provisions, among others: 
   * $3 million for wash and tributary flood control in Nogales, to prevent flood damage and promote recreation to accommodate population growth; 
   * $718,000 to restore the riparian habitat of the Colorado River in Yuma's East Wetlands; 
   * $3.5 million for Rio de Flag flood control, in response to concerns that a large flood could displace nearly half of Flagstaff's more than 60,000 residents, threatening Northern Arizona University and parts of the city's historic downtown; 
   * $8 million for a longtime riparian habitat and nature trail program in the Phoenix and Tempe reaches of Rio Salado, which has brought back significant avian wildlife; 
   * $10 million for the Tucson Drainage Area; 
   * $4.5 million for a riparian habitat program at the Tres Rios project using treated wastewater; 
  $400,000 for the Va Shly'Ay Akimel project restoring Salt River riparian habitat; 
   * $450,000 to monitor downstream riparian habitat from the Alamo Dam; and $359,000 for studies to improve water use efficiency in west-central Arizona;
