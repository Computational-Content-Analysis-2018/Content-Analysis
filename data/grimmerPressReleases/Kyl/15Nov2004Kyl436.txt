SEN. KYL COMMENTS ON BUSH CABINET DEPARTURES
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today issued the following statement on the announced departures of several members of President Bush's cabinet:  
   "I've always found it hard to understand all of the criticism of U.S. diplomatic outreach over the past four years, given that Secretary Powell is one of the most respected figures on the world stage. I don't know anyone who doesn't like and respect Colin Powell, Democrat or Republican, at home or abroad. His successor will have big shoes to fill." 
   "Spence Abraham and I came to the Senate together in 1994 and continued to work closely together when he took the helm of the Department of Energy, where he did a superb job. Perhaps his greatest legacy will be the revitalization of the department's nuclear materials operations, a key function of our national defense." 
   "As Secretary of Agriculture, Ann Veneman oversees forestry programs that are critical to the state of Arizona, and she has always been very helpful and responsive. She will be missed."
