SEN. KYL PRAISES INTERIOR DEPTARTMENT GRANTS FOR WESTERN WATER CONSERVATION
  Sen. Jon Kyl today applauded Interior Secretary Gale Norton's announcement of $4 million in grants for water conservation grants under the Water 2025 Secretarial Challenge Grant Program.  
   "The Water 2025 program was designed to support realistic, cooperative methodologies with a high probability of success in high-risk areas," Kyl said Monday. "That kind of approach, and the awarding of these particular grants, make clear that the Interior Department appreciates the water supply challenges we face in the West." 
   At an event in Phoenix announcing the grants, Norton spotlighted three projects in Arizona: the Gila Gravity Main Canal Board, the Salt River Project and the Yuma County Water Users Association. The grants, funded through the Bureau of Reclamation, will fund a variety of projects to increase the efficiency of current water use via conservation and other projects.

   Kyl sits on the Senate's Energy & Natural Resources Committee.
