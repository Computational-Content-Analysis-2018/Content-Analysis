SEN. KYL: ENACT TRAVEL BAN AND LOBBYING REFORM
  Sen. Jon Kyl today issued the following statement on his support for lobbying reform legislation. 
   "I am working now with Senator McCain, Senator Santorum, and others to craft reform legislation that will include a ban on lobbyist-sponsored congressional travel. I spoke with Senator Santorum again this morning and confirmed that the travel ban will be part of the legislation. I also expect that it will include a number of additional meaningful reforms that go beyond just the travel ban. The measure we are working on will be introduced very soon.
   "I plan to work actively with Senator McCain and other reform supporters to secure the prompt enactment of a travel ban and lobbying reform - just as I have always supported sensible ethics reforms."
