SEN. KYL CALLS ON CONGRESS TO ADDRESS VETERANS AFFAIRS BUDGET SHORTFALL
  Sen. Jon Kyl today commended the Senate's Committee on Veterans' Affairs for its decision to hold an emergency hearing in response to the troubling disclosure of a $1 billion funding shortfall within the Department of Veterans Affairs.  
   "I was distressed to learn that the information previously provided to the Congress by the Department was incorrect," said Kyl. "I'm firmly committed to supporting whatever measures are needed to ensure that access to the health care services that veterans depend on are maintained and improved." 
   Kyl continued, "It's my hope that today's hearing will determine what steps are necessary to rectify the shortfall in a swift manner. Our veterans deserve it."
