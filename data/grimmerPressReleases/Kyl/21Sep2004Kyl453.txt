SEN. KYL ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO FINISH ORGAN PIPE VEHICLE BARRIER
  Sen. Jon Kyl today announced that $6.6 million has been included in the Senate's Interior Appropriations bill - equivalent to the House's version - to complete construction of a vehicle barrier along the border between Mexico and the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona. 
   Spurred by the murder of park ranger Kris Eggle in 2002, the barrier allows passage of wildlife but is designed to prevent illegal immigrants, drug smugglers and others from simply driving across what had been essentially an open border.
   "This barrier is a good start, but much more needs to be done to protect both the people and the ecosystem of Arizona from illegal border crossings," Kyl said. "A longer vehicle barrier, one that can't simply be driven around, is necessary to avoid simply shifting the problem from Organ Pipe to areas like the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge.
   "Ultimately, the Border Patrol needs the resources to create multiple barriers to illegal crossings, from lights and video towers to fences and other barriers," he added. "That's a federal responsibility, because illegal immigration and border security are national issues."
