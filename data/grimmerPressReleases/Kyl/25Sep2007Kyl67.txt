ARIZONA NATIVE ROBERT FANNIN RECEIVES SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING
  The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee today held a confirmation hearing on the nomination of Arizona native Robert Fannin to become U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic. U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) introduced Fannin at the hearing.  
   "Bob is an outstanding individual and I was honored to introduce him at his confirmation hearing," said Kyl. "I've known Bob for over thirty years, and his dedication and intelligence to everything he's done in life has earned my utmost respect. I have every confidence that Bob will serve the United States well if he is confirmed, and I urge my colleagues on the Foreign Relations committee to quickly report out his nomination so that the full Senate can act." 
   Arizona Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) also provided similar praise in a written statement. 
   "His professionalism, thoughtfulness, and experience will make him an effective diplomat and a wonderful representative for the United States abroad," McCain said in a written statement. "I have every confidence that, if confirmed, Bob Fannin will contribute immensely to the continuation of our warm relations with the Dominican Republic." 
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee must now vote to send his confirmation to the full Senate.
