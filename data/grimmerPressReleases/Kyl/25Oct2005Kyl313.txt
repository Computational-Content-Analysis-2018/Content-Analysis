SEN. KYL HEARING TO PROBE LESSONS OF KATRINA FOR POTENTIAL TERRORIST ATTACKS
  Sen. Jon Kyl today announced plans to focus on how the lessons learned from the response to Hurricane Katrina also apply to the possibility of terrorist attack at a hearing Wednesday of his Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security.  
   "It's obvious that Hurricane Katrina exposed numerous weaknesses in our nation's emergency preparedness system," Kyl said. "We need to explore how we can learn from the experience not only for future natural disasters, but also for possible terrorist attacks, which could easily replicate the chaos on the Gulf Coast and would arrive with considerably less warning." 
   The objective of the hearing, Kyl said, is to gain a better understanding of several key issues: 
   * The types of terrorist attacks to which America is most vulnerable, particularly those that would have an impact similar to Hurricane Katrina's; 
   * The key success factors in planning for and responding to an attack; 
   * The emergency preparations of the federal government, and how it should work with state and local authorities to provide an effective response; and 
   * Existing shortfalls in need of attention by local, state, and federal authorities to improve readiness.
   Scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 26 in room 226 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, the hearing will include the following witnesses: 
   * Former Senator Slade Gorton, member of the 9/11 Commission and the subsequently-formed Public Discourse Project 
   * Wayne Thomas, Vice-President of Homeland Security, Innovative Emergency Management 
   * Henry Renteria, Director, California Governor's Office of Emergency Services 
   * Matt Bettenhausen, Director, California Office of Homeland Security 
   * Michael O'Hanlon, Senior Fellow, Foreign Policy Studies Program, the Brookings Institution The Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Homeland Security has held numerous hearings on the subject of potential terrorist attacks, examining security at seaports and the vulnerabilities of the nation's information infrastructure, as well as the potential impact of attacks using biological weapons and electromagnetic pulses.
