SEN. KYL REITERATES SUPPORT FOR NSA PROGRAM, PROPOSES GREATER OVERSIGHT
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Homeland Security of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today delivered a speech at the "Restoration Weekend" event held in Phoenix, Arizona, where he reiterated his support for the National Security Agency terrorist surveillance program and outlined a strategy for Congressional oversight of the program. 
   "We are in a protracted struggle with an enemy whose ambition is simple: Kill Americans by the millions and try to destroy our way of life," said Kyl. "This program is an indispensable aspect of the defense of our nation and I believe that we need to defend it and find ways to make it work." 
   Kyl said he supports greater oversight by Congress of the surveillance resulting from the program, including whether any U.S. citizens were inadvertently the subject of surveillance and whether steps are being taken to ensure that any further such incidents do not occur again. This does not require that the operational details of the program be revealed, which would jeopardize the effectiveness of the program. 
   Kyl also said he could support a proposal being advanced by Senator Mike DeWine (R-OH) that would specifically exempt the program from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that governs other electronic intercepts and also would require the administration to regularly brief members of the House and Senate intelligence subcommittees about it.
