SEN. KYL CRITICIZES CLOTURE VOTE ON PATRIOT ACT
  Sen. Jon Kyl today criticized the Senate's failure to overcome a filibuster of legislation that would reauthorize, with significant modifications, the U.S.A. Patriot Act.  
   "God forbid that there be a terrorist attack that could have been prevented by the Patriot Act after it has expired," Kyl said. "If that happens, those who have supported this filibuster will have to answer for it, and the American people will have a very hard time understanding what their objections were." 
   Kyl reiterated his objection to a short-term extension of the act, proposed by Senator Pat Leahy (D-VT) but blocked by Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN). "A short-term extension of the Patriot Act by the Senate is an utterly pointless gesture for multiple reasons," Kyl said. "The House won't agree to it. The President won't sign it into law. And more importantly, it won't change anything fundamental to the disagreement over reauthorization of the Patriot Act itself. Opponents aren't going to change their demands, and supporters like myself have compromised as far as we are willing to go." 
   "That leaves us at the point where a straightforward up or down vote would be the rather obvious next step," Kyl added. "But if that happened, the reauthorization would succeed, and its opponents have decided they would rather have the Patriot Act lapse entirely than allow the compromise version to become law. The consequences of their decision will rest upon their shoulders."
