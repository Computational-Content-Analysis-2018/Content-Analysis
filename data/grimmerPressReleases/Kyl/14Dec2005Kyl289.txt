SEN. KYL PRAISES PRESIDENTIAL ORDER ENHANCING FOIA
  Sen. Jon Kyl today applauded President Bush's issuance of an Executive Order to improve the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  
   "The Freedom of Information Act epitomizes the vision of the Founding Fathers of a government by, for and of the people," Kyl said. "Its spirit of transparency and accountability in government is both a potent symbol and a powerful tool for a free society." 
   The Executive Order directs federal agencies to "ensure citizen-centered and results-oriented agency FOIA operations." It requires the designation of a senior official as Chief FOIA officer in major agencies, who will oversee a process of identifying and implementing measures to improve performance over the next two years, including the establishment of "FOIA Requester Service Centers" and the appointment of public liaisons to assist in resolving disputes or other issues. 
   The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security, which Kyl chairs, held a hearing on improving the FOIA process on March 15. Legislation that grew out of that hearing caught the attention of the White House, Kyl said. 
   "I think the President simply decided this was a good idea and that he had the authority to make it happen without waiting for the sometimes slow-grinding gears of the formal legislative process," Kyl said. "There's a word for that: 'leadership'." 
   Federal agencies received more than 4 million FOIA requests in 2004, a 71 percent increase since 2002. The program is currently administered by about 5,000 employees.
