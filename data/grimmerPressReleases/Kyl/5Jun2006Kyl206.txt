SEN. KYL SECURES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY MEETING FOR PHOENIX OFFICIALS TO ADDRESS HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today announced that he has secured a meeting between Department of Homeland Security and Phoenix officials to address federal homeland security funding levels for metropolitan Phoenix.  
   DHS Undersecretary George Foresman and Assistant Secretary for Grants and Training, Tracy Henke, are expected to meet with Mayor Phil Gordon and other Phoenix officials this month to review the rationale used to determine the funding levels for Phoenix under the Urban Area Security Initiative grant program. Phoenix is the nation's fifth largest city, with important strategic assets including Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station and Luke Air Force Base. 
   "I am concerned by the recent announcement of homeland security funding levels for the City of Phoenix," said Kyl. "It is my hope that through this meeting, the critical homeland security needs for Phoenix will be recognized, and we can determine whether adequate federal resources are going to Phoenix to address these needs. It will also be an opportunity for city officials to provide additional input to the Department."
