SEN. KYL LAUDS HOUSE ACTION ON INTERNET GAMBLING
  The U.S. House of Representatives today approved H.R. 4411, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2005, by a strong bipartisan vote of 317 to 93. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) applauded its passage, calling it an encouraging step toward significantly curbing gambling on the web.  
   "A Harvard professor once appropriately likened Internet gambling to using crack cocaine," said Kyl. "Gambling can be highly addictive, especially when it's done over an unregulated environment such as the Internet." 
   The core of the House legislation is similar to the proposals that Kyl has championed. H.R. 4411 would require the U.S. Treasury Department to issue regulations that would prohibit approving a transaction between a U.S.-based customer account and an Internet gambling merchant. Financial institutions would have to follow those regulations. 
   "For more than a decade, I have fought for legislation to enforce Internet gambling prohibitions," said Kyl. "Today's action in the House is a very encouraging step, and I will work with my colleagues to explore all ways to move this much-needed legislation through the Senate this year." 
   Many legal, governmental, and collegiate groups have endorsed efforts to combat gambling activity in cyberspace including the National Association of Attorneys General, which has expressed strong support. The Federal Trade Commission has also acknowledged the harms of Internet gambling and the National Collegiate Athletic Association is particularly concerned about the risks to college students and has urged a legislative remedy.
