SEN. KYL RECEIVES AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION'S HIGHEST AWARD
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) yesterday received the prestigious Dr. Nathan Davis Award from the American Medical Association, the highest award that the group can bestow upon a government officeholder. Sen. Kyl earned the award for consistently supporting efforts to improve patient access to quality medical care.  
   "Since the day he entered Congress, Senator Kyl has been a stalwart supporter of physicians in Arizona and throughout the entire country," said Chic Older, Executive Vice President of the Arizona Medical Association. "He cares about patients and the public health, and he understands the concerns of doctors who care for these patients." 
   Senator Kyl was nominated for the award by several groups, including the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, the Arizona Medical Association and the Arizona Osteopathic Association. Kyl has been a leader in the Senate in ensuring the doctors receive adequate reimbursement from the government so that they can provide quality care to patients. Last year Kyl was able to prevent a scheduled 4.4 percent cut in physician reimbursements, enabling more physicians to continue to treat Medicare patients. Kyl has also been a leader in the Senate fighting for litigation reform. Kyl has secured funding for important Arizona medical initiatives like the Translational Genomics Institute in Phoenix; and has voted for increased funding for the National Institutes of Health. Kyl also won a provision in the 2003 Medicare reform bill to begin reimbursing hospitals for federally mandated services provided to illegal immigrants. Arizona providers are slated to receive $180 million, or up to $45 million per year, in federal reimbursement.
