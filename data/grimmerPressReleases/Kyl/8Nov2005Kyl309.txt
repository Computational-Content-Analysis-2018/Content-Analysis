SEN. KYL CALLS SAUDI ARABIAN SUPPORT FOR WAHHABISM 'FUNDAMENTALLY UNCHANGED'
  Sen. Jon Kyl said today that the government of Saudi Arabia has not done enough to stop Wahhabi extremism, noting that, "when I held hearings more than two years ago, the General Counsel of the Department of Treasury had testified that Saudi Arabia was the epicenter of terrorist financing."  
   As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security, Kyl held several hearings in late 2003 examining the influence of Wahhabism in the United States, as well as recruitment efforts within the military and prison system. 
   "I had hoped that Saudi Arabia would have made more progress," Kyl said at a hearing Tuesday of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "Unfortunately, despite some examples of change, there is still too much extremist support coming from Saudi Arabia. We recognize that deep-rooted cultural malignancies don't change overnight, but at the very least, the government of the kingdom owes the world more of a commitment to tackle the problem." 
   Witnesses at the hearing included Anthony Cordesman, co-director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who called Saudi Arabia the world's largest source of funding for Wahhabi extremism, along with: 
   * Daniel Glaser, deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes at the Treasury Department; 
   * Nina Shea, director of the Center for Religious Freedom and author of the Freedom House Report; 
   * Steve Emerson, a terrorism expert and executive director of the Investigative Project on Terrorism; and 
   * Gulam Bakali, a member of the board of trustees of the Islamic Association of North Texas.
