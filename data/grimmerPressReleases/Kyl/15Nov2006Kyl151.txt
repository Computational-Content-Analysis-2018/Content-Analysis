SEN. KYL ELECTED CHAIRMAN OF SENATE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today was elected chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, making him the third ranking member in the Senate Republican leadership. Kyl, who previously headed the Republican Policy Committee, will now be responsible for driving the messages of Senate Republicans.  
   "I am honored to have been elected by my colleagues to a new leadership position," said Kyl. "Our new team understands that Republicans need to learn some lessons from the election, including the fact that we are expected to stand for fiscal prudence, ethical service, and an effective pursuit of national security. I look forward to working over the next two years to help regain the majority in 2008." 
   Rounding out the Republican leadership team, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was elected as Senate Minority Leader, Senator Trent Lott (R-MS) as Senate Minority Whip, Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) as Conference Vice Chairman, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) to lead the Republican Policy Committee, and Senator John Ensign (R-NV) to chair the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
