SEN. KYL DISAPPOINTED WITH PALESTINIAN ELECTION RESULTS; CONCERNED HAMAS WIN COULD HURT PEACE PROCESS
  Sen. Jon Kyl, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security, today made the following statement about the election of a Hamas-dominated Palestinian government. 
   "Today's news that the Palestinian people have elected a Hamas-dominated government is troubling in the extreme. Hamas is a terrorist organization, dedicated to the destruction of Israel - a fact it advertises openly.
   "In June 2002, President Bush called on Palestinians to choose 'new leaders, not compromised by terror.' In the event that the Palestinians chose the path of peace, the President offered full support for their aspirations to statehood. It appears that the Palestinians have squandered that opportunity.
   "The President is correct to restate our resolve not to do business with terrorists. Unless Hamas immediately and unequivocally renounces terrorism and demonstrates a commitment to peaceful political activity, the United States will be guided by this policy.
   "In December I signed a letter to President Bush stating that, in the event that Hamas was brought into the Palestinian Authority, the United States 'would have little choice but to reevaluate all aspects of our relations with the Palestinian Authority.'"
