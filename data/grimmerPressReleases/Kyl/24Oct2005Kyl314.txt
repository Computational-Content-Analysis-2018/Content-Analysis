SEN. KYL APPLAUDS BERNANKE APPOINTMENT TO CHAIR FEDERAL RESERVE
  Sen. Jon Kyl today praised President Bush's decision to appoint Ben Bernanke to chair the Federal Reserve, calling Bernanke "a steady hand on the tiller of a very important ship."  
   "Beyond his policy expertise, one of the things that made Alan Greenspan such a success was the sense of responsibility and gravitas that he projected," Kyl said. "Americans want their central banker to be smart and also inspire confidence, and Ben Bernanke is a reassuring figure on both counts." 
   Kyl noted that last week Bernanke urged Congress last week to move quickly to extend President Bush's dividends and capital gains tax cuts, lest market uncertainty undermine economic growth.
