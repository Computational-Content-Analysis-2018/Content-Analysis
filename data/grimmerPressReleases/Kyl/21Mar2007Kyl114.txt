SENATE REJECTS TAX RELIEF FOR TEACHERS, STUDENTS, FAMILY BUSINESSES
  The Senate today failed to adopt an amendment introduced by Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) that would have extended key tax relief initiatives for teachers, students, and seniors, while also significantly and permanently lessening the burden of the death tax.  
   "The Senate today decided to place partisan differences ahead of good economic policy for America," said Kyl. "My amendment today would have gone a long way toward helping teachers, students, and small businesses by extending critical tax relieve initiatives. It also would have brought permanent relief to one of the most unfair provisions of our tax code." 
   "My effort to kill the death tax doesn't end here and I will continue to do whatever is necessary to bring a permanent end to the damaging burden of this tax." 
   The Kyl amendment specifically would have protected families, family farms, and small businesses by raising the death tax exemption to $5 million and reducing the maximum death tax rate to no more than 35 percent. 
   As a result of 2001 and 2003 Republican tax relief initiatives, the death tax rate is 45 percent this year through 2009. It returns back to its original levels in 2011 and skyrockets to as high as 60 percent with an exemption amount of $1 million. 
   The amendment also would have extended the college tuition deduction and the student loan interest deduction. It would have also extend the teacher classroom deduction; protected senior citizens from higher taxes on their retirement income; maintained U.S. financial market competitiveness; and promoted economic growth by extending the lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains. 
   The amendment was not agreed to on a party line vote of 47 to 51.
