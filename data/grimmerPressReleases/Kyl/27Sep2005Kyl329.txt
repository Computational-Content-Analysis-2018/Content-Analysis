SEN. KYL JOINS BILL FOR MILITARY, CIVILIAN RETIREES TO PAY HEALTH PREMIUMS PRE-TAX
  Sen. Kyl today cosponsored legislation that would allow military and civilian retirees and their families to pay health insurance premiums on a pre-tax basis.  
   This benefit, known as "premium conversion," is already available to many private sector employees, and was extended to include active federal employees by executive order in October 2000. Kyl's bill, S. 484, makes the necessary changes in the tax code and other regulations to include military and federal civilian retirees as well. It was originally sponsored by Sen. John Warner (R-VA), who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
   "The rising cost of health care is a major concern for everyone, but particularly for retirees living on fixed incomes," Kyl said. "Those who dedicated their careers to public service deserve the same benefits as those in the private sector, and certainly the last thing we want to see is military veterans struggling to pay for health insurance after they've willingly put their very lives on the line for this country." 
   Kyl noted that premiums are expected to increase by an average of 7.9 percent for the more than 8 million federal employees, retirees and their families covered by the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. S. 484 would affect approximately 2.3 million federal and military retirees, spouses, widows and widowers and would result in average annual savings of $434 per year. 
   Companion legislation has been introduced in the House by Rep. Tom Davis (R-VA).
