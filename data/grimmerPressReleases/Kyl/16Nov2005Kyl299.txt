SEN. KYL AMENDMENT WOULD RAISE LIMITS ON GIFTS TO SOLDIERS
  Sen. Jon Kyl today announced the Senate passage of an amendment he co-sponsored to the Defense Department Authorization bill that would increase the $20 cap on the value of gifts that can be given to military personnel from those other than close friends or relatives.  
   "A great many Americans would like to show their support for our troops overseas by providing gifts and support for both service members and their families," Kyl said. "That's something the federal government should be encouraging instead of discouraging." 
   Also co-sponsored by Sen. Mel Martinez (R-FL), the measure amends the current statute related to accepting gifts, providing the Secretary of Defense the authority to receive gifts on behalf on individuals. This mechanism is designed to provide administrative oversight and prevent abuses or the appearance of individual impropriety. The amendment would also allow the same process to be used for gifts to dependents and survivors of wounded and injured personnel.
