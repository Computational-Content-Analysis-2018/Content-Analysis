SEN. KYL ANNOUNCES DOT GRANT FOR HOOVER DAM BYPASS BRIDGE
  Sen. Jon Kyl announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded a grant of $6.6 million to finance the ongoing construction of the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge along U.S. highway 93.  
   "This bridge is my key transportation priority, as it is critical not only for two of the fastest growing states in the country, but also for the national security of the whole United States," Kyl said Wednesday. "The Hoover Dam would be an obvious terrorist attack target, because of the potential for both damage to electrical infrastructure as well as major environmental impact, and even loss of life. The current 23-mile detour, although regrettably necessary, is a considerable nuisance to local residents and a serious threat to public safety, as heavy trucks have had to negotiate narrow, two-lane roads with steep grades." 
   Kyl vowed to continue his work with Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), and with other members of the two states' congressional delegations to obtain the remainder of funds needed for the bypass.
