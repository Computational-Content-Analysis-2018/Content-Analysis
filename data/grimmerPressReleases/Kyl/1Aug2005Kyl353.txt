SEN. KYL APPLAUDS BOLTON APPOINTMENT TO U.N.
  Sen. Jon Kyl today applauded President Bush's appointment of John Bolton to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, noting that Senate Democrats' obstructionism left the president no other choice.  
   "It would have been better if he had been formally confirmed, but there's no question that, absent the Democrats' filibuster, he would easily have received a solid majority," Kyl said. "President Bush was very patient - he waited five months for a vote - and enough is enough, we need to get a permanent ambassador to the United Nations. Under the circumstances, everybody there will know that he's the president's man." 
   "John Bolton is a successful diplomat and advocate for peace and freedom, with a proven record in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and working with the United Nations to repeal the odious Zionism-equals-racism resolution," Kyl said. "Despite the caricature painted by his opponents, Bolton will bring to the United Nations a combination of toughness and diplomacy, much like his predecessors Jeanne Kirkpatrick and Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Bolton is serious about the war on terror, cleaning up corruption at the UN, and like most Americans, he really doesn't appreciate our being pushed around by nations that are not democracies, do not respect human rights, and are not helpful in the war against terrorism. Clearly, the UN is an organization that could use some 'tough love' right now." 
   Senate Democrats' constantly increasing demands to see more paperwork before allowing a vote on Bolton's nomination was a "transparent charade," Kyl added, warning: "The Senate shouldn't get too carried away with our ability to say no, because if we do, the president ultimately has the authority to go around us. Democrats need to understand that their obstructionism has actually weakened the power of the Senate."
