SEN. KYL ADDS NEW JUDGESHIP TO FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS FOR ARIZONA, WESTERN STATES
  The Senate Judiciary Committee today adopted an amendment by Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) that will add one judgeship to the federal appeals court that serves Arizona and the Western region.  
   The amendment eliminates the twelfth seat on the D.C. Circuit and adds one on the Ninth Circuit. 
   "For years, members of the Judiciary Committee have noted that the twelfth seat on the D.C. Circuit is not justified by that court's caseload," said Kyl. "The Ninth Circuit, which serves Arizona and the Western states, on the other hand has the most of any court to decide cases despite the fact it has a full complement of active judges. Adding another judge would help alleviate this backlog and burden. 
   "The backlog in the Ninth Circuit injures ordinary people in Arizona who have to wait to have their lawsuits resolved. Plaintiffs who have been injured, criminal defendants seeking reviews of their conviction, and victims who are waiting for justice; for these people, justice delayed in justice denied. This amendment will help alleviate the delays of the Ninth Circuit." 
   The twelfth seat of the D.C. Circuit was first authorized in 1984, but has remained vacant the majority of the years since that time, including for the last 10 years. The Ninth Circuit, however, has the most pending cases per judge anywhere in the country, many of which are immigration-related.
