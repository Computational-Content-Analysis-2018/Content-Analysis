SENS. KYL, FEINGOLD INTRODUCE BILL TO STRENGTHEN NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION EFFORTS RE: IRAN
  Sens. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) today introduced legislation to strengthen sanctions aimed at foreign companies and other entities that facilitate Iran's acquisition of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons through the transfer of dual-use technologies or equipment.  
   "Iran is racing to develop nuclear weapons at the same time its president is openly calling for Israel to be 'wiped off the map'," Kyl said. "That is not a subtle juxtaposition, nor is the danger limited to the Middle East. It is incumbent on the U.S. government to do everything we can to prevent Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, not just for Israel's sake, but for the world's." 
   The Iran Nonproliferation Enforcement Act builds upon the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000, which requires the President, on a biannual basis, to submit to Congress a report identifying all foreign people and entities that facilitate Iran's acquisition of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons via dual-use technologies or equipment. The original act empowers the President to apply sanctions against identified proliferators, including prohibitions on arms exports from the U.S. government and the issuance of export licenses for U.S. companies seeking to do business with them. The new bill would strengthen its provisions by: 
   * Requiring, rather than merely authorizing, the imposition of sanctions on proliferators; 
   * Extending sanctions to the parent company of a sanctioned entity; 
   * Broadening sanctions to include prohibitions on US investment, financing, and financial assistance of proliferators, in addition to the current arms and dual use export prohibitions; and 
   * Requiring more detailed justification if the Administration chooses not to impose sanctions.
   In February, Vice Admiral Lowell E. Jacoby, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that "Tehran probably will have the ability to produce nuclear weapons early in the next decade." In September, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) formally declared that Iran was out of compliance with its agreed-upon obligations.
