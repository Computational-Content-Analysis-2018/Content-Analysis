SENATE PASSES RESOLUTION HONORING TUSKEGEE AIRMEN
  The U.S. Senate passed a resolution late yesterday honoring the service of the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, America's first group of black military pilots and support personnel.  
   "The Tuskegee Airmen were genuine war heroes - patriots whose performance against the enemy would have been inspirational under the best of circumstances," said Kyl, who cosponsored the measure. "Certainly, as the victims of discrimination from many on their own side, they were not flying their missions under the best of circumstances." 
   Passed by unanimous consent, the resolution authorizes President Bush to award a gold medal on behalf of Congress, collectively, to the Tuskegee Airmen in recognition of their unique military record, which "inspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces." 
   Among the numerous notable accomplishments of the group, a four-squadron fighter group of Tuskegee Airmen made history by escorting 200 bombing missions of the 15th Air Force over central and southern Europe without the loss of a single bomber to enemy aircraft. "The skill and dedication of the Tuskegee Airmen not only helped win World War II, it was a major contributing factor to President Truman's decision to integrate the military," Kyl said.
