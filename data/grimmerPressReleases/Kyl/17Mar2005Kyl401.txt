SEN. KYL-SPONSORED AMENDMENT WOULD ADD 2000 NEW BORDER PATROL AGENTS
  Sen. Jon Kyl today co-sponsored legislation that calls for 2,000 additional front-line border patrol positions, bringing the total of new agents closer to the number required by the intelligence reform bill passed by Congress in December and signed into law by President Bush.  
   "The porosity of the nation's borders is an ongoing national scandal and a very real threat to America safety and security" Kyl said. "Arizona and other border states are at the front line of the problem are in dire need of more agents to protect the nation from illegal immigration, drug smuggling and terrorist infiltration." 
   Last year's intelligence reform bill provided for 2,000 new agents to be added every year for five years, for a total of 10,000 new positions. The Kyl amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution calls for $352 million for this year's allotment, funded by a transfer from other accounts in the budget and thus requiring no increase in non-discretionary spending. 
   "We now have evidence that terrorists are seeking to enter the country via our southern border," Kyl said. "Security there is a federal problem that requires a federal solution. "The time to beef up our defenses is now, not after another 9/11." 
   The amendment is co-sponsored by senators John McCain (R-AZ), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), John Cornyn (R-TX), John Ensign (R-NV) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).
