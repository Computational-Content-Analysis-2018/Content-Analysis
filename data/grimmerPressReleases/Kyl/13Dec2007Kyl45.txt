SEN. KYL LAUDS NOMINATION OF ARIZONAN SNOW FOR FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT
  U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today commended the President for nominating G. Murray Snow to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The nomination, jointly recommended by Senators Kyl and McCain, was made by the White House on Wednesday.  
   "I am pleased with the President's decision to nominate Judge Snow for the Federal District Court for Arizona - a position for which he is well qualified," said Senator Kyl. "Arizona's Federal District Court continues to be overworked due to a tremendous backlog of cases, primarily immigration related. Therefore, it's important that the current vacancy on the court is filled expeditiously to prevent an even greater backlog." 
   Since 2002, Judge Snow has served on the Arizona Court of Appeals. Prior to that, he was a partner at the Phoenix law firm Osborn Maledon. 
   Senator Kyl, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, will urge Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy to move swiftly on Snow's nomination.
