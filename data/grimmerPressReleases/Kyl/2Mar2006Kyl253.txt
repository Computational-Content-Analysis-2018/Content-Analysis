SEN. KYL LAUDS PASSAGE OF ANTI- TERRORISM LEGISLATION
  Reaffirming its commitment in the war on terror, the U.S. Senate today approved legislation that will provide law enforcement the tools necessary to effectively combat terrorism. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) lauded passage of H.R. 3199, the USA Patriot Reauthorization Act, although he expressed concerns over the delay in final passage. 
   "I applaud the Senate's action in reauthorizing the Patriot Act, but I don't believe the objections to it were enough to have delayed final passage of this critically important bill," said Kyl. "The delay has created legal uncertainty that forces our anti-terror investigators to wonder if the tools they need to do their job will still be available tomorrow."
   The Patriot Act was initially enacted shortly after 9/11 and was intended to give intelligence agencies and law enforcement enhanced tools to gather information to prevent terrorism. When it expired at the end of 2005, Congress was forced to resort to a temporary extension, as Members failed to agree on revisions. The temporary extension is set to expire on March 10, 2006.
   A key provision of H.R. 3199 also combats methamphetamine production by imposing restrictions on the retail and whole sale of chemicals used to produce this destructive substance. Many components used for methamphetamine production can currently be purchased on an unlimited scale in retail outlets.
   "I also welcome the anti-methamphetamine provision in this bill, and believe this is a good step toward fighting the drug production scourge that has spread to many parts of our country," said Kyl. "For this provision to have significant impact however, it must now be coupled with a comprehensive border security strategy, as a large majority of crystal methamphetamine sold in the United States is trafficked into the country across our southern border."
