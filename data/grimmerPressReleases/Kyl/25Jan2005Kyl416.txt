SENS. MCCAIN, KYL REINTRODUCE YAVAPAI LAND EXCHANGE LEGISLATION, LOOK FORWARD TO QUICK PASSAGE
  Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl reintroduced the Northern Arizona Forest Lands Exchange and Verde River Basin Partnership Act of 2005 today.  
 The compromise, which passed in the Senate at the end of the last session, provides a sound framework for the exchange of 50,000 acres of private and public land in Northern Arizona. A companion bill will be introduced by Rep. Renzi this week in the House. 
   The land swap, commonly known as the "Yavapai land exchange," consolidates the largest remaining checkerboard ownership in the state; improves the management of forest lands and conservation of natural resources; as well as provides communities with an opportunity to acquire land needed for economic development, community services, and open space. 
   The bill also addresses the water issues raised by the exchange of lands located within the Verde River Basin watershed by limiting water usage on certain exchanged lands. In addition, it supports the development of a collaborative, science-based water resource planning and management entity for the Verde River Basin watershed. 
   "I look forward to the expeditious passage of this compromise bill which is both balanced and foresighted in addressing land use and water issues in Northern Arizona." McCain said, adding, "I am pleased that the legislation promotes sound management of limited water supplies while encouraging economic development in our great state." 
   Senator Kyl added, "There are few issues more important to the people of Arizona than water resources, forest fire control and sound land management, This land exchange is a unique opportunity to protect our natural resources, accommodate the state's tremendous growth and plan for the future."
