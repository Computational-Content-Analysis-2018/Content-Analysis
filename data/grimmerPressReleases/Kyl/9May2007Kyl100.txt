SENATE-HOUSE GOP LEADERS ACCEPT PETITION FROM SERVICE MEMBERS URGING CONGRESS TO SUPPORT MISSION IN IRAQ
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today joined Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and a group of House and Senate members in accepting a petition from 2,700 U.S. service members urging Congress to support the mission in Iraq and end calls for retreat.  
   The petition, entitled "Appeal for Courage," was started by two U.S. service members in February. Of the 2,700 signatures, 60 percent of the petition signers have previously served or are now serving in Iraq. 
   "As an American currently serving my nation in uniform, I respectfully urge my political leaders in Congress to fully support our mission in Iraq and halt any calls for retreat," the letter states. "I also respectfully urge my political leaders to actively oppose media efforts which embolden my enemy while demoralizing American support at home. The war in Iraq is a necessary and just effort to bring freedom to the Middle East and protect America from further attack." 
   "I am honored to join with my Senate and House colleagues in accepting this petition from our U.S. service members," said Kyl. "I think this petition highlights the need for the leaders in Washington to support our troops fighting overseas, instead of playing politics with the resources our forces need to complete their mission." 
   The petition was presented by Bob Wallace, Executive Director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, on behalf of the petition's organizers. 
   U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), along with House Republican Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio), House Conference Chair Adam Putnam (R-Fla.), and Chief Deputy Whip Eric Cantor (R-Va.) were also in attendance to receive the petition.
