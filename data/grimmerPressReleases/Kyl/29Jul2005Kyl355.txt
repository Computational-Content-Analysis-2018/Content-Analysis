   "As wildfires tear across many parts of Arizona, we're particularly grateful for the more than $2.5 billion in the bill for wildland fire management," Kyl said. That total includes $767 million for the Bureau of Land Management, $1.7 billion for the Forest Service, $497 million for hazardous fuels reduction, $10 million for Rural Fire Assistance, $67 million for State Fire Assistance and $14 million for Volunteer Fire Assistance.

   * Grants to expand wastewater treatment plants in Lake Havasu City and Avondale ($1.5 million each).

   * $800,000 for the City of Safford wastewater plant's debt repayment.

   Before passage of the Senate version of the bill, Kyl was one of 17 Senators who supported an amendment to provide additional funding for diabetes and alcohol treatment through the Indian Health Service (it was defeated). 
   The $26.3 billion bill also includes $1.5 billion to meet shortfalls at the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as nearly $200 million for various national land and water conservation projects and $2.3 billion for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which will support Tribally Controlled Community Colleges, other education grants and law enforcement.
