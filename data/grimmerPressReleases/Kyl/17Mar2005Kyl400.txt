SENS. KYL, FEINSTEIN RESOLUTION CALLS FOR FULL STATE CRIMINAL ALIEN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FUNDING
  Sen. Jon Kyl today helped win passage of a "Sense of the Senate" resolution by which the Senate calls for $750 million in FY 2006 funding to reimburse state and local governments for costs related to incarcerating criminal aliens, and urges long-term reauthorization of the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP).  
   "Criminal aliens are a federal responsibility and the cost of incarcerating them should not be borne entirely by state and local governments that happen to be on or near the border," Kyl said. "It's an unfunded mandate that isn't just unfair, it drains resources from our ability to provide basic law enforcement protection to our citizens." 
   SCAAP has never been fully funded at its authorized level; at its height of $573 million in the late 1990s state and local governments only received reimbursement of 33 cents on the dollar. For FY 2005, Congress appropriated only $305 million for SCAAP, and President Bush's FY 2006 budget zeroes out the program entirely. 
   The State of Arizona spends at least $300 million each year to house criminal aliens - almost $54.00 per inmate per day - but is reimbursed for only around $17.00. In the jails of Santa Cruz, Cochise and Pinal counties, about a fifth of inmates are illegal aliens. SCAAP Awards for Arizona rose from $18 million in 2000 to $24 million in 2002 but by last year had declined to just over $9 million. 
   Separately Thursday, a bill also co-sponsored by Kyl and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) for long-term SCAAP reauthorization passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by unanimous consent.
