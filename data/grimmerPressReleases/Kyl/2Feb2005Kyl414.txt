SEN. KYL ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR GONZALES' NOMINATION
  Sen. Jon Kyl today announced his support for Alberto Gonzales' nomination to serve as United States Attorney General.  
   "It would be hard to find a more compelling example of the American dream than Alberto Gonzales," Kyl said, "a son of migrant workers who grew up with seven siblings in a two-bedroom house in the town of Humble, Texas, and was the first person in his family to go to college. From there he rocketed through Harvard Law School, partnership in a prestigious firm in Houston, and the highest levels of Texas' and now the federal government." 
   Gonzales is now poised to become the first Latino to serve as a cabinet secretary for what Henry Cisneros has referred to as the "big four" departments: State, Defense, Treasury and Justice. "Of all these key positions, it is probably the most important to have an Attorney General who understands the framework of legal rights for all Americans," Kyl said. "Judge Gonzales's endorsements span the political spectrum, from the Fraternal Order of Police to the League of United Latin American Citizens. He is a credit to his people, his home state of Texas, and the nation he has served in so many ways."
