SCAAP FUNDING RISES TO $405 MILLION, ALONG WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES
 Sen. Jon Kyl today announced that the final conference report on the Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill for FY 2006 includes $405 million for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), which reimburses states for costs related to incarceration of criminal aliens.  
   The $100 million SCAAP increase over the previous year is the result of efforts, led by Kyl, of border state legislators to educate their colleagues about the high cost to state and local governments of incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens. (Arizona's allocation has yet to be determined.) It falls short, however, of the $750 million the Senate approved in March in Kyl-sponsored authorizing legislation. 
   "The increase for next year will be helpful, but I'm disappointed it wasn't more, particularly since the Senate is on the record acknowledging that the need is so much greater," Kyl said. "Immigration policy and controlling our borders are, for the most part, federal responsibilities, and the federal government has not lived up to them. The result is that state and local jails and prisons, particularly in states like Arizona, must bear the heavy cost of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens. They deserve more reimbursement than this." For fiscal years 2003 and 2004, Arizona state prisons incarcerated 4,743 criminal aliens at a total cost of more than $71 million but received only $9 million in SCAAP funding. This year, the Arizona Department of Corrections estimates that its 4,220 criminal alien inmates will cost $84 million, of which the state will be reimbursed barely 10 percent. 
   Also in the conference report are a number of Kyl-sponsored items: 
   * $30 million for the Kyl-sponsored Southwest Border Prosecutor Initiative, to reimburse State, county, parish, tribal, and municipal governments for costs associated with the prosecution of criminal cases declined by local United States Attorneys' offices; 
   * $14 million for law enforcement technologies and interoperable communications, including $200,000 for programs in Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa and Chandler, and Maricopa County; 
   * $64 million for policing initiatives to combat methamphetamine production and trafficking and to enhance policing initiatives in "drug hot spots," including $250,000 for programs in the city of Tucson. 
   * $15 million for Tribal law enforcement, and $9 million for the Tribal Prison Construction Program; 
   * $2 million for victims' rights program support under the Justice for All Act, of which Kyl was the primary sponsor; and 
   * Funding for an update to a study first sponsored by Sen. Kyl in 1998, conducted by the University of Arizona, of the other-than-incarceration costs of processing of criminal illegal aliens, such as court and prosecution expenses.
