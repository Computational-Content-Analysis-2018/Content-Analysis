SEN. KYL CHAMPIONS DEATH TAX ELIMINATION
  Sen. Jon Kyl today issued the following statement regarding the announcement by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist that death tax legislation has been scheduled for Senate consideration in May: 
   "Senator Frist and I have consulted about the need to set a date for the Senate to take permanent action on the death tax; and to fully support his initiative to schedule consideration of death tax legislation for May. American families and family-owned businesses must deal with the overwhelming emotional pains and financial agonies that come from the loss of a loved one. The government then asks these troubled families to once again pay taxes at confiscatory rates, for assets that were already taxed when they were earned--this is simply wrong at the most fundamental level.
   "The death tax is also detrimental to our economy, as it forces businesses to have to pay taxes to the government rather than investing in business growth--even worse, many businesses are forced to sell off the business to pay for the resulting death taxes. We have a responsibility to do whatever is necessary to bring a permanent end to the excessive burden of this tax as soon as we can.
   "If an opportunity to deal with the death tax comes before May, we retain the option of taking it up then.
   "A majority of Senators support permanent repeal of the tax. The will of the majority should prevail. But, if we must deal with a filibuster to get permanent relief, we will be prepared to get the votes to do so. Americans do not want to wait any longer for permanent relief from this unfair tax."
