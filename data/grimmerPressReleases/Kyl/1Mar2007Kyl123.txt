SEN. KYL WILL WORK TO REPAIR MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FORMULA
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today issued the following statement following the release of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) report on overhauling the way physicians are reimbursed for providing Medicare services:  
   "I welcome the recommendations from MedPAC and I look forward to thoroughly evaluating each proposal. Medicare in its current form relies on an outdated payment formula that doesn't take into account the rising costs of treating patients. Congress must find a long-term solution instead of acting every year to correct the shortfalls resulting from this antiquated formula. 
   "A critical part of ensuring that seniors receive quality health services though Medicare involves retaining quality physicians in the program. And to retain quality doctors, the federal government has to reimburse Medicare physicians adequately for providing services. While I will seek a solution to avert the scheduled reduction of payments to Medicare physicians this year, I will also work to develop a permanent formula that will take into account all factors involved with providing quality health-care services to seniors."
