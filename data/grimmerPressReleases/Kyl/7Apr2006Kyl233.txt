SEN. KYL WILL NOT SUPPORT PROPOSED 'COMPROMISE'
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today voted with the majority of the U.S. Senate not to cut off debate on the immigration reform bill in order to allow amendments to be brought forward and voted on. 
   "I have several amendments, including one that's been pending for more than a week that would bar criminals from receiving the benefits of this bill," said Kyl, "but I have been denied the opportunity to have a vote on these amendments. Until there is a chance for Senators to propose their ideas, and there is a thorough and thoughtful deliberation on amendments, I will continue to oppose cutting off debate on this critically important piece of legislation."
   The Senate Minority has obstructed having votes on amendments to the immigration reform bill, bringing work on the legislation to a standstill. A proposed compromise was also offered by a group of Senators on Wednesday evening.
   "Though I appreciate the intentions of the drafters of the proposed 'compromise,'" said Kyl, "I do not support it because it makes only a minor change in the underlying bill and would still guarantee an automatic pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants; it would just take one group a little longer than the rest."
   The proposal by Sens. Mel Martinez (R-FL) and Chuck Hagel (R-NE), would separate illegal immigrants into groups depending on the length of time they have resided illegally in the country. Based upon the length of stay, one group would be immediately placed on a legal path to citizenship, while the other group could get on a legal path to citizenship after going to a land port of entry (presumably in Mexico) and reentering the U.S.
