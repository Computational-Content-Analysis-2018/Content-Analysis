SEN. KYL APPLAUDS SENATE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO
  Sen. Jon Kyl today praised the Senate's vote to confirm Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, calling Alito well-suited and highly qualified to serve on the Court. 
   "I am pleased with today's confirmation of Sam Alito to the Supreme Court and I congratulate him and his family," said Kyl. "The nation is well-served when people of Sam Alito's caliber are willing to endure the grueling confirmation process in order to answer the call to public service."
   Kyl noted that Judge Alito has more judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years. As a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Alito participated in the deciding of more than 4,500 cases and authored more than 360 opinions. The American Bar Association, long considered by Senate Democrats to be the gold standard to assess a judicial nominee's qualifications, rated Alito unanimously well qualified.
   "More than anything, I believe that it was his tremendous command of the law and impeccable credentials which earned him the support of a majority of Senators today," added Kyl. "I'm confident that Judge Alito will continue to demonstrate the same qualities as a Justice that he has throughout his career on the appellate court and during the confirmation process."
