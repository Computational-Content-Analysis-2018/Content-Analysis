SEN. KYL COMMENDS EPA DECISION TO EXTEND SUMMER-BLEND GAS WAIVER
  Sen. Jon Kyl today announced that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Steve Johnson has granted an extension of the waiver of the specific volatility requirement for "summer-blend" gasoline through September 30 for Arizona, which uses the summer blend through the end of the month because of high temperatures. 
   Kyl had written to the Administrator on September 9 urging the extension, saying "Anything we can do to ease supply restrictions would help put downward pressure on those prices."
