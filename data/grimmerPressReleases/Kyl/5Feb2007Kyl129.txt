SEN. KYL CALLS ON DEMOCRATS TO ALLOW OPEN DEBATE ON IRAQ RESOLUTIONS
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today called on Senate Democratic leadership to allow debate dealing with the Iraq Senate resolutions.  
   "Senate Republicans are ready to proceed with a full and open debate on the President's strategy in Iraq. But we want a full debate on all the various resolutions, not just one that was handpicked by the Democratic leadership. 
   "Everyone knows that there are three competing resolutions, and in the world's greatest deliberative body, we ought to have debate and votes on all three. Republicans are prepared to have this debate and to vote on all three by the end of this week." 
   The Senate today voted to invoke cloture on a resolution introduced by Senators John Warner (R-VA) and Carl Levin (D-MI), which criticizes the troop increases and new strategy proposed by the President. Democrats failed to garner the necessary votes to proceed with its consideration. 
   The two pending bipartisan resolutions that the Democratic leadership has refused to allow debate on include a resolution drafted by Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.), which sets benchmarks for the Iraqi government to achieve. Senator Judd Gregg (R-NH) has also introduced a resolution which states that the Senate will not cut off funding for U.S. troops.
