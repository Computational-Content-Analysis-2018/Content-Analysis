SEN. KYL: SEN. LOTT A TRUE MASTER OF THE SENATE
  U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today released the following statement after Senator Trent Lott (R-Miss.) announced that he will retire from the Senate:  
   "I have been privileged to spend much of my career serving with Trent, first in the House of Representatives and then in the Senate. His friendship and his leadership have meant a great deal to me, and I know I speak for many when I say that it is difficult to imagine the Congress without him. 
   "Few Senators in the history of this nation can match Trent's remarkable understanding of this institution. He is a true master of the Senate. 
   "Caryll and I wish Trent and Tricia all the best - they deserve it."
