SEN. KYL CRITICIZES HIGHWAY BILL
  Sen. Jon Kyl criticized the highway bill passed by the Senate today, calling the legislation "fiscally irresponsible and a bad deal for Arizona."  
   At $295 billion, the bill faces a potential White House veto. In March, the House passed a $284 billion bill, corresponding to President Bush's stated maximum acceptable sum, itself an increase of $73 billion (35 percent) from the amount provided in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the six-year bill enacted in 1998. 
   Arizona would receive 91 cents back for every dollar it sends to Washington in taxes under the bill's formulation, continuing a long-term trend of inequitable transportation funding in comparison with other states. Sen. John McCain and Sen. Kyl both voted against the bill.
