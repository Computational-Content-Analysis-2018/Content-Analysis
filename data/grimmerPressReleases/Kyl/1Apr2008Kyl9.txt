SEN. KYL CALLS FOR 18-MONTH EXTENSION OF MEDICARE PHYSICIAN PAYMENT
  Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl (Ariz.) today called on Congress to approve an 18-month extension of payment reimbursements for physicians who provide Medicare services. The following are excerpts from remarks he delivered at the National Advocacy Conference hosted by the American Medical Association (AMA): 
   "Congress has three months to come up with a solution or a significant payment reduction goes into effect beginning July 1. Unless Congress acts, Medicare physician payments will be cut by 10.6 percent for the last half of 2008 and by 15.4 percent for 2009. Over the long term, the situation worsens. The AMA estimates that reductions in Medicare physician payment will total 40 percent from 2008 to 2018."
   "Medicare physician payment reform is one of my highest health care priorities. Just as I did last year, I will work to ensure that it is a priority this year and that we avert scheduled payment reductions."
   "Even in a difficult fiscal environment, I support an 18-month, positive physician payment update. Let me be clear - physician payment updates are not the problem. We can pass an 18-month extenders package, similar to last year, with fairly uncontroversial offsets."
   "The problem is the potential for additional spending. Some may want to pursue a 6-month or a 12-month package in order to satisfy non-extender spending priorities. I do not support such a strategy. Our end goal must be long-term payment reform.
   "An 18-month package provides Congress with the best opportunity to consider long-term solutions without having to stop and address short-term cuts. However, the only way we will be successful is if we work together. It is the right thing to do for patients, for physicians, for everyone."
