SEN. KYL LAUDS SENATE MOVE TO EQUALIZE BENEFITS FOR SURVIVORS OF MILITARY RETIREES
  Sen. Jon Kyl today hailed Senate passage of an amendment to the FY 2006 National Defense Authorization Act that will eliminate two significant inequities in the benefits for survivors of 100% disabled military retirees and servicemembers killed on active duty.  
   "Other than supporting our service members themselves, it's hard to think of a higher priority than supporting their families," Kyl said. 
   Passed late Tuesday with Kyl's support, the amendment eliminates the offset against the annuities paid by the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for the amount that a military retiree's survivors might be entitled to in payments from the Veterans Administration's Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) program. It also moves the effective date of "paid-up" SBP status to October 1, 2005. 
   Under existing law, the SBP annuity payments are reduced to offset benefits from the DIC. Surviving spouses of 100% disabled military retirees have asked Congress to recognize that the DIC benefit should supplement the SBP income to which their payments entitle them. 
   Similarly, military retirees who are 70 years of age and have paid SBP premiums for at least 30 years have been authorized by Congress to stop paying premiums and retain coverage for their survivors. Unfortunately, the effective date of this change had been October 1, 2008, creating an extraordinary disadvantage to the earliest SBP enrollees, who would have to pay up to 36 years of premiums to receive similar coverage for themselves and their survivors. 
   "Many veterans have told me that no open-market annuity plan would cancel its benefits based on the receipt of another benefit like SBP for our military retirees," Kyl said. "And I agree that it is unfair to force a set of retirees to pay into SBP well beyond the 30 year limit."
