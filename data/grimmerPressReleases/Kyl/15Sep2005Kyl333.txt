SEN. KYL COSPONSORS AMENDMENT ON UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS CRIMES
  Sen. Kyl today announced that he cosponsored the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act as an amendment to the Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill, which passed today. 
   The amendment creates a special section within the Justice Department for prosecuting pre-1970s civil rights-related murders that violated federal civil rights laws. 
   "Justice delayed has been justice denied for many of the victims of the civil rights era whose murders remain unresolved," Kyl said. "Now these cases can be opened anew."
