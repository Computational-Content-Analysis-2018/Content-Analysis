SEN. KYL INTRODUCES AMENDMENT TO FREEZE SENATE PAY RAISE
  Sen. Jon Kyl today introduced an amendment that would freeze the Senate's 1.9 percent projected cost-of-living pay increase for FY 2006, saying Congress should demonstrate leadership by "sharing in the national belt-tightening required by hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the war in Iraq."  
   "Congress is rightfully searching for ways to rein in spending across the federal government," Kyl said. "It's hard to argue that this process shouldn't include our own salaries, even if the amount saved is mostly symbolic." 
   Kyl's amendment, offered to the Transportation, Treasury, HUD, Judiciary and District of Columbia Appropriations Act (H.R. 3058), would save the federal treasury approximately $2 million. Congress hopes to find at least $50 billion in savings to offset Katrina-related spending alone.
