SEN. KYL, SENATE REJECT CALLS FOR ARBITRARY WITHDRAWAL TIMELINES
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), along with a majority of the U.S. Senate, today rejected amendments that would set arbitrary withdrawal timelines in Iraq.  
   Two amendments were offered to S. 2766, the Defense Authorization bill, that set or called for a timeline for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. A proposal introduced by Sen. John Kerry (D-MA), would force the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq by July 31, 2007. The other amendment was introduced by Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI), which called on the President to set a timeline for troop withdrawal, but left vague a target date and defined no criteria for determining a pull out. 
   "Setting arbitrary timelines for withdrawal of our troops before we have finished the job sends a devastating message to our troops and allies, and gives the enemy a strategic advantage in this war," said Kyl. "The recent death of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi and the progress in establishing the Iraqi government are both testaments to the progress being made there. But our work in Iraq is far from over, and we must now capitalize on this momentum by recommitting ourselves to victory there - not cut and run when things get tough. 
   "No one wants this war to go any longer than it needs to. But we must do whatever is necessary based on the advice and counsel from our military leaders in Iraq. 
   "We have the finest military in the world, and each and every American should be proud of the job our fighting men and women are doing under grueling circumstances in Iraq. Our troops need our support now more than ever. Leaving now would only dishonor their sacrifice." 
   Both the Kerry and Levin measures were overwhelmingly rejected by the Senate.
