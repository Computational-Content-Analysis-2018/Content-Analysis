SEN. KYL: ARIZONA'S FORESTS NEED IMMEDIATE HELP TO COMBAT FIRES
  Sen. Jon Kyl today attended a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests to stress the dire condition of Arizona's forests and the desperate need for more funding and resources to prevent and fight fires. Kyl reaffirmed his request for the Forest Service to immediately direct more assistance to Arizona and the Southwest. 
   "The Southwest is seeing its driest winter on record," said Kyl. "Wildfire season, which typically begins in May, has already started. Arizona could face the longest and most costly fire season in state history."
   Kyl addressed his comments to the committee members and Mark Rey, U.S. Department of Agriculture Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, who was there to testify about the development of interim and long-term plans for use of fire retardant aircraft in Federal wildfire suppression operations.
   Yesterday, Kyl sent a letter to Mr. Rey outlining his concerns and request for additional assistance. In the letter, Kyl specifically asked that the administration accelerate NEPA-ready forest thinning projects in Arizona and make available now the necessary firefighting assets needed to combat wildfires this season.
   Mr. Rey told Kyl that $1.25 million in severity funds have already been sent to Arizona this month. Kyl welcomed the news that such severity funds are being directed to the state, but notes that "it only amounts to a drop in the bucket of what is really going to be needed. Already, the cost of the 'February" fire is estimated to be over $3 million" A copy of Kyl's letter to Mr. Rey can be obtained through the Kyl press office.
