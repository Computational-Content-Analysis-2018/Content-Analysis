SEN. KYL APPLAUDS NOMINATION OF JUDGE MUKASEY FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL
  U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today issued the following statement on the president's nomination of Michael Mukasey to be attorney general:  
   "I applaud the president's choice for attorney general. Michael Mukasey built a distinguished record of public service during his four years as a federal prosecutor and his more than 18 years as a federal district court judge. His knowledge of the legal system, his commitment to justice, and his consummate fairness and integrity won him the respect of his colleagues and observers of the courts. These qualities, combined with his extensive experience in national security and terrorism cases, make him an ideal candidate for attorney general. He will bring honor to the post and ensure that the Department of Justice remains dedicated to upholding the rule of law and ensuring the 'fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.' 
   "Since the Carter administration, attorney general nominees have been confirmed, on average, in approximately three weeks, with some being confirmed even more quickly. The Senate should immediately move to consider Judge Mukasey's nomination and ensure he is confirmed before Congress recesses for Columbus Day."
