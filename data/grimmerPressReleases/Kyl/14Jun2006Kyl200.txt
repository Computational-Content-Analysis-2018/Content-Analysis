SEN. KYL INTRODUCES BILL TO FIGHT INTERNET CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz) late Tuesday introduced S. 3499, the Stop Adults' Facilitation the Exploitation of Youth Act, or Internet SAFETY Act, which is intended to fight the rise of child pornography on the Internet.  
   The Internet SAFETY Act cracks down on Internet child pornography and related conduct by: creating new federal offenses targeted at those who produce it or knowingly facilitate its transmission; increasing penalties for child pornography, sex trafficking, and sexual abuse offenses; and increasing resources for prosecution and prevention of child sexual-abuse offenses. 
   "The increase in Internet use has given sexual predators new ways to prey on children," said Kyl. "This bill, among other things, is intended to shut down these opportunities, and severely punish the degraded individuals who are involved in the sexual exploitation of our youth." 
   A May 2006 report by the U.S. Department of Justice estimates that in 2003, 20,000 images of child pornography were posted on the Internet every week. Between 1998 and 2004, child-pornography reports made to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children increased from 3,267 to 106,119 - a 30-fold increase over a six-year period. The Justice Department also notes that the severity of abuse depicted in child pornography has escalated in recent years, "with the images found today more frequently involving younger children - including toddlers and even infants." 
   The report concludes that "the nation should be alarmed at the fact that child pornography is being produced, possessed, and distributed in record numbers."
