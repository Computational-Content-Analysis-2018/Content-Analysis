SEN. KYL PRAISES FORMER UTAH GOVERNOR LEAVITT SELECTION TO HEAD HHS
  Sen. Jon Kyl today applauded President Bush's selection of former Utah Governor Mike Leavitt to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services, calling Leavitt a "results-oriented leader."  
   "Mike Leavitt is a good man and a strong asset to the Bush Administration," Kyl said. "Under his administration, Utah was named one of the best-managed of America's state governments, and he's demonstrated results-oriented leadership on a wide range of issues from diesel pollution to welfare reform. This kind of background makes him well suited to the massive responsibility of running an agency like the Department of Health and Human Services."
