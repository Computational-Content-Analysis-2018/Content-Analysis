SEN. KYL INTRODUCES AMENDMENT TO MODIFY CLEAN WATER FUNDING FORMULA
  Sen. Jon Kyl today introduced an amendment to the Senate Interior Appropriations Bill that would fix the existing state funding inequity in the EPA-administered Clean Water Act State Revolving Fund - the primary federal mechanism for financing clean water and wastewater infrastructure projects nationwide.  
   The current State SRF formula allocates funds to states based on fixed percentages that were set in the Clean Water Act in 1987 and bears no relationship to the actual clean water needs documented by states and reported to EPA. Despite the fact that Arizona certifies nearly $6.3 billion in clean water infrastructure needs, ranking 10th for needs by state, Arizona ranks dead last in the percentage of documented needs met under the current formula. 
   "Arizona's fund is not receiving its fair share from the federal government and that is wrong. Under my amendment, funding would be allocated to states on the basis of actual need. As a result, Arizona would receive five times more than it currently receives," said Kyl. 
   The needs-based approach proposed in Kyl's amendment uses the successful Drinking Water Fund formula as precedent. Correcting the funding discrepancy will allow states to provide more funding to help cities and towns to defray the costs of wastewater treatment improvements to comply with the basic requirements of the Clean Water Act. 
   "The current formula is flawed and should be replaced with one that treats states fairly. It's important that we do this to have the necessary infrastructure to provide clean water to every Arizonan," Kyl added.
