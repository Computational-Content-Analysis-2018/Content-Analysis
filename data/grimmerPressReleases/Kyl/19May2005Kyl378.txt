SENS. KYL, STABENOW INTRODUCE BILL TO UPDATE MEDICARE PHYSICIAN PAYMENT SCHEDULE
  Sen. Jon Kyl today joined with Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) to introduce legislation that would provide a two-year update to the Medicare physician payment schedule.  
   The "Preserving Patient Access to Physicians Act of 2005" relies on recommendations from the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPac), specifying a 2.7 percent increase in 2006. In 2007 the increase would be based on the Medicare Economic Index for Input Price Changes and Productivity Increases; based on current assumptions, it is likely to be about 2.6 percent. MedPac has repeatedly urged the Bush Administration and its predecessors to develop a long-term formula for physician payments, which are now tied to the nation's Gross Domestic Product and thus fluctuate unpredictably. "Although Senator Stabenow and I share MedPAC's concerns about the payment formula and its flaws as a volume control mechanism, this bill does not permanently repeal the formula or propose a permanent new mechanism to calculate physician payment. Such a broader solution will be neither easy nor quick and requires the attention of the full Senate," Kyl said. 
   The Kyl-Stabenow bill has not yet been scored by the Congressional Budget Office, but estimates for its cost range from $25 billion to $35 billion over 5 years.
