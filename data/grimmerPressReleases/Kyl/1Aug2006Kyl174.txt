SEN. KYL, SENATE APPROVE GULF OF MEXICO ENERGY SECURITY ACT
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today joined fellow Senators in approving S. 3711, The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act - bipartisan legislation that will open parts of the Gulf of Mexico to new energy exploration and development, resulting in greater domestic supplies, reduced dependence on foreign oil, and in turn lead to lower prices for consumers at the pump.  
   "At a time when Americans face record-high energy costs due to high consumer demand and supply problems, it makes sense for Congress to look for ways to encourage greater energy production," said Kyl. 
   The bill opens new federally controlled areas in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas leasing by energy producers, and would make available to U.S. consumers an additional 1.26 billion barrels of domestically produced oil and 5.83 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. 
   "The act is a necessary step in securing American oil and natural gas for American energy consumers," said Kyl. "It will start to address the root cause of high prices - demand outpacing supply." 
   A similar bill was passed by the House of Representatives on June 29. A conference committee must reconcile differences between the two versions before a final version is sent to President for his signature.
