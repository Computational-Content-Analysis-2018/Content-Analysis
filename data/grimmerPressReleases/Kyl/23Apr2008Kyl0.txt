SEN. KYL ISSUES STATEMENT ON MILITARY SELECTIONS
  Multi-National Force Iraq Commanding General David Petraeus was today selected to become head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno was selected to replace Petraeus in Iraq. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) released the following statement:  
   "The last time I was in Iraq I met with both General Petraeus and General Odierno, and I applaud the Defense Secretary's selection of such fine men to lead our forces. General Petraeus and General Odierno implemented the current strategy in Iraq that has given our forces the forward momentum there, and I am certain that General Odierno will continue that progress. 
   "I am confident that General Petraeus will use his new role at CENTCOM to continue supporting progress in Iraq, while helping to strengthen our efforts with our allies in Afghanistan. I am also confident that General Petraeus will address the growing threat Iran poses in the Middle East. I will work with my Senate colleagues for the swift confirmations of both Generals."
