SEN. KYL BACKS EFFORTS TO REIN IN FEDERAL SPENDING
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz) today will join Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg (R-NH) to introduce the Stop Over-Spending (SOS) Act of 2006, which is designed to rein in federal spending, reduce the deficit, and regain control of the federal budget process.  
   "Although the government is currently seeing record amounts of tax revenue as a result of Republican pro-growth tax policies, we still must govern in a fiscally-sound way, and curb out-of-control spending that threatens the health of our economic future," said Kyl. 
   The SOS Act provides: a line-item veto process that allows the President to identify wasteful pork-barrel spending, ask that it be rescinded, and return it to Congress for expedited consideration; a new mechanism to balance the budget by 2012; reinstates statutory caps on discretionary spending; the formation of two new bi-partisan commissions, one to study the accountability and efficiency of government programs, and the other to examine and provide solutions to the impending entitlement crisis. 
   "Clearly, American taxpayers cannot be asked to send more of their hard-earned dollars to Washington than they already are sending, said Kyl. "Congress must make the necessary decisions now to bring entitlement spending under control. The SOS Act will provide for automatic sequestration if Congress fails to take necessary steps through the legislative process. It will provide meaningful tools to reign in both mandatory and discretionary government spending." 
   Entitlement spending, excluding interest on the debt, now represents 56 percent of all federal spending. Left unchecked, that will grow to more than 62 percent in 10 years. This path is unsustainable, and no amount of tax increases - setting aside their damaging effect on the economy - could make up the difference.
