SEN. KYL APPLAUDS SENATE APPROVAL OF CHANGE FOR YUMA CROSSING AREA
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) applauded today's passage by the Senate of H.R. 326, the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area Boundary Adjustment Act, which modifies the boundaries of the Yuma Crossing Heritage Area. Sen. Kyl introduced its Senate companion (S. 505).  
   "It's good news for Yuma." said Senator Kyl. "This is a non-controversial, straightforward modification that will alleviate any concerns that the Heritage Area designation would affect private property rights." The act amends the legislation passed in 2000 to adjust the boundary of the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area to conform to the lines set forth in the Heritage Area Management Plan approved by the Secretary of the Interior in 2002. 
   The Yuma Crossing Heritage Area was designated in October 2000, the product of a preliminary concept plan completed in 1999 by the Heritage Area Task Force. The boundaries proposed in that plan included approximately 22 square miles, extending from the Colorado River on the north and west to the Avenue 7E alignment on the east and the 12th street alignment on the south. 
   "The boundaries represented the task force's 'best guess' at the time as to the cultural landscape warranting inclusion in the heritage area," Senator Kyl said. "During the development of the final Heritage Area Management Plan, it became apparent that the boundaries were too large and should be more concentrated along the Colorado River and in historic downtown. Rather than simply leave the boundaries as they were set in the 2000 legislation, the community in Yuma expressed that it was important to conform the boundaries to those in the agreed-upon Management Plan." 
   The bill passed the House earlier this year and it will now be sent to the President for his signature.
