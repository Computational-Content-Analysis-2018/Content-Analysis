SEN. KYL, SENATE EXTEND RELIEF FOR AMERICAN TAXPAYERS
  Continuing his efforts to promote pro-growth tax policies, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight, today voted to approve a bill that extends relief for the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and lower rates for dividends and capital gains. H.R. 4297, the Tax Increase Prevention and Extension Reconciliation Act of 2005, passed the Senate 54 to 44. 
   "The bill provides real, meaningful relief for American taxpayer families and small businesses," said Kyl. "Extending these tax policies is necessary to sustain our growing economy."
   As a conferee on the tax bill, Kyl played a key role in securing the extensions for lower rates on capital gains and dividends, and the Alternative Minimum Tax patch.
   Since the initial implementation of the tax relief initiatives in August 2003, the U.S economy has created nearly 5.3 million jobs, experienced 32 consecutive months of job growth, and enjoys the nation's lowest unemployment averages in over forty years. The U.S. Treasury is also bringing in record level revenues, with the nation's gross domestic product growing at a rate faster than any industrialized nation in the world.
   Government estimators had predicted that the reduction in capital gains tax rates enacted in 2003 would cost the federal government $27 billion in lost revenues for 2004, but the Congressional Budget Office now reports that the lower rates actually brought in an additional $26 billion in revenue.
   "I'll continue to pursue ways to make permanent these and other tax policies that have contributed to the growth and strength of our economy today."
   The bill was approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday and will now be sent to the President for his signature.
