SEN. KYL PRAISES ARIZONA WATER PROJECT FUNDING IN APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Jon Kyl applauded the Energy & Water Appropriations bill passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee today, calling it "a big vindication of our efforts to restore riparian habitat, improve flood control and increase public recreation opportunities."  
   The bill, which now heads to the Senate floor, includes the following Kyl-requested provisions, among others: 
   Bureau of Reclamation, Department of the Interior 
   * $1.5 million to restore the riparian habitat of the Colorado River in Yuma's East Wetlands. 
   * $300,000 for a salinity study of central Arizona 
   * $250,000 for a management study of the West Salt River
   Army Corps of Engineers 
   * $4.5 for wash and tributary flood control in Nogales, to prevent flood damage and promote recreation to accommodate population growth 
   * $4 million for Rio de Flag flood control, in response to concerns that a large flood could displace nearly half of Flagstaff's more than 60,000 residents, threatening Northern Arizona University and parts of the city's historic downtown. 
   * $8 million for a longtime riparian habitat and nature trail program in the Rio Salado, Phoenix and Tempe reaches that has brought back significant avian wildlife 
   * $5 million for the Tucson Drainage Area 
   * $6 million for a riparian habitat program in at the Tres Rios project using treated wastewater 
   * Additional management funding to monitor downstream riparian habitat from the Alamo Dam 
   * $400,000 for the Va Shly'Ay Akimel project restoring Salt River riparian habitat.
   "This money represents an important investment in Arizona's future," Kyl said. "Life in the desert is all about water, and these projects demonstrate our commitment to sound management of this precious resource."
