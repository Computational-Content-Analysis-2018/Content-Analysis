SENATE PASSES WATER RESOURCES BILL THAT AUTHORIZES SEVERAL SEN. KYL-SUPPORTED PROJECTS FOR ARIZONA
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) announced that late Wednesday the Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act of 2006 - a bill that has several items of interest for Arizona, including funding authorizations for several flood-control and ecosystem restoration projects.  
   "In addition to the environmental benefits, these projects will provide protection for the welfare and safety of people and property in the affected areas," said Kyl. 
   THE FOLLOWING ARIZONA PROJECTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE BILL: 
   * Tanque Verde Creek Project (Pima County): $3.7 million (federal cost share) for the Tanque Verde Creek Project, which incorporates vital flood control bank protection and habitat restoration in and around Tucson. 
   * Salt River, Va Shlyay Akimel (Maricopa County): $101.6 million (federal cost share) for the Va Shlyay Akimel project, which provides environmental restoration to severely degraded and lost riparian habitat along the Salt River. 
   * Rillito River (Pima County): $48.4 million (federal cost share) for ecosystem restoration, recreation and incidental flood-damage reduction along the Rillito River near Tucson. 
   * Paseo De Las Iglesias - Santa Cruz River (Pima County): $61.2 million (federal cost share) for Paseo De Las Iglesias, which provides flood control and environmental restoration of the Santa Cruz River through downtown Tucson. 
   * Rio de Flag Flood Control Project (Flagstaff): The bill increases the authorization of the Rio de Flag flood-control project to a total cost of $54.1 million in order to reflect increased construction costs. The increased authorization will allow this important flood control project to move forward with construction. 
   The bill was approved on a voice vote. It must now be reconciled with a similar version (H.R. 2864) that was passed by the House of Representatives 401 to 14 on July 14, 2005.
