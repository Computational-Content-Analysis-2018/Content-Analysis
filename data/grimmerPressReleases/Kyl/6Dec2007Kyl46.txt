  The Senate Republican Conference today unanimously elected U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) to become the Assistant Senate Republican Leader. Kyl released the following statement after the vote:  
   "I am honored that my colleagues have placed their confidence in me to serve as the new Assistant Republican Leader. Trent Lott is a dear friend of mine, and although no one will be able to fill his shoes, I have learned a great deal from his leadership and hope to continue in that spirit. I look forward to working with the Republican Leader and the entire conference to meet the significant challenges we will face in the coming year."
