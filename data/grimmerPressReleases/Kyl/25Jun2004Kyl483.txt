SEN. KYL APPLAUDS LAUNCH OF UAV SURVEILLANCE ALONG ARIZONA BORDER
  Sen. Jon Kyl today praised the Department of Homeland Security's launch of a new program to use Hermes 450 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) along Arizona's southern border as part of the Arizona Border Control Initiative.  
   "We'll never have enough manpower to physically monitor the entire border of the United States," Kyl said. "Technology is the key to effectively safeguarding our homeland security. These UAVs are an effective way of expanding our overall field of vision, at a relatively low cost." The $2 million drones are particularly effective at monitoring remote border areas where patrols cannot easily travel, because they have the capacity to remain on station much longer than other aircraft. 
   Tucson Sector Border Patrol Chief Michael Nicley held a press conference Friday to announce the new program Fort Huachuca army base, southeast of Tucson. UAV operations will be controlled and monitored by U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Border Patrol. 
   It is estimated that at least 40 percent of the illegal immigrants who enter the United States cross the Arizona-Mexico border. The UAV program is one of many elements of the initiative, which is also slated to include other remote surveillance systems, 200 additional permanent Border Patrol agents and 60 temporary specially trained Border Patrol operations positions, tents for housing detained aliens and repatriation of those apprehended to the interior of Mexico. 
   "The ABC program has suffered some setbacks, but the launching of UAV operations is a good sign that things are again moving forward," Kyl said.
