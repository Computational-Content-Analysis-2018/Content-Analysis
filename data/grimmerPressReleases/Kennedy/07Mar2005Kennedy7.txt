         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC   Today the United States Senate will consider two minimum wage proposals as part of the bankruptcy bill    the first vote on this critical issue of this Congress  Senator Edward M  Kennedy s would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour  providing economic relief to 7 3 million Americans  Senator Kennedy is determined give working Americans the increase they long deserve and strongly believes that no one who works for a living should have to live in poverty   Senator Santorum s amendment  which will be voted on today after Kennedy s  has been loaded with anti worker poison pills  It denies more than 10 million workers minimum wage  overtime pay and equal pay rights and would be the death of the 40 hour workweek and the American weekend  It will increase the minimum wage by a mere  1 10 per hour  benefiting only 1 8 million workers    5 5 million fewer than the Kennedy amendment  Senator Santorum has consistently opposed a minimum wage increase   Eight hundred supporters of Senator Kennedy s minimum wage increase rallied outside the capitol hours before the vote urging the Senate to do what is fair for working Americans  The demand for an increase resonates strongly across the country  with minimum wage at its second lowest value in sixty years while costs of healthcare  tuition  housing have soared  Overwhelming numbers of citizens in Nevada and Florida showed the way last November by voting for a higher minimum wage in their states   Today the United States Senate has the opportunity to show where it stands  Families all across America are being squeezed in every direction by the Bush economy yet it has been eight long years since we ve raised the minimum wage  said Senator Kennedy at the rally  It is an absolute travesty that a family of three earning the minimum wage works five days a week all year round yet still lives below the poverty line  What does that say about us as a country   The last time the Congress voted to raise the minimum wage was in 1996 and three times in the last Congress the Republican leadership brought down a bill rather than having a clean vote on the minimum wage  Kennedy declared today that he would oppose any effort to add to the minimum wage so called overtime cuts that would be the death of the 40 hour workweek and the American weekend   FACT SHEET ON SENATOR KENNEDY S MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE   The Fair Minimum Wage Amendment of 2005 would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps     5 85 60 days after enactment    6 55 one year later    7 25 one year after that   The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 4 3 million since President Bush took office  Nearly 36 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Among full time  year round workers poverty has doubled since the late 1970sfrom about 1 3 million then to more than 2 6 million  An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem    The last time Congress voted to raise the minimum wage was in 1996  That increase raised it from  4 25 to  4 75 in 1996  and then in 1997 to its current  5 15 an hour    Three times in the last Congress the Republican leadership brought down a bill rather than let us have an up or down vote on the minimum wage    first on the State Department Bill  then on the Welfare Bill  and finally on the Class Action Bill    Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  earn  10 700 a year   5 000 below the poverty line for a family of three  Since the last increase in 1997  the value has eroded by more than 15 percent    Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  3 50 below what it was in 1968  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be  8 70 an hour today  not  5 15    Nearly seven and a half million workers will directly benefit from the minimum wage increase  More than eight million more will benefit indirectly  That s fifteen and a half million workers who will get a raise    Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 370 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families  That s enough for a minimum wage family to buy  o Almost two years of child care o Full tuition for a community college degree o A year and a half of heat and electricity o More than a year of groceries o More than 9 months of rent   In the past eight years  Members of Congress will have raised their own pay seven timesby  28 500  In those same eight years minimum wage workers have not gotten a single raisethey continue to earn  10 700 a year    The current minimum wage fails to provide enough income to enable minimum wage workers to afford adequate housing in any area of this country    History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation  In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades  More than 11 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 232 000 per month  There were ten million new service industry jobs  including more than one and a half million retail jobs  of which nearly 600 000 were restaurant jobs    A fair increase is long overdue  Congress should act as quickly as possible to pass a minimum wage increase that reflects the losses suffered as the result of our shameful inaction in the past  No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty   FACT SHEET ON SENATOR SANTORUM S MINIMUM WAGE PROPOSAL  The Santorum amendment gives pennies to minimum wage workers with one hand  and takes away minimum wage  overtime and equal pay rights from over 10 million workers with the other    It will increase the minimum wage by a mere  1 10 per hour  This amendment will benefit only 1 8 million workers    5 5 million fewer than the Kennedy amendment    The difference between an increase to  7 25 and an increase to  6 25 for a minimum wage worker is 15 fewer months of child care  more than a year less of tuition at a community college  10 fewer months of heat and electricity  6 fewer months of groceries  and 5 fewer months of rent    The Santorum amendment denies more than 10 million workers minimum wage  overtime pay and equal pay rights by ending individual Fair Labor Standards coverage and raising the enterprise coverage threshold to  1 million from  500 000    The Santorum amendment would be the death of the 40 hour workweek and the American weekend  After the Administration s denial last year of overtime protections for 6 million workers  this proposal would further undermine overtime by allowing employers to refuse to pay workers up to ten hours of earned overtime pay every two weeks    That means a pay cut of  3 000 a year for a median income earner   44 000 year  and an  800 pay cut for minimum wage workers  Employers are already free to offer more flexible schedules under current lawthe only difference is that now they have to pay workers overtime when they work more than 40 hours in a week    The Santorum amendment prohibits states from providing stronger wage protections than the federal standard for tipped employees like waiters and waitresses    For employees not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act    a growing group under the Santorum amendment    states can allow employers to pay their employees nothing and rely entirely on tips  For employees covered by FLSA  this provision ensures that states can t adopt more generous provisions than the existing federal requirement that employers must pay  2 13 an hour and employees must rely on tips for the remaining  3 02    The amendment removes agency discretion and creates a safe haven for violators of a broad range of consumer  environmental  and labor protections by prohibiting federal agencies from assessing civil fines for most first time reporting violations  It also preempts states  ability to enforce these laws    If Republicans were truly interested in raising the minimum wage they would not have loaded down their proposal with anti worker poison pills  I remind my colleagues that there are many ways to help small businesses without denying rights to millions of Americans  This amendment is unfair and unacceptable  I urge my colleagues to oppose the anti worker Santorum amendment
