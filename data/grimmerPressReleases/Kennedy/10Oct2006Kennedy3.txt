Event   AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY     Thank you  Mayor Menino for that warm and generous introduction and for those wonderful Irish dancers   And special thanks to Angela Menino as well for also hosting this magnificent event    Good evening my friends   Im honored to be here and very grateful for this award  and I extend my warmest congratulations to the other award recipients this evening   I commend the Mayors Office of New Bostonians for all theyre doing to promote diversity  respect  and civic participation by immigrants and by all the future citizens of our Commonwealth   In addition to English  the office now has services in Spanish  Portuguese  Creole  Spanish  Vietnamese  Chinese and Russian   Its also successfully partnered with a wide range of community organizations     Tonights celebration honors the diversity that immigrants bring to Boston and to our country as a whole   Our city  as you all know  has been a gateway to America for nearly 400 years  ever since the Mayflower  and there is no more appropriate place to celebrate our heritage as a nation of immigrants than here in Boston      Most of you know when you or your ancestors first came to this country   For me  a century and half ago  all eight of my great grandparents successfully crossed the Atlantic in the famous vessels that were often called coffin ships because so many failed to survive the arduous voyage   They arrived in Boston Harbor and came up the Golden Stairs and passed through the citys Immigration Hall on their way to a better life for themselves and their families   From my office in Boston  I can still see those Golden Stairs and Im constantly reminded of my immigrant heritage    As President Kennedy put it  This was the secret of America  a nation of people with the fresh memory of old traditions who dared to explore new frontiers  people eager to build lives for themselves in a spacious society that did not restrict their freedom of choice and action    Immigration is in our blood   Its part of our founding story   Courageous pilgrims set off in search of religious freedom and a better life  and they founded a great nation    For centuries ever since  brave men and women have made the difficult decision to leave their homes and seek better lives in this Promised Land     Immigrants today come from all corners of the world  representing every race and creed   They work hard   They practice their faith   They love their families  And they love this country     These hard working men and women built our country   They fueled our economic growth and fought in our wars   More than 60 000 immigrants serve in the military today   Countless others make scientific discoveries  establish thriving businesses  and enrich our literature  music  and the arts   And they also farm our fields and serve in many other occupations  often also enduring exploitation and bigotry as they begin their own American Dream     We would not be a great nation today without them   But whether we remain true to that history and heritage is a major challenge we are facing today    Were confronted with a choice  a choice between a future as a nation of immigrants  or a future measured by higher walls and longer fences  between a future in which the undocumented living among us can emerge from the shadows  or a future in which America becomes a two tiered society  with millions of workers endlessly confined to the underground economy    There is no question that the immigration system needs to be fixed to meet the challenges of the 21st Century   Its a complex problem and it requires a comprehensive solution   We need strict laws that are also fair laws to strengthen our borders and enable undocumented immigrants to become legal workers so that all working men and women  native born and foreign born  have the right to work with dignity and the protection of our laws    Weve welcomed immigrants as members of our communities for decades  but for decades we have denied them legal status   Theyve been victims of an unfair systemliving in fear of deportation  exploited at their worksites  unable to create the better futures they hope for and dream      Common sense tells us that enforcement alone is not a solution to todays complex immigration challenges   Yet  a number of recent immigration proposals in Congress have focused on enforcement only  bumper sticker proposals that are not only ineffective but cruel   These punitive measures do nothing to effectively secure our borders and mend our broken immigration system     We can build fences and put high tech devices along the border to deter some people   But we all know that many others will find a way to come here   Some Americans would even make criminals of pastors and priests who often help immigrants  but thats contrary to our values  and will have little effect on immigration    Such proposals also breed bigotry   We now see the resurgence of anti immigrant attitudes in many parts of the country   Hostile groups have grown in size and funds  and some political leaders and commentators are quick to fuel hostility   Many of them would like to close our borders and isolate America  violating the very principles on which America was founded    Those who hold such views have consistently been on the wrong side of history  and they still are   They forget were a nation of immigrants  and always have been     They forget were a country based on the principles of hard work  integrity  and honesty   These are the very principles at the heart of the immigrant experience in America  and may it always be so    I thank you all again for this prestigious honor  and for giving me the opportunity to praise the contributions of immigrants to our country   Above all  thank you for giving me the opportunity to fight for what is right  and to defend our nation of immigrants    Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
