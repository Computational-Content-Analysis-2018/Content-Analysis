         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today is a day when above all we honor the heroism  the sacrifice  and the bravery of our men and women in uniform  We pay tribute to those whose dedication to this nation has taken them far away from their loved ones  and those whose past service has made this country what it is today    It s deeply regrettable that the President is using Veterans Day as a campaign like attempt to rebuild his own credibility by tearing down those who seek the truth about the clear manipulation of intelligence in the run up to the Iraq War  Instead of providing open and honest answers about how we will achieve success in Iraq and allow our troops to begin to come home  the President reverted to the same manipulation of facts to justify a war we never should have fought  Each day  the American people learn more and more about the truth  It s time for the President to restore the trust of the American people in their leaders by coming clean about the war and leading us to a place where we can better protect our citizens and restore our leadership in the world  But  today s speech didn t do that  It only further tarnished this White House and further damaged his presidency   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
