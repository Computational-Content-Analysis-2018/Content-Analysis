         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senators Edward M  Kennedy  Tom Harkin  and a bipartisan coalition of Senators will joined the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research  CAMR  for a press conference  The group urged the Senate to pass the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  S 5     S  5 is a modified version of H R  810  which 63 Senators supported last year   The only change is that the bill now also includes the text of last years S  2754  the Specter Santorum alternatives bill   which passed the Senate by a vote of 100 0 but never cleared the House   The new S  5 combines the two stem cell bills that the Senate overwhelmingly approved last year but did not become law   Below are Senator Kennedys remarks  as prepared for delivery Last year  Congress passed bipartisan legislation to break the chains that had held back promise on stem cell research   We voted for hope  for progress  and for life  We are here once more to speak of the hope that stem cell research brings to patients suffering from diabetes  spinal injuries  Parkinsons Disease  and many other illnesses There are deep convictions on both sides of this issue   But most Americans agree that Congress should vote for hope and progress   I urge President Bush to respect their wishes and to sign this legislation into law When breakthrough cures that can end suffering and prolong life are within reach  it is wrong of the Administration to put irresponsible politics ahead of responsible science The time has come to say  Enough   No more We should say yes to the teenager with diabetes who is condemned to a life of endless tests  injections and hospital stays We should say yes to the father with spinal cord injury that one day he may be able to walk and support his family again We should say yes to the grandmother with Alzheimers that she might cherish her family memories in her golden years  Millions of patients and their families  as well as leaders in science and medicine  including the Director of NIH  have joined the call to end these unreasonable barriers to progress  I urge our colleagues in the Senate to listen to those calls  and to vote once again for legislation that offers the promise of better health and a fuller life to so many Americans Let us hope that the President will consider this issue anew  and put aside his veto pen for the sake of life      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
