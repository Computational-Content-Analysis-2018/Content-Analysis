         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  DC  Today Rep  Waxman  Sen  Kennedy  and Rep Roybal Allard introduced a package of bills that will help to ensure that adults have access to life saving vaccines  These vaccines include the new vaccine against the virus that causes cervical cancer as well as vaccines against seasonal influenza  certain pneumonias  Hepatitis B  and shingles  among others      These bills will increase access to vaccines by creating a Vaccines for Uninsured Adults program  modeled on the very successful Vaccines for Children  VFC  program  The Vaccines for Uninsured Adults program will provide vaccines free of charge to uninsured and underinsured adults  The bills would fund programs to educate the public about the importance of adult immunization and would provide for grants to states to strengthen state adult immunization efforts as well      The legislation would further facilitate immunization of older Americans by moving vaccines from Medicare Part D to Medicare Part B  which would allow for doctors to be paid to administer the vaccines  In addition  the legislation would require the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to study ways they can encourage both adult and health care worker immunization     This package of legislation represents a major policy initiative to improve adult immunization rates  said Rep  Waxman  We know that immunizations save lives  Unfortunately  not enough adults are getting their recommended vaccines  What we are proposing today is a comprehensive approach to boost immunization rates and to improve the Nations health     Vaccination is obviously indispensable in the battle against many diseases  said Sen  Kennedy  It protects children and adults alike  yet its not reaching all those who need it  The CDC estimates that more than 42 000 adults die every year from vaccine preventable diseases  Fewer than 30  of adults at high risk for influenza actually receive the vaccine  As new vaccines become available against more diseases  we need to do more to see that uninsured and under insured adults and children will benefit from these medical advances  Under the bills we are introducing today  many more adults and children in communities across America will have access to these life saving discoveries  and the nation as a whole will be better prepared to avoid or reduce the threat of a pandemic     It has been my pleasure to work with Congressman Waxman and Senator Kennedy  who have devoted their years in public service to ensuring that all Americans have access to quality health care  said Rep  Roybal Allard  This group of immunization bills is a key component of that effort  We are fortunate to have highly effective vaccines that will prevent death and disability and save billions of dollars in health costs annually  but they can t work unless we take decisive steps to ensure their universal availability and utilization      The bills would also help the nation with a vaccine shortage by requiring vaccine companies to give the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  one years notice  when feasible  of their plans to stop manufacturing a particular vaccine  In addition  the measures would give HHS the authority to keep track of doses of vaccines in times of shortage  Shortages can occur for many reasons and are often unpredictable  such as the manufacturing problem reported this week by Merck  Company that will likely result in a shortage of pediatric meningitis and pneumonia vaccines      Finally  the bills would improve the VFC by allowing underinsured children who qualify for VFC to get immunized at any public health clinic    A text of the bills and summaries are available at www oversight house gov          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
