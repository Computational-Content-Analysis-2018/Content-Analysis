         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the 2006 Supplemental We all support our men and women in uniform  and Congress should certainly provide the funds they need  But after nearly 2 300 American casualties and no clear strategy to end the war and begin to bring our troops home  it is time for the President to tell the American people exactly how much funding he s requesting for Iraq  His  65 billion request for the Pentagon makes no distinction between Iraq and Afghanistan  Congress has already provided more than  270 billion for the war in Iraq  The American people support our troops  but they deserve an honest price tag on the cost    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
