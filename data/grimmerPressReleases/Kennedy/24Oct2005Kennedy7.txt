         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today Senator Kennedy  ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration  Border Security and Citizenship  issued the following statement in response to reports that federal contractors have hired low waged undocumented workers in the reconstruction efforts in the Gulf Coast     The winds of Katrina exposed to all of America just how much more work is to be done to achieve equality and fairness in this country  We are a stronger country when we are a fairer country  Yet  first the Bush Administration awarded billions of dollars in contracts to many of their corporate friends while they decided that the men and women of the Gulf Coast don t deserve to be paid a fair wage  And now we learn that the Administration is letting these no bid outside contractors ignore the people of the Gulf Coast for the sake of bigger profits by allowing substandard wages and the exploitation of undocumented workers  The victims of Katrina have lost everything    and President Bush says it is okay for them to lose their fair wages too and okay for his corporate cronies to take advantage of people during this time of need   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
