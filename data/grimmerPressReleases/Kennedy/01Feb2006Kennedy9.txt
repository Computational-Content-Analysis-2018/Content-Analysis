         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE         Fact sheets on Bush s plan and Kennedy s solution are below      Washington  DCToday  Senator Kennedy joined Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi  and House and Senate Democrats to rally for real reforms that will benefit ordinary Americans  Last night  as he attempted to do last year with his Social Security privatization fiasco  President Bush will try to make the American people believe that the solution to rising health costs is to shift more and more of those costs to ordinary Americans  or to deny care to those in need  Kennedy believes that s the wrong prescription for health care  On Tuesday  Senator Kennedy introduced his plan to fix our fractured system of care  by extending Medicare to all Americans  from birth to the end of life  while allowing any American who wishes to stay in their current employer sponsored plan to do so  Under Kennedy s bill  employers can tailor their health plans to provide additional services to their employees that wrap around Medicare coverage    America s failure to guarantee the basic right to health care for all its citizens was one of the great public policy failures of the 20th century  and we must not allow that failure to continue in this new century  Senator Kennedy said  Like his Social Security privatization fiasco  President Bush s health savings accounts are a gimmick that will only make a bad situation worse  Our goal should be an America where no citizen of any age fears the cost of health care  and no employer stops creating jobs because of the high cost of providing health insurance    Below is a fact sheet on President Bush s gimmick and a fact sheet on Senator Kennedy s health care solution      BUSH S HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WILL MAKE A BAD SITUATION WORSE   Like Privatizing Social Security  HSA s Will Fail to Solve the Problem   After five years of ignoring our nation s healthcare crisis  President Bush is expected to announce at the State of the Union proposals to encourage health savings accounts  HAS   Last year  the White House launched a failed privatization social security plan and now they want to do the same to healthcare  Senator Kennedy believes that HSAs benefit the wealthiest and healthiest Americans but leave ordinary working families with higher medical costs and more people uninsured  The expanded use of tax deductions for health care would also primarily benefit high income houses    For example  a single woman suffering from breast cancer who makes  37 000 a year could face  32 000 in medical bills for cancer treatment and surgery in a single year  Right now  she s likely to buy an individual health plan for  2500 that provides full coverage of her costs after she pays a  2000 deductible    so her total costs would be  4 500 and insurance picks up the remaining  27 500  However  under the Bush health care proposal  her health insurance will cost  2000  but it will carry a  8000 spending limit  so her total costs would be  10 000     5 500 more than under her old plan  She may have some money saved in her HSA  but with a costly illness like cancer  she won t have time to save enough for her treatments  and would likely go into debt    As another example  today  the average single mother of three who makes  31 000 a year will pay  2200 for an employer sponsored health plan  with an out of pocket spending limit of  2000  If one of her children has an unexpected illness or injury  she wouldn t have to pay more than  2000 in extra medical expenses  Under the Bush health care proposal  she ll pay just  1800 for her HSA health plan  but that plan has a  10 000 deductible  So if her child gets sick under the Bush proposal  she could end up spending over  11 800   more than 30  of her income on health care    forcing her to cut back on other essential needs     Below are the facts on HSA s    Health savings accounts don t work for those who are not healthy  Persons with chronic health conditions or who are hit with illness or injury will experience significantly greater out of pocket expenses than for traditional  comprehensive insurance     Persons with high deductible health plans are significantly more likely to avoid  skip or delay health care because of cost than those in comprehensive health insurance  This problem is most commonly seen in individuals with health problems or incomes below  50 000  Thirty one percent  31   of individuals in high deductible health plans reported delaying or avoiding care  compared to 17  in comprehensive health plans    Most health spending is by those with multiple chronic conditions  These individuals will never be able to accumulate funds in a health savings account and will have to find the funds to cover all their care before meeting their high deductible plan begins to cover them     Health savings accounts put coverage for low income and less healthy individuals at risk  Traditional insurance spreads risk among large groups  While those who are young and healthy may pay a bit more than they otherwise would  they know that if they are hit by illness or injury  have a baby born with health problems  or as they age  they will still be able to purchase insurance at a more affordable price  With health savings accounts  it s each man for himself  and those who need insurance most will face the greatest risk    Several studies have found that if those who are young  healthy or wealthy move to health savings accounts while those who are not remain in the traditional insurance plans that provide the benefits and security they need  traditional insurance will become unaffordable  leaving those who most need protection at greater risk of becoming uninsured or underinsured    Health savings accounts are not a solution for the uninsured  They are regressive  favoring the wealthy  while most of the uninsured have low or moderate incomes  Most of the uninsured are in low tax brackets so they don t receive much  if any benefit  from the health savings account deductions  More than half of the uninsured receive no benefit from tax deductibility  The higher an account holder s income  the more benefit received from the tax deduction    Health savings accounts allow wealthy individuals to shelter funds  Funds grow over time and offer tax advantages regular savings vehicles    including 401ks and IRAs    don t provide  Individuals can fund a health savings account and receive tax favored treatment regardless of income  The tax deduction available for contributions has no phase out for high income individuals     This allows an additional tax favored savings vehicle for high income individuals who have maximized their contributions to retirement savings accounts or have incomes to high to qualify for a deduction     Once an account holder turns 65  funds that have accrued tax free may be withdrawn for any reason with no penalty  For example  if an account holder wants to buy a sports car with their health savings account funds  there is no penalty    Health savings accounts are another way of shifting costs  Early evidence is that one third of all businesses offering health savings accounts with a high deductible plan to their workers make no contribution to the account  For firms that do make contributions  the average contribution is only  533 for individuals and  1 185 for families  while the average deductible for an individual was  1 901 and the average deductible for a family was  4 070    Despite similar rates of health care use  individuals in consumer directed health plans and high deductible health plans are significantly more likely to spend a large share of their income on out of pocket health expenses than those in comprehensive health plans  Forty two percent  42   of those in high deductible health plans spent 5  or more of their income on out of pocket expenses and premiums  compared to 12  of those in comprehensive health plans    Health savings accounts already receive more favorable tax treatment than other health plans and retirement accounts  Contributions to health savings accounts made by an employer are not considered income and are not taxed  They are deductible  whether or not a taxpayer chooses to itemize  Earnings in a health savings account accrue on a tax free basis  and withdrawals for medical expenses are not taxed  All other similar accounts  including IRAs and 401 k  plans  are subject to tax either on contributions or withdrawals    MEDICARE FOR ALL  QUALITY  AFFORDABLE  HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS   America faces a health care crisis  Too many Americans are uninsured  and the number of the uninsured is increasing at an accelerating rate  No American family is more than one pink slip or one employer decision to drop coverage away from being uninsured  Health care costs are too high and are rising at double digit rates  Our dysfunctional health care financing system makes it harder for American businesses to compete in the global economy  creates incentives to outsource jobs abroad  has slowed job growth even as the economy recovers  and has been an especially heavy burden on manufacturing     America s failure to assure the basic human right to health care to all its citizens was one of the great public policy failures of the 20th century  Recent data emphasizes the urgency of redressing this failure  Forty six million Americans are uninsured  and the most recent Census Bureau figures show that the number of uninsured increased by nearly one million Americans in 2005 alone  Even these figures understate the problem  Over a two year period  82 million Americansone out of every three non elderly Americans  will be uninsured for a significant period of time     After a brief period of stability in the mid 90s  health care costs are rising at unacceptable rates far in excess of inflation  Health insurance premiums have risen at double digit rates since 2000  and have increased a whopping 73  in the last five years  Health care spending reached 16  of GDP  the highest level in our nation s history     The high level of American health care costs combined with a financing system that places the burden of paying for coverage on employers who voluntarily choose to offer health insurance puts American firms at a competitive disadvantage  As a proportion of GDP spent on health care  America is first in the world by a large margin  By that standard  we spend 49  more than the Swiss  the next highest spending country  88  more than the Germans  150  more than the British  and 160  more than the Japanese  according to the latest data from the OECD  Our extraordinary level of health spending  however  is not reflected in better health outcomes  Among the world s leading industrialized countries  the United States ranks 22nd in average life expectancy and 25th in infant mortality     Not only are our health care costs much higher than our trading competitors  but our system forces employers to finance a much higher proportion of costs than firms abroad  because foreign systems rely much more on broad based public financing  The heavy burden the health care financing system adds to labor costs in the United States also acts as a drain on hiring and provides an additional incentive for outsourcing jobs abroad     The Burden of Being Uninsured     In any given year  1 3 of the uninsured go without needed medical care        Eight million uninsured Americans fail to take medication their doctors prescribe  because they cannot afford to fill the prescription      Two hundred and seventy thousand children suffering from asthma never see a doctor  Three hundred and fifty thousand children with recurrent earaches never see a doctor  More than three hundred and fifty thousand children with severe sore throats never see a doctor      27 000 uninsured women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year  They are twice as likely as insured women not to receive medical treatment until their cancer has already spread in their bodies  As a result  they are 50  more likely to die of the disease      32 000 Americans with heart disease go without life saving and life enhancing bypass surgery or angioplasty    because they are uninsured      Whether the disease is AIDS or mental illness or cancer or heart disease or diabetes  the uninsured are left out and left behind  In hospital and out  young or old  black or white  they receive less care  suffer more  and are 25  more likely to die than those who are insured      Medical costs account for about half of all bankruptcies  affecting over 2 million people annually  More than 9 million families spend more than 1 5 of their total income on medical costs     Characteristics of the Uninsured     81  of those without insurance are employees or family members of employees  Of these uninsured workers  most are members of families with at least one person working full time      The uninsured are predominantly low and moderate income persons who cannot afford to buy coverage in the individual market  Approximately two thirds have incomes below 200  of poverty      8 3 million children are uninsured  one fifth of the total without coverage      Large numbers of people in all racial ethnic groups are uninsured  but minorities suffer the most  One in ten non Hispanic whites are uninsured  one in five African Americans are uninsured  and one in three Hispanics are uninsured     Health Care Costs    Excessive inflation in health care costs not only burdens the economy but is a major factor in increasing the number of the uninsured     After several years of low growth  health care costs are now rising very rapidly  Health insurance premiums increased 10 9 percent in 2001  12 9  in 2002  13 9  in 2003  11 2  in 2004  and 9 2  in 2005  The cumulative increase over the five years was 73   while the cumulative increase in the CPI was only 13 6      National health expenditures are projected to reach  3 6 trillion in 2014  growing at an average annual rate of 7 1 percent from 2003 2014  As a share of GDP  health spending is projected to reach 18 7 percent by 2014      Claims processing and other administrative functions cost the health care system  600 billion per year    money that could be better spent on patient care  America s fragmented health financing system is a major driver of these high administrative costs  In Canada  where health insurance is publicly financed and providers bill the government for all services rather than having to deal with a multiplicity of insurance companies with different rules and payment formulas  administrative costs are only about half as high as in the United States  16 7  of total health costs in Canada vs  31  in the United States       The administrative expense needed by the government to run the Medicare program accounts for only 3  of Medicare spending  By contrast  the amount of every premium dollar retained by private insurance companies for marketing  administration and profit is 14       Healthcare is one of the least efficient industries in America  Settling a single transaction in health care can cost as much as  12 to  25  whereas banks have cut their costs to less than a penny per transaction by using modern information technology      According to a study conducted by the RAND Corporation  by utilizing advanced information technology and adopting electronic medical records for every patient  America could save over  160 billion a year by reducing duplicative care  lowering health care administrative costs  and improving quality     Burden on U S Competitiveness and Job Growth    Government data  industry surveys  and interviews with employers indicate that many businesses remain reluctant to hire full time employees because health insurance has become one of the fastest growing costs for companies      A recent study found that employers have reduced hiring in response to rising health insurance premiums  and that industries with higher health care costs have had slower job growth  This has been especially true for the manufacturing sector      U S  employee benefit costsof which health care is the largest component  for manufacturing firms are higher than most of its major competitors and the private share of overall health expenditures is much higher in the U S  than it is for its major competitors      Ten percent of the total cost of a ton of steel manufactured in the United States is consumed by retiree health benefits alone  Starbucks now spends more on health care than it does on coffee  The difference between the way health care is financed in Canada and the U S  saves the Canadian auto industry  4 00 an hour in worker compensation compared to the U S  The Canadian branches of the big three automakers have released a joint letter with Canadian Auto Workers Union stating that the Canadian health care system is a strategic advantage for Canada and has been an important ingredient in the success of Canada s most important export industry     The Medicare for All proposal   The Medicare for All plan will make health care coverage available to every American by expanding the Medicare program to the under 65 population  To promote competition and choice  enrollees will also have the option of choosing any of the plans offered to members of Congress  the President  and Federal employees     Costs will be reduced by administrative savings from moving to a Medicare style financing system  by bringing modern information technology to health care  by improving quality of care  and by rewarding health care providers based on performance  not just on the number of procedures performed  International competitiveness and job creation will be enhanced by reduced costs and by shifting some of the burden of financing from business contributions to general revenues  as well as the healthier and more productive work force that will result from universal health insurance coverage     To ease the transition to the new system  coverage will be implemented in phases  In the first  coverage will be extended to individuals 55 65 and to children under 20 years old  In later phases  coverage will be extended to all other Americans not already covered under Medicare    Benefits   Benefits available to the under 65 population under the expanded Medicare program will be the same as those provided under Medicare  with additional benefits appropriate to the wider age range served by the new program  These will include early and periodic screening  diagnosis and treatment  enhanced preventive care  home and community based care and other services deemed appropriate to meet the nation s health needs  This plan provides comprehensive medical benefits  including prescription drug coverage  without the damaging gaps in coverage and chaotic administrative features of the Republican Medicare drug law     Enrollees may also choose any private insurance plan available to members of Congress under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program  These plans all have comprehensive benefit packages  but differ in specifics like dental coverage  vision coverage  and co payments  HMO and PPO options are available under FEHBP    Freedom of choice   Every enrollee in the expanded Medicare program is guaranteed the right to go to the doctor  hospital  or other health care provider of their choice  just as they are under the current Medicare program  This is a significant improvement over the current health financing system  under which insurers generally limit enrollees to providers chosen by the insurer or require them to pay high additional cost sharing if they want to go to an out of network provider    In addition  all enrollees have the right to choose one of the private health plans available to members of Congress  if that is their preference    Private health care delivery system   While the new program will be largely publicly financed  the health system itself will remain private  Just as under the current Medicare program  doctors  hospitals and other providers will continue to operate as independent  private entities  As under Medicare  the program will be largely be administered by private carriers and intermediaries    Eligibility and enrollment    Any individual with a social security number is eligible to participate in the plan and will be automatically enrolled in the extended Medicare plan unless they choose one of the private options  There will be the opportunity to switch plans annually  just as there is under the FEHBP program    Cost reduction through improved quality of care   Information technology can make a real difference in patient care  Computerized medical records  coupled with decision support software  can help avoid dangerous medical errors  assist in coordinating care for patients receiving services from multiple providers  help patients take responsibility for their own health  and improve the quality of care  Under Medicare for All  health care providers will be rewarded for improving the quality of care they give to patients  One measure of health care quality will be appropriate use of information technology systems that improve care quality and reduce costs    Role of Medicaid    Medicaid will continue to provide wraparound services and cost sharing assistance to very low income and disabled individuals    Medicare   The current Medicare system will continue to provide insurance for the over 65 population and for eligible disabled individuals    Cost of plan   The plan will create large savings   380 billion a year  at the same time it provides quality  affordable care for all Americans  The Institute of Medicine has estimated that  with no other changes  there would be a savings of  130 billion from extending coverage to all  Increased utilization of health care services by the currently uninsured will be offset by reductions in cost as the result of better prevention and earlier treatment of illness and by the economic benefits of a healthier population     In addition  the plan will save over  160 billion a year as the result of universal adoption of an electronic medical record and advanced information technology   70 billion a year in reduced insurance overhead costs  and  50 billion a year from reduced administrative costs to providers from dealing with a simpler  more uniform billing system     While the plan will create large savings overall  there will be a significant cost shift from individuals and businesses who now pay for the cost of health insurance to public financing sources  Preliminary estimates of the increase in federal spending are  600 billion a year  more than offset by reductions in costs to individuals and firms  The cost increase to the government will be fully covered by payroll taxes and general revenues  and will not add to the deficit    Financing   The plan will be financed by a combination of payroll taxes and general revenues  Eighty five percent of the financing will come from payroll taxes and 15  from general revenues  A preliminary estimate of the payroll tax financing necessary will be a payment of 7  of payroll by businesses and 1 7  by workers  By comparison  businesses providing coverage today spend an average of 13  of payroll to cover their workers    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
