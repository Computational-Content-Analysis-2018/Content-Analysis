         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C     Today Senator Kennedy issued the following statement following reports that ICE officers dressed in riot gear  entered Swift  Company plants and herded all workers together at gun point  violating their legal rights  I am deeply disturbed by the reports I have received today about the actions taken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to apprehend individuals and cart them away for processing without any opportunity to assert their rights or contact their families and attorneys  These men and women are simply workers and not terrorists or dangerous criminals and they should not be treated as such  No one denies the need for additional enforcement at the border and at US worksites  We support efforts by ICE officials to enforce our immigration laws  but do not condone enforcement efforts that mistreat workers and violate their legal rights  Comprehensive immigration reform is good for our economy and our security  and its consistent with our values and our heritage as a nation of immigrants  Todays enforcement action is the most recent reminder that our immigration system is irreparably broken and needs to be urgently fixed   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
