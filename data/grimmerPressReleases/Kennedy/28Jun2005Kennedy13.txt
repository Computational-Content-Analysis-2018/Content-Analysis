         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement in response to the Administration s formal proposal to seek  14 billion from the tobacco industry  instead of the  130 billion they had recommended originally  The Justice Department memos obtained by reporters show that high level Bush Administration political appointees over ruled professional lawyers in the case in slashing the damages that tobacco companies would be required to pay  The formal submission of the Bush Administration s recommendations to slash the amount that big tobacco owes from  130 billion to just  14 billion is profoundly disappointing  It is a serious breach of the Justice Department s responsibility to the American people and an abuse of power on behalf of the tobacco companies  There are few initiatives that would have a greater impact on the health of our nation than smoking prevention and smoking cessation  Parents know that every child that we stop from smoking is someone who will have a healthier  fuller  happier life  It is clear from today s action that President Bush has put the fox in charge of the chicken coop at the Justice Department  We see today in their own words that this Administration has made a political decision to cave in to Big Tobacco at the expense of the American people  The millions of Americans whose health has been ruined and whose lives may be shortened by the misconduct of the tobacco industry are entitled to a Justice Department that fights for them  not one that takes a dive for the tobacco companies   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
