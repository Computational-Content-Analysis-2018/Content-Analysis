         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  According to a report released today by the Energy Information Administration  the energy outlook for the coming winter remains bleak for millions of families in communities across the country  Households heating primarily with natural gas will pay an average of  306 more this winter for heatan increase of an incredible 41 percent over last year  Those relying primarily on oil for heat will pay  325 morean increase of 27 percent     Winter is coming  and it could easily become a perfect storm of high energy prices  bitter cold  and unaffordable heat for those in need  Unless we act now  the poor across the country may well become the victims of a major aftershock from the hurricanes in the Gulf    Big oil profits are fatter than ever  Exxon Mobil  the largest oil company in the United States    reported 3rd quarter profits of almost  10 billion  a 75 percent increase over last year     Exxon Mobil alone made  10 billion in the last quarteryet the Republican leadership refuses to fund LIHEAP  the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  beyond  2 billion  We must increase funds for LIHEAP now     In Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves 134 000 families  but 867 000 families are eligible for assistance  I recently heard from Patsy Lewis  the Executive Director of the Worcester Community Action Council  which has 3 500 households eligible for LIHEAP assistance  That s up from last November when the number was 2 500  Starting November 1st  in only four days the Council had 480 applicationsthey typically receive 350 applications in a month  This was their busiest start up ever    Patsy Lewis said that under this year s program  the maximum benefit is only  765 for the heating season  for a household at 100 percent of the poverty levelenough for only about one tank of oil for the winter    Unfortunately  it s clear that Republican priorities do not include the needs of the poor  Last month  OMB Director Joshua Bolten held a press conference to discuss the President s plans for a supplemental appropriations bill  When asked if the President planned to include funds for low income home energy assistance in the supplemental bill  Director Bolten replied  Gee  I forget what LIHEAP stands for  but the heating and energy assistance program  I guess  There is not a request contained in this reallocation for that purpose    There s no excuse for the Bush Administration and the Republican Congress to look the other way in the face of this worsening povertybut they do  They haven t even taken the time to learn the name of the program that could keep millions of Americans warm this winter if it s properly funded    LIHEAP is indispensable  Surely this new report on the energy tragedy that is unfolding for so many families will at least be a call to action that is loud enough for Congress to hear and act accordingly  and avoid the needless suffering that is now on the horizon across the nation      MASSACHUSETTS LIHEAP STATISTICS       Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves approximately 134 000 householdsbetween 14 000 and 15 000 in Boston       The current average price per gallon of home heating oil is  2 48  This is an increase of 30 percent  66 cents  over the average price per gallon last October   1 82      This winter  800 gallons of heating oilthe typical need for winter heatingwill cost approximately  2000  about  500 more than they would have paid last year          Households in the Northeast heating with propane will pay 20 percent more than last winter     Many families will start the winter already behind in heating bills  As of May  80 percent of ABCD clients  ABCD is a community action agency in Boston  owed the gas company an average of  900  In some cases the heat has been turned off and can t be turned back on until the families pay off their debt                  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
