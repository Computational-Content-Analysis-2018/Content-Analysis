         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Mr  President  it is a privilege to join Senators Enzi  Dodd  and Alexander in introducing the Head Start for School Readiness Act  Our goal is to reauthorize Head Start and continue our bipartisan support for this very successful program to prepare low income children for school   For over forty years  Head Start has given disadvantaged children the assistance they need to arrive at school ready to learn  Its comprehensive services guarantee balanced meals for children  and a well defined curriculum to see that children develop early skills in reading  writing  and math  and positive social skills as well  It provides visits to doctors and dentists  and outreach to parents to encourage them to participate actively in their childs early development  It is clear that Head Start works  A federal evaluation found that Head Start children make gains during the program itself  and the gains continue when the children enter kindergarten  Once Head Start children complete their kindergarten year  they are near the national average of 100 in key areas  with scores of 93 in vocabulary  96 in early writing  and 92 in early math   Weve made tremendous  bipartisan progress this year in our effort to reauthorize Head Start and build upon a program that serves as a lifeline for the neediest families and children across the nation  In this legislation  we build on Head Starts proven track record and expand it to include thousands of low income children who are not yet served by the program  We provide for better coordination of Head Start with state programs for low income children  We strengthen Head Starts focus on school readiness and early literacy  We enhance the educational goals for Head Start teachers  And we provide greater accountability for the program  including new policies to ensure improved monitoring visits and new policies to address programs with serious deficiencies  To strengthen Head Start  we have to begin by providing more resources for it  The need for Head Start is greater than ever  Child poverty is on the rise again  Today  less than 50 percent of children eligible for Head Start participate in the program  Hundreds of thousands of three  and four year olds are left out because of the inadequate funding level of the program  Early Head Start serves only 3 percent of eligible infants and toddlers  It is shameful that 97 percent of the children eligible for Early Head Start have no access to it  Its long past time for Congress to expand access to Head Start to serve as many infants  toddlers  and preschool children as possible   The bill that we introduce today will set a goal to expand Head Start over the next several years  We call for increases in funding  from  6 9 billion in the current fiscal year  to  7 3 billion in FY 2008   7 5 billion in FY 2009  and  7 9 billion in 2010  These funding levels are critical to advance the essential reforms in this legislation  and to serve thousands of additional children in the Head Start program  Early Head Start is an especially important program for needy infants and toddlers  Research clearly shows its benefit to infants and toddlers and their families  Early Head Start children have larger vocabularies  lower levels of aggressive behavior  and higher levels of sustained attention than children not enrolled in the program  Parents are more likely to play with their children and read to them  This bill will double the size of Early Head Start over the course of this authorization  and deliver services to over 56 000 additional children over the course of this authorization   Our bill establishes a Head Start Collaboration Office in every state to maximize services to Head Start children  to align Head Start with kindergarten classrooms  and to strengthen its local partnerships with other agencies  These offices will work hand in hand with the Head Start network of training and technical assistance to support Head Start grantees in better meeting the goals of preparing children for school   States will also have an active role in coordinating their system of early childhood programs  and increasing the quality of those programs  Our bill designates an Early Care and Education Council in each state to conduct an inventory of childrens needs  develop plans for data collection and for supporting early childhood educators  review and upgrade early learning standards  and make recommendations on technical assistance and training  For those states ready to move forward and implement their statewide plan  our bill will offer a one time incentive grant to implement these important efforts  Over the past four decades  Head Start has built up quality and performance standards to guarantee a full range of services  so that children are educated in the basics about letters and numbers and books  and are also healthy  well fed  and supported in stable and nurturing relationships  Head Start is a model program  and we can enhance its quality even more  One way to do that is to strengthen Head Starts current literacy initiative  We know the key to later reading success is to get young children excited about letters and books and numbers  Our bill emphasizes language and literacy  by enhancing the literacy training required of Head Start teachers  by continuing to promote parent literacy  and by working to put more books into Head Start classrooms and into childrens homes  We also make a commitment in this bill to upgrade all of the educational components of Head Start  and ensure that services are aligned with expectations for childrens kindergarten year and continue to be driven by the effective Head Start Child Outcomes Framework  At the heart of Head Starts success are its teachers and staff  They are caring  committed persons who know the children they serve and are dedicated to improving their lives  They help children learn to identify letters of the alphabet and arrange the pieces of puzzles  They teach them to brush their teeth  wash their hands  make friends and follow rules  Yet their salary is still half the salary of kindergarten teachers  and turnover is high    11 percent a year  Because a teachers quality is directly related to a childs outcome  our bill establishes a goal to ensure that every Head Start teacher have their A A  degree and 50 percent earn their B A  degree over the course of this authorization  Head Start teachers and staff are the greatest resource to children and families in the program  and we must match these ambitious reforms and improvements with the funding needed to see that Head Start programs can meet these goals   Weve also granted additional flexibility in this bill for Head Start programs to serve families and children that need services at the local level  Weve lifted the eligibility requirements so that families living below 130 percent of the federal poverty rate can qualify and participate in Head Start  Often  these are the neighbors of Head Start children with similar needs  but currently remain barred from participating in the program  Under this bill  Head Start programs will be empowered with greater authority to determine the needs of families in their local communities and define services to meet those needs  If programs determine that theres a greater share of infants and toddlers in need of services  our bill allows them to apply to the Secretary to convert and expand Head Start to serve those youngest children  consistent with Early Head Start standards  If programs identify a need to provide full day or full year care for children and families  they can take steps to do so   Accountability is a cornerstone of excellence in education and should start early  Head Start should be accountable for its promise to provide safe and healthy learning environments  to support each childs individual pattern of development and learning  to cement community partnerships in services for children  and to involve parents in their childs growth   Head Start reviews are already among the most extensive in the field  Every 3 years  a federal and local team spends a week thoroughly examining every aspect of every Head Start program  They check everything from batteries in flashlights to how parents feel about the program  Our bill takes a further step to improve the monitoring of Head Start programs  ensures that programs receive useful and timely feedback and information  and strengthens annual reviews and plans for improvement  Our bill also takes an important step to suspend the Head Start National Reporting System  Four years ago  I insisted that instead of rushing forward with a national assessment for every four  and five year old in Head Start  this Administration should instead move more deliberately to develop and implement an assessment tool that would help guide and improve Head Start programs  Unfortunately  they rejected that call and proceeded with an assessment  absent sufficient authorization or oversight from Congress  that was later proven by a GAO study to be flawed and inconsistent with professional standards for testing and measurement  Any assessment used in Head Start must be held to the highest standard  It must be valid and reliable  fair to children from all backgrounds  balanced in what it measures  and address the development of the whole child  Our bill calls on the National Academy of Sciences to continue their work in surveying assessments and outcomes appropriate for early childhood programs  and to make recommendations to the Secretary and to Congress on the use of assessments and outcomes in Head Start programs  I hope the National Academys work will be helpful as we consider future improvements in the Head Start program  Finally  this bill appropriately rejects earlier calls to block grant Head Start services  preserving the community based structure of the program  It makes no sense to turn Head Start into a block grant to the states  To do so would have dismantled the program and undermined Head Starts guarantees that children can see doctors and dentists  eat nutritious meals  and learn early academic and social skills  The current federal to local structure of Head Start enables it to tailor its services to meet local community needs  Performance standards guarantee a high level of quality across all programs  Yet each program is unique and specifically adapted to the local community  Head Start is successful in serving Inuit children in Alaska  migrant workers children in Tennessee  and inner city children in Boston  It is essential to maintain the ability of local Head Start programs to tailor their services to meet the needs of local neighborhoods and their children   The Head Start for School Readiness Act we are introducing today will keep Head Start on its successful path  and enable this vital program to continue to thrive and improve  I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in advancing and strengthening this program  and give children the head start they need and deserve to prepare for school and for life  Head Start for
