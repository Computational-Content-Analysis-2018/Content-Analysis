         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C   Rep  George Miller  D CA   Rep  Nick Rahall  D WV  and Sen  Edward Kennedy  D MA  today announced a new package of legislation to help improve health and safety in U S  mines The legislation would improve mine emergency response plans  strengthen the ability of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration to enforce health and safety regulations  strengthen rescue  recovery and accident investigation practices  and update the 35 year old standard that is not effectively preventing todays miners from developing black lung disease  The initiative builds upon legislation passed by Congress one year ago  the MINER Act  which responded to the immediate concerns of mine safety and emergency preparedness after a deadly 2006 in which 47 miners lives were lost  making it the most dangerous year for coal miners in a decade The MINER Act was an important first step towards fixing years of backsliding and complacency when it comes to the health and safety of miners  said Miller  the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee  While important progress has been made  we now have clear evidence that more can and must be done  Enactment of this legislation is essential if we are to ensure that our miners and their families no longer have to fear for their lives or those of their loved ones in producing the coal this nation needs  I am pleased to join my colleague  George Miller  in keeping the health and safety needs of our coal miners at the forefront of our nations conscience  said Rahall  the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee  The mine tragedies of last year are the result of a government and a nation that let down its guard  That should never have happened  The provisions in this new legislative package build upon the solid groundwork provided by the MINER Act and could result in life saving advances for years to come Kennedy  one of the key authors of the MINER Act  said  The MINER Act was a key step forward  but there is still much to be done to safeguard the health and safety of our nations miners  We must build upon the advances we have already made and eliminate the many hazards these workers face every day  Americas miners and their families deserve no less The legislation introduced in the House and Senate would establish an independent ombudsman to ensure proper attention to miner complaints of unsafe conditions and to protect whistleblowers from retaliation  Coal miners and family members who lost loved ones in mining accidents testified before the committee in March that they faced blacklisting or retaliation if they spoke up about unsafe working conditions  In addition  the bills would  Require underground mines to move quickly to install proven technologies to help prevent emergencies and protect miners lives if accidents occur   Prevent witness coercion and conflict of interests during accident investigations   Allow supplemental investigations by the independent Chemical Safety Board if requested by representatives of miners or families   Enhance penalties not adjusted by MINER Act  Ban the practice of ventilating mines with intake air run over conveyor belts  and  Update the 40 year old exposure limits for hundreds of toxic substances and set improved requirements to protect miners from asbestos exposure SUMMARY OF NEW MINE HEALTH AND SAFTEY INITIATIVELegislation introduced in the House  H R  XXXX  H R  XXXX  and Senate  S  XXXX  today consists of the following provisions to improve health and safety in the nations coal mines  Use proven technology to help prevent underground emergencies and protect miners lives after accidents Ban the practice of ventilating mines with belt air and require the half century old standard on conveyor belt flammability to be updated Require the installation of underground gas and smoke monitoring systems  and require miners working alone to carry multi gas detectors to protect them from otherwise undetectable toxic atmospheres they may encounter Require a study by the National Academy of Sciences of the technology needed to help protect underground miners from the harmful potential consequences of lightning above the mine Speed up the dates by which mine operators must install improved underground communication systems and refuge chambersEnhance MSHAs enforcement authority Clarify the authority of mine inspectors to be free of interference and to issue withdrawal orders in emergencies Enhance penalties for a pattern of violations and for retaliation against miners who report safety or health violations Provide MSHA with subpoena power equivalent to that of other agencies Establish an independent ombudsman to ensure proper attention to miner complaints of unsafe conditions and to protect whistleblowers from retaliationImprove rescue  recovery and accident investigation authority Establish a national call center to respond to emergencies Require timely reporting of near misses to MSHA Require the procedures for accident investigations to be standardized Ensure witness coercion and conflict of interests during investigations are avoided Allow supplemental investigations by the independent Chemical Safety Board  if requested by miners  or their representatives or familiesReduce miners exposure to coal dust Reduce the amount of coal dust to which miners can be exposed in accordance with NIOSH recommendations Require miners be equipped with the new personal dust monitors developed and certified by NIOSH  and authorize miners to adjust their activities to avoid overexposure Set an independent standard for silica exposure in accordance with NIOSH recommendationsAddress other critical hazards in the mines Require MSHA to use the existing asbestos exposure standard applicable to most American workers rather that the weaker standard for asbestos now applicable to miners Require MSHA to use the original hazard communication standard issued in October 2000  which was later weakened by the Bush administration  in order to provide mine workers the most recent scientific information on workplace health risks Require MSHA to update the list of permissible exposure limits in its air contaminants standard to reflect the recommended exposure limits established by NIOSH       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
