         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Americans once believed that if they worked hard and played by the rules they could achieve the American dream  They would be better off than their parents  They could move to a nicer neighborhood than where they  themselves grew up  They could provide for their children s needs and wants  They could join the middle class  earn more each year  provide safety and security for their families  and save for retirement  But today more than three in five Americans say that the American Dream is harder to achieve compared to their parent s generation   The 2001 recession hit workers hard    millions lost their jobs  and many of those jobs still haven t come back  Eight million Americans are out of work today  Workers who lose their jobs lose their health insurance too  They use their retirement savings to keep afloat    to keep paying the mortgage  to pay for temporary health benefits  and to keep food on the table   But those retirement savings don t last forever  Expenses continue to pile up  and often the prolonged loss of income forces those who ve been out of work into bankruptcy  More than two thirds of bankruptcies involve job related problems    in many cases  the loss of a job and the difficulty of finding a new one   That s why I m offering this amendment to ensure that workers who have lost their jobs or who have an illness or injury that prevents them from working are not unfairly thrown into the harsh means test created by this bill  This means test puts additional burdens on debtors already trying to get their lives and finances back together after a difficult period   The means test applies to those debtors whose average income for the six month period prior to filing for bankruptcy is above the median income  Some debtors forced to file for bankruptcy because they lost their jobs are already exempt because they have no income in the last six months   But those who lose their jobs within the six months before filing for bankruptcy can be unfairly included in the means test based on income they are no longer earning  My amendment would correct this problem   It provides that income from any job in which the debtor is no longer employed  and income from any activity in which he can no longer engage due to a medical disability will be excluded from this calculation   The Bush economy is still not creating enough jobs for all who want one  Two unemployed workers are competing for every one job opening  President Bush is the first President since President Hoover to have private sector jobs during his Administration  Private sector employment is still down half a million jobs since President Bush took office   A large part of the problem is that hardworking Americans are losing their jobs to foreign competition  We ve heard for years about manufacturing jobs being sent to other countries   Today  millions of Americans with other types of jobs face that risk too  Every day  we hear new stories about jobs in health care  financial services  and information technology going overseas in this high tech age  Shipping jobs overseas is a problem that is only going to grow   Experts project that 3 4 million jobs with total wages worth more than  150 billion could be sent overseas in the next 11 years  including more than half a million computer jobs  and more than 600 000 business and management jobs  Hardworking families are just barely balancing on a cliff of piling bills  just hoping they won t topple over  Costs keep going up while families  paychecks remain flat  and the gap between the two is eating away at families  economic security  Health care costs are out of reach  No family is more than one pink slip away from being uninsured  HMOs are riding high  with the largest profits in years  The pharmaceutical industry is gorging itself on profits by gouging patients all across America   Families continue to get socked with skyrocketing costs for drugs they desperately need  On Bush s watch  health insurance premiums have soared 59 percent  Drug costs have soared 65 percent   The costs of housing are increasing too  Housing costs are up 33 percent in the last four years  Every family wants to move to a good neighborhood so that their kids go to a good school  But we all know what that means    housing prices are sky high in many neighborhoods  and families  mortgages have soared   Mortgage debt has climbed  2 4 trillion over the last four years   We see it with the cost of child care  Child care often costs up to  10 000 per year for one child    more than the cost of public college tuition  But college tuition is expensive too  College costs are rising at double digit rates  Tuition at public colleges has risen 35 percent in the last four years   Rising costs hit the unemployed particularly hard  More than half of unemployed adults have had to postpone medical treatment or cut back on spending for food   One in four has had to move to other housing or move in with friends or relatives  And more than one third  36   have had trouble paying gas or electric bills  Too often these workers are forced to go into debt just to get by  and many topple over into bankruptcy  It s no wonder that bankruptcy is on the rise  Bankruptcy is up 33 percent since President Bush took office  An American now goes bankrupt every 19 seconds  In Massachusetts  there s a bankruptcy every half hour   Many working families have to file for bankruptcy simply because they are injured or become ill and lose their job   Kelly Donnelly of Oswego  New York  was diagnosed with skin cancer in September 2003  She and her husband owned a three bedroom house  and had a daughter with a second on the way  As a result of her treatments  Kelly  26  became too weak to work from her illness  She eventually had to leave her drugstore job  leaving the family with only  20 000 a year in income   Even though her husband Andrew received health insurance from his job  copayments from Kelly s treatments and medication for the new baby quickly mounted to over  20 000more than Andrew earned in a year  The couple lost their house and had to file for bankruptcy in August 2004   The insecurity of American workers is spilling over into their families  Working families are being squeezed in every direction by the Bush economy  Their ability to live the American dream is increasingly out of reach with each passing year   They find it harder and harder to earn a living    to pay the mortgage    pay the rent    pay their medical bill    pay their food bill    pay their gasoline bill    and still send their sons and daughters to college   Nothing is more important to Americans than providing for their children  And nothing is more central to the American Dream than working hard so that your children can have a better life than you   But all of that is threatened in today s economy where the cost of just getting by keeps rising so much faster than family income         Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
