         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        Our Constitution lays out a careful system of checks and balances  That reflects our respect for the rule of law and the founding principles of fairness and justice  In Hamdan v  Rumsfeld  the Supreme Court clearly upheld the principles  It said  in essence  that the President could not make up the rules as he went along  but must consult with Congress  the peoples branchin the war on terror  As Justice Breyer wrote  Congress has not issued the executive a blank check    Four years ago  this administration bypassed these basic principles when it created courts to try detainees at Guantanamo  The tribunals and commissions at Guantanamo are fundamentally unfair and do not give detainees a reasonable opportunity to have the validity of their detention decided  They were denied the ability to confront their accusers  to know the evidence against them  or even to be present at their trials  The trials did not guarantee the basic procedural protections needed to provide a fair trial or achieve an accurate verdict   The Administration promised swift justice  but it locked detainees away for over four years without creating an adequate process to distinguish between who belongs in detention and who should be released  Over four hundred fifty detainees have been held year after year under inhumane conditions  Despite establishing these military commissions over four years ago  they have not held a single trial or obtained a single conviction   As we learned last week  the military commissions created by the Administration were created in secret  by a very small group of lawyers in the Justice Department and in the Vice Presidents office  There was little consultation with the experts in this area of the law  The Defense Departments General Counsel William Haynes gave the military Judge Advocate General a cursory look at the proposed process before completely ignoring their objections   As we go forward  we should heed the words of Justice Kennedy  who said in the Hamdan case  The Constitution is best preserved by standards tested over time and insulated from the pressures of the moment  We should take Justice Kennedys wise words to heart  and be deliberative in how we proceed  We must ensure that the process for developing the rules and regulations for the military commissions is open and the outcome is fair   We already have a system that is consistent with our laws and ideals  the Uniform Code of Military Justice  It was designed to operate in wartime  and has done so effectively  It can deal with classified information  protect the identities of government informants  and handle information gathered in intelligence interrogations  It even has provisions for classified proceedings   We need to stand up for our well established legal traditions and values  We need to ensure that the procedural rules are developed through the regular process  both here in Congress  and within the executive branch  We have wasted enough time on untested legal theories and legal appeals  This time the system must be beyond reproach  The Constitution and our national security are served badly by anything less     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
