GAO REPORT ON NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND INCLUDED      Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy addressed the need for greater quality  better oversight  and closer coordination with schools in providing tutoring options mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act      Students urgently need these services  and we cant tolerate fly by night tutoring that falls short of the meaningful help they need to succeed  said Kennedy   Todays report indicates that the quality controls for supplemental educational services are largely inadequate and lacking   We must uphold our promise in the law of ensuring the best outcomes for students      The No Child Left Behind Act includes provisions to ensure the quality of supplemental educational services  including established criteria for the selection of tutoring providers and requirements that such providers have a successful track record and can closely align tutoring and support services to school curriculum   The law calls for states to closely monitor the quality and effectiveness of supplemental educational services  and to terminate any provider that fails to help students make meaningful gains after 2 years    We need a new commitment in the No Child Left Behind Act to make schools more active partners in these essential tutoring services  to reinforce learning thats happening during the school day  Kennedy said   We also must ensure that students with the greatest needs have access to these essential services  and that should be a central priority as we reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act next year   A summary of todays GAO report follows Senator Kennedys statement  Senator Kennedy requested the study in the fall of 2005    A complete copy of the report is available at www gao gov this afternoon        SENATOR KENNEDY RELEASES NEW GAO REPORT   GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND CLOSER COORDINATION WITH SCHOOLS NEEDED FOR SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL SERVICES A Government Accountability Office report released today by Senator Edward M  Kennedy and other Congressional Requesters shows that while increased numbers of students are participating in the tutoring option provided under the No Child Left Behind Act  many of the laws requirements regarding monitoring of the quality of supplemental educational services have not been followed   The report indicates the need to ensure closer coordination and involvement by schools in implementing supplemental educational services       The report  entitled No Child Left Behind Act   Education Actions Needed to Improve Local Implementation and State Evaluation of Supplemental Educational Services  finds that the number of children receiving supplemental services has increased by over 300 000 since 2002  to number 430 000 children in 2005  or 19 percent of the total number of children eligible for such options  According to the GAOs analysis  many communities reported that greater involvement of school officials  teachers  and principals would help improve implementation of these tutoring and academic enrichment programs   Specifically  GAO found       About 70 percent of states reported difficulties with coordinating tutoring services between tutoring providers  school districts  and schools  sometime resulting in delayed services to students       Supplemental educational services were delayed or withdrawn in 3 of 4 districts visited by GAO because tutoring providers failed to meet their own enrollment targets  unbeknownst to the school district      States and school districts expressed concern with the U S  Department of Educations policy excluding certain school districts from delivering tutoring to students   Many believe that school districts in needs improvement status should be permitted to continue essential tutoring programs     The No Child Left Behind Act mandates supplemental educational services  consisting of tutoring and academic enrichment  for students in schools that have failed to meet their accountability targets for three or more years in a row   Parents of such students have an option to choose from a list of state approved public  private  or non profit providers to help their children  and the law requires close monitoring and accountability by the state    The No Child Left Behind Act permits approval of qualified school districts as providers under supplemental educational services  yet regulations from the U S  Department of Education later prohibited schools from directly operating programs if they failed to meet accountability targets under the law   No such regulation exists for private companies providing services     According to the most recent data from the U S  Department of Education  the number of tutoring providers nearly tripled within a two year period  to more than 2 700 in 2005   The majority of approved tutoring providers are private organizations and for profit groups  accounting for 76 percent of the entire pool of tutors      Todays GAO report indicates that all states ensured that their school districts comply with No Child Left Behinds requirements to set aside federal funds for supplemental educational services and notify parents of tutoring options for their children   Yet states struggled with collecting the information needed to hold tutoring providers accountable  consistent with the laws requirements   Specifically  GAO found        Monitoring of supplemental educational services is limited  and three fourths of states reported challenges in their ability to evaluate tutoring services and determine sufficient progress of students in such services        Only a few states completed an evaluation report of their tutoring providers  and no state had conducted a thorough analysis of the effect of such tutoring on student achievement      Despite requirements for supplemental educational services to be consistent and complementary to material taught during the school day  in almost 40 percent of school districts studied by GAO some tutoring providers failed to contact teachers to align their tutoring services to school curriculum    GAO also found that providing services to  and ensuring adequate services for  students with limited English proficiency or with disabilities had been a challenge under the law   Both of these special populations are fully included in No Child Left Behinds testing and accountability requirements  Specifically  the GAO found        In about one third of school districts  less than 5 percent of tutoring recipients were students with limited English proficiency   In about two thirds of school districts  children with disabilities comprised less than 20 percent of students receiving supplemental educational services        One third of school districts reported a lack of tutoring providers equipped to meet the needs of limited English proficient students      One tutoring provider surveyed by GAO indicated that it was difficult to serve students with disabilities because it required significant changes to the tutoring lessons to meet their needs
