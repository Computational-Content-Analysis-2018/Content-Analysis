         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Mr  President  I oppose the Republican effort to strike the critical section of this bill requiring our troops in Iraq to begin to come home in 120 days and that we finish the job in 2008  This is a defining moment for our country   The American people are watching  and the world is watching    The issue is clear   Will we stand with our soldiers by ending their misguided mission and beginning to bring them home   Or will we stand with the President and keep our soldiers trapped in Iraqs civil war  History will judge us  We can either continue down the Presidents perilous path  or insist on a new direction   If we dont change course  we know what lies ahead  more American casualties  more deaths  more destruction  greater loss of respect for America in the wider world  and greater danger to our national security A new strategy that makes Iraqis less reliant on our military is the best way forward  More of the same misguided policy will result in more of the same tragedy for our military  We need a realistic strategy  and we need it now   Iraq is the overarching issue of our time   Our national security itself is at stake   In this debate  we hear echoes of the past    We are accused of cutting and running  We are accused of giving comfort to the enemy  We are told we need to be patient and to accept the importance of staying the course  We are told we have to give the latest escalation a chance to succeed  Listen to this comment from a high ranking American official   It became clear that if we were prepared to stay the course  we could help to lay the cornerstone for a diverse and independent AsiaIf we faltered  the forces of chaos would scent victory and decades of strife and aggression would stretch endlessly before us   The choice was clear   We would stay the course   And we shall stay the course  That is not President Bush speaking   It is President Lyndon Johnson forty years ago  ordering a hundred thousand more American soldiers to Vietnam    Here is another quotation   The big problem is to get territory and to keep it   You can get it today and it will be gone next week   That is the problem   You have to have enough people to clear itand enough people to preserve what you have done  That is not President Bush on the need for more forces in Iraq   It is President Johnson in 1966 as he doubled our military presence in Vietnam    Heres yet another familiar argument     We are not going to tuck our tail and run   Those are not President Bushs words   Those are the words of President Johnson in 1966      Heres another familiar argument   We are being steadfast in Vietnam because we dont want the next generation of Americans to have to fight another war   That is not President Bush  but it sure sounds like him   It is Vice President Agnew in December  1969  Heres another familiar argument being used in the Iraq debate by the stay the course Republicans that weve heard before    We think we can bring peace   We will bring peace   The peace that we will be able to achieve will be due to the fact that Americans  when it really counted  did not buckle  did not run away  but stood fast  That is not President Bush   Its President Nixon in September  1969    And heres another  If  when the chips are down  the worlds most powerful nation  the United States of America  acts like a pitiful  helpless giant  the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions throughout the world    Thats not President Bush   Those are the words of President Nixon in April of 1970  These words from the past resonate painfully in todays debate on Iraq   In Vietnam  the White House grew increasingly obsessed with victory  and increasingly divorced from the will of the people and any rational policy   The Department of Defense kept assuring us that each new escalation in Vietnam would be the last     We were told to be steadfast  to stay the course  and not to retreat     There was no military solution to that war   But we kept trying to find one anyway   In the end  58 000 Americans died in the search for it  Echoes of that disaster are all around us today   Iraq is George Bushs Vietnam  But weve heard all that in the current debate about Iraq as well    Weve heard for years that the administration has a plan for success  that progress is just around the corner  But the plans for success keep getting tossed aside for new plans    The Administration has benchmarks to measure success  but there are no consequences when the benchmarks are not met   The timelines for progress keep getting extended   Weve turned so many corners that weve ended up back where we started  trying to control Baghdad   Its time to change direction   3 200 members of our forces have been killed  and more than 24 000 have been wounded   The casualties keep mounting   The violence continues to spiral upward  Our troops are in the impossible position of trying to stabilize a country at war with itself   The recent National Intelligence Estimate confirms the nightmare scenario unfolding for our troops  Iraq is sliding deeper into the abyss of civil war  and our brave men and women are caught in the middle of it  Prospects for halting the sectarian violence are bleak   Greater chaos and anarchy are looming ahead  Needless additional U S  causalities are inevitable   The facts speak for themselves   According to the United Nations  nearly 35 000 civilians were violently killed in Iraq last year  Most were killed in Baghdad  where unidentified bodies killed execution style are found in large numbers daily  More than 2 million refugees have fled the violence in Iraq  and another 1 8 million have been displaced internally  Our military should not be caught in the middle of this quagmire    Only a political solution can solve Iraqs problems    General Casey  in his testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in June 2005  called for a political solution   He said  If you look back historically at how insurgencies have been defeated  they have been defeated when the insurgents saw their options as better protected in the political process and their prospects for economic advancement can be better protected by the political process than fighting for them   And thats the essential element here   Last August  General Abizaid spoke about the need for a political solution   He said  Our troops are the best equipped  the best trained  the best led in the world   And I am enormously proud of them  and I have the utmost confidence in their ability to handle any mission   Yet  sectarian violence is worse than ever in Baghdad in particular   And I wonder about the validity of a strategy that says that less capable troops that are not as well equipped  trained and led as the best troops in the world can handle the security of this country if the upswing in violence has occurred despite the presence of the best troops in the world   It doesnt give me a lot of confidence in our underlying strategy   And it suggests to me that what we need is a political rather than a military solution   General Petraeus  the new Commander of our forces in Iraq  recently emphasized as well that there is no military solution in Iraq   But no one in the Administration has been able to clearly articulate a political solution or how it can take hold in the midst of this chaos  Instead of giving the Iraqis a necessary incentive to get their political house in order by beginning an orderly redeployment of our troops out of Iraq  the President stubbornly insists on sending more and more American troops into Iraqs civil war  Escalation didnt work in Vietnam and it wont work in Iraq either   Even worse  the administration has not been honest about the number of troops the President plans to send to Iraq for the surge  On January 10th  he announced that hed committed more than 20 000 additional troops to Iraq  Within a few days  we were told the number was 21 500  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would be far higher  as much as 35 000 to 48 000 troops when support troops are included  On February 6th  I asked General Pace and Secretary Gates for the best military estimate as to the actual size of the escalation   Their answer was an additional 10 to 15 percent   General Pace said  you re going to need no more than another 2 000  2 500 troops on the ground Nine days later  the number more than doubled     General Schoomaker told the Armed Services Committee his estimate was somewhere between 5 000 and 6 000 troops when he included imbedded trainers   Then  on March 6th Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England told a House Committee about 4 000  maybe as many as 7 000    On March 7  at the request of General Petraeus  Secretary Gates authorized an additional 2 200 Military Police troops    We still dont have an accurate total for the size of this escalation  The Administration refuses to speak with clarity and candor    Since the current surge began  Shiite militias in Baghdad may be lying low  but violence has increased elsewhere in Iraq      In Diyala province  in just three months  American casualties have exceeded the number for the entire year of 2006  In January this year  83 American soldiers were killed  compared to 62 in the same month a year ago  80 more American soldiers were killed in February this year   In the same month last year  we lost 55 soldiers  In March  we have already lost 76 soldiers  compared to 31 in March 2006      Continuing our open ended commitment to stay in Iraq will not bring victory   It will not stop the violence  and it will not protect our national security    The Administration has outlined military  economic  and political benchmarks to measure success  But it has not given any timeline to achieve them  and it has not specified any consequences if the benchmarks are not met  This same Administration supported timelines for every Iraqi election and for drafting the constitution    Yet  it remains emphatically opposed to any timeline for the redeployment of our military       The American people have been patient   But America has now been in Iraq longer than it took us to win World War II  Instead of progress  we continue to see unacceptably high levels of violence  death  and destruction  Were putting too much strain on our Army  especially the Army National Guard   Our forces are overextended   Many soldiers are now on their 3rd rotation  In the long run  we cant protect our Army if we dont end the war  Our troops have done their part   They have served with great courage   Were proud of their service  and were ready to welcome them home    Its time to change course   Its time to insist that Iraqis step up to the plate and take responsibility for their own future  Its time to begin to redeploy our troops out of Iraq    Its time to put the Iraqis on notice that our military will no longer be a permanent crutch for them to lean on and avoid their responsibility to achieve a political solution   As General Abizaid told the Armed Services Committee last November  I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more  from taking more responsibility for their own future  The only practical way to accomplish the change that is long overdue is for American combat troops to begin to come home  Those of us who opposed the war are used to the Administrations attacks when we disagree with their wrongheaded policy   We have come to expect that   They have questioned our patriotism and called us defeatists   When we challenged the Presidents misguided policy  they accused us of having political motives and being partisan  But all of their criticisms have a hollow ring  because the Administration has been so consistently wrong about the war in Iraq  They were wrong about the link between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein  They were wrong about Saddam Husseins possession of weapons of mass destruction  They were wrong about America being greeted as liberators  They were wrong about the insurgency being in its last throes  And they are wrong to deny that Iraq is in a civil war The American people are far ahead of the Administration   For all of us who oppose this misguided war  our goals have always been clear   to protect the lives of our soldiers and to protect our national security  We have an obligation to stand up for our troops and stand up to our President when he stubbornly refuses to change course in Iraq     This legislation will do that   It will change the mission of our military away from combat and require the President to begin to redeploy American combat troops out of Iraq in four months    The target date for the completion of the redeployment is March 2008  one year from now   A limited number of troops would remain in Iraq after that  to train and equip the Iraqi Security Forces  to conduct counter terrorism operations  and to guarantee the safety of our soldiers       Legislation is clearly necessary to give the Iraqi Government enough incentive to step up to the plate  work out its political differences  and take responsibility for Iraqs future  Our proposal is consistent with the bipartisan Iraq Study Groups findings     It is also consistent with the wishes of the American people  who want most of our troops home within a year    How much clearer does it have to be before Republicans in Congress and the President finally respond to the voices of the American people  We are meeting our responsibilities by changing the mission of our military  We are not micromanaging the war  Many of us oppose the war  but all of us support our troops   We dont want to keep sending more and more of them into the middle of a civil war   Under no circumstances do we want them to go to war without proper armor and equipment    Our troops deserve better   Their families and loved ones deserve better     For the sake of our men and women in uniform in Iraq and the American people  its time for us to take a stand  We need to adopt a new strategy    We need to make clear to the Iraqi Government that the mission of our troops must change and that we have a clear timeframe for their departure from Iraq  The Senate will fail our troops unless we vote to change course and begin to bring our soldiers home      At the end of this debate  the American people will know where each of us stands   On our side of the aisle  we stand with the American people   The voters told us in November to change course and begin to bring our troops home  and thats what we want to do  We stand with our troops   We and we alone are the ones insisting on a policy worthy of their courage and sacrifice  We stand for protecting Americas national security    The war in Iraq has been a disaster from the start  It has made America more hated in the world  It has made it harder to win the war against terrorism  It has made it harder to work with other nations on every issue  Peace and progress in Iraq must be earned by Iraqis and their neighbors  We must no longer send our brave soldiers to an uncertain fate on the streets of Baghdad    We must begin to bring them home  to the heros welcome they have surely earned                                                                     Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224
