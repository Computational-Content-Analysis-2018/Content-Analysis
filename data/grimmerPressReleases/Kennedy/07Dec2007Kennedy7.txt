         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The torture debate took another deeply troubling turn yesterday   The nation learned the CIA had destroyed videotapes of its employees in the act of using torture or other harsh interrogation techniques on detainees        Those tapes were not shown to Congress   They were not shown to any court   They were not shown to the bipartisan 9 11 Commission   Instead  they were destroyed        What would cause the CIA to take this action   The answer is obvious    cover up   The agency was desperate to cover up damning evidence of their practices   In a letter to agency employees yesterday  CIA Director Michael Hayden claimed that the tapes were a security risk because they might someday leak and thereby identify the CIA employees who engaged in these practices           But that excuse wont wash   I am second to no one in wanting to protect the brave men and women of the CIA   But how is it possible that the Director of the CIA has so little faith in his own agency        Does the Director believe the CIAs buildings are not secure      Would it be beyond the agencys technical expertise to preserve the tapes while hiding the identity of its employees        Does the Director believe that the CIAs employees cannot be trusted not to leak materials that might harm the agency       Or does he know that the interrogation techniques are so abhorrent that they could not remain unknown much longer      It is particularly difficult to take the Directors explanation at face value when the news that these CIA tapes were destroyed came the very same week that we learned that as many as ten million White House emails have not been preserved  despite a law that requires their retention   At the same time  the President continued to insist that we grant immunity to the phone companies for their role in the illegal wiretapping of American citizens        The pattern is unmistakable   The past six years  the Bush administration has run roughshod over our ideals and the rule of law   For four of those six years  the Republican Congress did little to hold the administration accountable   Now  when the new Democratic Congress is demanding answers  the Administration is feverishly covering up its tracks   We havent seen anything like this since the eighteen and a half minute gap in the tapes of President Richard Nixon        These efforts are wrong  and they must be stopped   I and other concerned Senators will today call upon Attorney General Mukasey to immediately begin an investigation into whether the CIAs handling and destruction of these tapes violated the law        We also must redouble our efforts to make sure that future interrogations by the CIA conform to our laws and values   No part of our government should engage in practices that are so horrific that we cannot bear to see them on tape   To that end  I introduced legislation to require that all government agencies  including the CIA  follow the standards of the Army Field Manual        Language that would take that important step was recently included in the conference report on the Intelligence Authorization bill  and we must act to adopt it as soon as possible        As founder John Adams said  our nation is a nation of laws  not men   That basic principle is at risk today from an administration that is engaging in a cover up     systematically  destroying records  commuting sentences  and stonewalling Congressional investigations   The CIAs role in this cover up is only the latest reminder that Congress must fight harder to prevent this administration from making a mockery of the rule of law  and to preserve the right of the American people to know what the government has been doing in their name             Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
