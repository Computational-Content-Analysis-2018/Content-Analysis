         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  on May 1  2003  four years ago today  President Bush dressed up in a flight suit  flew out to the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln  and stood below a Mission Accomplished banner declaring an end to major combat operations in Iraq Three thousand one hundred ninety six American soldiers have been killed since the President took that arrogant and premature victory lap  including sixty nine from Massachusetts  For them  for their families and loved ones  and for the nation  the mission was far from accomplished  and still is Today  our military is bogged down in the quagmire of Iraqs civil war  with no end in sight  The Administration insists that we are making progress in Iraq  and that its so called surge must continue On April 20  President Bush spoke about initial signs of progress on the ground Just last week  he said  As the General will tell the folks on Capitol Hill  there s been some progress  There  been some horrific bombings  of course  There s also a decline in sectarian violence  In fact  there has been precious little progress  The only thing surging is the violence More than 100 American troops were killed in April  and 80 American soldiers were killed in January  February  and March of this year Sectarian violence in Baghdad continues unabated  According to a report on April 25 by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq  civilian casualties of the daily violence between January and March remained high concentrated in and around Baghdad  The violence is so serious that the Iraqi Government has refused to provide mortality figures to the United Nations   Attacks within the international zone are increasing Violence is spreading out of Baghdad and peaking elsewhere in Iraq  such as in Diyala province  Insurgents are using new and deadlier bombs  including chlorine gas bombs Iraqis are demonstrating in the streets against our occupation and demanding that Americans go home General Petraeus has proposed to divide Baghdad into gated communities based on sectarian lines Past reconstruction projects touted as signs of success are crumbling and failing to provide the health care  education  and other essential services so desperately needed by the Iraqi people  Shiite leader Sadr has withdrawn six members from Prime Minister Malikis cabinet  and the largest Sunni bloc of members is now threatening to withdraw as well We know that Prime Minister Maliki has made little progress on political reconciliation  despite the arrival of the tens of thousands of additional American troops that the Administration claimed were necessary for such progress Meanwhile  respect for American in the world continues to plunge to all time lows  We continue to alienate our friends in other nationas  and Al Qaeda and other enemies gain new support and new recruits for their terrorist attacks Despite all this  President Bush stubbornly clings to the false hope that success is just around the corner and the mission will be accomplished Weve heard it all before  Ending the rule of Saddam Hussein was supposed to lessen violence and bring a new wave of democracy to the Middle East  It hasnt  Saddam Husseins capture was supposed to quell the violence  It didnt  Three elections and the drafting of the constitution were supposed to be the breakthrough  They werent  The surge was supposed to bring the stability essential to political reconciliation and economic reconstruction  It hasnt and it wont  Only the Iraqi people can save Iraq  It is time for them to do so  American military force cannot solve the problems of the Iraqi people  It is time for the President to put the Iraqis on notice that our military will begin to withdraw  No one in the Administration can honestly tell the American people that we are making progress in Iraq  Its time the President listened to the Iraq Study Group  Congress  and the American people  and worked with us to bring our troops home  The President is wrong to veto the Iraq spending bill and reject its needed timeline for the orderly  responsible  and safe withdrawal of our forces from Iraq  He was wrong to lead us into the war  wrong to conduct it so poorly  wrong to refuse to change course  We cannot continue business as usual in Iraq  It is time for America to end its participation in the brutal civil war  The message from the American people couldnt be louder or clearer  Instead of defying the will of the American people  President Bush should listen to their plea and begin working with Congress to bring this tragic war to an end       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
