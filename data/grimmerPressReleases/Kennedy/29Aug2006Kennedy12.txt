         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        Fact Sheet Included    Washington  DC  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to divisive comments made today by Secretary Rumsfeld at the American Legion s national convention   Secretary Rumsfeld is the last person who should preach the lessons of history after ignoring them for the last six years  He s been consistently wrong since he rushed to war with a country that had nothing to do with the real threat to America    the global war on terror  As a result of his failures  Americans are less safe    Secretary Rumsfeld was wrong about weapons of mass destruction  wrong about the number of troops needed  wrong about the strength of the insurgents  and wrong to send our troops to war without the armor they need or plan to succeed   When it comes to the war in Iraq  there is no confusion among military experts  bipartisan members of Congress  and the overwhelming majority of the American people about the need to change course in Iraq  The only person confused about how to best protect this country is Don Rumsfeld  which is why he must go  And the Administration should focus on battling terrorists instead of battling the growing number of Americans calling for a change in policy in Iraq  RUMSFELD  JUST PLAIN WRONG ON IRAQ  WMD   He was wrong about weapons of mass destruction      There are a number of terrorist states pursuing weapons of mass destruction  Iran  Libya  North Korea  Syria  to name but a few  But no terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people and the stability of the world that the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq  Senate Armed Services Hearing  September 19  2002      K nowing what we know about Iraq s history  no conclusion is possible except that they have and are accelerating their WMD programs  House Armed Services Hearing  September 18  2002      No terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people than the regime of Saddam Hussein and Iraq    Senate Armed Services Hearing  September 19  2002     Iraq poses a threat to the security of our people and to the stability of the world that is distinct from others  In both word and deed  Iraq has demonstrated that it is seeking the means to strike the United States  our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction for a reason  so that it can acquire the territory of its neighbors  Reserve Officers Association  January 20  2003 Troops needed for the war   He was wrong about the number of troops we would need to secure the country     What is  I think  reasonably certain is the idea that it would take several hundred thousand U S  forces I think is far from the mark  Media Availability with Afghan President Karzai  February 27  2003    Because Rumsfeld underestimated the amount of troops needed to fight the war  massive looting occurred after Baghdad fell  In response to the mass chaos  he said stuff happens  Interview on CNN  April 11  2003  Insurgency   He was wrong about the strength of the insurgents  whom he repeatedly called dead enders     Until the regime is gone  until it s finally tipped  until there s absolute certainty that Saddam Hussein is not there any more  I suspect that some of these dead enders will be down there shooting people and doing that type of thing  That s basically what s going on  Department of Defense News Briefing  March 25  2003   They re making progress against the dead enders who are harassing coalition forces  Department of Defense News Briefing June 24  2003   I don t use the phrase guerrilla war is because there isn t one  and it would be a misunderstanding and a miscommunication to you and to the people of the country and the world  Department of Defense News Briefing  June 30  2003   The dead enders are still with us  those remnants of the defeated regimes who ll go on fighting long after their cause is lost  Lackland Air Force Base  August 25  2003   Coalition forces are continuing to root out dead enders and criminal gangs and foreign terrorists that are in Iraq  Department of Defense News Briefing  September 16  2003   It s not been a pacified country  if you will  but in a country where regime dead enders are still violently trying to stop progress    Department of Defense News Briefing November 25  2003   The dead enders  threatened by Iraq s progress to self  government  may believe that they can drive the coalition out through terror and intimidation  and foment civil war among Sunnis and Shias or block the path to Iraqi self rule  But they re badly mistaken  Defense Department Operational Briefing  April 20  2004   There is no popular uprising going on in Iraq right now  This violence  in my view  is a desperate attempt by frustrated  isolated groups  such as the insurgents in Fallujah and Sadr s thugs in Najaf  to derail the progress that we ve been making  Secretary Rumsfeld and Republic of Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan Media Stakeout  April 21  2004   The battle in Iraq today is not a fight between Iraqis and foreign forces    it is a battle between free Iraqis and the last remnants of a defeated regime  who still do not realize that their cause is lost    Department of Defense News Briefing December 3  2004 Humvees   He was wrong about shortchanging our troops with the armor they would need for protection against improvised explosive devices    It isn t a matter of money  It isn t a matter on the part of the Army of desire  It s a matter of production and capability of doing it  Kuwait  December 8  2004    You go to war with the army you have  Theyre not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time  Kuwait  December 8  2004   The Army never asked the companies producing armored humvees to work at maximum capacity  The Army s contracts didn t provide enough funds to keep Humvee production at maximum production  In August 2003  only fifty one Up Armored Humvees were being produced a month  It took the industrial base a year and a half to work up to making 400 a month  Now the Army says they can now get delivery of 550 a month    On June 20  2005  a report from the Marine corps Inspector General was published for Congress stating that about a quarter of the Second Marine Expeditionary Force s Humvees lack sufficient armor to protect troops against roadside bombings  including 1 000 vehicles that have yet to be fitted with armor plates to protect the undercarriage  The report also says that if the current demands in Iraq continue  the Corps will need another 650 Humvees  which have been logging an average of 480 miles a month  mostly over rough terrain  And despite an agreement with the Army to repair broken vehicles at a maintenance facility in Kuwait  the Marine Corps had not scheduled any repairs as of last month  Meanwhile  those Humvees that have received full armor    which the report says have significantly improved the safety of troops    are suffering excessive wear and tear because they were never designed to carry the additional weight  Boston Globe  June 20  2005 Troop Training He overstated the number of trained Iraqis   We re increasing international military participation in Iraq  We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces  now more than 200 000 strong  Senate Armed Services Committee  February 4  2004  U S  government agencies do not report reliable data on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped The departments of State and Defense no longer report on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are equipped with their required weapons  vehicles  communications  equipment  and body armor  GAO Report  Preliminary Observations on challenges in Transferring security Responsibilities to Iraqi Military and Police  March 14  2005     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
