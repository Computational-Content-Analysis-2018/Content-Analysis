         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  DC  Today  with a vote of 12  6  the Senate Judiciary Committee passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes the main provisions of the McCain Kennedy immigration reform bill  a guest worker program for foreign workers that provides an opportunity for earned legalization and a program for the 12 million undocumented workers in the United States that would allow for earned legalization  Kennedy believes that providing a path to citizenship is the only way to break the cycle of illegality  The measure is now set to move to the floor  in compliance with the deadline set by the Majority Leader The country has spoken  and today the Senate listened  Kennedy said in reference to the million people across the country who have rallied in support of such a plan  No issue goes to the heart of who we are as Americans more than immigration  This measure will strengthen our national security by protecting our borders more effectively  It reflects our values as a nation of immigrants deciding who can earn the privilege of American citizenship  And it s about our progress as immigrants contribute to our economic growth  I am proud of my colleagues for coming together in a bipartisan way to address this great challenge  Kennedy s guest worker measure creates a new temporary visa to allow foreign workers to enter the US  The visa is valid for 3 years  and can be renewed one time for a total of 6 years  It contains strong labor protections for all workers  visas for family members  a path to permanent residence and citizenship and a flexible market based cap  beginning at 400 000 Under the McCain Kennedy plan for the 12 million undocumented workers already in the United States  they can apply for temporary status for six years  must demonstrate past work history  pay a 2 thousand dollar fine  undergo rigorous background and security checks  learn English and American civics  make good on back taxes  and satisfy additional criteria  Then if they wait until everyone already waiting their turn is processed through system they can apply for a green card  It is not amnesty  as opponents of the measure contend  rather it would give immigrants an incentive to come forward and an opportunity to earn legal status The McCain Kennedy bill  which was introduced last May  is the only bipartisan reform measure and has earned broad and diverse support because of its common sense plan to strengthen border protection and enforcement while reflecting our best values as a nation    of fairness  equal opportunity  and respect for the law  It has the strong backing of the U S  Chamber of Commerce along with other business groups  labor unions such as SEIU  religious leaders and Hispanic advocacy groups  The bill s co sponsors include Senators Graham  Brownback  Lieberman  Salazar  Obama and Martinez Below are summaries of the guest worker provisions  KENNEDY TEMPORARY WORKER AMENDMENT  6375 Many sectors of our economy today rely on the hard work and contributions of immigrants  Their work is indispensable to the continued growth of the American economy  The nation s dependence on immigrants will be even greater in coming years The data clearly shows that immigrant workers are vital to our economy  Our current immigration laws are out of touch with current economic realities and have no way to meet future economic trends  According to the Pew Hispanic Center  more than 400 000 illegal immigrants arrive each year to work    and we need them to keep our economy growing  But current immigration law provides visas for only 5 000 lower skilled workers There is virtually no legal way for a foreign worker to enter the country and take a full time  year round job  With so few legal channels for foreign workers  the current system essentially guarantees an illegal flow  Businesses can t find the workers they need  Entire industries operate on the wrong side of the law  Millions of foreign workers live in the country illegally  The immigration system doesn t work for anyone  We can meet our labor needs by enabling employers to obtain a legal  reliable  secure supply of workers  making it unnecessary for businesses to resort to illegal workers  At the same time  by establishing an equitable temporary worker program with strong labor protections  fair wages  and portability  we will provide temporary workers with the same rights and protections as American workers  This formula will improve the working conditions for all workers Temporary workers will be able to bargain for wages and benefits just as U S  workers do  If they don t like their jobs or the way they are treated  they will be permitted to change jobs  They will have the same right that American workers have to join or organize a union  Employers hiring temporary workers will be required to comply with all federal  state and local labor laws  Senator Specter has created a generous temporary worker program that that has good labor protections  It will provide visas for foreign workers to come legally and safely to the U S  to fill jobs when Americans workers are not available The amendment builds on that foundation  making a few but important modifications  First  I strike the requirement that H2C workers spend at least 1 year outside the U S  before they are eligible to obtain an extension of their 3 year visa  This requirement is not beneficial to business or workers  Employers want to retain experienced and trained workers  Workers who have played by the rules should be allowed to extend their status  We grant this benefit to high skilled workers  Lower skilled workers should be treated the same  It also give temporary workers who have lost their jobs a little more time to find a new employer  The Specter bill only gives a worker 45 days  Kennedy s amendment extends it to 60 days  Sixty days is still significantly little time  The average length of unemployment for a lower skilled U S  worker is 16 weeks The amendment also strikes provisions in the Specter bill that curtail access to administrative and judicial review  We should not give unfettered discretion to an agency which is prone to make mistakes Senator Specter s Mark requires employers to pay a prevailing wage  Kennedy s amendment strengthens this requirement by precluding the use of unreliable private independent wage surveys  In order to make sure that these workers are paid fair wages and they don t undercut the wages of U S  workers  I require the payment of a prevailing wage rate under the Service Contract Act if it is a job is covered under that Act In order to ensure that H2C workers are covered by all federal and state employment and labor laws  I modify Senator Specter s definition of employer to also cover employees  Moreover I specify that that these terms have the same meaning as under the Fair Labor Standards Act Senator Specter s Mark establishes an administrative complaint process whereby the Secretary of Labor may review claims by aggrieved parties  including U S  workers  and award back pay and benefits to workers and impose penalties and fines on employers who violate the terms of the program  Kennedy strengthens this process by making sure that workers can bring complaints for violations of the worker recruitment requirements  attestation process and prevailing wage requirements  The last two changes are the most important  The Specter temporary worker program fails to include a cap on the number of H2C visas that may be issued in a given year  My amendment would impose a flexible market based cap  which would start at 400 000 per year  That number would gradually increase or decrease based on demand Finally  the amendment provides temporary workers with an opportunity to become permanent residents  should they chose to do so  An employer could petition for the temporary worker at any time  In the alternative  a worker who has worked for at least 4 years as a temporary worker could self petition to obtain permanent residence  provided he is admissible under our immigration laws   Laura Capps
