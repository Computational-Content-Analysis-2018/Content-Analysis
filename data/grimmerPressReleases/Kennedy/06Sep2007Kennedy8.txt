         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  This week  well pass the largest increase in college student aid since the GI Bill And it couldnt come soon enough Today  the average student leaves college with more than  19 000 in student loan debt We are a better nation than that    a nation that believes in promise and opportunity for all of our citizens  Our legislation begins to match our resources with our vision  It takes the fat from the banks and lenders and gives it back to students Twenty years ago  the maximum Pell Grant covered 55 percent of costs at a public four year college  Today  it covers only a third  As a result  students are sinking deeper and deeper into student loan debt Thats not acceptable  And were going to change that This bill will help students access college  afford college  and manage their debt  It includes support for students and families from the beginning of the college process to the end  The bill raises the maximum Pell grant  500 next year  and it will reach  5 400 by 2012  thats a  1 000 increase after years of a stagnant Pell grant under the Republicans The bill says your student loan payments will never exceed 15 percent of your monthly income  It says if you take a public service job  like a police officer or a public school teacher  your college loans will be forgiven after 10 years in that job It enables more of our neediest students to qualify automatically for the maximum Pell grant  and it helps working students by protecting more of their earnings from the financial aid process These investments are important to students because we know that a college degree can open new doors of opportunity to them  But its also important because it helps us train a generation of Americans to compete and win good jobs in the global economy  This legislation says to the nation loud and clear that when you vote for Democrats  you see results on the priorities that matter  We have heard you loud and clear and were listening  This week  well pass the bill  and well keep fighting until every student has the opportunity to go to college and achieve the American Dream       Laura Burton Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
