         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I commend Chairman Warner and Senator Levin for holding this briefing today  and I thank the witnesses for appearing before the Committee The question that must be addressed is whether and how national security was factored into this decision at every stage The American people need to have confidence that the port deal won t undermine national security and that the Administration isn t outsourcing our national security in a way that would do us harm The Administration isn t known for its competence in handling critical situations  The only surprise is that the Administration is surprised by the intense reaction of the American people Nearly four and a half years after 9 11  it s obvious that our ports continue to be extremely vulnerable  The 9 11 Commission warned that terrorists would look for opportunities like that to do harm as great  or greater  than September 11th Last December  the 9 11 Commission issued its final report  and reviewed federal efforts to implement its recommendations  The findings were an alarming indictment of federal failures  With respect to the nation s ports  it issued grades of D for critical infrastructure assessments and cargo screening If terrorists were attempting to sneak a nuclear explosive device into this country  they might include it in one of the nine million containers arriving at our ports every year  95 percent of which go uninspected Over the next ten years  the Coast Guard believes we will need at least  5 4 billion to secure our ports  Yet  the Administration only sought  46 million for port security in its 2006 budget  and its recent request for 2007 would actually eliminate the only grant program we have that is dedicated to port security If port security is not a top priority for our own government  how can we ever expect it to be a priority for a foreign government    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
