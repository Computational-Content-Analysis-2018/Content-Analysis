         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  We face a health care crisis and President Bush and the Republican Congress have been missing in action  Empty words from the President cannot mask a four  year record of failure The worsening crisis in health care is caused by skyrocketing costs  declining insurance coverage  and dwindling security for every family  Businesses    especially small businesses    find it increasingly difficult to provide decent coverage for their employees  Companies struggling with foreign competition are at an ever larger competitive disadvantage because of the constantly rising costs Under President Bush and the Republican Congress  the cost of health care in the nation has increased by almost half a trillion dollars in the past four years  Health insurance premiums are up 59   Three weeks ago  senior citizens were saddled with the largest Medicare premium increase in history  Every family is facing higher copayments and deductibles  Labor negotiations are exacerbated as employers try to shift more health costs to workers  or drop health benefits entirely The number of uninsured Americans has grown by more than a million a year since President Bush took office  to 45 million today  Five million jobs no longer offer health insurance  Every working American is just one pink slip or one employer decision to drop coverage away from being uninsured  Retirees worry about whether former employers are about to drop pension coverage for health care The Republican policies of un benign neglect are no longer sustainable  The price of continued inaction is simply too high Democrats are prepared to take to lead fighting for American families Our legislation  the Affordable Health Care Act  states our strong commitment as Democrats to end the crisis in health care that affects every family  It s a down payment on our commitment to quality  affordable health care for every American  and we will not rest until that goal is achieved Our bill doesn t solve all these problems but it is an important down payment  We provide tax credits to help small employers cover their employees We allow importation of safe and effective prescription drugs to bring down their exorbitant price  We encourage widespread adoption of health information technology to improve the quality of care and reduce its cost  The use of information technology can save as much as  140 billion a year in health spending  We give FDA additional power to require follow up studies to assure that approved drugs are safe  and It puts the Senate strongly on record against turning Medicaid into block grants to the states or cutting back the program  We guarantee affordable coverage for every child Affordable health care is a high priority for every family  and it s long past time for Congress to act  Senate Democrats are committed to guaranteeing the basic right to health care for all Americans  and when we say all  we mean all   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633
