         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  BOSTON  MA  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  today addressed students  professors and community members at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Compton Lecture in the Stata Centers Kirsch Auditorium  Senator Kennedy discussed the current politics of ideology that blockade important scientific discoveries in stem cell research and climate change  as well as new and improved approaches to fighting terrorism and expanding economic opportunity  Kennedy condemned the Bush Administrations political calculations to determine the nations best course of action  Kennedy also discussed the progress being made by the new Congress  and emphasized the importance of investment in education and the importance of giving students the tools they need to thrive in a global economy  Tragically  and dangerously    the Administration has developed a pattern and practice of ignoring or manipulating facts to achieve a desired political result  But  no matter how hard they try to create their own pseudo science and pseudo reality  in the long run  they will not succeed  The reality based community is alive and well  And were fighting back This week  the United States Senate voted overwhelmingly to reverse President Bushs prohibitions on stem cell research  If the President signs this legislation  it would open the doors to life saving discoveries in cancer  heart disease  Parkinsons and Alzheimers  President Bush vetoed the legislation last year  and it never became law  Prior to Wednesdays vote  Senator Kennedy and a bipartisan group of Senators  joined the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research  CAMR  in urging the Senate to pass this important measure  The Karl Taylor Compton Lecture Series was established in 1957 to honor the late Karl Taylor Compton  who served as president of MIT from 1930 48 and chairman of the Corporation from 1948 54  The purpose of the lectureship is to give the MIT community direct contact with the important ideas of our times and with people who have contributed much to modern thought      Remarks of Senator Edward M  KennedyMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyApril 13  2007 As Prepared for Delivery Let me begin with the one premise Im sure we can all agree on  that MIT reflects the best traditions of our country  Thats been true from its beginning  In 1859  Governor Nathaniel Banks proposed that the state donate lands for education  A citizens committee  led by William Barton Rogers  proposed an institute of technology because  they said  material prosperity and intellectual advancement are       inseparably associated They also believed in what they called the happy influence of scientific culture on the industry and civilization of nations  The founders of this great university understood that the spirit of scientific inquiry could serve a model for a more enlightened age  And the result of their vision has been a remarkable century and a half of leadership by MIT in producing scientists  engineers  and entrepreneurs who have changed the world  The political leaders who founded this university embraced progress  They valued independent academic inquiry  They believed that politics should be influenced and informed by science  not the other way around  They knew that a strong society must be an educated society  They understood that the never ending effort to form a more perfect union would always require a restless spirit that asks new questions and is not afraid of the answers  Ah  for those good old days  Today  it often seems that we live in less enlightened times than those that gave birth to MIT  We see governmental officials who reject independent academic inquiry  We find people in power who believe that political advantage  and not scientific truth  should inform public policy  We see leaders who undermine the human quest for knowledge by insisting that we stop asking questions and  blindly follow the leader instead  With this warped philosophy of government  truth is taking a beating  In fact  one aide to President Bush scoffed at those of us who are still part of what he called the reality based community  because we foolishly believe that solutions emerge from  the  judicious study of discernible reality  That s not the way the world really works anymore  he explained  Instead  and Im still quoting here     w hen we act  we create our own reality       That kind of skewed thinking has spread like a cancer in our current Administration  infecting every policy decision they make  Tragically  and dangerously    the Administration has developed a pattern and practice of ignoring or manipulating facts to achieve a desired political result  But  no matter how hard they try to create their own pseudo science and pseudo reality  in the long run  they will not succeed  The reality based community is alive and well  And were fighting back Just two days ago  I was proud to cast my vote in the United States Senate  again    in support of embryonic stem cell research and the hope it brings to millions of Americans  Yet this important research has been crippled for nearly six years by an Administration with a policy that is flawed and  frankly  nonsensical  I want to say at the outset that I understand and deeply respect the religious and moral opposition that some have to stem cell research  But  in my view  thats not what were talking about here  When you look closely  the administrations stem cell policy pays lip service to those concerns  but it does not truly reflect them  The administration would have us believe that their policy stems from a moral concern with the use of embryonic stem cells  But their actual policy allows federal funding for stem cell lines that were created before August 9  2001  Moreover  the Administration does not seek to outlaw stem cell research  It doesnt seek to close down fertility clinics  It doesnt seek to stop the fertilization and disposal of eggs in a laboratory  It just opposes the federal funding of stem cell lines created since August 9  2001  And whats the scientific or moral significance of that date  Nothing  Its simply the date the President first addressed the nation on the subject of stem cell research Without question  the United States is being put at a serious competitive disadvantage by failing to expand federal funded research this area  Our medical research capabilities have been the envy of the world  but we will be left out and left behind if we dont aggressively continue to explore this new frontier  As Prime Minister Toy Blair said last year  if America does not want stem cell research  we do  And so do countless other countries who see the promise of this research and understand    as the founders of MIT did    that intellectual advancement and material prosperity are inseparable A strong majority in Congress favors federal support for stem cell research  but  as of today  we do not have the votes to override a Presidential veto  So we look to you and applaud the commitment youve made through Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research  And we look to the Commonwealth and applaud the commitment that Governor Patrick has expressed  And we look to other states and institutions that have made that commitment  But we all understand that  to be truly competitive  we need the leadership and financial resources of the federal government  And we need federal leaders who do not allow political posturing to restrict scientific progress In addition to preventing new breakthroughs in medical research  this administration has also blocked patients from accessing existing treatments  The most stark example of this intrusion is found in the FDAs consideration of over the counter sales of the emergency contraceptive pill Plan B  In 2003  the FDAs professional staff recommended approval of over the counter sales of this drug  The relevant FDA scientific advisory committee also voted overwhelmingly that Plan B was safe and effective for women of all ages  But the White House allowed a narrow minority in its right wing base to drown out this scientific consensus  and it was not until August 2006 that the FDA finally approved over the counter sales of Plan B  We should not have been surprised by this attack on the use of science to help family planning  Two days after he was inaugurated  President Bush signed an executive order banning federal funds from going to international family planning groups that offer information about abortion  This action has been followed by years of derailing and defunding efforts to improve international family planning  despite its enormous potential to improve the health and lives of those in the developing world  The threat to scientific progress is not limited to medical research and treatment  Look  for example  at global warming  There is a strong consensus that global warming is being accelerated by the burning of fossil fuels  But  with the backing of its cronies in the oil and gas industry  the Administration decided to create its own reality on global warming  We now know from whistleblowers and investigations that scientific conclusions that did not match the Administrations political agenda have either been rewritten or ignored As James Hansen  Director of NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and an early voice on climate change  recently told Congress In my more than three decades in government  I have never seen anything approaching the degree to which information flow from scientists to the public has been screened and controlled as it has now That process involved allowing former oil industry lobbyists employed by the White House to edit EPA documents about global warming before they were released  A House Committee found earlier this year that those edits weakened critical conclusions about the scope and causes of climate change  They even deleted the statement that such changes are likely mostly the result of human activities  The Office of Management and Budget then insisted that these scientific documents    need balance  because global climate change has beneficial effects as well as adverse impacts  But  proving yet again the old adage that you cant fool all of the people all of the time  the Supreme Court  just last week  rejected the Administrations arguments for failing to regulate CO2 emissions  citing incontrovertible scientific evidence that greenhouse gases are contributing to global climate change  This is by no means the end of the story  but it is an enormous victory There are countless additional examples of the politicization of science  In just this mornings New York Times  Paul Krugman reports that a Presidential appointee at NASA       told a web site designer to add the word theory after every mention of the Big Bang  to leave open the possibility of intelligent design by a creator  The President himself has supported the teaching of intelligent design in our public schools  notwithstanding the enormous weight of scientific evidence against it  Unfortunately  we are fighting the war for truth on many other fronts    not just those public policy debates directly affected by science  The war in Iraq is perhaps the most prominent example  In September 2002  33 international security scholars  among them 4 MIT professors  representing some of the best minds in the world  signed a letter in the New York Times  explaining why war with Iraq would prove disastrous  I agreed with them  and am proud to have spoken out and voted against the war from the beginning  As Ive often said  its the best vote Ive cast in my 44 years in the United States Senate But  as we now know  even before the vote in Congress  President Bush had decided to go to war with Iraq  and Administration officials were busily collecting and twisting information to support that decision  According to a confidential memo written by a member of the British Government in July 2002  fully eight months before we invaded Iraq Bush wanted to remove Saddam  through military action       the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy  Just as with stem cell research and global warming  the decision to go to war was made first and the facts were retooled to support it  Those in the intelligence community or armed forces who refused to go along were ignored or fired  And too few in Congress asked questions  or tested the administrations assertions against available intelligence or the actual testimony of the Generals who appeared before Congress  Perhaps most egregiously  the Administrations political operation encouraged candidates to use the war as a political tool  attacking the patriotism of those who opposed the war or the Administrations rosy view of the situation on the ground This manipulation of our intelligence and political institutions has resulted in tragedy of unspeakable proportions  Mission Accomplished has become Mission Impossible  And yet the administration and its supporters continue to ignore the reality of a bloody civil war being fought before their very eyes  Fortunately  the American people and a bipartisan majority of both houses of Congress are facing reality and insisting that we begin to withdraw from Iraq  Over and over and over again  in the past six years  we have seen the triumph of politics over the public policy  Weve seen it at the Department of Justice  which has gone from being a bulwark of independence to being a political tool  Weve seen it when a mining industry executive was placed in charge of worker safety at the Mine Safety and Health Administration  Weve seen it when the lobbyist for the companies who manufacture consumer products is named to head the Consumer Product Safety Commission  And the list goes on This manipulation of governmental institutions for political gain not only breeds cynicism and erodes trust  but it also threatens the very foundations of our democracy But there is an antidote for this poison  and youve got it here at MIT  You understand that the answer to unquestioning uncertainty is not absolute certainty of our own  but a questioning spirit that seeks to find and follow the truth  The opportunity for investigation and innovation is what attracts so many students and researchers to MIT each year  Its the idea that a major breakthrough  a revolutionary discovery  or a new vision of society is just around the next corner  Its the idea that your intellect can be harnessed to make life better for others  That same kind of spirit is what attracts people to politics and public service  Its the belief in the power of an individual to make a difference  Its the willingness to persevere and to work through complex issues  It is the ability to understand and build on all that we have inherited from those who came before us  As both politicians and scientists know  difficult issues are not solved in weeks or months or even years  They are often the work of a lifetime  That is why I so deeply regret the lost opportunities of the last six years  But I also have great hope for the years just ahead  In Washington  we have begun to insist again on policies that are rooted in reality rather than ideology  And I know that MIT will be our partner in making science and public policy partners once again  Together  we will return to the great traditions that were at the heart of the founding of MIT a century and a half ago  At that very time  Alfred Lord Tennyson was giving voice to the spirit that we must reclaim today  to strive  to seek  to find  and not to yield  Thank you very much        Melissa Wagoner  Keith Maley  617  565 4472
