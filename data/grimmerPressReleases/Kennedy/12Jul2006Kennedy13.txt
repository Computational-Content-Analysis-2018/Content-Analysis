         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE              Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for calling this additional hearing on immigration reform     In recent days  weve witnessed a strong outpouring of support for strong  sensible  comprehensive immigration reform  reform that enhances enforcement  but also allows the 12 million undocumented immigrant families to earn their way out of the shadows and sets a course to meet our future workforce needs as well    Americans know that immigration is a complex challenge that calls for a comprehensive solution   We heard this in our hearing in Philadelphia last week from Mayor Bloomberg  religious leaders  and community leaders  We heard it from General Pace on Monday in Miami as he spoke so movingly of his immigrant heritage and the valor of immigrants who serve in our armed forces  We heard it from conservative leaders in the Wall Street Journal yesterday  when they called on Congress to pass comprehensive reform  And we heard it from the President of the United States last week as he spoke eloquently again on the importance of full reform to our security  our progress and our values   These leaders understand the urgency in this post 9 11 era of enforcing our borders and bringing illegal immigration under control  But they also know of the vital contributions that immigrants bring to our economy  our communities  our values  and our national strength    Yet  there are those in Congress who prefer to play politics with this issue  Instead of supporting realistic and comprehensive solutions to the immigration crisis  they put forward bumper sticker slogans that will leave us weaker and at greater risk  They suggest that all we need to do is build more walls and hire more border patrol agents and our immigration problems will just disappear    Americans know better and they expect responsible  comprehensive action  and now   Thats what this hearing is about    We have tried enforcement only approaches for the last 10 years  and they have failed  Weve spent more than  20 billion on border enforcement  But even after a decade of ramped up enforcement  undocumented immigration has doubled to nearly 12 million immigrants today    These are not just numbers  They are real people who love their families  practice their faith  and contribute to their communities  They are parents with children  because 1 6 million of the undocumented are children and three million American citizen children have undocumented parents  They work hard to support their families and  just like millions before them  they want nothing more than to live the American dream   We must also recognize that the challenge of addressing modern immigration challenges is made even more complex by the global economy  More than 12 500 trucks legally cross the border from the United States into Mexico every day  carrying  620 million in merchandise  There are 660 000 legal passenger crossings per day at the 35 Ports of Entry along the U S  Mexican border  Mexico is not only the largest country of origin for legal immigration  but also our second largest trade partner  Between a third and one half of all undocumented immigrants enter legally and remain here after their visas expire  No number of fences or walls will stop these flows   No one denies the need for additional enforcement at the border and  especially  at US worksites  But  the real debate is about whether we will create the conditions for enforcement to succeed  To win  we need not only to keep out those who would harm us  but to welcome those who will help us  The Senate bill has a plan to accomplish this goal  The House bill does not    The Senate bill lays the foundation for success by addressing the roots of todays crisis  too few legal visas to meet legitimate demands for family  and employment based immigration  As long as this basic imbalance exists  employers will seek workers any way they can and undocumented immigrants will always find a way to live and work in the United States    The Senate bill also includes a realistic and humane plan to deal with the millions of existing undocumented immigrants  We are not going to round up 12 million men  women and children and drive them across the border  Immigration reform cannot succeed without a realistic strategy to provide them with a path to earn the privilege of American citizenship    But we must act now   Time is not on our side   The number of undocumented immigrants grows by half a million a year   Once again  I thank our Chairman for this hearing and his leadership on this issue  and I look forward to hearing from todays witnesses       Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
