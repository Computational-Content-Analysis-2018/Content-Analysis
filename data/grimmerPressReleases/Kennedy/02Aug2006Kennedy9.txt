EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON NIE AMENDMENT  AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY   Mr  President  I intend to offer an amendment to require the Director of National Intelligence to task the intelligence community to prepare an updated National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq    The last time the NIE was updated was in July 2004    According to press reports  it outlined three possibilities for Iraq through the end of 2005   The worst case was civil war   The best case was an Iraq whose stability would remain tenuous in political  economic and security terms  Much has changed over the last two years and decision makers in the Executive and Legislative Branches urgently need an updated NIE   Since 2004  reports from the Departments of Defense and State and comments by Administration officials on security and stability in Iraq have been unconvincing  and it is essential to have an objective assessment of Iraq from the intelligence community   Our amendment would require the Director of National Intelligence to provide an intelligence assessment by October 1  two months from now   If he is unable to do so  he must provide a report outlining the reasons   The intelligence estimate required in our amendment would require an update on eight key issues   The first is sectarianism   We need an assessment from the intelligence community on whether Iraq is in a civil war now or is descending into civil war  and what will prevent or reverse a deterioration of conditions promoting civil war     The increasing sectarian violence  the ruthless death squads  the increasingly powerful privately armed militias  and the Administrations decision to send thousands more U S  troops to Baghdad are alarming   They underscore the urgency of obtaining an updated assessment from the intelligence community about current conditions so we can adjust our policy accordingly     The second issue that the new intelligence estimate should address is security  One of the key elements of that assessment should be the militias   Militias are the engines of civil war   All one needs do is look at Bosnia or Lebanon     As the violence in Lebanon demonstrates  political parties cant govern with one hand and use militias to terrorize civilians with the other   It didnt work with Hezbollah in Lebanon   It wont work with Hamas   And it wont work in Iraq  Prime Minister Maliki has acknowledged the militia problem  but he has not articulated a clear vision for how to tackle this critical issue  It is time for the new government to move beyond vague statements and develop a viable strategy to deal with the militias and prevent Iraq from descending into full scale civil war   On this critical issue  we need to know the intelligence communitys assessment of the likelihood that the Government of Iraq will obtain a commitment from the political parties to ban militias   We need to know the extent to which the Government of Iraq has developed and implemented a credible plan to disarm  demobilize  and reintegrate militias into government security forces   More broadly  we need an assessment from the intelligence community about whether Iraq is succeeding in standing up its own effective security forces  and what actions are needed to increase the prospect of that occurring   The third issue is terrorism   We need an assessment from the intelligence community about the extent of the threat from violent extremist related terrorism  including Al Qaeda  in and from Iraq  and the factors the intelligence community believes will address the terrorist threat   Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki told Congress last week that in addition to the challenge of sectarian violence  his country is the front line against terrorism   Is a majority of the violence in Iraq driven by the insurgency  rather than foreign terrorists   Is it still the case that less than 1  of the prison population in Iraq are foreign fighters     We need to know the current nature and extent of the terrorism threat   Just as important  we need the intelligence communitys assessment on what the Iraqis and we can do to counter this threat   Fourth  we need an assessment from the intelligence community about whether Iraq is succeeding in creating a stable and effective unity government  the likelihood that changes to the constitution will be made to address the concerns of the Sunni community  and the actions it believes will increase the prospect of that occurring   Fifth is economic reconstruction   We need an assessment from the intelligence community about whether Iraq is succeeding in rebuilding its economy and creating economic prosperity for Iraqis  the likelihood that economic reconstruction in Iraq will significantly diminish Iraqs dependence on foreign aid to meet its domestic economic needs  and the actions the intelligence community believes are needed to increase the likelihood of that occurring    Sixth is the future of Iraq   We need an assessment from the intelligence community of the optimistic  most likely  and pessimistic scenarios for the stability of Iraq through 2007   The future of Iraq is difficult to predict  but certainly the assessment provided in 2004 needs to be updated   We need to know what the intelligence community foresees now    Seventh is an assessment of the international presence in Iraq  including whether  and in what ways  the large scale presence of multi national forces is helping or hindering Iraqis  chances for success      Eighth and finally  we need an assessment of the extent to which our operations in Iraq are affecting our relations with Iran  Saudi Arabia  Turkey  and other countries in the region     A new National Intelligence Estimate is long over due   John Adams once said  Facts are stubborn things   It is abundantly clear that the facts matter   They mattered before the war and during the war  and they matter now  as we try to deal effectively with the continuing quagmire   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment
