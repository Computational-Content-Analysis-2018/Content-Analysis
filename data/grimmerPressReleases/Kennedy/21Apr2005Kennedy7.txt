supplemental spending bill for the war in Iraq to ensure that humvee production remains at its maximum level through the fiscal year  This money will ensure that this country keeps its promise to

unarmored humvee will provide enough protection to get them through their missions and back home    A quarter of all American deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan have been in unarmored vehicles  Kennedy

armored humvees has been increaseddue to Kennedy s tireless efforts on the Senate Armed Services Committeebut more resources are needed  Senator Kennedy has heard from countless parents who have received phone calls from their sons and daughters in the field begging for additional armoranything to affix to their vehicles as they patrol war torn areas in Iraq and Afghanistan  Kennedy adamantly believes that our soldiers and their families deserve more  Kennedy s amendment to the Supplemental bill will ensure that more parents will know their sons and daughters have the protection they need while defending our country    KENNEDY FLOOR STATEMENT ON HUMVEE ARMOR FOR OUR SOLDIERS SERVING IN IRAQ    In December  just a few months ago  the Secretary of Defense was asked by a soldier in Iraq why our troops were sent into battle with unarmored vehicles    It was a question on the minds of many Americans    especially those with sons  daughters  husbands  wives  friends  and neighbors who had answered their country s call and whose lives were on the line every day in Iraq and Afghanistan    Americans know how our troops have been fending for themselves by strapping plywood and scrap metal onto their vehicles  Our troops call them cardboard coffins  As one soldier who served in Iraq said  I would feel safer in a Volvo than I would in one of these  unarmored  Humvees    A quarter of all American deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan have been in unarmored vehicles  That means more than 400 brave Americans have died because they were sent into the line of fire unprotected  And thousands more have been injured or disabled for life    For our troops on patrol  every second counts  Every moment of delay puts their lives at risk  Yet  in a report issued to Congress just last month  the Government Accountability Office describes month after month after month of bureaucratic mismanagement in getting our troops the armored Humvees they need to stay alive and do their jobs  In fact  the GAO report found that the Army still has no long term plan to improve the availability of armored Humvees  The war in Iraq has been going on for more than two years  our troops are under fire every day  and they still don t have a plan    The Pentagon has asked American companies to increase production  The Army will tell you that as of last month  they now have 22 000 armored Humvees in Iraq    But the Pentagon has failed to provide armored Humvees at levels that meet the real security needs of our troops  On nine different occasions  we have asked the Pentagon for their requirements for armored Humvees  and nine times they have been wrong     And now the Pentagon wants to decrease the production of armored Humvees      Tell that to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and they ll let you know just how irresponsible that is    just as they told Secretary Rumsfeld on his trip to Iraq in December    Tell that to the family of James Sherill  a Kentucky National Guardsman who was killed in an unarmored vehicle just this month    Tell that to the families in Massachusetts who have lost loved ones in Iraq    Tell that to the tens of thousands of dedicated men and women in uniform about to serve their second and third tours there  Tell them they may have to ride into the danger zone yet again without enough armor    We know that American companies can produce more     Armor Holdings    the company that makes the armored Humvee    told my office this morning that their current contract with the Army will mean sharp reductions  Right now  they make 550 armored Humvees a month  Their Army contract cuts that to 239 in June  zero in July  40 in August  and 71 in September  The company is negotiating with the Army for slightly higher levels of production for June  July  and August  but still expects to decrease production to 71 by September    The Pentagon keeps saying  We ll work it out  There are even those in the United States Senate who say  We ll work it out in conference    We cannot let the Department of Defense get it wrong a tenth time  For the sake of our troops  Congress needs to act    and act now    to get it right    The House of Representatives seems to understand this  A year ago  House Armed Service Committee Chairman Duncan Hunter accused the Army of having a case of the slows  The House is keeping up the pressure to produce more armored Humvees for our troops  They added  230 million to the House version of this bill    Now  the Senate needs to do its part  too  by adopting the Bayh Kennedy amendment    Our troops continue to serve our colors proudly today    right now    in Iraq and Afghanistan  They continue to perform their duties with heroism and great risk  They are maintaining their commitments  We must maintain ours by adopting this amendment   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
