         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement applauding the Finance Committee for moving forward with the reauthorization of the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP   Ten years ago  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Senator Orrin Hatch created the program that has since provided health care for tens of millions of children  In 2006  covered 6 7 million kids  Today  the Finance Committee will discuss CHIP reauthorization language Senator Kennedy said  This bipartisan plan means peace of mind for millions of American families as it will enable millions more children to grow up healthy and strong  I commend the Finance Committee for its leadership putting aside partisanship for the sake of needy children in the same spirit as when Senator Hatch and I worked together on the initial CHIP program in 1997  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this out of the Senate and then to working with the House to finish job for our Americas children  I urge President Bush to back down from his threat to veto this vital piece of legislation  and to put the health of children and the peace of mind of their parents before partisan politics CHIP provides states with federal matching funds to cover uninsured children of families with incomes that are above Medicaid eligibility levels  States receive an enhanced federal match for the CHIP program  this federal match is significantly higher than the federal match that states receive through the Medicaid program as an incentive for states to provide coverage for low income children who need it All 50 states and the District of Columbia have CHIP programs Below is additional information on CHIP  including the cost of CHIP in comparison to the war in Iraq and tax cuts imposed by the Bush administration  CHIP  A Matter of PrioritiesThe Senate Finance Committee is considering a bipartisan agreement that would add  35 billion to the Childrens Health Insurance Plan  CHIP  over 5 years  Secretary Leavitt has stated that the President will veto the Finance Committee agreement and has characterized the 61 cent tobacco increase  which would fund the program  as neither necessary nor advisable   The War in Iraq costs approximately  10 billion per month For 3 5 months in Iraq we could fully fund the Finance committee CHIP proposal to provide coverage to over 4 million children over 5 years   For the cost of 6 weeks in Iraq  we could cover every child in America who is eligible for CHIP or Medicaid  For one month in Iraq we could cover the current total cost of CHIP for over a year   President Bushs CHIP proposal only asks for the equivalent of 2 weeks in Iraq to cover Americas kids  And thats  8 billion less that whats needed to keep all current children covered  Through 2006  the President enacted  1 9 trillion in tax cuts over a 10 year period   In 2007  the wealthiest 1  will receive  72 6 billion in tax cuts  By rolling back tax cuts for the extremely wealthy for just one year  we could fund the 5  year CHIP proposal twice over and still have change to spare CHIP FACT SHEET CHIP currently covers about 6 million children throughout the course of the year  with about 4 million children enrolled at any point in time  About 9 million children remain uninsured  About 6 million of these uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP  but unenrolled  Before CHIP was enacted in 1997  about 23  of children were uninsured  Today  that number has dropped to about 15 6   Significant declines in infant mortality  8 5   and childhood deaths  5 1    as well as reductions in low birth weight  7 8    have been attributed directly to expansions in eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP 1 Studies of CHIPs impact have found an association between enrollment in the program and improved school performance among low income children  Improvements include increased school attendance  greater ability to pay attention in class  and increased ability to participate in school and normal childhood activities 1 27 and the District of Columbia cover children up to 200  of poverty 8 states do not cover children to at least 200  of poverty 15 states cover children at incomes above 200  of poverty   40 000 for a family of four in 2007  Additionally  in June  Senators Kennedy and Hatch released principles to guide the reauthorization process  The principles are included below  Kennedy Hatch CHIP PrinciplesChildren must be the primary focus of the CHIP program  Six million of the nine million American children who are currently uninsured are eligible but not enrolled in public coverage through Medicaid or CHIP  We propose providing the resources needed to states  local communities  schools  faith based organizations  Indian tribes and safety net providers for outreach to eligible children and populations  and enrolling them in Medicaid and CHIP  We propose innovative outreach and enrollment efforts  especially those focused on hard to reach populations  including minority and underserved children  and those in rural areas and inner cities  Incentive grants would be given to states which lower the number of uninsured children who are eligible for CHIP We propose the simplification of the enrollment and renewal process which often serves as a barrier for families seeking to enroll their children in CHIP We propose adopting national pediatric quality standards to measure the quality of care that children receive through the CHIP program  We believe that a good starting point would be S  1226  the Children s Health Care Quality Act We support states in their efforts to prevent childhood obesity  to provide access to mental health services  and to promote oral health  good nutrition and physical activity among children  Incentive grants may be used to cover these benefits at the option of the states We propose eliminating existing barriers that make it difficult for states to provide premium support through CHIP for children in families with qualifying incomes that have access to employer sponsored coverage  We propose evaluating the current five year exclusion of lawful immigrant children and giving states the option of covering these children We propose giving each state the flexibility to determine the federal poverty level of the children who would be covered under its state CHIP program The current system of allocating CHIP funds should be better targeted  We now have a decade of experience with the program  and with the knowledge of state spending gained  we propose allocating funds based on the individual needs of each state  No state should be allowed to retain federal CHIP dollars while doing little to actually cover eligible children  In addition  no state should be faced with closing enrollment or dropping children from the program because of a shortfall of available federal funds We propose authorizing and appropriating sufficient funding for CHIP in order to maintain current CHIP enrollment and to enroll those children who are currently eligible but not enrolled in the program  Funding should be increased to account for increases in health costs and increases in enrollment and eligible children We propose funding the CHIP program through tobacco taxes       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
