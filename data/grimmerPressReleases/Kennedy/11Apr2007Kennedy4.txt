         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   BOSTON  MA  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  along with the entire Massachusetts Congressional Delegation  urged Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez to declare a fisheries resource disaster for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  On Monday  Governor Deval Patrick formally requested the declaration to account for economic losses for commercial groundfishermen  A declaration would allow federal assistance to become available for Massachusetts fishermen  Senator Kennedy said  Massachusetts fishermen need immediate relief to survive new restrictions and to avoid a total collapse of the groundfish industry  The state has made a compelling case to support a fishery disaster declaration  and I urge the Dept  of Commerce to provide the declaration as quickly as possible  so that immediate steps can be taken to remedy the economic losses          The Honorable Carlos GutierrezSecretaryU S  Department of CommerceWashington  DC 20230 Dear Secretary Gutierrez  Were writing to express our strong support for the fishery disaster declaration request by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  and we respectfully request that you issue this declaration as quickly as possible  On February 21  Governor Deval Patrick wrote you expressing the Commonwealths intent to seek a declaration of economic disaster on behalf of its commercial groundfishermen   On April 9  he submitted a report to the Commerce Department documenting the economic disaster   The report found an 18 percent loss in groundfish fleet revenue since the implementation last year of Framework 42 to the Northeast Multi species Fishery   The Massachusetts reports findings track closely with NOAAs report  An Examination of the Potential Impact on All Affected and Interested Parties of Framework 42 to the Northeast Multi species Fishery Management Plan  which was completed in January pursuant to Section 215 of Public Law 109 479  the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act   NOAAs report estimated that Massachusetts vessels will lose 20 percent of income under Framework 42    Framework 42  which was implemented in November  places new restrictions on fishery catch and requires reductions in allotted days at sea   The changes have been devastating to the groundfishing fleets of Gloucester  New Bedford  and the Cape and Islands of Massachusetts  since more than a quarter of these vessels fish exclusively inside areas where the new regulation orders each day at sea to be counted twice   As a result  many of these fishermen now have just 24 days to fish during a season   The hardship is particularly acute for the many small boat fishermen who cannot safely fish beyond the inshore areas where each day at sea is counted twice    Framework 42 is not limited to Massachusetts  but our state is potentially the most adversely affected  since half of the 800 active groundfish vessels in the Northeast are based in Massachusetts  and three quarters of the Massachusetts groundfish fleet are small and medium size vessels   The Massachusetts groundfish fleet has declined from 572 vessels in 2000 to just 400 in 2005  and the decline was steepest for small and medium sized vessels  which fell by 35 percent  Massachusetts fishermen need immediate relief to survive the new restrictions and avoid a total collapse of the groundfish industry  We believe the state has made a compelling case to support a fishery disaster declaration  and we urge you to provide the declaration as quickly as possible  so that immediate steps can be taken to remedy the economic losses   With respect and appreciation  and we thank you for considering our request  Sincerely    Edward M  KennedyJohn F  KerryEdward J  Markey Barney Frank Richard E  Neal John W  Olver Martin T  Meehan James P  McGovern John F  Tierney Bill Delahunt Michael E  Capuano Stephen F  Lynch          Keith Maley  617  565 4472
