         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement   Its deeply disturbing that it takes a close election  not in Iraq  but in America  to get this White House to even talk about flexibility and changing course   American and Iraqi deaths didnt do it   The growing insurgency and increasing sectarian violence didnt do it   The conclusion in April by our intelligence community that the Iraq war is a rallying cry for anti American extremism didnt do it   Only the prospect of losing his rubber stamp Congress and the Presidents own low polls seem to penetrate the wall of denial around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue   Sadly  the bottom line is that it s still a stay the course strategy from the White House   The President may have abandoned the label but he has not abandoned the failed strategy    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
