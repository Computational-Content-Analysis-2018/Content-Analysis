         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing on North American Border Security  Senator Kennedy addressed the need for comprehensive immigration reform and cooperation from Mexico and the Central American countries  The McCain Kennedy  Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act provides common sense solutions to fix our broken immigration system  beginning with strengthening alliances and requiring more from Mexico and other countries     Kennedy acknowledged that without cooperation from neighboring countries  immigration reforms adopted unilaterally by the United States are less likely to succeed Bilateral and multilateral agreements provide a framework for cooperation and are more likely to result in secure borders and safe and legal immigration     It s essential that we work with Mexico and Canada on migration problems and enforcement  A major mistake we made in the past is to assume we can control illegal immigration on our own  Senator Kennedy said in his testimony  America needs to do its part  but Mexico and other nations must do their part  too  to replace illegal immigration flows with regulated  legal immigration     Since the McCain Kennedy bill was introduced on May 12  Senator Kennedy has personally discussed the legislations with several Mexican officials who are now receptive to bill  The legislation contains important provisions from Chairman Lugar s legislation    the North American Cooperative Security Act    to address North American cooperation     Specifically  the McCain Kennedy bill would     Require foreign countries to enter into migration agreements with the U S  that help control the flow of their citizens to jobs in the U S   with emphasis on encouraging the re integration of citizens returning home  Encourages the U S  government to partner with Mexico to promote economic opportunity back home and reduce the pressure to immigrate to the U S   Encourages the U S  government to partner with Mexico on health care access so that the U S  is not unfairly impacted with the costs of administering health care to Mexican nationals   Below are Senator Kennedy s remarks from today s hearing      Statement of Edward M  Kennedy Hearing by the Foreign Relations Committee  North American Cooperation on Border Security  As Prepared for Delivery    Mr  Chairman  thank you for the opportunity to testify on the importance of improving cooperation among the North American governments on border security and immigration reform     The United States  Canada  and Mexico have a proud history of friendship and mutual cooperation  Our countries share the world s longest non militarized borders and we are historically and economically interdependent     After September 11th  our governments worked closely together to increase coordination and communication to address terrorist threats  We entered into numerous accords to share intelligence and strengthen border security  These were important achievements that have helped to make us all safer  but much more needs to be done  I m particularly concerned that we have done little to address the long standing problem of illegal immigration     In the last 10 years  we have spent more than  20 billion to enforce our immigration laws  Yet  our efforts have not been adequate  We ve tripled the number of border patrol agents  and tried countless measures to strengthen border enforcement  We are even building a fence  Yet  illegal immigration continues  The proof is in the numbers    nearly 11 million persons are living in the United States without authorization  Those already here are not leaving  and new immigrants keep coming in    Every year  thousands of Mexicans and others come to the United States  to work and join their families  Illegal immigration has been averaging 485 000 persons a year  To deal with the growing numbers of unauthorized workers  we have to modernize our laws to meet the challenges of the 21st century  Reforming our immigration laws will improve the security of each of our countries  strengthen our economies  restore control over our borders  and end the rising number of deaths     It s essential that we work with Mexico and Canada on migration problems and enforcement  A major mistake we made in the past is to assume we can control illegal immigration on our own  America needs to do its part  but Mexico and other nations must do their part  too  to replace illegal immigration flows with regulated  legal immigration    Mexico s southern border is increasingly being used as a transit corridor for third country nationals attempting to enter the United States illegally  The Border Patrol estimates that they will apprehend nearly 150 000 non Mexicans crossing our southern border this year   a 200 percent increase over last year  We need to work with Mexico to put an end to this problem  We also need to work with Canada and Mexico to help the Central American countries maintain the security of their borders     Without cooperation from neighboring countries  immigration reforms adopted unilaterally by the United States are less likely to succeed Bilateral and multilateral agreements provide a framework for cooperation and are more likely to result in secure borders and safe and legal immigration     The overwhelming majority of people crossing illegally into the United States are from Mexico  Central America  and the rest of Latin America  They come here seeking work and an opportunity to help their families  The United States should enter into agreements with these countries to help control the flow of their citizens to jobs here  and encourage the re integration of their citizens returning home  We must restore the circular migration patterns that once existed between the United States  Mexico  and other Central American countries    We cannot continue to throw money at border enforcement as our primary means for reducing illegal immigration  Nor can we continue to legislate more and more enforcement measures on top of a broken system  We need realistic immigration laws that provide legal means for qualified immigrants to enter America  and strong enforcement of those laws  By restoring control of our borders  we will also improve our national security and strengthen our economy     Three essential components of any effective proposal for reform are a fair and generous temporary worker program  an earned legalization program for undocumented workers  and reform of our immigrant visa system  These measures will reduce the current illegality and chaos and provide safe  legal  and orderly avenues for persons to enter the United States  They will also free up resources to allow our border agents to focus on terrorists  drug smugglers  and violent criminals     We must also encourage the U S  government to partner with Mexico to promote economic opportunity in Mexico and reduce the pressure for its citizens to emigrate  The special relationship between our two countries will be strengthened if we assist the government of Mexico in improving the lives and raising the standard of living of its people     John McCain and I have included all of these proposals in our bill    the Secure America Act  Our bill also contains important provisions that we have included from Chairman Lugar s legislation    the North American Cooperative Security Act    to address North American cooperation  Effective enforcement of our immigration laws depends upon the participation and commitment of neighboring governments     Thank you for the opportunity to testify  and I look forward to working with you to enact these responsible and long overdue reforms to deal with these main challenges   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
