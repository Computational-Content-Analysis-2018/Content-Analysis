for everything  and for asking us to share this beautiful evening here with you in Simi Valley  I understand an important month is coming up for the Library  as you prepare to host the first Republican Presidential Debate of the 2008 campaign  and later your first Annual Mothers Day Brunch As for the first event  Im afraid I wish you    or at least the Republican candidates    only moderate success  But I assure you that the Kennedys are with you 100 percent on the importance of Mothers Day I have so many wonderful memories of President Reagan  a President great in purpose who has a high place on the mountaintop of history  I recall not just the accomplishments  but the kind of man he was  He was always a good friend and a gracious foe I came to understand the generosity of the man just months into his Presidency when he brought the Kennedy family to the White House to present Ethel with the Congressional Gold Medal for my brother Bob  It was an early and powerful demonstration of the largeness of spirit that infused his Presidency and his life  and it was a day none of us in our family will ever forget  A few months later  my mother came to the White House to thank President and Mrs  Reagan personally  and they were especially gracious  Mother gave him some of Jacks letters about football and Notre Dame  she knew President Reagans background and he made a point of showing her that he was still using the same White House desk that Jack had used as President Mother then mentioned that she had first visited the White House as a young girl in the 1890s  when William McKinley was President  President Reagan didnt miss a beat  He said  Mrs  Kennedy  when I ran against Pat Brown  he claimed I had the same platform as William McKinley I started to laugh  and he immediately said  Dont laugh  Senator  McKinley freed Cuba Thats the kind of man he was  a strong competitor who wanted to win  not just for himself  but for his beliefs  He wanted to defeat his opponents  but not destroy them  Our battles on the issues might resume the next morning  but we could laugh together at the end of the day  Whatever our differences  we were all united by our love of country and its ideals  I believe he always retained the essence of the idealism that inspired him long before he ran for office  In 1947  he joined Americans for Democratic Action soon after its creation  James Loeb  a union leader and one of its founders  wrote him a letter  Dear Ronnie  It was an encouraging experience to have had a chance to talk to you and to know there are people in your position who share so completely a liberal point of view His point of view may have changed  but the idealism never did  And neither did his vision of hope that enabled this landmark conservative ultimately to transcend the political categories and stand as quintessentially American In June of 1985  in another act of generosity  President and Mrs  Reagan came to my home outside Washington for a dinner to support the new Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston  In his remarks that evening  he made a beautiful observation about my brother which captured Jacks spirit perfectly  He said Jack seemed to grasp from the beginning that life is one fast moving train  and you have to jump aboard and hold on to your hat and relish the sweep of the wind as it rushes by  You have to enjoy the journey  its unthankful not to Those words apply to Ronald Reagan himself  At an age when many were slowing down  he jumped aboard the fastest train of all  not as a passenger content to watch the scenery  but as the engineer determined to lead the country on a journey to the shining city on a hill that was a touchstone for him as well as for President Kennedy  In the 1980s  I was on that train  too  and it was a great ride  Much of the time  its fair to say  I was doing what I could to steer in a different direction  We disagreed on many things  But we agreed the United States is a beacon of light for people across earth  What we had in common was far greater than what divided us  It was the idea of America For most of us born and raised here  its sometimes hard to grasp what the idea of America has meant to the billions of people who have looked at us from afar throughout our history  But President Reagan and President Kennedy understood it  honored it  enriched and advanced it  They recognized that Americas commitment to liberty  opportunity  and the rule of law is still a revolutionary idea  They each had faith that Americas best days lie ahead  and that our true power in the world depended on our fealty to our countrys founding ideals Today  we need to recapture the spirit that these two leaders personified if we are to make this new century the next American century  We live in challenging and perilous times  but that fact is hardly new in the American experiment  Every fall semester  John Lewis Gaddis  one of our foremost historians  teaches the Cold War to undergraduates at Yale  few of whom have any memory of the days he describes  He writes  When I talk about Stalin and Truman  even Reagan and Gorbachev  it could as easily be Napoleon  Caesar  or Alexander the Great  To these students  the Cold War at first seems distant and quaint  They wonder  says Gaddis  how we could have had anything to fear from a power that turned out to be as weak  as bumbling  as temporary as the Soviet Union  But the more they learn about those perilous years  the more they wonder  How did we ever make it out of the Cold War alive  The challenge then was enormous  After we defeated fascism in the Second World War  we were faced with a Europe in which tens of millions were close to economic and social despair  The rise of the Soviet Union and the dawn of the nuclear age required a new definition of national security  one that for the first time in history had to deal with a potential threat to human existence itself  We had to meet the threat with both resolve and wisdom  We had to build what President Kennedy called in his Inaugural Address a grand and global alliance for freedom  We had to be strong across decades  abroad and at home We began with the Marshall Plan and NATO  We committed our resources to the regeneration of Germany and Japan  now among the worlds most vigorous democracies And because we knew from the start that it would take more than armed force and economic aid to preserve peace and defend liberty  we adopted the G I  Bill of Rights to educate the veterans returning from the frontlines of war  Those G I s became the new front lines of unparalleled prosperity  We established academic exchange programs so that young scholars from around the world could study at American universities  We built libraries and cultural centers in countries where information had been tightly controlled   We translated the Declaration of Independence  the Constitution  and the works of Americas greatest authors into dozens of languages and sent them everywhere as compelling ambassadors of the idea of America  We broadcast Americas story to audiences wherever freedom was endangered or denied In that same spirit  President Kennedy created the Peace Corps  calling on Americas youth to sacrifice their energies and time and toil in the cause of world peace and human progress  We were a nation blessed with human and financial resources we could send across the globe to help shape a more hopeful future  and we did  Nearly 190 000 Americans have served in the Peace Corps  Today  almost 8 000 volunteers serve in 67 countries  including many on the other side of what was once the Iron Curtain  Each of them is America at its best  making better the life of the world  As the arms race mounted  so did our unprecedented effort to inspire others to embrace our values of peace  democracy  and fundamental human dignity  Here at home  we worked to help our own nation to live up to its principles for every American  We breathed new life into the idea  and the ideal  of America   We outlawed racial segregation  guaranteed equal access to public facilities and the right to vote  prohibited job discrimination because of age  race  or gender  opened the door to higher education for women  multiplied the middle class  acted  however imperfectly  to combat the poverty of the other America  and brought decent health care to tens of millions of senior citizens with the passage of Medicare  America lifted itself up at home as it served and saved the cause of liberty in the world  The Cold War ended with the utter collapse of the Soviet Union  It had been waged as a bipartisan enterprise by Republican and Democratic Congresses and Administrations from the first moment to the last  There were disagreements over tactics  to be sure  but unanimity in our resolve to contain and defeat democracys greatest enemy  And President Ronald Reagan deserves immense credit for the success we finally achieved  the greatest victory for liberty against the gravest threat of tyranny  President Reagan foresaw it and called for it  and Mr  Gorbachev did tear down that wall  In his farewell address to the nation in January 1989  Ronald Reagan described not only the end of the Cold War  but another of the singular triumphs of his presidency   the recovery of American morale  I believe he was right when he said America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership  Other nations understood that the best guarantee of peace and stability would be for the United States to live up to its ideals as a beacon for the rest of the planet  We were admired for our democracy and respected for our economic strength Today the situation is very different from the world President Reagan left us  We are sadly diminished  even in the eyes of our friends  Anti Americanism is on the rise  We seem to have lost our way  our vision  and our confidence in the future  Others have stopped listening to us the way they once did  We have strained the extraordinary alliances that advanced our ideals as well as our interests  At the root of much of the anti Americanism that has surfaced in recent years is the perception of American unilateralism in international affairs  I am astonished when some say it does not matter that so many in the world no longer respect the United States  Of course it matters  It matters to our security  and it has mattered since the first days of our Republic  In the opening paragraph of the Declaration of Independence  Thomas Jefferson acknowledged the importance of a decent respect for the opinions of mankind  That quality is as true today as it was when our founders signed the declaration affirming it on that first Fourth of July  To restore Americas standing and strength  we must recapture that combination of realism and idealism which motivated John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan to jump aboard that fast moving train  We need to understand that the great challenges facing our fragile world require an abundance of hope that only a united and determined America can provide  America has to lead  America has to inspire The new sense of insecurity after 9 11 has led some to say all we need is to build a bristling fortress with higher walls  and shut ourselves off from the world to keep the danger out  But in an era when the oceans no longer protect us  that approach will not provide true security  We must recall and believe President Reagans famous words in Berlin  Democracy builds bridges between peoples  It tears down walls  In Iraq  we have acted nearly alone  and we are paying a terrible price  Yet earlier this month  tens of thousands of Iraqis marched against us  demanding an end to what they denounced as American occupation  I opposed the war in Iraq  and have called for setting a course to end it  precisely because this war profoundly weakens America  Ending it is essential to our security and to regaining the respect of the world We have learned again  as President Reagan told us  that might alone cannot make America right  We cannot prescribe our own rules for the modern world  If we try to do so by force  we deprive our great nation of the moral claim that is the ground of our being and the purpose of our power We can and sometimes must defend democracy by force  but we cannot impose it by force  Democratic principles are universal  but democracy must find its champions within each countrys culture and traditions  We need to seek common ground with our friends and renew the alliances that kept the world safe for human rights and human survival when the threat of nuclear war was a clear and present danger  We will always defend our interests  but we put them at grave risk when we choose to act unilaterally in an interdependent era  The unconventional warfare used by our enemies mocks any conventional war strategy that we stubbornly pursue on our own We live in a time of enormous possibility and enormous risk  and no nation is guaranteed a limitless future of prosperity or security  We have to work for it  We have to sacrifice for it  Presidents from Truman to Reagan defended our liberty and our security in concert with our allies  with a clear eyed appraisal of our interests and our capacities  and with a sense of overriding principle  And they prevailed They understood as well that strength is not just something we exercise overseas  but something we must build here at home  And they understood that our greatest national strength is found in our people  Building our strength here at home means providing education that will empower our people with the skills they need to compete in the global economy  Technology has liberated highly educated workers in other lands to engage actively in the international economy  We must meet that challenge  We must also strengthen our nation by meeting the urgent challenge presented by illegal immigration  The world is watching how to see how we respond  whether we can achieve a forward looking reform that enriches our nation with the dedicated talent of new Americans  or whether we succumb to fear and recrimination  There is much common ground on the issue in Congress  especially on the need to strengthen our borders and enforce our laws  What we need now is a good faith effort to reach a larger compromise that honors our commitment to our security  to our families  and to the ideals upon which America was founded  President Bush supports that kind of comprehensive solution  So do I  and I am sure President Reagan would too  Every generation of Americans has been strengthened by the spirit of hardworking immigrants from many parts of the globe  As President Reagan said so eloquently in one of his last speeches  We lead the world because  unique among nations  we draw our people  our strength  from every country and every corner of the world  And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation  Thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity  were a nation forever young  forever bursting with energy and new ideas  and always on the cutting edge  always leading the world to the next frontier  This quality is vital to our future as a nation  If we ever closed the door to new Americans  our leadership in the world would soon be lost  President Reagans words ring true today  not just because he understood the issue of immigration  but because he understood the idea of America  From defeating terrorism  to competing in the new global economy  to meeting the test of immigration  to safeguarding liberty at home as we defend it abroad  that idea can and must be our everlasting touchstone  We have the examples our forebears set and the enduring ideals that guided them  We have the might if we will use it right  the economic ability  the military strength  and the power of principle to make the world  as President Reagan once put it  new again His leadership was right for America and the world  So was John Kennedys  But above all  I believe  with both of them  that Americas best days are still to come Thank you very much      Laura
