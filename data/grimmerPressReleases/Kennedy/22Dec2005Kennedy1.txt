         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington DC  Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent the following letter to President Bush requesting that he provide the information on his domestic electronic surveillance program that Americans deserve  Kennedy contends that while Congress works to fix the Patriot Act during the next six month President Bush must produce the documents to support his claims that the Administration had the authority to conduct warrantless searches    Below is the text of the letter   A PDF copy is available upon request      December 22  2005   December 22  2005    President Bush The White House Washington  DC 20510   Dear Mr  President    On July 22  the Senate unanimously approved legislation to reauthorize and improve the USA PATRIOT Act  which granted appropriate means to intercept communications in relation to terrorist activities  while maintaining the fundamental principles and protections of the Bill of Rights  Last night  again with unanimous support  the Senate extended this act for an additional six months to give Congress and the Administration more time to deal with these extremely sensitive surveillance issues now being debated    I urge you to provide Congress and the American people with answers about the Administration s recently disclosed domestic electronic surveillance activities  including all documents relating to    1  Authorizations of any domestic electronic surveillance by the National Security Agency  and activities conducted under such authorizations  including all presidential orders  authorizations and underlying legal opinions that you relied upon to authorize the Agency to intercept domestic international communications    without judicial review    more than 30 times since the September 11th attacks    2  The Federal Bureau of Investigation s ongoing surveillance of religious  political and other citizen organizations engaged in public education campaigns  and   3  The Federal Bureau of Investigation s use of National Security Letters  There is no legitimate purpose in denying Congressional access to all of the legal thought and analysis relied on by the Administration to develop and maintain these surveillance activities     As you know  Congress has amended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978  FISA  numerous times over the last twenty seven years  and did so again with the passage of the PATRIOT Act after the tragic attacks on our country on September 11  2001  Yet  despite numerous Congressional hearings on the PATRIOT Act  the Administration has only now raised concerns that existing law is outdated and insufficient to address the domestic electronic surveillance activities undertaken outside of FISA in response to current terrorist threats    The purpose of FISA has always been clear    to put an end to such surveillance at the whim of any official under the guise of national security and to establish the exclusive means by which such surveillance may be conducted  Under FISA  the Attorney General may approve emergency domestic electronic surveillance for up to 72 hours without a court order  but must then apply to the FISA court after the Attorney General authorizes such surveillance  The Act was intended to ensure that the Executive Branch    under any President    does not ignore the basic civil liberties of the American people by utilizing an unchecked inherent power to eavesdrop under the Constitution  When Congress enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force  Public Law 107 40  against those responsible for the attacks of September 11  2001  Congress did not authorize electronic surveillance of American citizens  without adherence to a judicially approved warrant  Nor has Congress authorized or approved such surveillance since FISA was enacted    I urge you to disclose these requested documents promptly  The Senate Judiciary Committee has announced plans to hold hearings on these issues early next year  and these issues will also be a subject of the confirmation hearings on Judge Alito beginning January 9  In seeking Judge Alito s views on these issues  the Committee must be able to review any relevant information and documents from the Administration in advance of both these hearings     With so much at stake  I respectfully urge you to provide these documents swiftly so that the Senate Judiciary Committee  Congress  and the American people can make informed decisions on these intelligence gathering activities                                                                            Sincerely                                                                        Edward M  Kennedy               Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
