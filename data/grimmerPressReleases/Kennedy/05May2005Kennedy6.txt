         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement in response to the letter from the Department of Labor to the AFL CIO    The AFL CIO is a leading defender of workers  retirement security  It has consistently advocated high standards for duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and continues to uphold those standards today  The Department of Labor letter merely restates and clarifies the scope of these important duties  This appears to be much ado about nothing  and it s wrong to exploit it as anything else   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
