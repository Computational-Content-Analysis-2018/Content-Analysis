         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC I applaud Judge Kessler s decision to consider the views of anti smoking and health advocates regarding remedies to be imposed against the tobacco industry  They can make the arguments that the Justice Department should have made  but did not  because the Bush Administration abandoned the health of the American people in favor of Big Tobacco  I am hopeful that considerations of the well being of future generations of Americans will prevail in this trial   Laura Capps  202  224 2633
