         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       AMENDMENT SUMMARY INCLUDED  As you know  yesterday the Senate voted to eliminate H 2C immigrants  ability to self petition for a green card after four years  I believe that vote was a huge mistake because it will have devastating effects not just for temporary workers  but for all workers and for all Americans The amendment I have offered today would correct this mistake and take the good language from the Cornyn amendment to improve upon the underlying bill  What this amendment will do is require that the Labor Department certify than no US worker will be displaced by H 2C workers when they adjust to permanent status  as the Cornyn amendment requires But this amendment will also restore the ability of H 2C workers to obtain a green card without being dependent on the generosity of their employers  The self petition feature of our temporary worker program is innovative and essential to their labor rights  and all Americans lose if it is eliminated from this bill The reason temporary worker programs failed in the past is because they didn t protect workers  rights  For this new program to work without harming US workers  H 2C workers must have the fullest set of labor rights possible That s why our bill includes extensive labor protections for the temporary workers  They have the right to join unions They are guaranteed a fair prevailing wage The have the right to all the labor protections under US lawBut these rights only exist on paper if the immigrant is dependent on one specific employer to maintain his or her legal status  That s why our bill allows workers to change jobsthis is an important break from the H 2A visa program Job mobility is an important start  but the other half is equally important  immigrants must have the abilityafter paying their dues and working these tough jobs for four whole yearsto adjust to legal permanent status with or without employer support  H 2C visa holders will work in some of the hardest and most dangerous jobs in this country  They need the most robust labor protections possible  to prevent exploitation and abuse by employers If we take away the right to self petitions  the basic right to autonomy  then temporary workers have no ability to fight for their rights at the workplace  They will be forced to accept unfair working conditions  unfair pay  and unfair hours because the employer will hold the trump card in any negotiations at the workplacethe employer will hold the key to the immigrants future Without the right to self petition  temporary workers become victims at the workplace  When temporary workers lose  all workers lose If this temporary worker program becomes a new Bracero Program in which immigrants are regularly exploited and have no autonomy  then the H 2C program will be part of the problem rather than part of the solution  The right to self petition is that important  If we deny temporary workers the most basic right to change jobs and to take responsibility for their own destiny  all workers lose and all Americans lose This is why I urge my colleagues to restore the right to self petition  Let s protect American workers through the labor certification  as Senator Cornyn suggests  but let s also protect them by ensuring that temporary workers are not exploited by unscrupulous employers SUMMARY OF KENNEDY H 2C SELF PETITION AMENDMENTSummary of Amendment  The underlying bill permits H 2C immigrants to adjust to legal permanent residency on their own petition as long as they have been employed for a cumulative total of four years  Under this amendment  an H 2C immigrant could only self petition if  The Secretary of Labor would have to certify that there are not sufficient US workers available to fill the job in which the immigrant is or will be employed The immigrant would have to provide documentary proof that he or she is employed  including self employmentThis amendment would supersede the Cornyn amendment passed last night  That amendment eliminated the self petition altogether   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
