         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the withdrawal of judicial nominees William Haynes  Terrence Boyle  William Myers  and Michael Wallace Im heartened that several judicial nominees whose records prevented their confirmation in the last Congress have withdrawn  William Haynes was an architect of the Administrations shameful torture policy Terrence Boyles decisions had been overturned on appeal over 160 times  and he had issued rulings that undermine important civil rights  William Myers was a lobbyist for large mining companies  which tried to roll back environmental protection Michael Wallace had a long record of opposing basic civil rights and was rated unanimously unqualified by the American Bar Association I hope this is a signal that the White House will adopt a new bipartisan spirit of cooperation in selecting judicial nominees  so that we can begin the important business of confirming genuinely qualified nominees who have a demonstrated commitment to upholding the basic rights and guarantees so important to the American people   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
