         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  Chairman  I continue to have strong opposition to Title IV of this bill because it undermines the safety of our neighborhoods  endangers our police officers  and interferes with the essential role of police departments across the nation  There are many sensible things Congress can do to protect citizens from gun violence  In 2004  we moved in the wrong direction by enacting the original concealed carry bill and overriding the right of the States to decide the needs of their communities and who should carry a concealed weapon  Unfortunately  this years bill fails to correct the serious problems of the original law  In fact  it makes matters worse  by haphazardly putting more guns on the streets  even though the Committee has no legislative record   or even an explanation  to suggest why this bill is even necessary  Theres no evidence that its needed to protect retired law enforcement officers   no evidence to suggest why local police chiefs and sheriffs arent the ones to make the decision about whether retired officers can carry concealed weapons  especially across state lines  The idea that this law will prevent crimes because more concealed weapons are being carried by less trained and less regulated out of state  off duty  retired officers is absurd  The original Act took away the ability of state and local police departments to enforce rules and policies on when and how their own officers can carry weapons  If were going to amend the Act  we should be giving back to local police the power to run their own departments  Under this law  local police chiefs are stripped of their ability to deny a concealed carry permit  I have an amendment to say thats wrong  and I hope my colleagues will support it  The bill does not even draw a distinction between officers who served ably and those who did not  Officers who retired while under investigation for domestic violence  racial profiling  use of excessive force  or alcohol or substance abuse could still qualify for the broad concealed carry authority under the Act  I have another amendment to make clear that nothing in the Act will supersede or limit state or local laws that prohibit or restrict the possession of a concealed firearm by an officer who  retired under threat of disciplinary action  or was dismissed for an emotional problem that did not rise to the level of mental instability  or retired or quit just prior to a disciplinary or competency hearing  or retired with exceptional skills and then later has become unfit to carry a concealed weapon and is no longer overseen by a police management structure that identifies such problems in active duty officers The International Association of Chiefs of Police says local jurisdictions should have this discretion  Its in the best interests of our public safety  and I urge each of you to join me in supporting this amendment  This bill also further undermines local law enforcement by reducing the number of years persons must spend as law enforcement officers before they can obtain a permit  I have an amendment to retain the existing standards and qualifications  and I hope that it too will have the Committees support Each State should be able to make its own judgment about whether private citizens can carry concealed weapons and the standards for when active or former law enforcement officers should be able to carry such weapons  Thats why I have an amendment to allow States to opt out of this Acts requirements  We tried to get this measure included in the original law  and now were trying again Theres no reason for Congress to override gun safety measures in the States  Rather than putting even more guns in the streets  we should be making current law safer  One way to do so would be a requirement that all police departments report who can carry a concealed weapon  Otherwise  how can a local police officer verify when an out of state officer has a license under the Act  There is currently no way of knowing  because there is no uniform way of identifying who can lawfully carry a concealed weapon under the Act  I have an amendment to establish a national database of individuals licensed to carry under this law  and another amendment to require a GAO report so that Congress and the American people can know who is carrying under this law  Asking GAO to submit a report on how the law has been implemented is another obvious step we should take to understand what were doing  I intend to offer a number of amendments to this bill to remedy some of its most serious flaws  I hope that my colleagues will vote for them  The best course of action for this Committee  however  would be to set this flawed legislation aside and have the Committee turn its attention to measures we know will reduce crime and protect the safety of police officers and all Americans      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
