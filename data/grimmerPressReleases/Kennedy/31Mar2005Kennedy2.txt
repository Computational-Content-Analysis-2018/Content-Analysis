         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        CONTACT  Laura Capps   Melissa Wagoner                                     202  224 2633    Our thoughts  and prayers are with Terri Schiavo and her entire family        The Schiavo and Schindler families have had to endure much public pain  especially during these last days  and I hope that they will be allowed to grieve with the privacy they deserve     As I said two weeks ago  I believed that the courts are the fairest forum to do what is right in this case  I intend to do all I can to see that any action Congress takes is constructive and free from partisan politics  and does not make a tragic situation worse by exploiting this terrible tragedy     Mr  DeLay s comments today were irresponsible and reprehensible  I m not sure what Mr  DeLay meant when he said the time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior  But at a time when emotions are running high  Mr  DeLay needs to make clear that he is not advocating violence against anyone  People in this case have already had their lives threatened  In just the past few weeks  judges and their families in this country have been brutally murdered  This case has been heartbreaking and tragic enough  It is time for mourning and healing not for more inflammatory rhetoric  and responsible national leaders should understand that and stop this exploitation    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
