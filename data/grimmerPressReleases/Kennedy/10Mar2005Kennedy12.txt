         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The entire world continues to wait for signs that the Administration takes seriously its moral and legal responsibilities to eliminate torture and abuse   The need for a full investigation and full accountability is enormous  The American people deserve answers about the unlawful and counterproductive conduct their government has engaged in  They deserve to know when and under whose authority the abuse started  why it was kept secret for so long  and why we had to learn about it from the media  They deserve to know why our government did not respond in a proper manner to the early serious complaints made by the Red Cross  They deserve to know what orders and guidelines on interrogations were given  and how those policies originated  Most important  they deserve an ironclad assurance from the White House  the Defense Department  and the Justice Department that this abuse is no longer going on in any prison or detention facility  anywhere  under American control   The report by Vice Admiral Albert T  Church III on his long awaited Review of Department of Defense Detention Operations and Detainee Interrogation Techniques was intended to be a comprehensive investigation into U S  detention and interrogation policies and abuses committed against prisoners of war and other detainees   Regrettably  Admiral Church s report falls short of the mark  Although it provides some useful information  it is notable more for what is absent than what it contains  It fails to address any of the abuses that occurred at Abu Ghraib  or the deaths of Afghan detainees at Bagram Air Base  It does not address the shocking reports by F B I  agents of abuse at Guantanamo    reports which we ve learned about only as the result of a private Freedom of Information Act lawsuit  It does not address the fact that through the bizarrely named process of rendition  more than 100 U S  detainees have been turned over to countries known to practice torture   In addition  the report limits its focus to just those abuses that occurred while interrogations were being conducted  even though it elsewhere states that it is appropriate for military police to set favorable conditions for interrogation   Most disturbing of all is the report s failure to address matters of senior officer accountability  No questions were asked about the judgment of General Counsel William Haynes and the other civilian Pentagon officials responsible for putting the radical new interrogation polices in place  We all know now that the prisoner abuse scandal is not merely the responsibility of a few bad apples  as the Administration initially claimed  Yet this report tells us little about who up the chain of command should be held accountable   We continue to hear new reports about the alleged abuse and torture of detainees in U S  custody  Last month  the Associated Press reported that one of the ghost detainees held at Abu Ghraib  Manadel al Jamadi  died in November 2003 under C I A  interrogation  He had been suspended by his wrists  with his hands cuffed behind his back  According to one Army guard who was summoned by the interrogator to reposition al Jamadi  blood gushed from his mouth as if a faucet had been turned on after he was released from his shackles  Two pathologists have concluded that the stress position used against al Jamadi contributed to his death   According to F B I  e mails recently released in the litigation under the Freedom of Information Act  detainees at Guantanamo have been burned with lighted cigarettes  shackled hand and foot and made to lie in their own urine and feces  subjected to forced enemas  sexually humiliated by female interrogators  and terrorized by military dogs   Such abuse is contrary to all that we stand for as Americans  and violates of our military s longstanding rules and traditions  How was it allowed to take place  Who is responsible   Clearly  one responsible party is the Defense Department s General Counsel  William Haynes   On November 27  2002  Haynes advised Secretary Rumsfeld that it was both legal and humane to use such tactics as forced nudity  waterboarding to simulate drowninng  threats to kill a detainee s family members  and the use of military dogs to induce stress   The following year  Haynes convened a Working Group to reassess and revise the Department s rules on the treatment of detainee and approve new interrogation tactics  In April 2003  the Haynes Working Group issued a report that twisted and diluted the definition of torture  claimed that military personnel who commit torture may invoke the defenses of necessity and superior orders  and advised military personnel that they are not obligated to comply with the federal prohibition on torture   In making these extreme claims  the Haynes Working Group relied in large part on the Justice Department s notorious Bybee Torture Memorandum    a memo originally written in August 2002 by Jan Bybee  the Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department s Office of Legal Counsel  and now a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  The Bybee Memorandum was written at the request of White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and the C I A   and Harold Koh  Dean of the Yale Law School  has described the Bybee Memorandum as perhaps the most clearly erroneous legal opinion I have ever read   In December 2004  in the wake of outrage the memo provoked when it became public  the Justice Department repudiated the Bybee Memorandum and distributed a new memorandum on the definition of torture  It does not appear  however  that the Defense Department has repudiated the Haynes Working Group Report or provided any substitute guidance on the standards for the interrogation and treatment of detainees   The unclassified portions of the Church Report do not explain how the clearly erroneous legal claims in the Bybee Memorandum became the official policy of the Defense Department  They do not explain whether any member of the Haynes Working Group raised objections to these claims  or how any such objections were addressed   A major part of the problem is that many portions of the Church Report are classified  The security justification for classifying these portions is questionable  The Bybee Torture Memorandum and its repudiation by the Justice Department have been the subject of several public nomination hearings  There does not appear to be any legitimate security reason for concealing from public scrutiny the mechanisms by which interrogation policy was developed at the Defense Department   The political reasons for shielding this information are all too clear  Senior officials in the Defense Department  the Justice Department  and the White House may well be implicated  Jay Bybee was confirmed by the Senate as a federal judge after his role in the issue became public  William Haynes has been re nominated to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals  and the Administration wants his nomination to be acted on soon  I m very concerned about the possibility that classification decisions have been made for the purpose of avoiding embarrassment to these officials  instead of protecting the nation s legitimate security interests   Another problem with Church Report must be addressed  The report reiterates an all too familiar and none too persuasive defense of the Administration s detention and interrogation policies  It doesn t matter what specific policies may have been promulgated  according to this defense  because President Bush directed that all detainees must be treated humanely   The reference is to a February 7  2002 directive by President Bush that rejected the application of Geneva Convention protections to al Qaeda and the Taliban  The directive reaffirmed a previous order issued by the Secretary of Defense requiring that detainees be treated humanely and to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity  in a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva   The President s directive did not apply to the C I A  It was carefully worded to apply only to the Armed Forces  After the Senate voted on the 9 11 Intelligence Reform Bill to prohibit all U S  personnel  including the C I A   from engaging in cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment  the Administration insisted that this provision be eliminated in the Senate House conference on the bill  As a result  a huge loophole on abuse exists for the C I A   As for the Armed Forces  the President s directive contained a military necessity exception that could be used to justify almost any abuse at all  Even worse  the term humane has never been adequately defined  During his recent confirmation proceedings  Alberto Gonzales told the Judiciary Committee that he would define humane treatment as a basic level of decent treatment that includes such things as food  shelter  clothing  and medical care  His definition did not say anything about physical abuse  or how detainees should be treated during interrogation  Under this definition  detainees could be beaten day in and day out  so long as they received a meal  a roof  a robe  and a doctor   The main purpose of the Justice Department s Bybee Memorandum and the Defense Department s Working Group Report was to expand the outermost boundaries of legal behavior  These memos made the existing legal prohibitions against torture and abuse null and void by defining them so narrowly as to be meaningless  It is unreasonable to cite the Presidential directive on humane behavior while ignoring the concerted efforts within the Administration to narrow the definition of inhumane behavior in a way that encourages abuses   The Church Report provides some helpful information  but it is not the full and independent investigation the American people deserve  By refusing to act like the truth is important  the Administration is only making the crisis worse  further embarrassing the nation in the eyes of the world  and casting greater doubt on its commitment to the rule of law  We will not be able to move past this scandal as a nation until there is full independent investigation of all that has gone wrong in our detention and interrogation policy  and all the persons found responsible for this shameful policy are held accountable        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
