         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse Boston Massachusetts June 1  2006   I would like to thank Judge Walton and the Commissioners for inviting me to participate in this hearing  I m honored to have the opportunity to speak on such an important topic  The stories you ve heard from these courageous young people underscore the urgent need to deal with the ongoing problems of juvenile prisoner abuse     With the Prison Rape Elimination Act  Congress made a bipartisan commitment to do more to deal with the long ignored epidemic of rape and sexual abuse in the nation s prisons  As those here today know well  with over two million prisoners now incarcerated nationwide  one in ten will be a victim of rape  Given these sobering numbers    and a greater push in Congress to treat juveniles as adults    we need a clear strategy to confront the problems before us and to give hope to those already in the system     Congress needs input from the Commission on next steps  We know we have a responsibility to protect the incarcerated from such vile and predatory acts  The nearly 100 000 children who make up the juvenile prison population are possibly the most vulnerable and defenseless group in our criminal justice system  and too often  we fail to protect them  As two survivors testified so courageously this morning  juvenile facilities are regularly the site of shocking physical and mental abuse     In addition to issues surrounding juvenile facilities  the plight of child inmates in adult prisons is an even more serious concern  Juveniles housed with adults are five times more likely to report being victims of sexual assault than those in juvenile facilities  An even more appalling statistic is that the suicide rate of child inmates in adult prisons is over seven times higher than in juvenile facilities    In 34 states  juveniles who have been tried and convicted in criminal court must be tried as adults for all subsequent offenses  The number of youth under 18 in adult jails has nearly tripled in the last fifteen years  Over 7 000 child prisoners now live daily alongside adult criminals    Despite all the testimony that you will hear today about the grave consequences of incarcerating juveniles with adults  there s been alarming escalation in the willingness of many of my colleagues in Congress to treat children as adults  Historically  judges have been given broad discretion to choose the best course in dealing with child offenders  This discretion helps ensure that arbitrary requirements do not prevent judges from finding the best solutions in individual cases  but unfortunately  many states have gradually reduced the power of judges to make these determinations  At least 29 states have enacted statutes that exclude large categories of cases from the jurisdiction of juvenile courts  Now  some in Congress want to do the same  The House of Representatives has also passed a draconian bill on gangs that would dramatically reduce judges  discretion over cases still within their responsibility     In the Senate Judiciary Committee    of which I am a member  Chairman Specter is now working on a companion gangs bill with Senators Hatch  Feinstein and Schumer  While we haven t had any hearings on the issue  it seems that there is a strong push to do something this year  The Senate bill would expand mandatory minimums for juvenile offenders  including mandatory life sentences  For some offenses  the Senate bill would even establish a presumption in favor of transferring a juvenile to adult court     While the punishment must fit the crime  the current proposals fail to create comprehensive solutions to the problems of youth violence and sentencing facing our country today  While the Senate proposal takes a different approach than the House  we face a real challenge in trying to work out the differences between these very different bills    The work of the Commission is important in understanding the enormous risks of such policy changes  At the same time  we are seeing a continued    and disturbing    trend of under funding and undercutting juvenile justice programs across the board  For this reason  the Commission should provide Congress with specific recommendations on how to best target resources     Only a better understanding of the consequences of condemning a child to the adult penal system can adequately address these issues  and I commend the Commission for its leadership here  and I urge the Commissioners to continue to focus on this important aspect of the problem    One further issue is also of particular concern to me  Our treatment of mentally ill child inmates remains grossly inadequate    as many of those here today know firsthand  Only half of juvenile facilities screen all inmates for mental health illness  One in ten don t screen at all  Over a third of these facilities provide no on site mental health treatment     Even when young people are able to obtain services  the treatment is often inadequate and the consequences can be severe  According to a report of the House Committee on Government Reform  scores of mentally ill youth are held in detention simply because no space is available in community mental health facilities     Two thirds of these facilities report that some of the young offenders have attacked others or attempted suicide  I urge the Commission to study carefully this serious problem of the incarceration of mentally ill youth  particularly where there is abuse  and include recommendations to Congress in its final report     While Congress grapples with the issues surrounding youth violence and gangs  we cannot forget to include provisions to address serious concerns about youth with mental illness  Given the stakes  I m prepared to reach across party lines to get something done  We did it before with the passage of the Prison Rape Elimination Act and I m prepared to do so again     With all the experts and those with direct experience here today  the Commission is moving in the right direction to provide thorough recommendations to Congress  Let me take a moment to respectfully suggest the things that we need    One  we need an analysis of the best research available  With these factual findings  Congress will be in a better position to legislate    In addition  we also need an assessment of the resources needed to implement strategies to address the problems discussed today  I hope that the Commission will continue to work with the panelists here today  including the National Council on Crime and Delinquency  the National Partnership for Juvenile Service and the Center for Children s Law and Policy  to propose standards and best practices in the area of juvenile detention  We need guidance on how best to ensure that proper staff training and interventions take place    as well as clear recommendations on how to make conditions of confinement better and safer     Finally  I hope that the Commission will recommend a system of checks and balances so that the federal government can do a better job of monitoring these facilities     This hearing  and your forthcoming reports  will help to raise public awareness and improve the prospect of needed changes  In particular  I hope that you will highlight the important need to address the specific challenges relating to juveniles     In addition  I am encouraged that the Commission will also focus on problems with abuse at immigration detention facilities  We can t go on like this  and we re counting on your guidance for the most effective resolution as soon as possible  Thank you very much    Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
