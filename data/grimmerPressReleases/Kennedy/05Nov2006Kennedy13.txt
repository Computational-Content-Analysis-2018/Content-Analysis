         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC   Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement in response the verdict in the trial against Saddam Hussein  Saddam Hussein was responsible for vicious crimes and brutal atrocities  and I welcome the decision to hold him accountable   Iraq has obviously descended into civil war  and I hope this verdict will not further destabilize Iraq and put American men and women in uniform at greater risk   The American people know that the war in Iraq has not made us safer   They know that Osama bin Laden should have been captured to strengthen our security  The American people also know that it is time for a new direction in Iraq   The intelligence community agrees that the Iraq war has created more terrorists   The Pentagon says Iraq is in chaos   Nearly 3000 Americans have been killed in Iraq  and theres no end in sight to the violence    Only President Bush and the Republican rubberstamp Congress refuse to see the need for a change in course in Iraq    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner     202 224 2633
