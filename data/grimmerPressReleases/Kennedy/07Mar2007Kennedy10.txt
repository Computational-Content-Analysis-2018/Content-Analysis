         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  Sens  Orrin G  Hatch  R Utah  and Edward Kennedy  D Mass   today  introduced legislation to reauthorize the only federal law specifically  addressing issues faced by 5 3 million Americans who live with a long term  disability as a result of traumatic brain injury  or TBI  Hatch and Kennedy were  the principal authors of the original TBI law in  1996              Those suffering from a traumatic brain injury deserve  the best care possible  Hatch said  Thats the goal of this bill  to help  patients get quality care early  so they can recover from this devastating  injury  Its difficult to describe the heavy physical  emotional  and financial  toll caused by TBI  We need to reauthorize the TBI Act to not only improve the  care the injured receive but also to help prevent others from suffering brain  injuries in the first place  This bill couldnt be more timely or  important    it will help the thousands of soldiers coming home from Iraq and  Afghanistan with traumatic brain injuries  Kennedy said  We need to fund  programs that have helped individuals with traumatic brain injury with an array  of advocacy needs including assistance with returning to work  finding a place  to live  accessing needed supports and services such as attendant care and  assistive technology  and obtaining appropriate mental health  substance abuse   and rehabilitation services   As a nation we owe it to our injured men and women  in uniform to do all we can to provide them with the help they need to recover  and live fulfilling lives              Brain injuries are the most  frequent reasons for visits to physicians and emergency rooms  the most common  causes being falls and car crashes  Of the 1 5 million people in the United  States who sustain a TBI each year  50 000 die  235 000 are hospitalized  and  1 1 million are treated and released from an emergency department  An extremely  high incidence of TBI occurs among children between birth and age 14   approximately 475 000 per year   The TBI Act would continue essential federal  funding for programs within the Centers for Disease Control  CDC   National  Institutes of Health  NIH   and Health Resources and Services Administration   HRSA  to conduct research on TBI  provide education and prevention programs and  make available protection and advocacy services  The bill would reauthorize  these programs through 2011  authorize a new study through CDC and NIH to  determine the incidence and prevalence of TBI and instruct HRSA and the  Administration on Developmental Disabilities to coordinate data collection  regarding protection and advocacy services Below is a summary of the  bill    Traumatic Brain Injury Act  ReauthorizationSUMMARY    What is TBI Traumatic brain injury  TBI   is a blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that causes damage to  the brain   Common causes include falls and car crashes   Every year  of the 1 5  million people in the United States who sustain a TBI  50 000 die  235 000 are  hospitalized  and approximately 80 000 to 90 000 become disabled  Who  will this bill primarily help  The bill will provide assistance to  the millions of children and adults in our nation who are facing an array of  problems because of TBI    The programs authorized under this bill can help the  thousands of soldiers wounded in the war    As of February  2007    almost  25 000 service members have been wounded in Iraq   brain injuries are  approximately two thirds of the injuries suffered in the war   There is  an extremely high incidence of TBI among children between birth and age 14   approximately 475 000 a year  Some of the highest numbers of injuries are among  children under the age of five  What will the bill do The  bill expands the existing law enacted in 2000  with respect to TBI the   reauthorization is crucial to essential federal funding for a range of TBI  programs including reauthorize grants that have been assisting States   Territories  and the District of Columbia in building or enhancing coordinated  systems of community based services and support for children and adults with  TBI   It will extend the ability to apply for these grants to American Indian  consortia   When Congress first authorized the TBI Act as part of the  Childrens Health Act of 2000 it included funding for a protection and advocacy  programs for individuals with TBI  This program needed because persons with TBI  have an array of needs including assistance in returning to work  finding a  place to live  obtaining needed support and services such as attendant care  assistive technology  and mental health  substance abuse  and rehabilitation  services   Often  these patients are forced to remain in extremely  expensive institution far longer than necessary because community based support  and service are not available     Effective protection and advocacy services for  people with TBI will lead to reduced government expenditures and increased  productivity  independence and community integration  The Advocates must possess  specialized skills  and their work is often time intensive  The  reauthorization Extends the authorization of such sums as are  necessary for CDC research  public education  and state registry programs  NIH  research  and programs through 2011   Establishes a new study through  CDC and NIH to determine the incidence and prevalence of TBI identify common  therapeutic interventions  and develop rehabilitation guidelines  Amends  the HRSA demonstration project program so that American Indian consortia can  apply for funding  Projects are redefined to improve access to rehabilitation   and grants are limited to 3 years   Requires the Administrator of HRSA  and the ADA Commissioner to coordinate data collection on protection and  advocacy   It stipulates that  in any year in which at least  6 million is  appropriated for the HRSA protection and advocacy services  2  must be used for  grants for training and technical assistance to protection and advocacy  programs             Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy  202  224 2633
