         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                Washington  D C   The U S  Senate today passed the Emergency Supplemental  which included initiatives put forth by Senator Kennedy to expand loan consolidation options for borrowers and did not include a hike in student loan interest rates being pushed by lenders  Below is a statement by Senator Kennedy praising the Appropriations Committee and the Senate  followed by a letter sent two weeks ago urging the Appropriations committee chairmen to reject interest hikes on student loans  The letter references a recent Washington Post editorial outlining inappropriate efforts to increase rates on student loans which is also included   On the issue of education  we know that countless families across America are struggling to put their children through college  The last thing they need is an increase in interest rates on student loans  I commend the Appropriations Committee for expanding loan consolidation options and resisting efforts by lenders to increase the burden of college debt  Last February  Congress perpetrated the biggest raid on college aid in the history of the program  cutting  12 billion from student loan programs to help pay for tax giveaways to the wealthy  We need to do more to help struggling families afford college  and the Committees action on this bill is a step in the right direction   June 6  2006   The Honorable Thad Cochran Chairman  Committee on Appropriations United States Senate Washington  DC 20510  The Honorable Robert C  Byrd Ranking Member  Committee on Appropriations United States Senate Washington  DC 20510  Dear Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Byrd   I know that conferees on the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act have been asked to include language to increase interest rates on student loans in the Direct Lending program  With college tuition at an all time high  I urge you to reject this request    As you may know  when the Deficit Reduction Act was signed into law in February of this year  it raised the interest rates on parent borrowers in the Federal Family Education Loan  FFEL  program  but not in the Direct Loan program  I understand that lenders and others are lobbying to equalize rates in the two programs by increasing rates on borrowers in the Direct Loan program  I hope you agree that this is an untenable solution  and I urge you to reject proposals that increase interest rates for any student loan borrower   Families already struggle to afford the cost of college  Since 2001  public college tuition has increased by 46 percent and more and more students are forced to borrow in order to attend college  The average debt of a public college graduate is  17 600 today  while a private college student graduates with an average of  22 581 in debt  According to the Congressional Budget Office  the interest rate increase being proposed by the lenders will cost parents in the Direct Loan program an additional  365 million over the next five years   I am attaching for your reference an editorial from last weeks Washington Post that highlights these inappropriate efforts to increase rates on student loans    Families need our help  especially in this era of globalization  when a college degree is more important than ever before  I hope you agree that we must do all we can to make college more affordable for families  and I urge you to reject any efforts to increase interest rates on student loans in Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act                                                    Sincerely                                                                 Edward M  Kennedy   WASHINGTON POST  Fortuitous Error Congress mistakenly undercharged some student loan borrowers  which might be good news   Friday  June 2  2006  Page A18  IT S ONE OF those classic  only in Washington situations  In December  Congress passed a bill designed to cut the federal deficit    and made a mistake  One of the money saving measures in the bill  in fact a money raising measure  increased the interest rate on guaranteed student loans made to parents from 7 9 percent to 8 5 percent  However  in their eagerness to get out of town before Christmas  members drafted the legislation in such a way that parents borrowing money using banks and other lending institutions make the new payment  while parents borrowing through the Direct Loan program  which comes directly from the government  will still be paying the older  cheaper rate   Congress had always intended to fix this anomaly  which kicks in on July 1  But in the meantime  the whole matter has become rather awkward  For one  the error drew attention to the little noticed fact that parents of college students are being squeezed to pay down the deficit  There has also been some unseemly lobbying by banks    and  alarmingly  by some college financial aid officers    to get the government to raise the rates on the direct loans  Many school financial aid offices operate symbiotically with lending institutions  accepting gifts of equipment and other perks in exchange for directing students their way  Clearly  they didn t relish competition from direct loans    nor did they seem to feel their role involved lobbying for lower rates all around   The deepest irony  though  is that study after study has shown that direct loans are cheaper for taxpayers than loans that flow through middlemen  But because of the incentives that those middlemen offer colleges  not as many students wind up using the direct loans  Perhaps Congress should just leave its mistake in place  and let students start clamoring for the direct loans    which would  in the long term  help cut the federal deficit            Laura
