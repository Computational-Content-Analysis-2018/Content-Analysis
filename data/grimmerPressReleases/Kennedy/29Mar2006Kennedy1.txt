         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  DC  President Bush made clear today that he thinks guest workers should be able to become American citizens  He stated  I believe that we ought to say to somebody doing a job an American won t do   here is a tamper proof identity card that will enable you to be here for a period of time  And if that person wants to become a citizen of the United States  because we re a nation of laws  they get at the end of the line  not the beginning of the line  Senator Kennedy issued the following statement in response  I commend President Bush for backing the position that guest workers should be given the opportunity for earned citizenship  It is the only realistic way to break the cycle of illegality and is an essential aspect of the McCain Kennedy three part strategy to fix the broken system  stronger enforcement to improve our national security  a temporary worker program to meet the need for future flows that includes the opportunity for earned citizenship  and a path to earned citizenship for those who are already here  As the President departs for Mexico today  he has before him an opportunity to fully embrace bipartisan comprehensive reform and the McCain Kennedy plan  As he rightly says  we can be both a nation of laws and a welcoming nation   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
