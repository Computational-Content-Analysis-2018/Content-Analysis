         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the Senate debate regarding a constitutional flag burning amendment   As the Senate begins debate today on a constitutional flag burning amendment  Americans must be asking themselves why their representatives in Washington are spending time on this divisive issue rather than taking on the serious challenges they face every day such as gas prices  health care costs  and a costly and enduring war  The sad  but inescapable answer is that our Republican leaders priorities are being driven by election year politics  Watering down the Bill of Rights will not address any real problem  I am second to no one in condemning those who would burn the flag  but I believe this amendment is a purely symbolic act  designed to agitate and divide our nation            Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
