         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today  the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee continued its negotiations of a Republican plan that would raise the premiums and lower the benefits for millions of Americans who already have health coverage today  Although the bill has been presented as legislation for small businesses  the effects of this bill go far beyond the small business plans and would sweep away important protections for patients in every state regulated insurance market  Senator Kennedy opposes the plan and will offer amendments to improve it  including one that would strike the language relating to state benefits  Kennedy and his colleagues have offered an alternative bill to give small business real help and assistance to provide meaningful health coverage  Unfortunately  the bill before us includes damaging provisions to repeal existing laws that make healthcare coverage more affordable for millions of Americans  It sets up the barest of bare bones standards for benefits    sweeping aside requirements to cover cancer screening  well baby care  immunization  access to specialists and many other needed services  Senator Kennedy said  In the name of helping small businesses afford health insurance for their workers  the Republican plan is a blank check for the insurance industry and a bad deal for patients  resulting in higher premiums and lower benefits for millions of Americans with reliable health coverage today  Kennedy offered amendments to help solve the health care crisis in this country such as fixing Medicare Part D  offering Medicare for all Americans  and allowing small businesses to buy drugs at the same price that the Veterans Administration does  He also offered an amendment that would strike the preemption language in the bill and allow states to choose whether or not to adopt the rating rules  benefit package  and harmonization standards promulgated under the Act  Below is a summary of the Republican plan  Senator Kennedy s statement on state choice  and summaries of his mental health parity amendment  his Medicare for All amendment  his Part D Fix amendment and his VA drug prices amendment Also attached is the lengthy list of groups that oppose the Republican bill THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE MODERNIZATION ACT Insurance Companies Win but Patients LoseSmall businesses face increasing challenges affording the soaring costs of health care for their employees  Congress has a responsibility to provide small business with effective help in meeting those costs B but the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act takes the wrong approach  Sweeping away essential protections for patients  and allowing insurance companies to cherry pick the healthiest workers  while redlining those with health care needs is no answer to the crisis that small businesses face The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act is a wolf in sheep s clothing  Its effects go far beyond the small business market  and reach into every State and every area of health care coverage  In the guise of providing help to small businesses with the skyrocketing costs of health care  the bill   Sweeps away essential State patient protections guaranteeing access to services such as well baby care  immunization  cancer screening  access to specialists  and many other important services   Nullifies State laws that guarantee affordable health insurance premiums for millions of Americans   Allows insurance companies to cherry pick businesses with the healthiest workers while red lining those whose workers have health care needs   Gives insurance companies unprecedented powers to sue to protect their profits B but fails to give consumers the right to defend their rights in court   Undermines the basic legal tools that state insurance commissioners use to ensure that consumers are not harmed by fraudulent or discriminatory actions by insurance companies The bill is so skewed to benefit industry over consumers that it does not even limit its impact to the new small business health plans B nor does it improve the affordability of coverage for the self employed  It effects will be devastating B millions will pay more for the health insurance  while major corporations will line up for the lucrative business of providing skimpy coverage to those who need little health care

HEALTH INSURANCE MARKUP MARCH 15  2006 This bill includes damaging provisions to repeal existing laws that make health care coverage more affordable for millions of Americans  The bill says that it is fine to charge one group of people more than another because of their gender  or because they have a history of illness or work in a particular industry  It sets up the barest of bare bones standards for benefits    sweeping aside requirements to cover cancer screening  well baby care  immunization  access to specialists and many other needed services  But through all this  the supporters of the bill claim it s all optional  since they re not really preempting State laws  They claim States have the right to choose whether to adopt the bare bones benefit package or not  They say States have the ability to choose to accept the rating rules that abolish standards that have helped millions of Americans afford coverage  That argument ignores the fact that the bill before us uses the word preempt or supersede 21 separate times  nullifying good laws on essential medical services  Let s look at just a few examples  On page 57  the bill says  This part shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as such laws relate to mandates relating to covered benefits  services  or categories of provider in the health insurance market  That sentence alone strikes down laws requiring coverage of well baby care  cancer screening  access to specialists  and many other vital services  On page 59  the bill denies states the ability to require insurance companies to offer needed benefits  It gives the insurance industry unprecedented rights to sue States that try to enforce their own laws requiring good coverage  I remember many objections on the other side of the aisle when we tried to let patients defend their rights in court if they re denied needed services by HMOs  But this bill gives insurance companies extraordinary rights to take action against states for trying to enforce laws that require insurance companies to cover basic needed services  Supporters of the bill claim that all these new programs are voluntary  If that s truly the case  they should accept my amendment  which strikes the preemption of State protections  It gives States a real choice to determine whether to go beyond the weak standards established at the federal level to provide real protections for their people  If the bare bones plans under this bill are as good an idea as its supporters believe  States should rush to adopt them    but let s at least give them the choice to say no  If doing away with protective rating laws is as good an idea as the supporters of this bill claim  States will embrace it voluntarily    but let s make sure they can say no if they wish to  as New Hampshire already has done  Congress should not enact laws to deprive people of rights and protections  Time after time  we have enacted laws that provide a basic floor of protection    but allow States to reach beyond that floor if that s what s best for their people of the State  In Kassebaum Kennedy  we set a Federal floor for protections in terms of portability of health care coverage    but we allowed states to go beyond the Federal standard if they chose  In CHIP  the Children s Health Insurance Program  we established a basic level of services that all states have to provide    but States have the discretion to go beyond that if they decide it s important for the people of their state  In the genetic discrimination bill the Senate voted to adopt last year  we set a federal minimum standard  But we left in place State laws that exceeded that standard  Time after time  we ve set minimum standards at the federal level  but allowed States to go beyond them This bill turns that principal on its head  If a state decides to require all insurance plans to cover cancer screening or immunization or access to specialists    this bill denies them the right to do so  It tells the people of Massachusetts  and Wyoming  and Tennessee    and every other state    that they don t have the right to provide greater protections for their people than this bill provides  That s the wrong course for Congress to take  The right course is to allow good state laws that protect patients to stand   not force States to abandon them The Democratic Plan  The Small Employers Health Benefits Program  SEHBP  ActSummary The Small Employers Health Benefits Program  SEHBP  is based on the successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  FEHBP   which has provided extensive benefit choices at affordable prices to members of Congress and federal employees for decades  Last year  more than eight million people were banded together in the FEHBP purchasing pool and given choices among 10 national health insurance plans and a variety of local insurance plans  A total of 249 private insurance plans offered benefits to  and competed for the business of FEHBP enrollees in 2005 By pooling small businesses across America into one risk and purchasing pool like FEHBP  the new SEHBP program will allow employers to reap the benefits of group purchasing power and streamlined administrative costs  as well as access to more plan choices  Health plans will bid to offer benefit packages to SEHBP enrollees  The Office of Personnel Management  OPM   which has been efficiently managing FEHBP for decades with less than one percent administrative cost  OPM will ensure that the health insurers bidding for access to the pool are offering appropriate benefits at reasonable prices as they have done with the federal program  This will free small business owners from the burden of negotiating with health plans Eligibility Requirements  The SEHBP program will be open to all employers with up to 100 employees  OPM will have the authority to grant participation waivers to businesses with more than 100 employees   All employees of participating SEHBP employers will be eligible to receive coverage through SEHBP Participation and Coverage  Employees may join SEHBP when first hired or during an annual open enrollment period   Prior to each annual enrollment period  employers will receive a booklet detailing the insurance plans available  OPM will work to ensure a range of choices are available  like in the federal employees plan  There will be at least one plan that is equivalent in benefits to the nationwide plans in FEHBP   Coverage choices are made by the employee  Each individual may choose a health plan according to his or her own needs   SEHBP enrollees who have at least six months of health insurance coverage immediately prior to enrollment in an SEHBP plan will face no pre existing condition waiting period  To prevent people from waiting until they get sick to enroll  health plans will be allowed to exclude coverage for pre existing conditions for up to six months for people without coverage immediately prior to enrollment  reduced by one day for each day of immediately previous coverage   The pre existing condition provisions are consistent with HIPAA  In an effort to balance premium prices with consumer protections  participating plans will be allowed to apply adjusted community rating to their premiums  The SEHBP plan is similar to a model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2000  which allows plans to vary premiums based on age  geography and family composition within strict limits to prevent extreme variations in price  If a state has rating rules that are stricter than the rules laid out in this bill  the state is held harmless  meaning they can maintain their current rating structure Encouraging Participation among Health Plans Health plans interested in bidding in the SEHBP pool must be licensed in the state in which they will operate  Nationwide plans much be registered in all 50 states   Health insurers who offer products in SEHBP during its first two years of existence will be insured against losses through a three percent risk corridor and a reinsurance pool for high cost individuals  Risk corridors are contractual safeguards that limit the downside risk and upside gain for an insurer  The federal government has experience with risk corridors in TriCare  the health system for military families  The risk corridor will be in place for five years and begin phasing down after three years  The reinsurance pool will pay 80 percent of an individual s cost when claims exceed  50 000 in one year  The reinsurance pool will also be in place for five years   Once the risk pool stabilizes and insurers have claims experience on which to accurately base their premiums  the program will switch to the service charge system currently employed by FEHBP Benefit and Solvency Mandates  SEHBP enrollees in local plans will be covered by state consumer protection laws  such as benefit mandates and solvency standards  State insurance commissioners will continue to regulate solvency  grievance processes  internal review and network adequacy laws  among other things  National plans will be required to provide similar protections under the oversight of OPM   Like FEHBP  OPM will have the authority to require plans to limit enrollees  annual out of pocket expenses  include patient consumer protections and provide parity for coverage of mental and physical health care Cost  The federal costs associated with this program will include the tax credits that will encourage employers to participate and provide coverage to their employees  providing the two year risk corridor and reinsurance to health plans to encourage their participation  set up costs for OPM and public outreach costs  Administrative costs will eventually be included in the premiums  meaning the program will pay for itself The Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act Amendment of 2006 SummaryApproximately 50 million Americans experience some form of mental illness each year  Unfortunately too many forgo medical treatment due to the high out of pocket cost of treatment as private health insurance plans typically provide lower levels of coverage for treating mental illness than for treating other illnesses  This bill will eliminate the discriminatory treatment of mental illness by requiring insurers provide parity between mental health benefits and medical and surgical benefits Full Parity for All Mental IllnessesWhile the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996  MHPA  was a major step forward in ending insurance discrimination  it fell short of full parity  The 1996 law focused only on catastrophic benefits B requiring annual or lifetime dollar limits for mental health coverage be no more restrictive than medical or surgical coverage The Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act Amendment of 2006 will take parity a significant step further   It will provide full parity   equalizing all treatment limitations and financial requirements for all physical and mental illnesses  Financial limitations include not only lifetime and annual limits  but all financial terms and conditions  including deductibles  coinsurance  and limitations on the total amount that may be paid for benefits under the plan   It will provide full parity for all mental illnesses  This includes all categories of mental health conditions listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  DSM   the most comprehensive diagnostic tool available to mental health providers   It is not an insurance mandate   The bill requires only that insurance policies which cover mental illnesses  provide mental health benefits at parity with other medical and surgical benefits   It protects small businesses  Only companies with 50 or more employees will be covered under the law The Cost is Low  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that providing full parity for all mental illnesses will cause insurance premiums to rise by less than 1    The bill is modeled on the mental health coverage in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program  FEHBP   the program that covers Congress   The Office of Personnel Management testified that the cost of implementing full parity is only 1 3  of premiums  roughly  1 month for self enrollees  and  2 month for families Background on Mental Health ParityMental Illness Insurance IssuesOver 50 million American adults experience some form of mental illness each year and over 5 5 million have a severe mental illness  such as major depression or schizophrenia Private health insurance plans have typically provided lower levels of coverage for treating mental illness than for treating other illnesses due to concerns about cost and adverse selection  Common ways health plans have restricted coverage of mental illness include   1  lower annual or lifetime dollar limits   2  lower service limits such as the number of covered hospital days or outpatient visits  and  3  higher cost sharing requirements such as deductibles  co payments  or coinsurances  As a result of limited coverage  individuals with mental illness often do not seek treatment  and those receiving treatment can quickly exhaust their benefits Current Law   Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 The Parity Act of 1996 focused on Acatastrophic  benefits only C requiring only that annual and lifetime dollar limits for mental health coverage be no more restrictive than for all medical and surgical coverage  The law exempted employer sponsored plans with 50 or fewer employees  group plans that experienced a 1  or more increase in plan costs because of compliance Proposed Amendment    Senator Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2006 The AMental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2006 prohibits health plans from placing discriminatory treatment limits or financial requirements that are different from other medical and surgical benefits MEDICARE PART D FIX AMENDMENTAs a result  the great unfinished business of Medicare in recent years has been to provide coverage for the drugs that millions of seniors need to protect their health and save their lives  Sadly  the Republican Medicare bill failed to live up to the promise of Medicare Instead of the Medicare that seniors know and trust  the drug benefit was turned over to HMOs and other insurance companies  Instead of allowing Medicare to bargain for discounts on prescription drugs  as the Veterans Administration does for drug for veterans  such bargaining for lower costs for seniors was made illegal The result has been a disaster  The bill that passed was a nightmare of complexity and confusion  Seniors across the country were denied the drugs they need  or were forced to pay exorbitant fees to fill their prescriptions  The time has come to address these serious flaws and give seniors the Medicare drugs benefit they deserve To address these serious problems  the legislation  Gives every Medicare beneficiary the choice of receiving their drug benefit through traditional Medicare  with a formulary that is not allowed to change from day to day or state to state  Allows Medicare to negotiate the same good discounts on drug prices that the VA gets for veterans  Eliminates excessive subsidies to private insurance plans  the slush fund  the overpayments  and the bonuses for having healthier enrollees   Eliminates the demeaning assets test  Establishes a consistent nationwide premium for Medicare drug coverage  Reduces the annual deductible for drug coverage  Increases the share of seniors  drug costs that Medicare will pay  Eliminates the so called doughnut hole that will force seniors to bear the full costs of their drugs one a minimum is reached  Provides true security against runaway costs by assuming the full costs of drug purchases once a maximum out of pocket spending limit is reached  It provides full parity for all categories of mental health conditions listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  Fourth Edition  DSM IV   The legislation does not include expansions for substance abuse  The legislation exempts group health plans offered by employers with less than 50 employees Parity for Federal Employees Federal employees currently have mental health parity in their health benefits  Benefits coverage for mental health and substance abuse conditions is equalized in the Federal Employees Health Benefits  FEHB  Program  Parity in the FEHB Program means that benefits coverage for mental health  substance abuse  medical  surgical  and hospital providers will have the same limitations and cost sharing such as deductibles  coinsurance  and copays  This amendment is modeled after the mental health benefits provided through the Federal Program MEDICARE FOR ALL  QUALITY  AFFORDABLE  HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANSAmerica faces a health care crisis  Too many Americans are uninsured  and the number of the uninsured is increasing at an accelerating rate  No American family is more than one pink slip or one employer decision to drop coverage away from being uninsured  Health care costs are too high and are rising at double digit rates  Our dysfunctional health care financing system makes it harder for American businesses to compete in the global economy  creates incentives to outsource jobs abroad  has slowed job growth even as the economy recovers  and has been an especially heavy burden on manufacturing America s failure to assure the basic human right to health care to all its citizens was one of the great public policy failures of the 20th century  Recent data emphasizes the urgency of redressing this failure  Forty six million Americans are uninsured  and the most recent Census Bureau figures show that the number of uninsured increased by nearly one million Americans in 2005 alone  Even these figures understate the problem  Over a two year period  82 million Americansone out of every three non elderly Americans  will be uninsured for a significant period of time After a brief period of stability in the mid 90s  health care costs are rising at unacceptable rates far in excess of inflation  Health insurance premiums have risen at double digit rates since 2000  and have increased a whopping 73  in the last five years  Health care spending reached 16  of GDP  the highest level in our nation s history The high level of American health care costs combined with a financing system that places the burden of paying for coverage on employers who voluntarily choose to offer health insurance puts American firms at a competitive disadvantage  As a proportion of GDP spent on health care  America is first in the world by a large margin  By that standard  we spend 49  more than the Swiss  the next highest spending country  88  more than the Germans  150  more than the British  and 160  more than the Japanese  according to the latest data from the OECD  Our extraordinary level of health spending  however  is not reflected in better health outcomes  Among the world s leading industrialized countries  the United States ranks 22nd in average life expectancy and 25th in infant mortality Not only are our health care costs much higher than our trading competitors  but our system forces employers to finance a much higher proportion of costs than firms abroad  because foreign systems rely much more on broad based public financing  The heavy burden the health care financing system adds to labor costs in the United States also acts as a drain on hiring and provides an additional incentive for outsourcing jobs abroad   NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS  KEY GROUPS  FIGHT BILL THAT WOULD ELIMINATE STATE BENEFITS LIKE CANCER SCREENINGS
