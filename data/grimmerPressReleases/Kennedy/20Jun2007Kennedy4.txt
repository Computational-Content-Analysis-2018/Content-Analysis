         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to the Republican remarks on the Employee Free Choice Act  Opponents of American workers are trafficking in the politics of fear  by grossly mischaracterizing the policies in the Employee Free Choice Act  Theyre afraid to give workers a voice  so theyre obscuring the truth  I think its important to set the record straight  The Employee Free Choice Act does one thing  it empowers workers  It gives them the freedom to choose  without fear of intimidation or harassment  whether they want union representation  Theres nothing more fair or democratic than that  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT MYTHS AND FACTS ABOUT THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACTMYTH  The Employee Free Choice Act eliminates elections for choosing a union FACT  The Employee Free Choice Act does nothing to change employees ability to get a secret ballot election  WHAT ARE THEY MISSING  Under current law  workers can try to form a union by requesting an election or by using cards to show that the union has majority support  However  an employer can veto the workers decision about how they want to choose a union  and force an election  The Employee Free Choice Act takes this veto power away from employers  giving workers the power to decide how they want to choose their representative  If workers want an election  they can have one  If they fear employer intimidation  and want to use majority sign up  they have that choice MYTH  The Employee Free Choice Act restricts what an employer can say during a union organizing campaign FACT  The Employee Free Choice Act does absolutely nothing to change what an employer can or cannot say during a union organizing campaign  WHAT ARE THEY MISSING  Employers are prohibited from threatening or coercing workers  The Employee Free Choice Act does nothing to change this aspect of current law However  despite the law  threats and coercion  both lawful and unlawful  are rampant during many union organizing campaigns  The Act does two things to close the floodgates of abuse  it strengthens the penalties for conduct that is already illegal under current law  and allows employees who fear threats or intimidation by their employer to minimize this abuse by choosing a union more quickly through majority sign up MYTH  The Employee Free Choice Act allows union bosses to coerce workers into supporting a union FACT  Coercing workers to support a union is illegal  and its a very rare occurrence WHAT ARE THEY MISSING  It is already illegal for a union or co worker to try to coerce a worker into supporting a union  Nothing in the Employee Free Choice Act changes this  Historically  such coercion by unions has been a nearly unheard of problem  Opponents of the Act cite one study suggesting that there have been 113 NLRB cases where a union representative coerced someone into signing a card over the last 60 years  Even if we accept that as true  its a drop in the bucket compared to the number of coercion charges filed against employers  over 18 000 last year alone  It is employer coercion that is the real problem  because it is employers  not co workers or union organizers  who have the power to hire and fire workers  MYTH  Secret ballot elections have been the rule for 60 years FACT  Until the mid 1960s  about 40 years ago  employers could not require workers to use an NLRB election to choose a union WHAT ARE THEY MISSING  Majority sign up has been used since 1935  Until the mid 1960s  it was usually an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to bargain with a union selected by majority sign up  Theres a long history of majority sign up  and there is no evidence that it has caused any of the problems that opponents of the Act suggest  MYTH  The Employee Free Choice Act will force employees to work under government imposed contracts FACT  The Employee Free Choice Act provides incentives to negotiate that help workers and companies get a first contract  Arbitration is used only as a last resort WHAT ARE THEY MISSING  Under current law  there are no incentives for employers to bargain in good faith for a first contract  One study showed that more than one third of union elections victories do not result in a contract for workers The Employee Free Choice Act gives the parties a schedule and a framework for negotiations  providing an incentive to sit down and talk  The parties can always choose to extend this schedule by mutual agreement  the framework just keeps one party from stonewalling  The Act also provides for mediation to help the parties reach their own solution  Such mediation  provided by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service  has an 86  success rate at helping unions and management agree on a contract  Binding arbitration is used only as a last resort  and the parties can always avoid it  They just have to stay at the table and keep talking  Most Canadian provinces have a similar system in place  and they have found that binding arbitration is used very infrequently      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
