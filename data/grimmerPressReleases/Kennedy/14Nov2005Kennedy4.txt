         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Judge Alito s extreme statements as an official in the Reagan Administration are deeply troubling  Judge Alito was clearly trying to pass a litmus test to get a promotion in an administration that stood against the march of progress in this country  By his own admission  he was pledging his allegiance against established Supreme Court decisions on voting rights  a woman s constitutional right to privacy  and civil and individual liberties  This may explain why the right wing expressed such enthusiastic support for Judge Alito after campaigning against Harriet Miers     When he comes before the Senate  Judge Alito faces a heavy burden of demonstrating that he no longer holds these extremely troubling views and would bring an open mind and a real commitment to fundamental rights and freedoms if the Senate confirms him for the Supreme Court  Judge Alito has an extensive record from which we can determine whether he retained those extreme views during his 15 years as an appellate judge  Although we are still reviewing that record  some of the decisions we have already seen may indicate that he does  His willingness to allow a warrantless strip search of a 10 year old girl  to support an employer s unreasonable restrictions on sick leave  and to interpose barriers to justice for civil rights and environmental claims will face tough scrutiny when he comes before the Committee   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
