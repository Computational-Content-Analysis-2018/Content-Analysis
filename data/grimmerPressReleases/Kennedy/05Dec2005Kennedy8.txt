         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent the following letter to Judge Samuel Alito on his failure to clearly answer why he did not recuse himself from a case involving Vanguard     A PDF version is available upon request     December 5  2005    Judge Samuel A  Alito Jr  357 U S  Post Office and Courthouse  Federal Square and Walnut Street Newark  NJ 07101   Dear Judge Alito    Your statements to members of the Judiciary Committee  your November 10th response to our letters to you  Judge Scirica s November 22nd response to our inquiries  and your response last week to the Committee s Questionnaire have left the Vanguard case recusal issue even more problematic than when the issue was first raised    In the hope that we will not have to spend a great deal of time on this subject at January s hearings  I urge you to provide prompt and clear written answers to the many remaining questions about your failure to recuse yourself in 2002 when you were assigned Third Circuit Case No  01 1827  involving three named Vanguard companies    The central issue is that you have given at least six different answers to the basic question of why you not only sat on the case  but presided  signed orders  and joined an opinion upholding Vanguard s position in that case    1  The Initial Service Explanation Your November 10th letter suggests that your 1990 commitment to the Judiciary Committee to disqualify myself from any case involving the Vanguard companies was only a temporary one which you could dissolve at any time  and did not apply after your initial service as a judge   a  However  neither the question we asked about the procedure you will follow to resolve potential conflicts of interest  nor your answer in 1990  had any time limitation  If your financial interest in the Vanguard companies had ended  no one doubts that your recusal plans would have changed  But your Vanguard investments rose from about  80 000 in four Vanguard funds  at the time of your commitment  to what is now over half a million dollars in 12 Vanguard funds  so this was clearly not a temporary or disappearing financial interest   b  Moreover  your answer to Question 23 of the Committee s Questionnaire makes clear that when the passage of time justifies a change in your recusal practices  you specifically notify the Court s Clerk of that fact  as you did when you adjusted your recusal practice in cases involving your former office  You have not provided evidence of any such justification or notification before the 2002 Vanguard case   c  In fact  the evidence is to the contrary  Appendix 4 of your response to the Committee Questionnaire shows clearly that your standing recusal list continued to include the Vanguard companies during the entire period of your judgeship  up to the present  In fact  you were recused in 2005 in cases involving Vanguard Group  Inc   and Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company  two of the same Vanguard parties named in the earlier Vanguard case that you failed to recuse yourself in     Our Question  Would you agree that the initial service explanation was not the actual basis for your failure to recuse in 2002  and can you tell me when and how this rationale originated     2  The Oversight Explanation Your letter of November 10 states that  Due to an oversight  it did not occur to me that Vanguard s status in the matter might call for a recusal  This explanation suggests that your failure to recuse yourself was inadvertent and was the result of an oversight by you or someone else  rather than a decision by you not to recuse yourself  Perhaps this is your version of the explanation originally offered by the White House that a computer failure or glitch left you ignorant of your own Vanguard investments or of Vanguard s status as an interested party in the case  If so  the explanation hardly suffices   a  Even if the Clerk s office or its computer had failed to remind you that your recusal list included Vanguard and that three Vanguard companies were named and interested parties in the case  as all judges are frequently reminded in such situations  you nevertheless remain fully responsible for noticing and acting on that fact yourself  You knew of your large and growing Vanguard investments because you were required by the judicial canons of ethics to pay close attention to your investments  and because you submitted updated financial disclosure forms and recusal lists at least annually   b  In your initial meeting on the case in April 2002  the panel you headed decided not to hold oral argument  a decision your court s rules allowed you to make only after examination of the briefs and records  In the papers you received  the name Vanguard appeared 19 times on the covers of the main briefs in the case  and over 400 times altogether in those papers  including repeated mentions in the lower court opinion you were reviewing  Vanguard appeared in the caption and opening text of the opinion you yourself signed and  we understand  were responsible for  Included in those papers were Vanguard s required corporate disclosure form  which explained in detail the relationship of the named Vanguard parties to the Vanguard funds you owned  The specific purpose of this form is to provide judges with the facts they need about the corporate parties before they sit on a case involving the parties  You also personally ruled on motions and signed orders that identified Vanguard prominently    Our Question  The computer glitch or oversight explanation is insufficient on its face  since regardless of a failure in the Clerk s automatic process for recusals  you remained personally responsible for knowing and acting upon the relevant facts  Again  please state when and how this rationale originated  and whether you agree that it is not the actual reason that you did not recuse yourself in 2002     3  The explanation that mutual funds I own were not at issue In your November 10th letter  you suggest that the particular Vanguard funds you owned were not at issue in this lawsuit and that you did not have a substantial financial interest in the case  But as you well know  you did not tell the Committee in 1990 that you would only recuse yourself in cases involving those particular funds or that you would recuse only in cases where your interest in the outcome of the case was substantial  You said you would recuse yourself as to all Vanguard companies  Moreover  the basic requirement of the law is for judges to recuse themselves if they have any ownership interest in a party  however small   a  As Vanguard s disclosure made explicit  two Vanguard parties in the case were wholly owned subsidiaries of a list of Vanguard funds including the 10 or more you owned at that time  As recently as this year  the Clerk s office interpreted your recusal list to require your recusal in those parties  cases  So clearly your decision to sit on the 2002 Vanguard case could not be validly based on this reasoning   b  You have not suggested that you made any effort to research this issue before you sat on the case  Your letter says that you reviewed the applicable ethical rules and guidelines only after the appellant raised it over a year after your decision in Vanguard s favor  At that time  the instructions for use of the Checklists for Financial and Other Conflicts of Interest  which the Judicial Conference of the United States disseminated widely to federal judges beginning in 1999  clearly described the precise type of ownership structure used by the Vanguard funds and their management company  and said that that company should be included on the conflicts list  A 1998 opinion   57  by the Judicial Codes of Conduct Committee had reached a similar conclusion  Those would have been the most recent authorities in 2002 before you sat on the case  and remained so in 2003 when you reviewed the matter     Our Question  Obviously none of these technical issues were the basis for your decision to sit on the case in 2002  since the possibility of recusal did not occur to you  But when the issue was raised in 2003 after your decision for Vanguard  what did your review of the issue include beyond Vanguard s brief defending your failure to recuse yourself  and did you consider the guidances noted above    4  The explanation that I voluntarily recused myself once a complaint had been filed  To suggest that your recusal  over a year after you decided the case in favor of a company in which you had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars  was entirely voluntary seriously misrepresents your options at the time   a  First  the statute in force then and now begins with the general rule that a judge shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned  The 2000 ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct  considered an important guideline for applying this law  comments that A judge should disclose   information that the judge believes the parties or their lawyers might consider relevant to the questions of disqualification  even if the judge believes there is no real basis for disqualification  Even if the subjective rule is the only possible ground for disqualification  a judge cannot sit unless the parties waive the issue after a full disclosure of the record by the judge  There can be little doubt that had you discovered the problem before the Appellant did  and had you disclosed both your interests and your promise to the Committee  as the Model Code provides  there would not have been a waiver by the parties  and you would have been required to recuse yourself   b  Second  you say to me  as you said to the Chief Judge in 2003  that your personal practice is to recuse myself  when any possible question might arise    The inner quote is from your 2003 letter   But this means that were it not for your oversight in 2002  you would have been obligated under your practice to recuse yourself when you were first assigned the case  Whatever the objective rule or the subjective rule required  it would have been clear that a possible question might arise if the appellant discovered your Vanguard holdings before you disclosed them to the parties     Our Question  At any time before the Appellant s motion to disqualify you  did you discover the Vanguard problem  and do you agree that if you had disclosed it to the parties  as the Model Code required  there would not have been a waiver     5  The Harmless Error explanation Your letter suggests that because the panel was unanimous  your vote did not affect the outcome  and therefore that you took an extra and unnecessary step of requesting that a new panel of judges be appointed to rehear the case   a  Actually  your letter to the Chief Judge  after your participation had been challenged  merely stated that your post decision recusal will of course necessitate the reconstitution of a panel to consider the pending motion to disqualify you and vacate your decision  Chief Judge Scirica reconstituted the panel to consider the motion to vacate  then vacated your opinion and ordered the new panel to take whatever steps were appropriate in the case  He certainly did not treat your participation in the case as harmless error   b  As you may recall  the Appellant s Motion anticipated this issue  and cited several cases at the Circuit and Supreme Court level  persuasively rejecting the harmless error theory in these circumstances    Our Question  When and how did the harmless error suggestion in your letter originate  Do you think it justifies an otherwise erroneous decision to sit  After reflecting on the precedents on the subject  do you understand why courts  including the Supreme Court  have insisted on properly constituted panels as a prerequisite to effective judicial action    6  The Pro Se explanation In conversations with at least two Senators  you suggested that the fact that the Appellant in the Vanguard case was acting pro se  without a lawyer  had some impact on your failure to recuse yourself  Chief Judge Scirica and the Clerk have explained the pro se process to me  and I see nothing in it that would explain that failure   a  The case file  including the corporate disclosure statements intended to alert judges to overlooked recusal issues  was distributed to the panel  In this case  the file included key papers with hundreds of references to Vanguard  briefs and memoranda signed by Vanguard  and a detailed and relevant Vanguard disclosure statement that should have been read by every member of the panel  The pro se panel had to review the file to make its decision on oral argument  to decide motions  to determine whether to adopt the staff attorney s draft opinion  revise it or re write it  and to deal with post decision rehearing motions  The rules are clear that no matter how late in the process a potential conflict is discovered  the prescribed remedial action must be taken  b  The fact that the Clerk s office uses its own process to make its own initial recusal decisions does not relieve a judge in either a pro se or a counsel case from vigilantly checking for conflicts of interest especially in a pro se case  in which the litigant is less likely to know of a judge s recusal history or financial disclosures     Our Question  Is there something else in the way that pro se cases are actually handled that would explain why the clear potential for conflict in 2002 and the clear need for some action to resolve the potential conflict were not recognized by you    In the interests of a smoother and less confrontational confirmation process  I look forward to your prompt answers to these questions  and to the still unanswered questions and requests in our prior letter  especially our request for your recusal lists     If you have any questions about this letter  please feel free to call    With respect and appreciation    Sincerely    Edward M  Kennedy Cc  Senator Arlen Specter   Senator Patrick Leahy   The White House  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224
