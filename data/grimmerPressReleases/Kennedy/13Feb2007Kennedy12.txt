         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY   It s an honor to be here today as the Commission outlines its recommendations for the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act  The Commission has done impressive work in assessing how the law is working or not working in communities across the nation  I commend Governor Barnes and Secretary Thompson for their bipartisan leadership  Both have made strengthening public education a priority during their service as governor  and we re all grateful for their continuing dedication to this goal on a national level  They have assembled a talented group of Commissioners from a broad of array of fields and experiences  and we look forward to their recommendations  I know that Senator Enzi  Chairman Miller and Congressman McKeon all join me in welcoming your suggestions to improve the Act  Our goal in the legislation was to chart a better course for the nations public schools  and to set high standards and close achievement gaps  Its enactment expressed our bipartisan commitment to the principle that every child  black or white  native born or immigrant  disabled or non disabled  deserves a realistic opportunity to learn and succeed  As we know  schools have faced many challenges in implementing the laws reforms  and one of the most serious of these challenges has been the lack of funds  We can t expect to achieve reforms without providing the funds needed to achieve them  But weakening the law or turning back the clock on its requirements is no solution  especially for the neediest students who stand to gain the most from the reforms  In reauthorizing the Act this spring  our goal is to develop a strong bipartisan bill that builds on the positive aspects of the law  resolves the concerns about its implementation  and encourages reforms that will be effective in helping students succeed  We have to reach for new and creative solutions to key issues We need to measure progress more effectively  and do more to ensure students reach high standards  We need to attract and retain good teachers for high need schools  We need to strengthen state and local roles in improving low performing schools and providing the technical assistance they need to turn their schools around  We need to involve parents and local communities more actively in these reforms  We need to address the dropout crisis in our schools  And we need to do more to guarantee that high school graduates have the skills to go on to college and compete in the 21st century workforce  The Commission has constructive recommendations on all of these issues  Some of the Commissions recommendations  such as those related to teacher effectiveness and changes to the accountability provisions  tackle the most difficult issues raised by this law and will require close scrutiny  But today should mark the beginning of a broad  open  and inclusive discussion  We will listen to experts like the Members of this Commission  as well as students  teachers  parents  and school leaders  I look forward very much to working with all of you and my colleagues in Congress to build on the laws strengths and remedy its weaknesses  And ask you to join with me in fighting for more funds in the budget to carry out the Act  Failure is not an option  Education is the key to our nations future    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
