family involvement in schools  engage community partners in meeting the comprehensive needs of students  and address high dropout rates among at risk children  Senator Kennedy said  Educators recognize  on the basis of social science and common experience  that parents  effective involvement is a critical element in childrens academic and social development  Effective parental engagement  as well as community based  integrated student services  often make the difference between the academic success and failure of students in school  As prepared for delivery Mr  President  Im pleased today to introduce the Keeping Parents and Communities Engaged or Keeping PACE Act  to foster greater involvement of parents in their childrens education  engage community partners in supporting the comprehensive learning needs of students in school  as well as to address our nations high dropout rate Its clear that engaged parents can make a positive difference in students achievement  Parents are their childrens first teachers  and they have immense influence over their childrens attitudes  focus  priorities and goals  Well informed parents are more likely to be involved  to ask questions  to suggest constructive changes and to make a difference in their childs education  They deserve to know what their children are learning and being tested on  what their childrens grades and assessment scores mean  and how assessment data may be used for improvement  Informed and engaged parents can help turn around struggling schoolsWe crafted the No Child Left Behind Act to recognize parents as full partners in their childrens education  The Act includes essential requirements to develop parent involvement policies and programs  develop and release school report cards  and to establish a team of parents and community representatives to construct a plan to improve schools if they are identified as struggling  We should build on these important reforms  But in the upcoming reauthorization of the law  we must also explore new and innovative strategies to engage parents and communities in helping kids succeed in school Better coordination among parents  schools  and the community can also help create a network that enables and empowers students to take advantage of every opportunity to learn  Thats particularly important for students needing the greatest help and attention in their learning and those who need more challenging schoolwork to keep them engaged and progressing  as well as students at risk of dropping out of school  Today  more than one million students who enter the ninth grade fail to receive a high school diploma four years later and approximately 7 000 students drop out of school every day  Weve made great advances in recent years to improve the education of every student  but it remains clear that more must be done to respond to this challenge  We must support and strengthen our elementary and secondary schools and do more to attend to the learning and non academic needs of our most at risk students  which make such a difference in how well they master their subjects  That means support for community programs to meet childrens social  intellectual  emotional  and physical needs  It means making parent involvement a top priority  and offering support to schools to involve parents and families more effectively in their children s education  including postsecondary education planning The Keeping PACE Act will address these fundamental issues  This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to encourage and support parent  family  and community involvement in schools  to provide needed supports and services to children  and to ensure that schools are centers of communities  Educators recognizeon the basis of abundant research and common experiencethat parental involvement is a critical element in childrens academic and social development  Unfortunately  as noted in a recent report by Appleseed  too often  schools and districts continue to face challenges that impede efforts to effectively advance parental involvement  My bill enables States to award grants to local education agencies to assist schools in hiring and maintaining Parent and Community Outreach Coordinators  These coordinators will build critical partnerships among families  schools  and the community  Theyll work with school principals  teachers  and staff to encourage parents to become more involved in their childs education and give them the tools necessary to become successful advocates for their children  Last year  a Massachusetts pilot initiative placed 17 full time Family and Community Outreach Coordinators in Boston Public Schools  The Coordinators were responsible for supporting families  teachers  and the community in a common effort to help students excel academically and socially  Their efforts have worked  The Family and Community Outreach Coordinator at the Condon School in Boston  Massachusetts  has offered workshops for parents on middle school transition and math curriculum  coordinated parent participation on the School Climate Committeean anti bullying initiative at the school  helped teachers and parents make connections for parent teacher conferences  and brought in over 200 parents to participate in the fall open house  where some teachers reported having contact with over 80  of their students families  The Coordinator has also leveraged donations to the school through the generosity of local businesses The success of the coordinators led the Boston School Committee to approve its budget for the next school year with the addition of fourteen more full time Family and Community Outreach Coordinators  All together this means that almost 22  of Boston Public Schools will have a coordinator by September 2007 2008 The director of the Harvard Family Research Project notes that many years of research confirm that  n ow is the time for  action  The question we must ask is  in addition to quality schools  what non school learning resources should we invest in and scale up to improve educational outcomes  narrow achievement gaps  and equip our children with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in the complex and global 21st century  The bill answers that question and responds directly to these needs by creating new grants for community based organizations to work in partnership with schools to bring essential comprehensive and integrated services to children in need  These support services may include health care  counseling  social services  enrichment  mentorship  and tutoring  services that can often spell the difference between a dropout and a graduate Rather than giving teachers  counselors  and principals more to do as they address the non classroom needs of students  every school should have a resource they can turn to for help with identifying student needs and leveraging community services to help all students succeed  We know that comprehensive  integrated supportive services increase graduation rates and improve student achievement  In one national report  82  of tracked students improved their attendance in school  86  of tracked students had fewer behavior incidents  89  of tracked students had fewer suspensions  In addition  98  of tracked students stayed in school and 85  of eligible seniors graduated  Students who are identified as needing these services  but do not receive them are more likely to drop out of school The Lucy Stone School in Boston  Massachusetts demonstrates the effectiveness of student supports on learning  The once failing school took action and focused on improving core learning skills  a broad array of enrichment activities and health and social supports  Lucy Stone is making strong progress  Students in Grades 3 and 4 are passing the literacy MCAS at rates well above the Boston Public School average percentages  and are approaching State averages  Grade 4 math MCAS passing rates are approaching Boston and State averages as well  In other communities  diverse community partners have played an important role in providing accelerated learning and mentoring opportunities that have made all the difference for students  For example  a comprehensive evaluation of nine schools in New England found that classroom participation in community service outdoor learning projects increased student engagement and retention of science knowledge  And the Being Enthusiastic about Math and Science  BEAMS  enrichment program at the Jefferson National Lab in Virginia  which serves 1 800 inner city students and their teachers  has resulted in increased achievement and attendance rates  and a better understanding of academic subjects  careers and applications among participating students The National Commission on Service Learning found that mentorships and internships with caring adults in a workplace resulted in higher grade point averages and better attendance than for students who spend less time with adult mentors There is one particular organization that has a demonstrated track record in helping leverage the integrated services and supports that students need to succeed in school  Communities in Schools  CIS  is the nations largest dropout prevention organization  and has a nearly 30 year track record of helping connect students  families and schools with supportive services to help them graduate and prepare for life  With affiliates operating in 27 states and the District of Columbia  Communities in Schools helps about 2 million students every year  Community involvement means real help for children in need  and the evidence shows  For instance   In Georgia  CIS currently supports graduation coaches directly serving approximately 37 000 high school students who are at risk of dropping out   In the wake of Hurricane Katrina  CIS stepped in to provide morning classes and afternoon activities for students whose parents had lost their social support systems after they were forced to relocate to Houston  Texas  There are also countless individual stories of community based integrated services making a difference  In Texas  CIS helped fourteen year old Yeana Carbajal  who born with cerebral palsy  to obtain proper medical attention and social services enabling her to return to school after hip surgery when her doctors had told her that would be impossible  Yeana is now back in school and thriving academically and socially  Another student  who at 14 became the primary caregiver of a mother who eventually died with AIDS  overcame homelessness and became the first in her family to graduate high school  A turning point for her came when she participated in a career exploration program coordinated through the community based program office at her school  She discovered her special talents in the culinary arts  and is now an honor student at Johnson and Wales University  Finally  a growing body of educational research suggests that student achievement improves in environments where learning is a community value  and where schools have the ability to address a broad range of educational needs  Many school districts have gone even further to respond to this research  by establishing full service community schools that directly involve parents  families  and the entire community in education  The Keeping PACE Act also responds to this research by providing new avenues to establish and support full service community schools  These efforts have wide ranging positive impacts  including better family functioning and parental involvement  healthy youth development and improved social behavior  improved academic achievement and learning outcomes  and enhanced community life  Two prominent researchers in the field further note  In community schools s chools are transformed into much more than just a portfolio of programs and services  They become a powerful agent for change in the lives of young people and their families and improve the climate of the entire school  This bill enables States to provide incentives to local education agencies that coordinate with mayors  community based organizations  for profit organizations and other community partners to re design and modernize their current school plans and facilities to better link students with community resources  School districts across the country are beginning to recognize the benefits of planning a school not only as an academic center for students  but also as a neighborhood center that serves the entire community  Designing schools from the onset to leverage integrated services to students helps meet multiple local needs such as educational  health  social service  and recreational needs Its time for America to make a real commitment  and give real opportunity and real fairness to address the comprehensive learning needs of children and families  guarantee a place for parents and families in schools  and provide real hope to our students most at risk of dropping out  Engaging parents and communities in the success of students enrolled in our public schools is critical to the future and prosperity of our entire nation  Mr  President  this bill is supported by fifteen organizations representing education communities  I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support be printed in the record  The Keeping PACE Act Educators recognize  on the basis of social science and common experience  that parents  effective involvement is a critical element in childrens academic and social development  Effective parental engagement  as well as community based  integrated student services  often make the difference between the academic success and failure of students in school   Our nations dropout crisis is further exacerbated by a lack of coordinated and comprehensive services to engage and support students in their learning  Approximately 70 percent of students graduate from high school  and African American and Hispanic students have a 55 percent chance or less of finishing high school with a regular diploma  Many communities offer a broad scope of services and support for children and youth  but fragmented delivery doesnt always ensure that services and community resources reach the students who need them the most  The Keeping Parents and Communities Engaged Act amends Title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act  No Child Left Behind Act of 2001  to expand parent and community involvement in schools  and to provide the integrated supports and comprehensive services children need to learn and stay in school  Strengthens Parent Involvement in Schools Authorizes  130 million to support Parent and Community Outreach Coordinators in Title I schools  to facilitate the participation of families and communities in the education of their children  Builds partnerships and relationships between school staff  families  and community members  to increase parents participation in the school environment and to develop and maintain activities focused on family engagement  Ensures timely and consistent communication and engagement with parents  and especially limited English proficient and low income families  Supports a rigorous evaluation of family and community engagement in schools  based on criteria which include student achievement  student attendance rates  graduation rates  improvements in the school environment  and levels of participation in parent school activities Connects Students to Comprehensive Supports and Community Resources Authorizes  78 million to support community based organizations  in partnership with schools  to deliver integrated student services designed to close the achievement gap and dramatically reduce the risk of students dropping out of school  Provides for a needs assessment to identify comprehensive supports needed to promote the social  emotional  intellectual  and physical development of students to enhance their learning  Delivers integrated services such as health and counseling  human services  dropout prevention  enrichment and accelerated learning  mentorships and tutoring  and other supports to better engage students in school and help them succeed   Ensures an effective and cost efficient delivery  connecting existing community resources with schools  Studies show that for every  100 of federal investment  community based integrated services can help leverage an additional  82 of private funds  Creates Schools as Centers of Communities Authorizes  52 million in incentive grants to encourage the innovative use of schools as joint facilities to deliver  expand  and coordinate services for children and their communities   Encourages the design and renovation of schools as Centers of Communities  in coordination with mayors  for profit and non profit organizations  and other community partners  to better address the comprehensive needs of students       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
