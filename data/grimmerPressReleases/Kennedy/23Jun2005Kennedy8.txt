         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  This report shows once again the consequences of the Bush Administration s failure to invest in school reform and improvement  The No Child Left Behind Act set high standards to hold schools accountable for the education of every one of our children  We cannot strengthen our economy and open new doors of opportunity for our children if we fail to invest in good teachers  smaller class sizes  able tutors  and effective after school programs    all actions needed for continued progress in our public schools As the report points out  there are very real problems with the law s implementation  I ve introduced legislation to correct these problems  I ll continue to call upon the Bush Administration to improve implementation and provide the resources promised to our public schools under the No Child Left Behind Act  We need real partnerships and real resources to improve public schools Policymakers and educators agree that high standards and strong accountability are critical ingredients for improving public education  The No Child Left Behind Act has put these principles at the center of the national debate on school reform and is spurring positive changes in many communities and schools  Massachusetts embraced those principles long before the No Child Left Behind Act  and I m proud of all that Massachusetts parents  teachers  and students have done to make our public schools the best in the nation But we can always do better and we must do better if we expect to compete in the global marketplace  While Massachusetts leads the nation in reading and math  not every student in our schools receives a quality education that equips them to compete in the modern marketplace  African American students fail the MCAS at four times the rate of their white students  and Latino students fail the test at six times that rate  As long as those disparities exist  we have room for improvement  Educators  parents and students throughout Massachusetts will rise to this challenge  I look forward to continuing to support their efforts   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
