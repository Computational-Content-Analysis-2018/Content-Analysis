         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   D C   The Bush National Labor Relations Board has waged an unprecedented war against long established workers rights  witnesses told the House Subcommittee on Health  Employment  Labor and Pensions  and the Senate Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee today     Sen  Edward Kennedy  D MA   chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  said  The National Labor Relations Board is supposed to protect the voice of American workers  but the Board is no longer fulfilling that responsibility  Instead of enacting policies that encourage collective bargaining  it seems hostile to the very idea of such bargaining  Each time the Board uses its power to undercut the protections of the law  the nations workers pay the price  We should all  Democrat and Republican  be concerned about the state of collective bargaining in our country  History teaches us that the nations unions and the middle class rise and fall together  Theyve been placed apart in recent years  and we need to bring them back together      A majority of these decisions are viewed as many as a major shift in labor policy and an assault on the American worker and his or her right to collectively bargain  said Rep  Rob Andrews  D NJ   chairman of the House subcommittee  When workers get their fair share  the economy benefits and the middle class grows stronger  The freedom to organize and collectively bargain has been under severe assault in recent decades and it is our role to determine whether the Boards recent decisions are contributing to the problem     This President has stacked the deck against workers on the National Labor Relations Board  said Sen  Patty Murray  D WA   As chair of the Senate Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee  protecting workers rights is a critical priority for me  And it should be a priority for those government agencies charged with promoting the well being of workers and their families  Unfortunately  it seems that many Administration appointees have decided that following the intent of the law isnt important     Witnesses said that the NLRBs Republican majority has overturned long settled precedent and established new rules that make it even more difficult for workers to join unions and bargain for better employment terms and less costly for employers to break the law and fire workers who want a union     Since its installation in 2002  the Bush administrations Labor Board has embarked on a systematic and insidious effort to radically overhaul our federal labor law and its regulation of labor relations in the private sector  said Jonathan P  Hiatt  general counsel of the AFL CIO  Its decisions are not merely a pendulum swing or a course correction at times characteristic of changes in political administrations  Rather  they evince a calculated effort to make fundamental changes to our nations labor law     The NLRB issued 61 published decisions in September alone  including one on how much back pay workers can receive if they are unjustly fired  In 1996  Feliza Ryland  a housekeeper at the Grosvenor Resorts in Orlando  and other workers were fired after going on strike when contract negotiations stalled  In 2001  the NLRB agreed that the workers were illegally fired and were entitled to back pay      The NLRB ruled that Ryland and other workers were not entitled to full back pay because the striking workers did not leave the picket line soon enough  The NLRB said that the workers forfeited the right to full back pay because they picketed for several weeks in an attempt to get their jobs back  jobs from which they had been unlawfully terminated  rather than looking for a new job  Giving full back pay would promote idleness  the majority said     It has now been more than 11 years since I was unlawfully fired  and I am still waiting to see the back pay  still waiting to see justice  said Ryland  Workers who are fired for trying to organize and bargain for a better life have been mistreated for exercising their rights  It should not take so long to get justice     In reading Grosvenor Resort  one almost wonders who the wrongdoer really was  the employer or the employees  said NLRB Board Member Wilma Liebman  who disagreed with the majority opinion in Rylands case  What reasonable employee will risk exercising her labor law rights  if she is uncertain about her chances at the Board  but can count on a long delay before a violation might be found  more delay before a remedy is awarded  and a meager remedy in the end     Matthew W  Finkin  a labor policy researcher at the University of Illinois School of Law  said that the NLRB under the Bush Administration has been moving in a radical new direction rather than following established labor law      The current NLRB has charted a historically unprecedented course  said Finkin  I do not believe that any disinterested reader of the contemporary Boards record could characterize the pattern of the Board decisions as the product of impartiality or could conceive of the Board as a neutral arbiter     Workers rights have been under near constant assault in the years since the start of the Bush administration  said Rep  George Miller  D CA   chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee  The rights of workers to join together and bargain collectively for a better deal are fundamental human rights  These rights are enshrined in the National Labor Relations Act  the purpose of which is clear  to protect workers full freedom of association and encourage collective bargaining          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
