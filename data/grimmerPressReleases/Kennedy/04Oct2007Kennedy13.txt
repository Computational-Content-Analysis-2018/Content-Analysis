         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I rise today in response to the shocking news reported on the front page of the New York Times  the Department of Justice gave legal advice authorizing the use of extreme interrogation techniques not only in 2002 and 2003  but also at least two more times in 2005  This revelation shows that the Justice Department has fallen even lower than we had realized  and that it is up to Congress to take a firm stand against torture because this Executive can never be trusted to do so      Weve been here before  Before this morning  we already knew about an earlier opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel that authorized the use of torture      When this torture memo came to light  it inspired worldwide outrage and condemnation  America lost its moral high ground in the fight against terrorism  possibly for years to come  This memo and others like it violated the values we hold dear  undermined our intelligence gathering  and encouraged our enemies to respond in kind     But the opinion was not only morally wrong  it was also legally wrong  After the public outrage over the opinions broke  the Office of Legal Counsel took the extraordinary step of withdrawing it  As far as we know  this was the first time that an OLC opinion had ever been overturned within a single Administration       Todays New York Times story tells us that this disgraceful episode did not end when the torture memo was withdrawn  At the same time that the Justice Department was publicly claiming that it had put things right  the Office of Legal Counsel was secretly issuing two new opinions      The first opinion authorized harsh interrogation techniques together  in combination  to create a more extreme overall effect  For instance  interrogators could withhold food at the same time that they subjected detainees to freezing temperatures      The second opinion declared that none of the CIAs interrogation methods violated the ban on cruel  inhuman  and degrading treatment that Congress was getting ready to pass  This was at a time when the CIA was using waterboarding and other abhorrent techniques copied from the Soviets and other brutal regimes      So how did the Justice Department go from secretly authorizing brutal interrogation techniques in 2002 and 2003  to withdrawing some of that authorization in 2004  to once again secretly authorizing such techniques in 2005  The answer  we now know  is that the White House overruled all those pesky officials who told them what they didnt want to hearwho told them that torture is wrong and illegal        James Comey told his colleagues at the Justice Department that they would all be ashamed when the world eventually learned of these opinions  He was sidelined by the White House  Jack Goldsmith met the same fate  These were conservative Republicans and loyal patriots  who were simply trying to uphold the law       It is clear why President Bush wanted Alberto Gonzales to run the Justice Department  He wanted to install his personal lawyer  not a guardian of the rule of law  Mr  Gonzales approved these two memos and everything else the President needed legal cover on     It would be bad enough if this Administration had disgraced itself and this country by engaging in cruel and degrading treatment of detainees  It is worse still that it enlisted the Justice Department in the effort to justify and cover up its activities    Todays revelations give new urgency to the need for Congressional action  I am the sponsor of a bill that responds to this need  the Torture Prevention and Effective Interrogation Act      The bill makes one basic reform  to apply the standards of the Army Field Manual to all U S  government interrogations  not just Department of Defense interrogations       When Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005  we recognized that the Army Field Manual represents our best effort to develop an effective interrogation policy  The Senate voted 90 9 to apply its standards to all Department of Defense personnel      By enacting the Detainee Treatment Act  Congress tried to ensure that our government honors its commitment to the basic rights enshrined in the Geneva Conventions  which protect both the values we cherish as a free society and the lives of our servicemen and women overseas      We now know  however  that the 2005 Act falls short of our goals  We left open a loophole that undermines the basic safeguards against torture and cruel and degrading treatment  We applied the reform to the Department of Defense  but not to the CIA  And as todays New York Times story shows  it is the CIA that we need to be most worried about      Last year  in the Military Commissions Act  Congress left it to the President to define by Executive Order the interrogation practices that would bind all government interrogators  including the CIA     The Presidents Executive Order took maximum advantage of this loophole  It is vague and fails to prohibit many of the most flagrant interrogation practices  Combined with these new OLC opinions that have just come to light  this Executive Order makes clear that the President believes these interrogation practices to be perfectly acceptable     The Torture Prevention and Effective Interrogation Act closes the loophole left open by the Detainee Treatment Act  It follows the warning of General Petraeus that brutal interrogation methods are both illegal and immoral  and that history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary     This bill is an opportunity to restate our commitment to the security and ideals of our country  It is an opportunity to repair some of the damage done to our international reputation by the Abu Ghraib scandal and the abuses at Guantanamo  It is an opportunity to restore our nations role as a beacon for human rights  fair treatment  and the rule of law  And it is an opportunity to protect our brave servicemen and women from similar tactics  It is a simple measure that is long overdue     Once again  this morning  Americans and people all over the world are revolted by what they have learned about this Administrations refusal to reject cruel and degrading treatment  It will be up to the next Attorney General to restore the Justice Department to integrity  It is up to Congress to restore the rest of the government to the principles of law and justice that make this country great           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
