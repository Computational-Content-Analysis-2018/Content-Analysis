         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the Surgeon Generals report on smoking   Today  the Surgeon General of the United States issued a major new report documenting the fact that there is no risk free level of exposure to secondhand smoke  Exposure to secondhand smoke at home or at work increases the risk to non smokers of developing lung cancer by 20 to 30  and heart disease by 25 to 30     The scientific evidence of the toxic effect cigarettes can have on nonsmokers  as well as smokers  is overwhelming  The deadly smoke poisons not only those who choose to light up  but also the nonsmokers who live or work around them   I hope this new Surgeon Generals Report will finally spur Congress to take meaningful action to regulate cigarettes  the most dangerous consumer product in America  Congress must put the public health first         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
