         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Legislation Will Build on Landmark 1996 Parity Law  WASHINGTON  U S  Senators Edward Kennedy  D Mass    Pete Domenici  R N M    and Mike Enzi  R Wyo   today introduced breakthrough mental health legislation to ensure greater health insurance parity for persons with mental illness  The Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 represents the culmination of more than a years negotiations involving lawmakers  mental health  insurance and business organizations to craft compromise legislation  The new policy would build on the landmark 1996 Mental Health Parity Act  a law authored by Domenici and the late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone that began the process of ending health insurance discrimination against people with mental illness  The bill does not mandate group plans to provide any mental health coverage  but it does require health insurance plans that offer mental health coverage to provide that coverage on par with financial and treatment coverage offered for other physical illnesses  One in five Americans will suffer from mental illness this year  But unlike in the past  we know today that mental illnesses are treatable  more treatable than many physical illnesses  Yet  only one third of those facing mental illnesses will receive treatment  Kennedy said  The bill we introduce today will begin to right these wrongs  It represents an agreement  after seven long years of stalemate  not only between Democrats and Republicans  but also with the mental health community  businesses and the insurance industry  And it provides new hope to millions of our fellow citizens   We are here today after years of hard work  Domenici said  Simply put  our bill will provide parity between mental health coverage and medical and surgical coverage  No longer will a more restrictive standard be applied the mental health coverage and another more lenient standard be applied to medical and surgical coverage  This is a matter of fairness and I am genuinely excited that we may finally make progress to build on the 1996 law and offering this much needed help to those with mentally ill and those whose care for them   This carefully crafted  balanced compromise bill could only be reached by bringing together employer  insurance and mental health communities and asking them to set aside partisanship and find a common ground  By bringing everyone to the table to air concerns and determine areas of agreement  we have finally overcome years of legislative paralysis to make progress for the millions of Americans affected by mental illness  Enzi said  Domenici is a long time mental health advocate  while Kennedy and Enzi are chairman and ranking member  respectively  of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee that has jurisdiction over this issue  The HELP Committee is scheduled to take up the bill Wednesday   The legislation would provide mental health parity for about 113 million Americans who work for employers with 50 or more employees  It will ensure that health plans do not place more restrictive conditions on mental health coverage than on medical or surgical coverage  As such it would require   Parity for financial requirements like deductibles  co payments  and annual and lifetime limits  and   Parity for treatment limitations such as the number of covered hospital days and visits   The 1996 Mental Health Parity law only provided parity for annual and lifetime limits between mental health coverage and medical surgical coverage  The new bill expands parity by including deductibles  co payments  out of pocket expenses  coinsurance  covered hospital days  and covered out patient visits   The measure does include a small business exemption for companies with fewer than 50 employees  and also includes a cost exemption for all businesses   The 1996 law began the parity process  and helped raise greater public awareness to the plight of those with mental illnesses and the societal stigma often associated with those illnesses  Today  about 26 percent of American adults  or nearly 58 million people  suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder each year  Six percent of these adults suffer from a serious mental illness  Mental illness is also closely linked to the more than 30 000 suicides in the United States every year  In addition  an estimated 16 percent of all inmates in state and local jails suffer from a mental illness     30    Summary Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 Context  This compromise legislation reflects more than a year of discussions among business  insurance  and mental health organizations  What the Bill Requires Plans To Do  The bill does not mandate group health plans provide any mental health coverage  However  if a plan does offer mental health coverage  then   The plan or coverage must ensure that the financial requirements applied to mental health benefits are no more restrictive than the financial requirements applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits that the plan covers  Such financial requirements include deductibles  co payments  coinsurance  out of pocket expenses  and annual and lifetime limits  The plan may not establish separate cost sharing requirements that are only applicable to mental health benefits   The plan or coverage must also ensure that the treatment limitations applied to such benefits are no more restrictive than the treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits that the plan covers  Such treatment limitations include limits on the frequency of treatment  number of visits  days of coverage  or other similar limits on the scope and duration of treatment  What the Statute Does Not Limit Plans From Doing  The bill would not prohibit group health plans from negotiating separate reimbursement or provider payment rates  or managing the provision of mental benefits in order to provide medically necessary treatments under the plan  as a means to contain costs and monitor and improve the quality of care   This statute would not prohibit group health plans from taking into consideration similar treatment settings or similar treatments when applying the provisions of this statute   The bill would not require group health plans to provide out of network coverage for mental health benefits  but if a group health plan does provide both medical and surgical benefits and mental health benefits  including substance abuse treatment   and provides such benefits on both an in  and out of  network basis pursuant to the terms of the plan  or coverage   then the plan must ensure that the requirements of this section are applied to both in  and out of network services by comparing in network medical and surgical benefits to in network mental health benefits and out of network medical and surgical benefits to out of network mental health benefits  Scope of Coverage  Small Business and Individual Market Exemption  The mental health parity requirements apply to group health plans with 50 or more employees   It does not apply to employers with less than 50 employees who are exempt from this Act  nor does it affect the individual insurance market   Cost Exemption  Plans may elect to be exempt from the parity requirement if it is projected that the health plan will experience increased actual total costs of coverage under the plan that exceed 2  of the actual total plan costs during the first plan year or exceed 1  of the actual total plan costs each subsequent year  The cost exemption would apply for the next plan year following determination that the cost threshold will be exceeded  Definitions  Mental Health Benefits are defined to mean benefits with respect to mental health services  including substance abuse treatment  as defined under the terms of the plan or coverage  and when applicable  as may be defined under State law to health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan  Effect on State Mental Health Parity Laws  At the State level  mental health parity standards regarding financial requirements and treatment limitations would be preempted  The bill would not preempt state laws mandating that mental health benefits be covered  States that elect  through statute or regulation  to adopt the federal standards would not be subject to preemption  Administration  Oversight and administration would be conducted by the Department of Labor for self funded ERISA plans and by the Department of Health and Human Services for insured plans  Effective Date  The requirements of the bill will be effective in the first plan year that begins on or after January 1 of the first calendar year that begins more than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act  Mental Health Parity Act of 2007  Q  A Q  Who does the bill affect  A  Anyone who has group health insurance through their employer  if their employer has more than 50 employees  Thats roughly 113 million Americans  or 2 8 million in Massachusetts  Q  What does the bill do  A  This bill requires insurance companies and employers offering mental health coverage to provide parity between mental health and physical health coverage  meaning that they must treat the two benefits similarly to each other  They cant establish different financial requirements for mental health  such as deductibles  co pays  annual and lifetime limits  etc  Plans can also not create different treatment limitations such as day and visit limits for mental health  meaning that the treatment they cover for mental health should be on par with what you would receive for physical health care  Q  Does it mandate or require a plan to offer mental health coverage  A  No  It simply requires a plan that offers mental health coverage to treat that coverage in a similar way to its physical health coverage  Q  Will it take away my state mandated mental health coverage  A  No  State laws requiring plans to provide mental health coverage will remain in effect  The primary difference is that these plans will now have to treat your mental health coverage the same as physical health coverage under the federal parity guidelines that address financial requirements such as co pays  and treatment limitations such as day and visit limits  Q  What happens if my states laws outline specific mental health treatment limitations  A  This bill would not affect the states basic mandate of mental health coverage  but it would take the place of any specific day or visit limits that your state might currently mandate  Q  Are small businesses required to comply with the parity rule  A  No  businesses of 50 or fewer employees do not have to offer plans with parity under this bill  but theyll still be required to follow state regulations that apply to them  Q  Will the parity requirement result in a cost to employers  A  Past Congressional Budget Office scoring of mental health parity has shown a less than 1  increase in cost to employers  Q  Can companies and insurance providers opt out of providing parity  A  Yes  but only if they can show that their actual costs for providing parity increased their overall cost by 2  over the course of the first year parity is in effect or 1  for subsequent years  If so  they may choose to opt out for one year  but must comply with the parity requirements the next year  Q  What happens if my insurance doesnt comply  A  If your plan does not offer the parity required by law  the first recourse is through your states Department of Insurance or other agency handling insurance matters in the state  If the state fails to enforce the law  you can appeal to the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  which can charge the health insurance issuer a civil monetary penalty fee of up to  100 per day per violation for each individual affected  The U S  Department of the Treasury is also authorized to penalize employers with an excise tax of up to  100 per day per violation for each individual affected  The U S  Department of Labor can also enforce compliance in group health plans  Finally  if none of the above appeals have resolved your dispute  you can also bring a claim against the plan issuer through the federal courts to get them to do what was required under law  Q  Will the states all enforce parity in the same way  A  Yes  Each state is required to enact the federal parity standard  or change their state law to mirror the federal standard  This ensures uniformity in how the states enforce the parity requirements  Q  Will my out of network mental health coverage be protected by parity  A  Yes  the bill requires that plans which offer out of network mental health coverage provide parity for that coverage  so that out of network mental health coverage is treated the same as out of network physical health coverage  However  the bill does not require that a plan offer out of network mental health coverage  even if the plan does offer out of network coverage for physical health  Q  Is substance abuse treatment included in the bill  A  Yes  plans that cover substance abuse will be required to provide parity  but the bill does not mandate that plans offer any substance abuse coverage  Q  Does it affect my coverage under Medicare or Medicaid  A  Yes and no  Medicare is not affected  Medicaid managed care  SCHIP  and some state and local health plans are affected  Q  Will the group health plan issuer be required to notify me of any changes to my mental health coverage  A  Yes  the bill requires that plans notify enrollees of any changes in their mental health coverage  Q  When does the federal parity requirement go into effect  A  The parity requirement will take effect on the first plan year of your coverage that begins at least one calendar year after the President signs the bill into law  MENTAL HEALTH FACT SHEET NATIONAL An estimated 26 2   of Americans ages 18 and older  about one in four adults  suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year  When applied to the 2004 U S  Census residential population estimate for ages 18 and older  this figure translates to 57 7 million people   In any given year  about 6    or 1 in 17 people  suffer from a serious mental illness   In addition  mental disorders are the leading cause of disability in the U S  and Canada for ages 15 44   Although mental illnesses are surprisingly common  affecting approximately 26 2 percent of our nation  recovery is possible  Studies show that many people with mental illnesses recover completely when they receive mental health services   Mental illnesses have a huge impact on our society  Consider for example that mental illness  including suicide  accounts for over 15 percent of the burden of disease in established market economies  such as the United States  This is more than the disease burden caused by all cancers   Evidence indicates a persistent disparity in the mental health status of racial and ethnic minority populations  as compared with the overall mental health status of the U S  population  Demographic trends indicate that the demand for mental health services tailored to racial and ethnic minorities will increase  but several barriers deter minorities from reaching treatment  Many of these barriers operate for all Americans  cost  fragmentation of services  lack of availability of services  and societal stigma toward mental illness  DHHS  1999   The MHPA would help to lessen pervasive mental health disparities   The number of employees receiving mental health parity under the new bill covered by self insured plans under ERISA would be approximately 82 million   The number of employees receiving mental health parity under the new bill covered by insured plans  which are not under ERISAs jurisdiction  would be approximately 31 million   Approximately 98  of workers with employer sponsored health insurance have coverage for mental health care   Approximately 14 20   of group health plan participants use their mental health coverage    LAURA CAPPS  202 224 2633
