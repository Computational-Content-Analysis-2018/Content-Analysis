         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                 CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633     The Supreme Court of the United States is the ultimate arbiter of our Constitution and  as such  it is the final protector of individual rights and liberties in this great nation  So when we vote to confirm a justice for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court  we have an awesome responsibility to get it right  And when we vote to confirm the Chief Justice of the United States  we have an even greater responsibility  because the stakes are even higher     The Chief Justice sets the tone for the Court and  through leadership  influences Court decisions in ways both subtle and direct  Indeed  during the course of his confirmation hearings  Judge Roberts expressly acknowledged the important role that a Chief Justice can play in persuading his fellow justices to come along to his way of thinking about a particular case  During my discussion with him of the Supreme Court s landmark decision in Brown v  Board of Education  I mentioned that the decision was a unanimous one  Judge Roberts responded    Yes  That      represented a lot of work by Chief Justice Earl Warren because my understanding of the history is that it initially was not  And he spent    it was re  argued  He spent a considerable amount of time talking to his colleagues and bringing around to the point where they ended up with unanimous court          On another day  when I again mentioned Brown and the indispensable role played by Chief Justice Warren  Judge Roberts said    Well  Senator  my point with respect to Chief Justice Warren was that he appreciated the impact that the decision in Brown would have  And he appreciated that the impact would be far more beneficial and favorable and far more effectively implemented with the unanimous court  the court speaking with one voice  than a splintered court    The issue was significant enough that he spent the extra time in the reargument of the case to devote his energies to convincing the other justices    and  obviously  there s no arm twisting or anything of that  it s the type of collegial discussion that judges and justices have to engage in    of the importance of what the court was doing and an appreciation of its impact on real people and real lives    I have thought long and hard about the exchanges I had with Judge Roberts  and I have read and re read the transcript and the record  And try as I might  I cannot find the evidence to conclude that John Roberts understands the real world impact of court decisions on civil rights and equal rights in this country  And I cannot find the evidence to conclude that a Chief Justice John Roberts would be the kind of inspirational leader who would use his powers of persuasion to bring all the Court along on America s continued march of progress     Therefore  I do not believe that John Roberts has met the burden of proof necessary to be confirmed by the Senate as Chief Justice of the United States  Sadly  there is ample evidence in John Roberts  record to indicate that he would turn the clock back on this country s great march of progress toward equal opportunity for all  The White House has refused to release documents and information from his years in the Reagan Administration and in the first Bush Administration that might indicate otherwise  but without those records  we have no way of knowing     Both in committee and on the floor  some have argued that those of us who oppose John Roberts s nomination are trying to force a nominee to adopt our partisan positions  to support our causes  to yield to our special interest agendas     But progress towards a freer  fairer nation where justice for all  is a reality    not just a pledge in the Constitution    is not a personal cause  or a special interest  or a partisan philosophy or ideology or agenda     For more than half a century  our nation s progress towards a just society has been a shared goal of both Democrats and Republicans  Since Republican Senate Leader Everett Dirksen led his party in supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964  equal rights for all has been a consensus cause  not a partisan cause  Since Congress adopted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and began the process of spreading true democracy to all Americans  it has been a national goal  not a special interest goal  Fulfilling the Founders  ideals of equality and justice for all is not just a personal ideology  it is America s ideology  Surely  in the 21st century  anyone who leaves the slightest doubt as to whether he shares it fully  openly and enthusiastically should not be confirmed to any office  let alone the highest judicial office in the land     Our doubts about John Roberts s commitment to continuing our national progress towards justice was  quite appropriately  a major issue in the committee hearings  The fundamental question was whether his record and his answers suggested that he would be an obstacle to that progress  by treating cases before the Supreme Court in a narrow legalistic way that resists and undermines the extraordinary gains of the past    For all his brilliance and polish  he gave us insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the John Roberts of today is not the ideological activist he clearly was before  The strong evidence from his own hand and mind  the crucial three year gap in evidence because of Administration s refusal to release his papers as Deputy Solicitor General  and his grudging and ambiguous answers at the hearing left too many fundamental doubts  and could put the entire nation at risk for decades to come     Some argue that John Roberts was just doing his job and carrying out the policies of the Reagan Administration in the early 1980 s  But his own writings refute that argument    these were clearly his own views  and were enthusiastically offered as his views  If he didn t agree with those policies as a lawyer in the Justice Department in 1981 and 1982  he would not have applied for the more political and more sensitive job in the White House Counsel s office when he left the Justice Department  He knowingly chose to be a voice for their policies  and often advocated even more extreme versions of those policies    He certainly knew what was expected of him when he chose to become Deputy Solicitor General in 1989  That position was explicitly created to be the political monitor over all Department of Justice litigation  He was eager to advance the ideological views that his earlier memoranda show he personally supported  He obviously wasn t just following orders    he was an eager recruit for those causes  That was the evidence he needed to overcome in the hearings  and his effort to do so is unconvincing    I hope I am proved wrong about John Roberts  I have been proved wrong before on my confirmation votes  I regret my vote to confirm Justice Scalia  even though he  too  like Judge Roberts  was a nice person and a smart Harvard lawyer  I regret my vote against Justice Souter  although at the time his record did not persuade me he was in tune with the nation s goals and progress     But as the example of Justice Scalia shows  and contrary to the assertions of my colleagues across the aisle  I have never hesitated to vote for a Republican President s nominees to the Supreme Court whose commitment to core national goals and values appeared clear at the time  In fact I have voted for seven of them  more than the number of nominees of Democratic Presidents I have voted for    Our Senate responsibility to provide advice and consent on Supreme Court Justices and other nominations is one of our most important functions  The future and the quality of life in this nation may literally depend on how we exercise it  If we are merely a rubber stamp for the President s nominees  if we put party over principle  then we have failed in this vital responsibility  Even more important if we go along to get along with the White House we will be undermining the trust the Founders placed in us  and we will diminish the great institution entrusted to our care  Every thoughtful and reasonable no vote is a vote for the balance of powers and for the Constitution  so we must never hesitate to cast it when our independent consciences tell us to do so    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
