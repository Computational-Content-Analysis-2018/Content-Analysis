         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner                  202  224 2633    Forty years ago  after the Selma Montgomery march  many of us in the Senate and House worked together to pass the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965  to guarantee that racism and its bitter legacy would never again bar polling places to any citizen     The failure to guarantee voting rights for all Americans has long been a national scandal  and it was finally cured in this long overdue Act     As we look forward to August 6th  the 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act  we recall the sacrifices of all those who worked brilliantly and tirelessly to see that all Americans have the right to vote  regardless of their race    This celebration is a wake up call to remind Congress of the need to strengthen and reauthorize the provisions of the Voting Rights Act which are scheduled to expire in 2007     In particular we need to extend section 5  which requires federal review of voting changes in areas of our nation where past discrimination has denied some the right to vote  We need to reauthorize Section 203  which requires bilingual elections where necessary to ensure that citizens with limited English proficiency can vote    As the Senate prepares to consider the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court  we are also reminded of the Court s essential role in upholding the Act     It is vital for the Senate to be sure that any Justice confirmed to the Supreme Court understands the Act s importance and respects the power of Congress to protect the right to vote  We ve recently received documents that show Judge Roberts had a role in opposing efforts to strengthen the Act in 1982  and I intend to question him about that during the hearings to learn more about his views    I look forward to working with my colleagues in both the House and Senate  and on both sides of the aisle  to advance that great goal and reauthorize the Act    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
