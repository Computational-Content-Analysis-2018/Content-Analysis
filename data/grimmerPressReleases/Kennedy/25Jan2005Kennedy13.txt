         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  I intend to oppose Condoleezza Rice s nomination  There is no doubt that Dr  Rice has impressive credentials  Her life story is very moving  and she has extensive experience in foreign policy In general  I believe the President should be able to choose his Cabinet officials  But this nomination is different  because of the war in Iraq  Dr  Rice was a key member of the national security team that developed and justified the rationale for war  and it s been a catastrophic failure  a continuing quagmire  In these circumstances  she should not be promoted to Secretary of State There is a critical question about accountability  Dr  Rice was a principal architect and advocate of the decision to go to war in Iraq  at a time when our mission in Afghanistan was not complete and Osama bin Laden was a continuing threat because of our failure to track him down In the Armed Services Committee before the war  Generals advised against the rush to war  But Dr  Rice and others in the Administration pressed forward anyway  despite the clear warnings Dr  Rice was the first in the Administration to invoke the terrifying image of a nuclear holocaust to justify the need to go to war in Iraq  On September 9  2002  as Congress was first considering the resolution to authorize the war  Dr  Rice said   We don t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud In fact  as we now know  there was significant disagreement in the intelligence community about Iraq s nuclear weapons program  But Dr  Rice spoke instead about a consensus in the intelligence community that the infamous aluminum tubes were for the development of nuclear weapons On September 8  2002  she said the aluminum tubes are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs  On July 30  2003  she said the consensus view of the American intelligence agency is that the tubes were most likely for use in nuclear weapons Dr  Rice continually spoke of the contacts between Al Qaeda and Iraq and the connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam  In fact  as we now know  there was no operational link between Iraq and Al Qaeda   as the 9 11 Commission has confirmed On the eve of the war  many of us argued that inspectors should be given a chance to do their job and that America should share information to facilitate their work  In a March 6  2003 letter to Senator Levin  Dr  Rice assured the Congress that United Nations inspectors have been briefed on every high or medium priority weapons of mass destruction  missile  and UAV related site the U S  Intelligence Community has identified In fact  we had not done so  Dr  Rice was plain wrong  The Intelligence Committee s report on prewar Intelligence concluded Public pronouncements by Administration officials that the Central Intelligence Agency had shared information on all high and moderate priority suspect sites with United Nations inspectors were factually incorrect Had Dr  Rice and others in the Administration acknowledged publicly that the U S  had not shared all information  it might have changed the course of history  The rush to war might have been stopped  We would have stayed focused on real threat  kept faith with our allies  and would be safer today America is in deep trouble in Iraq today because of our misguided policy and the quagmire is very real  Nearly 1400 of our finest men and women in uniform have been killed  and more than 10 000 have been wounded We know now know that Saddam had no nuclear weapons program  and no weapons of mass destruction of any kind  The war has not made America safer from the threat of Al Qaeda  Instead  as the National Intelligence Council recently stated  the war has made Iraq a breeding ground for terrorism that previously did not exist As a result  the war has made us less secure  not more secure  It has increased support for Al Qaeda  made America more hated in the world  and made it much harder to win the real war against terrorism   the war against Al Qaeda Before we can repair our broken policy  the Administration needs to admit that it is broken  Yet  in two days of confirmation hearings  Dr  Rice categorically defended the President s decision to invade Iraq  saying  The strategic decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein was the right one She defended the President s decision to ignore the advice of General Eric Shinseki  the Army Chief of Staff  who felt that a larger number of troops would be necessary if we went to war  She said  I do believe that the plan and forces that we went in with were appropriate to the task She refused to disavow shameful acts of torture that have undermined America s creditability in Iraq and the world  When Senator Dodd asked her whether in her personal view  as a matter of basic humanity  the interrogation techniques amounted to torture  she said  I m not going to speak to any specific interrogation techniquesThe determination of whether interrogation techniques are consistent with our international obligations and American law are made by the Justice Department  I don t want to comment on any specific interrogation techniques  I don t think that would be appropriate  and I think it would not be very good for American security Yet  as Secretary of State  Dr  Rice will be the chief human rights official for our government  She will be responsible for monitoring human rights globally  and defending America s human rights record  She cannot abdicate that responsibility  or hide behind the Justice Department as Secretary of State Dr  Rice also minimized the enormous challenge we face in training a competent Iraqi security force  She insisted that 120 000 Iraqis have now been trained  when the quality of training for the vast majority of them is obviously very much in doubt There was no reason to go to war in Iraq when we did  the way we did  and for the false reasons we were given  As a principal architect of our failed policy  Dr  Rice is the wrong choice for Secretary of State  We need instead a Secretary who is open to a clearer vision and a better strategy to stabilize Iraq  to work with the international community  to bring our troops home with dignity and honor  and to restore our lost respect in the world The stakes are very high and the challenge is vast  Dr  Rice s failed record on Iraq makes her unqualified for promotion to Secretary of State  and I urge the Senate to oppose her nomination   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633
