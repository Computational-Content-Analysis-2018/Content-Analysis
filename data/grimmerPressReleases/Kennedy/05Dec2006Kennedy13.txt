         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Fact sheet included  This afternoon  the Senate will consider legislation that will have far reaching effects on the nation s readiness for bioterrorist attacks  epidemics  and other public health emergencies  The passage of the bill today is the culmination of a long process that our subcommittee  under the able leadership of Senator Burr  conducted to evaluate recommendations for renewing and strengthening the public health legislation enacted in 2002 and the BioShield proposal enacted the following year  That was no small challenge  Our lack of preparedness was painfully clear to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who suffered and are still suffering in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  Today we face the possibility of a pandemic or a bioterrorist attack  which could be as bad as a Hurricane Katrina in every community in America  We know that we are not yet ready for a catastrophe of that scale  We need new medicines and new vaccines to protect against the disease threats of the twenty first century  Yet many biotechnology companies are unwilling to invest in this area because of its uncertain commercial rewards  Congress previously enacted the BioShield law to provide a guaranteed market for these products  but that program has been implemented poorly and has failed to live up to its promise  Our legislation makes improvements in BioShield  and supplements it by creating a new agency based on the successful model of DARPA  which has enhanced the development of important new products for our national defense  In recent years  the innovative research funded by DARPA has led to breakthroughs in supercomputers  robotics  materials science  nanotechnology  and in many other areas  Through the creation of a new agency  the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency  we can emulate that success in the development of new vaccines and medicines But creating new products is only half the story  The newest vaccines and the most sophisticated technology are of little value if our hospitals and health agencies are overwhelmed and under equipped  Time and again  Congress has called on the Administration to take the steps needed to protect America against these new threats  But time and again  the response has been insufficient  In 2000  Congress enacted the Frist Kennedy legislation to provide a framework for bioterrorism preparedness  In the first year after the legislation was enacted  these programs received just  1 million out of the  360 million called for by the legislation Even in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks  the Administration initially proposed only  50 million to upgrade our hospitals and emergency rooms  and requested only  125 million to improve our health agencies  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Daschle  Senator Frist  and Senator Byrd  and of now Senator Burr when he served in the House  Congress rejected these recommendations and provided over half a billion dollars for hospital readiness and nearly a billion dollars for health agencies Yet the Administration has cut these needed funds  The support for hospital readiness through HRSA has decreased from  518 million in 2003 to  483 this year  The story is the same in the CDC program to improve our health agencies  Funding has dropped from  939 million in 2003 to  834 million this year  Is it any wonder that study after study shows that America is not ready for a biological attack  Our former colleague  Senator Lowell Weicker  is chairman of the board of the Trust for America s Health  which convened a panel of experts in public health to assess each state s readiness for bioterrorism  The sad story is that no state was fully ready  Even the most prepared states scored only 8 out of 10 on measures of basic preparedness  And these measures don t ask the impossible  One measure is whether a state has plans to ensure continuity of care in an emergency  Another is whether the state can provide additional ventilator beds for ten    yes  just ten B additional patients  Even on these basic measures of readiness the majority of states scored a five or worse    and 4 states scored only a woeful 2 out of 10 We have seen the consequences of failure  Now  we must prepare for success  With this bill  we take many important steps to increase our preparedness and response capabilities for public health emergencies  This bill will increase our medical surge capacity  strengthen our public health infrastructure  and clarify the responsibilities of Federal officials The first response to emergencies happens at the state and local level  But state and local governments were quickly overwhelmed by the magnitude of the tragedy during Hurricane Katrina  and would soon be overwhelmed in a pandemic  Federal assistance is essential  But for the past 4 years  we have been giving States money for public health preparedness without giving them adequate guidance on how to spend it  This bill reauthorizes these grants to State and local public health departments  but now provides benchmarks  performance standards and increased technical assistance from HHS that will allow state and local governments to improve their performance  Accurate and up to the minute information is essential to managing an emergency  Health information technology is the key to a more effective health care system in so many areas  and it can immeasurably improve our ability to monitor a health emergency  Our legislation includes an important program to harness the power of health IT to aid our health emergency response We must learn the lessons of the past and see that our hospitals and health professionals can treat the victims of disease  that our health agencies can detect disease threats rapidly and accurately and that all parts of our society have adequate plans to contain a disease outbreak  This bill takes the right steps to better prepare our nation for the next public health emergency  no matter what its source  I urge my colleagues to approve this proposal and to work with us to see that we can send it to the President s desk before the end of the Congress  The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act Substitute Amendment to S  3678 This legislation reauthorizes the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002  P L  107 188  to protect the public more effectively and efficiently by responding to public health emergencies  and clarifies lines of responsibility  It also builds on the Project BioShield Act of 2004  P L  108 276  to accelerate advanced research and development of drugs and vaccines to protect the United States from health emergencies  such as avian flu  By building on the lessons we have learned from Hurricane Katrina and September 11th  this bill will improve public health and medical response capabilities for emergencies  Identifies the Secretary of Health and Human Services as the lead Federal official in charge of public health and medical preparedness and response during a public health emergency  consistent with the National Response Plan  Provides guidance to States and requires them to meet preparedness benchmarks and performance standards to ensure effective capabilities for public health and medical preparedness across the nation  Strengthens the State and local public health workforce by offering loan repayments to recruit and train public health professionals capable of responding to emergencies  Modernizes how public health departments detect  respond to  and manage public health threats  by collecting instant electronic information to enable public health officials to make informed decisions before  during  and after a public health emergency  Improves the management and readiness of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps to respond to emergency health care needs  Speeds up emergency medical response by improving training  logistics  and planning for health care providers and volunteers  promoting regionalization  and using mobile hospitals and alternative federal facilities to handle an increase in patients during an emergency  Accelerates the development of new medicines and vaccines by establishing the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority  BARDA   a new agency at HHS modeled on DARPA  BARDA will o Provide direct investment in medical countermeasure advanced research and development to bridge the funding valley of death where most products fail o Promote innovation to reduce the time and cost of medical countermeasure product development o Lead and enhance collaboration among the federal government  relevant industries  academia and other entities  Provides a limited Antitrust exemption to allow the Secretary of HHS and the Director of BARDA to collaborate and consult  as needed  with agency leaders  academia  and industry on developing needed medical countermeasures  Creates a National Biodefense Science Board to advise the Secretary on threats  challenges and opportunities presented by advances in biological and life sciences     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
