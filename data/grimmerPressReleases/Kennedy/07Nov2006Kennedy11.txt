         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Election Night Victory Speech  Tuesday  November 7  2006  Prepared for Delivery   Thank you Mayor Tom Menino  the finest mayor in America  for that generous introduction  And thank you John Kerry  my friend and partner in the Senate    I think were looking at a big night    Are you ready for victory    All across the country  people are demanding change  and we intend to make it happen   Im deeply grateful to the people of Massachusetts for sending me back to the United States Senate to fight for them    To the people of Massachusetts  I say thank you  Serving you is the greatest honor of my life    Just as you have honored me with your trust tonight  I will honor you in the years ahead by fighting every day for our Commonwealth and for our shared vision of what our country ought to be     Ill fight for good jobs and decent wages to support your families     Ill fight for affordable health care for you and all Americans     Ill fight for full civil rights for all our people  and an end to bigotry  prejudice and discrimination in all their ugly forms     Ill fight for education  to make sure that our schools serve all our children well and that college is affordable for every student    And Ill fight to change our course on Iraq  This administration went to war on false pretenses  They sent our troops into battle under armored  under manned  and without a strategy for victory  But our brave soldiers have fought with courage and honor for three and a half long and senseless years  Theyve done their jobs heroically  and were deeply proud of them  We owe them a policy worthy of their sacrifice    So I pledge to you Ill never give in until we change our course in Iraq     The votes you cast for me tonight were not just for a Senator  but for a cause     Its the cause of young families in Boston with great dreams for their children     Its the cause of elderly citizens in Springfield who cant afford their prescription drugs and are trapped in the Medicare donut hole    Its the cause of families in Worcester with loved ones suffering from serious illness  and who want the immense potential of stem cell research to become a reality as soon as possible    Its the cause of young students in Lawrence hoping for better schools and eager to go on to college    Its the cause of minimum wage workers in New Bedford and Barnstable whove waited ten years for the raise in pay they clearly deserve    Its the cause of all the parents and wives and husbands and brothers and sisters and sons and daughters across Massachusetts who pray that our brave soldiers will make it safely home     Most important  its the cause that unites all of us here tonight  and all our fellow citizens across the country  Our shared cause is a return to the America of our hopes and dreams  an America respected not hated in the world  an America that is once again a land of opportunity for all and a beacon of liberty to peoples everywhere    Today we have rejected the politics of fear and the tyranny of special interests  We have laid the foundation for a return to the politics of hope and a genuine commitment to the common good    So I say this to you tonight  Im ready to return to the Senate to do my very best to put our country on track again  We want our America back     I want to thank Ken Chase for his willingness to run  Our democracy works best when contending views are heard in the public square  and Ken Chase performed a public service for our Commonwealth     I thank all of you here in this room and the many others whove stood with us throughout this journey  Its your victory too  I couldnt have done it without you    Together  we intend to move our Commonwealth and our nation forward again  and become an America that once again lives up to its highest ideals at home and abroad    Im especially grateful to my family tonight for their unconditional love and support    Above all  Im grateful to a woman of grace and strength and wisdom  whose laughter and warmth can light up a room  especially on a glorious moment like tonight  Im so fortunate to have the strong

extraordinary people  Doris and Edmund Reggie  I thank you both for your friendship and love and support throughout this campaign     It was a special privilege this year to run on a Democratic ticket with Deval Patrick and Tim Murray  Their campaign has been built on the politics of hope and vision and opportunity  and thats how theyre going to lead from the Corner Office    Looking out across this room tonight  I see great friends over many years who were there for Jack in 1960 and his campaigns in Massachusetts before that  I see supporters and volunteers and foot soldiers from my own first campaign in 1962  and many of Bobbys supporters as well  Youve been there with us through good times and bad  and Ill never forget you     Ive also been blessed by new friends and supporters  many of whom were not even born in 1962  Your vigor and your enthusiasm have lighted up this campaign  and given me great inspiration for the future      The poet Yeats said it well  Think where man s glory most begins and ends  and say my glory was I had such friends    Im honored by your support and grateful for your confidence in me  I intend to repay your trust in the best way I know how  by working harder than ever for you the people  and for a stronger  fairer  and better Commonwealth and country and planet      Thank you all so much
