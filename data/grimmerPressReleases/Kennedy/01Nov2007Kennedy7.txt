         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I intend to oppose the nomination of Michael B  Mukasey to be the next Attorney General of the United States       This is a nomination I had hoped to support   There is no doubt the Department of Justice is in desperate need of new leadership    Under Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  the Department was transformed from a genuine force for justice into a rubber stamp for others in the Administration who cared little for the rule of law        The Office of Legal Counsel  and the Attorney General himself  repeatedly authorized programs of torturing detainees and wiretapping Americans that were both illegal and immoral       Career attorneys who spoke up were marginalized or transferred to dead end jobs   U S  attorneys were fired if they refused to take orders from the White House as to who should be prosecuted       The Civil Rights Division turned its back on its historic mission  and failed to vigorously enforce our civil rights laws  Instead of protecting the rights of all Americans  it spent time approving voter identification laws that keep the poor  the elderly  and minorities away from the polls  and investigating phantom allegations of voter fraud      There has never been a time when the Department of Justice was more in need of a new directionaway from partisanship and back to its critical responsibility of protecting our rights and enforcing our laws         We all hoped that Michael Mukasey could provide that needed leadership   He had served with distinction as a federal judge for almost 19 years   By all accounts  he was smart  fair  and conscientious in the courtroom   In some cases  he showed admirable independence  rejecting some of the Administrations most extreme legal arguments   He has the credentials and many of the capabilities to be a strong Attorney General       But talent and experience are not all that s required for the job   The Attorney General of the United States must also be a person with an unbending commitment to justice  fairness  and equality  who will stand up for Americas laws and values  even when the White House tries to steer the Department in the other direction       I have had the chance to meet with Judge Mukasey  to listen to his testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee  and to read through his answers to written questions submitted by Committee members   I cannot in good conscience support his nomination       My concerns begin with Judge Mukaseys answers to our questions about waterboarding    Waterboarding is a barbaric practice in which water is poured down the mouth and nose of the detainee to simulate drowning  The nations top military lawyers and legal experts from across the political spectrum have condemned this technique as a violation of U S  law and a crime against humanity   Following World War II  the United States prosecuted a Japanese officer for engaging in this very practice  and that officer was convicted and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor           Waterboarding is torture   Period   Yet Judge Mukasey refuses to say so        His refusal was so extraordinary and unexpected that we asked the Judge a series of further questions to help us understand why an able  experienced lawyer would find it so difficult to agree that a practice used in the Spanish Inquisition was torture   But our questions were met with equivocation and evasion   Judge Mukasey told me that my questions about the legality of waterboarding were the kind of hypothetical questions that judges commonly refuse to address    But he has been nominated to be Attorney General  and an Attorney Generalunlike a judgeis often called upon to determine whether an action would be legal before such an action is taken        However  it is not just his remarks on waterboarding that trouble me   Judge Mukasey also evaded a wide range of questions on torture   He refused to commit to sharing with Congress the legal opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel that have authorized coercive interrogation techniques   He suggested that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventionsthe basic international standard for humane treatmentmay not always apply to the treatment of enemies we capture  even though the Supreme Court has rejected that view   He would not even say whether it would be unlawful for enemy forces to subject Americans to painful stress positions  threatening detainees with dogs  forced nudity  waterboarding and mock execution      These extreme views are not only immoral and legally flawed   They also increase the risk that our own troops will be subjected to barbaric treatment      Judge Mukasey could not even bring himself to reject the legal reasoning behind the infamous Bybee torture memo  That memo stated that physical pain amounted to torture only if it was equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury  such as organ failure  impairment of bodily function  or even death   Anything that fell short of this standard would not be torture  according to the memo        CIA interrogators called this memo their golden shield  because it allowed them to use virtually any interrogation method they wished   When the memo finally became public  however  the country was appalled and the memos flaws were quickly exposed   Dean Harold Koh of Yale  Law School wrote  in my professional opinion as a law professor and a law dean  the Bybee memorandum is perhaps the most clearly legally erroneous opinion I have ever read   The Bush Administration was so embarrassed that it withdrew the memo        When I said to Judge Mukasey that his testimony left the alarming impression that you may agree with  the memos  legal reasoning  he did nothing to remove that impression   He said that the memo was a mistake  but he could not bring himself to reject its flawed reasoning   There are only two possible explanations for Judge Mukaseys testimony on this issue    The first is that he genuinely believes that waterboarding may not always be torture  that international law does not fully protect American POWs  and that the withdrawn Bybee memorandum was not deeply flawed    If those are his beliefs  he is so far out of the mainstream of legal thought in this country that he should not serve as Attorney General      The second explanation is that Judge Mukasey has already begun defending President Bushs Administration  instead of standing up to it when the rule of law requires it   It is quite possible that Judge Mukasey knows that waterboarding is torture  that international law protects American POWs  and that the Bybee memorandum was a moral and legal abomination    But he refuses to say so  because such answers would be deeply inconvenient to the Bush Administration      Time and again  Judge Mukasey told us that he would be independent of the White House  that he understands that the Attorney General is not simply the Presidents lawyer  but is the guardian of the law for all Americans   I would like to believe Judge Mukasey   But if this issue was the first test of his independence  he has failed it                   Judge Mukasey s answers to our questions on torture remind me of nothing so much as the responses to the Senate on these issues by Attorney General Gonzales    Mr  Gonzales adopted an absurdly narrow definition of torture in order to permit extreme interrogation practices   He ignored the plain language of the Geneva Conventions prohibiting cruel and humiliating treatment  He withheld his views on how to interpret and enforce our laws against torture and cruel  inhuman  and degrading acts   He refused to discuss specific interrogation techniques or to repudiate the Bybee memo   He refused to take any firm positions       Judge Mukasey may have dressed up his responses in more skilled legal rhetoric  but the difference between his answers and those of Mr  Gonzales is disappointingly small        Judge Mukaseys answers make clear that this Administration simply cannot be trusted ever to renounce torture   Congress  therefore  must act now to strengthen our ban on torture   I have already introduced a bill to do that  the Torture Prevention and Effective Interrogation Act   It will apply the standards of the Army Field Manual to all U S  government interrogations  not just Department of Defense interrogations   This basic reform will ensure that our government honors its commitment to the rights enshrined in the Geneva Conventions  which protect the values we cherish as a free society and the lives of our men and women overseas   I intend to move that legislation at the earliest possible time   Congress needs to pass it promptly      While Judge Mukaseys views on torture are reason enough to oppose his nomination  I found little comfort in other areas as well       For instance  Judge Mukasey argued that the President has substantial spheres of exclusive powers over which the other branches of government have no control whatever   He indicated that the President may indefinitely imprison a U S  citizen  seized on U S  soil  without charges  solely on the President s determination that the person is an enemy combatant   He ridiculed critics of the PATRIOT Act   He stated that the President may sometimes violate or disregard the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  despite that law s clear statement to the contrary       Judge Mukasey also argued that the Authorization for Use of Military Force  passed by Congress immediately after the 9 11 attacks  may have authorized the President s warrantless surveillance program that was used to spy on millions of Americans for over 5 years   That is a ridiculous legal argument  which legal experts have debunked time and time again   In these statements and others  Judge Mukasey left the troubling impression that the Executive Branch can run roughshod over the constitutional role of the other branches and the civil liberties of Americans      Finally  every Attorney General must have an unassailable commitment to civil rights   But  on issues of civil rights as well  Judge Mukasey fell short   His record on civil rights is not reassuring   As a judge  he made several decisions suggesting he was unsympathetic to victims of employment discrimination   More than once  he was overruled by the appellate court for dismissing claims of discrimination  even though the claims had merit and should have gone to the jury       When I met with Judge Mukasey  I made clear that the Civil Rights Division is failing in its historic mission   As civil rights legend John Lewis recently testified  the Division has lost its way   It will take clear  strong leadership to ensure that the Division once again vigorously enforces the nations civil rights laws   When we met  I suggested specific reforms  and I mentioned published studies that have done the same   Yet when I asked Judge Mukasey about his specific plan for the Civil Rights Division  he gave only vague answers   He never acknowledged that the Division is in need of reform  and he never provided any concrete ideas on how he would revitalize the Division   There was nothing in his answers to suggest that as Attorney General  he would enforce our civil rights laws with the skill and vigor that are necessary to guarantee equal justice and equal opportunity for all Americans      I therefore intend to oppose this nomination   Judge Mukasey appears to be a careful  conscientious and intelligent lawyer  and he has served our country honorably for many years  But those qualities are not enough for this critical position at this critical time   Over the past six years  the Bush Administration has run roughshod over the rule of law  and has taken the Department of Justice along for the ride   In light of that history  the Senate must demand an Attorney General who will speak truth to power  and follow the law  no matter what the consequences        Judge Mukasey s equivocations and evasions on critical issues give me no confidence that he will fulfill this vital role   After six long years of reckless disregard for the rule of law by this Administration  we cannot afford to take our chances on the judgment of someone who either does not know torture when he sees it  or is willing to pretend so to suit the President                 Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
