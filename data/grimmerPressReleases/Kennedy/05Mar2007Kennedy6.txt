back to  Childrens Hospital Boston   My familyand I know first hand the excellent  care that you provide to Massachusettschildren  and to children throughout  New England and the country  I especially want to thank Childrens  Hospital for your support of the NewEngland Alliance for Childrens Health    This coalition of diverse partnersfrom across the region was formed to make  sure that the reauthorization andfull funding of the Childrens Health  Insurance Program is a top priorityfor all of us   Your support will truly  make a difference  I also want to thank the Massachusetts Communities  Action Network  a groupof interfaith leaders who understands the importance  of childrenshealthcare  for their leadership and for their work in bringing  us togethertoday  Theres a simple reason that the Childrens Health  Insurance Program enjoystremendous bipartisan support in Congress and in  families in Massachusettsand across the Nation   The program is based on a  simple yet powerful idea   that all children deserve a healthy start in  life  and that no familyshould have to worry about whether they can afford  to take their child tothe doctor when theyre sick  CHIP can make the  difference between a childstarting life burdened with disease  or a child  who is healthy and ready tolearn and grow  In Massachusetts  weve  long understood that health care coverage forchildren is a necessity    My  good friend John McDonough deserves muchcredit for his pioneering work on  childrens health care   Johns work ledto the passage of the Childrens  Medical Security Plan in 1993 which broughtquality health care to children  in working families whose incomes were toohigh to qualify for Medicaid but  too low to afford health insurance   Thatinnovative program was the  inspiration behind the CHIP program  CHIP is even more important today  than it was at its start a decade ago More families wages are not keeping  pace with rising inflation andincreasing housing and health costs  Fewer  employers are offering familyhealth coverage to their workers  and many of  the workers who are offeredcoverage cant afford it   While the  number of adults who are uninsured has soared over the pastdecade  the one  bright spot is that the number of children who are uninsuredhas dropped by  about one third during the same time  And an important part of our  health reform last year was expanding CHIP tocover families with incomes up  to 300  of poverty  about  60 000 for afamily of four   Thousands of  uninsured children in Massachusetts now havecoverage through this  expansion  The Lewis family who has joined us today is a good example of  why we need tokeep fighting everyday to preserve these important  programs  But we need to do more   About 9 million children in the  United States stilllack health coverage  Whats frustrating is that 6  million of them    morethan two thirds    are eligible for coverage under  CHIP or Medicaid   Wemust do more to get those children enrolled  both  through better outreachand by simplifying the enrollment  process  Those of us in Massachusetts understand that the government has  a large roleto play in making sure that all children have health coverage    The pollreleased today shows that the people of Massachusetts just seem to  get it Whether they are Democrats  Republicans or Independents  they want  thegovernment to do more to provide health care coverage for  children  Back in Washington  President Bush does not seem to get it    The budgetproposal he sent us last month provides less than half the funds  we needjust to maintain the program  Under his proposal  wed actually see  adecline in the number of children with coverage through CHIP  What we  needis funding not only to make sure that children already on CHIP can  keeptheir coverage  we need to provide funds so that we can also cover the  6million children who are eligible for CHIP or Medicaid   That will  costabout  60 billion over the next five years  but I cant think of a  moreworthy program  We also need to provide the additional funding  for states that faceshortfalls this year   Fourteen states including  Massachusetts face fundingshortfalls over the next few months   Well fight  to make sure that we getstates the money they need so that they wont have  to drop children  fromcoverage
