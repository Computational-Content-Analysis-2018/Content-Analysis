         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C    Senator Kennedy released the following statement today in recognition of World AIDS Day AIDS is the greatest pandemic of our time  It affects men  women and children on every continent in the world  Nearly 40 million people are infected with HIV worldwide  and the disease causes 2 8 million deaths every year  Experts predict that in the next 25 years  AIDS will become the third leading cause of death worldwide  after heart disease and stroke  AIDS is a global problem that requires a global solution  Over the past decade  we have made significant progress here at home in both the prevention of the disease and its treatment  We have nearly doubled the life expectancy of people living with the HIV virus Large numbers of Americans  however  are still without access to the lifesaving drugs and primary health care and support services they need  The federal government must continue its commitment to combating the disease  We must do more to provide the funding needed to test for the virus  and provide care and counseling for those affected  We in Congress should reauthorize the Ryan White Care Act without further delay Because AIDS knows no borders  the United States must continue to be a leader internationally on the issue  Our country is blessed with incredible resources  both human and financial  and we have a moral obligation to use them to help those who suffer so much from the disease in other lands  We must work with other countries and their governments to provide affordable protection and treatment to all people  no matter where they live  Although the challenge is great  our ability to work together for the common good is greater  On World AIDS Day  it is important that each of us recommit ourselves to working together to defeat this devastating pandemic   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
