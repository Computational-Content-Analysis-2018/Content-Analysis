         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC  The Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  in the Department of Homeland Security has released Guidelines for Identifying Humanitarian Concerns among Administrative Arrestees When Conducting Worksite Enforcement Operations  The guidelines are the product of discussions among Senator Kennedy  Congressman Delahunt  and ICE that took place following the arrest last March of 350 workers at the Michael Bianco factory in New Bedford   Massachusetts  The guidelines set forth best practices for quickly identifying persons arrested who are sole caregivers or who should be released from custody for other humanitarian reasons  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Congressman William D  Delahunt released the following statement     Since the New   Bedford raids  our offices have been working closely with ICE to develop guidelines on humanitarian screening for workers arrested in immigration raids  We hope these guidelines will ensure that pregnant women  nursing mothers  and sole caregivers will no longer be subject to detention  We commend ICE for agreeing to permit state social service agencies to participate in humanitarian screening of arrestees whenever possible     The new guidelines are included below       Guidelines for Identifying Humanitarian Concerns among Administrative Arrestees  When Conducting Worksite Enforcement Operations     Prior to conducting a worksite enforcement operation targeting the arrest of more than 150 persons  ICE should develop a comprehensive plan to identify  at the earliest possible point  any individuals arrested on administrative charges who may be sole care givers or who have other humanitarian concerns  including those with serious medical conditions that require special attention  pregnant women  nursing mothers  parents who are the sole caretakers of minor children or disabled or seriously ill relatives  and parents who are needed to support their spouses in caring for sick or special needs children or relatives  Where practical  at the direction of the Assistant Secretary  ICE will continue to implement these guidelines in all smaller worksite enforcement operations      In support of ICE efforts to identify arrestees who should be considered for humanitarian release after processing  ICE should coordinate with the Department of Health and Human Services  Division of Immigration Health Services  DIHS   to provide a sufficient number of personnel to assess the humanitarian needs of arrestees at the ICE processing site      DIHS personnel should be given prompt access to all arrestees under safe and humane conditions on the day of the action  To the extent possible  DIHS should be provided access on a rolling basis right after processing of each arrestee  DIHS personnel should be given the time necessary to assess each arrestees individual circumstances  The purpose of the assessment should be to determine whether the arrestee  the arrestees children  or other people  including sick or disabled relatives  have been placed at risk as a result of the arrest  based on the illegal activity of the arrestee  To the greatest extent possible  the information provided in the course of such assessments should be used exclusively for humanitarian purposes  DIHS should also inform ICE of any medical issues that might necessitate humanitarian release or additional care  If  during the course of the arrest operation or processing  an emergency medical condition is identified  ICE will ensure that arrestees receive appropriate emergency medical care      If DIHS is unable to support an ICE request for a planned worksite enforcement action  ICE should consider coordinating with an appropriate state or local social service agency  SSSA  or utilizing contracted personnel to provide humanitarian screening  If DIHS support for ICE worksite enforcement operations is found not to meet the needs or standards of ICE and such issues cannot be resolved through consultation between ICE and DIHS  then ICE should consider coordinating with an alternative social service agency or utilize contracted personnel      In the event DIHS is unable to provide the requested support  ICE should provide advance notice of a planned worksite enforcement operation to the SSSA in the appropriate jurisdiction  In worksite enforcement operations  ICE will consider whether such coordination is appropriate  without regard to whether DIHS is able to provide the requested support  and will make such coordination whenever possible  While advanced notification to a large number of state social service officials may not be prudent or feasible for every operation  when practicable  ICE should attempt to inform the cabinet level state official responsible for social services of an impending worksite enforcement action  The notification should be given with sufficient advanced notice to allow the SSSA to identify resources that can support the operation      Once the SSSA has been notified  ICE should work with the SSSA to define its role on the day of the enforcement operation  to include proactively screening arrestees for humanitarian concerns  Humanitarian screening should occur at a time and place determined by ICE that minimizes its impact on the law enforcement operation  provided that such screening occur within 12 hours of the enforcement action  or as soon as practical      DIHS representatives and any SSSA representatives who have screened arrestees should make recommendations to ICE about individuals who should be released on humanitarian grounds  ICE should promptly take these recommendations into consideration when making determinations about whether arrestees will be released on their own recognizance or through some other alternative to detention  While ICE should take humanitarian issues raised by DIHS or an SSSA into consideration  these concerns will be weighed against other factors  including the arrestees criminal record  an existing removal order and other factors that would normally mandate detention  It is also understood that aliens who are ordered detained by ICE can seek relief before an Immigration Judge  who can change ICEs detention decision      Detainees should not be transferred out of the general area until the above assessments have been completed      In addition to coordination with DIHS and the relevant SSSA  when conducting large worksite enforcement operations ICE should provide notification to key area nongovernmental organizations  NGOs  once an operation is underway  ICE should provide the NGOs with the name and contact information of an ICE representative with knowledge of the operation  This notification should be to request that the NGOs assist ICE with identifying any humanitarian issues that are not brought to the attention of ICE      As in all ICE law enforcement operations  ICE should provide arrestees with adequate food and water and allow reasonable restroom access  Arrestees will be restrained when operationally necessary in accordance with ICE policy      All ICE law enforcement officers receive training and guidance to ensure that individuals are provided access to legal counsel  consistent with principles of due process and fundamental fairness      As in all ICE law enforcement operations  ICE should ensure that all personnel assigned to the operation receive detailed instructions on what steps to take if they encounter individuals with humanitarian concerns       In accordance with existing law and procedure  during processing ICE should provide arrestees with oral notice  and written where practical  in their first language of their right to legal counsel and communication with consular officers  along with a list of pro bono legal services in the area  As soon as practical after processing  ICE should grant arrestees an opportunity to meet or speak by phone with legal counsel and consular officers  ICE should facilitate all such communication  as well as communication with family members  by providing free and reasonable telephone service       As in all ICE law enforcement operations  once ICE determines that an arrestee will be removed  ICE should give the arrestee adequate notice and access  by phone at a minimum  to relatives so that s he may make plans for dependents  If the family requires assistance from an SSSA  ICE should facilitate contact by providing the arrestee with contact information for the SSSA  ICE should provide the arrestee access via telephone and  where possible  direct visits with the agency at the detention facility      As appropriate  if ICE is contacted by an SSSA or an NGO and provided with new information regarding a humanitarian condition after an arrestee has been processed and detained  ICE should facilitate contact between the reporting entity and the arrestee  In compelling cases  ICE may consider the possibility of release on humanitarian grounds based on such newly obtained information      In furtherance of efforts to ensure that humanitarian issues are raised with ICE  the agency should staff a dedicated toll free hotline so that relatives seeking information about the location of a family member will have reliable up to date information  ICE should publicize the hotline information to the community     Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
