         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  We are all moved by the bravery of the Iraqi people who voted in today s election  and we honor the courageous men and women of our armed forces who continue to risk their lives for a better future for the Iraqi people  As I said this week  while the elections are a step forward  they are not a cure for the growing violence and resentment of the perception of an American occupation  The President must look beyond the election  I continue to believe that the best way to demonstrate to the Iraqi people that we have no long term designs on their country is for the Administration to withdraw some troops now and to begin to negotiate a phase down of our long term military presence  Over the next year  we must more effectively train capable Iraqi security forces   David Smith   Jim Manley
