         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  It s ominous that the Administration would even attempt to resuscitate its radical doctrine of preventive war  By any standard  it s been an utter failure in Iraq and has weakened our security  not strengthened it  This dangerously incompetent Administration is obviously incapable of learning from its own history  and on the three year anniversary of the Iraq war  we can only pray that we re not being condemned to repeat it   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
