BROCKTON COLLEGE ACCESS CENTEROCTOBER 16  2006 AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY Thank you  Adrian  for that warm introduction  Its a privilege to be here to celebrate all you do here at the Institute  Im delighted to announce the  3 5 million in new federal TRIO grants that TERI is receiving to support its work in Boston and at the College Access Center here in Brockton With these additional federal dollars  TERI will be able to increase the number of students and citizens it serves by a third  from 1100 to 1750 per year  The five year TRIO Talent Search grants were announcing today will enable more low income  first generation students in Brockton and Boston to complete high school and enter college  Theyll encourage students who have dropped out to re enter the school system  And students and families will receive the information they need in order to pay for college The four year TRIO Educational Opportunity Center grant were announcing will help low income  first generation adults in Brockton obtain the guidance  mentorship  and information they need on planning for college and other education opportunities The work you do here is extraordinary  and it couldnt happen without the special partnership that exists between the Center  the city of Brockton  its school system  and the federal government  I commend each member of that partnership for your success  Willis Hulings  the president and CEO of TERI  whom I had the pleasure of meeting earlier this morning  Congressman Steve Lynch  for his strong support of the federal TRIO programs  Brockton Mayor James Harrington  whos such a staunch advocate for the city and for TERI  and Lydie Ultimo  Director of TERIs Brockton TRIO Programs  who has guided them into becoming a city wide system promoting access to education TRIO would not be successful without the close coordination of middle and high schools  colleges and universities  and community agencies  So Id also like to acknowledge  Basan Nembirkow  superintendent of Brockton Public Schools  Stonehill College and Massasoit Community College  who work closely with TERI to support its programs in Brockton  and  The Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission and Career Works  which provide space to TERI to carry out its mission All of us know that a college education is essential for the success of our people and our nation  More than ever today  its essential for the American Dream The modern momentum began in earnest after World War II  We knew we needed to build a strong peacetime economy  So we passed the GI Bill to enable those who had served in war to obtain the benefits of a college education and embark on worthwhile careers  It was perhaps the finest economic decision America ever made  For every dollar we invested  the Greatest Generation returned  7 to our economic growth Today  the stakes are just as high  As families come face to face with the rapidly evolving global economy  they have seen the value of their wages decline  the cost of living go up  and their jobs sent overseas More than ever  our young men and women need a college education  so that they thrive in the global economy and enable our country to thrive as well In 1950  when I graduated from school  only 15 percent of jobs required some post secondary training  Today  that number is over 60 percent and rising rapidly  Tragically  we face a shameful and growing gulf in college attendance between the rich and poor  Each year  400 000 college ready students dont attend a four year college because they cant afford it  Much like the achievement gap in K 12  theres a shocking gap in college achievement between White and minority students  Only 15 percent of African American students and 10 percent of Latino students obtain bachelors degrees today  compared to 30 percent of white students  Thats unacceptable  Fairness and justice demand we do all we can to close that gap Thats why the TRIO programs are so important  Forty years ago  Congress recognized the need for special programs to help low income  first generation students get to college  TERI has been a leader in that mission here in Massachusetts for more than two decades  During that time  youve grown from a small college access program in the Boston Public Library to a full scale operation that serves nearly 40 000 students and adults a year in Brockton  Boston and Chelsea  Today  you manage 9 college access centers  You give direct services to students in 12 public schools  You operate a toll free hotline for students and parents to obtain information and advice on planning and paying for college Since opening  this Center has helped more than 4 000 low income  first generation students receive services to help make their college dream a reality Participating in TRIO can make all the difference for students who might not otherwise go to college  Across the country  95 percent of high school students who participate in the Talent Search program remain in school  73 percent of college ready Talent Search participants are admitted to college or a program of postsecondary education  So I know the two Talent Search grants were announcing today will mean brighter futures for many  many students So will the Educational Opportunity Centers grant  These grants do a superb job of guaranteeing that students and adults receive critically needed services to help them apply to college and obtain financial aid  Nationally  83 percent of all participants  including 100 percent of all adult participants  receive counseling services  The various services provided are vital for low income and first generation students  for whom applying to college and paying for college are extremely daunting prospects The successes are impressive  but we know much more needs to be done  The Talent Search program reaches only 2 percent of its target population of low income and first generation students  The administrations recent cuts to TRIO have affected 26 of our Commonwealths 53 TRIO grantees  making it much more difficult for these programs to help all the students they can Thats why Im especially glad to be bringing  3 5 million back to the students of Massachusetts  where it belongs  and Ill continue to fight for more funds for these valuable programs From our earliest days as a nation  education has been the engine of the American dream  and we cant let it stall  All students and their parents deserve the support they need to benefit from education and keep our country strong in the years ahead TRIO is constantly opening new doors for all students to make the most of their God given talents  and showing that we are truly committed to fairness and opportunity for all in higher education  I look forward to hearing about the great work that each of you will continue to do for our students here in Brockton  and commend you again for the extraordinary difference youre making in their lives  Thank you so much   Laura Capps Melissa
