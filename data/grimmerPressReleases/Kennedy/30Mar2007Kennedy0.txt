         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I opposed Attorney General Gonzaless confirmation because he came before the Senate as an enabler of the Presidents misguided legal policies rather than as an independent legal voice  He has presided over one disastrous policy after another  including the continued abuse of detainees  the approval of unlawful wiretapping by the NSA  the partisan enforcement of the voting Rights Act and the failure to enforce our other civil rights laws  the abusive use of National Security Letters and the the inappropriate firing of U S  Attorneys  According to Alberto Gonzales he signed off on firing eight U S  Attorneys without being involved in any deliberations over the firings  According to his former Chief of Staff he was involved from the beginning  Either Alberto Gonzales is not telling the truth or he is far too disengaged and irresponsible to serve as Attorney General  His resignation is long overdue        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
