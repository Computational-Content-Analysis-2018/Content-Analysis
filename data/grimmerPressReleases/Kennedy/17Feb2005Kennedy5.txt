         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        Mr  President  today President Bush nominated Ambassador John Negroponte to be the new Director of National Intelligence  Rarely will a nominee so clearly go from the frying pan to the fire     Ambassador Negroponte will face enormous challenges in his new position just as he has in his current position as our Ambassador to Iraq  His experience there will serve him well  since the war with Iraq has made the country a breeding ground for terrorism that did not previously exist  His new top priority must be to keep America s intelligence community focused on the real threat to our national security   the war against Al Qaeda    This will not be an easy task  The ongoing war in Iraq is sapping our military  diplomatic  and intelligence resources  It is a war that did not need to be fought  There were no weapons of mass destruction  There were no persuasive links to Al Qeada  America should not have rushed to war with Iraq  We should have stayed focused on the imminent threat from Al Qaeda  a threat that remains strong more than three years after the 9 11 attacks     CIA Director Porter Goss  statement yesterday that Al Qaeda is intent on finding ways to circumvent US security enhancements to strike Americans and the homeland is a timely reminder that Al Qaeda is still the gravest threat to our national security  and the war in Iraq has ominously given Al Qaeda new incentives and new opportunities to attack us     The warning about Al Qaeda s threat was emphasized Admiral James Loy  Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security  He told the Intelligence Committee  We believe that attacking the homeland remains at the top of Al Qaeda s operational priority list We believe that their intent remains strong for attempting another major operation here    The danger was also emphasized by Robert Mueller  the FBI Director  who told the Intelligence Committee  The threat posed by international terrorism  and in particular from Al Qaeda and related groups  continues to be the gravest we face  Director Mueller said  Al Qaeda continues to adapt and move forward with its desire to attack the United States using any means at its disposal  Their intent to attack us at home remains and their resolve to destroy America has never faltered    In addition  the threat was emphasized by the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency  Admiral Lowell Jacoby  who said  The threat from terrorism has not abated The primary threat for the foreseeable future is a network of Islamic extremists hostile to the United States and our interests  The network is transnational and has a broad range of capabilities to include mass casualty attacks    Most ominously of all  CIA Director Porter Goss emphasized that terrorists are doing all they can to acquire nuclear materials that can be used in a nuclear attack against any American city  He spoke specifically about the materials missing from Russian nuclear facilities  He said  There is sufficient material unaccounted for  so that it would be possible for those with know how to construct a nuclear weapon  His assessment is that It may be a only a matter of time before Al Qaeda or another group attempts to use chemical  biological  radiological and nuclear weapons     Defense Intelligence Agency Director Jacoby concurred  saying  We judge terrorist groups  particularly Al Qaeda  remain interested in chemical  biological radiological and nuclear weapons    Admiral James Loy  Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security warned  Al Qaeda and its affiliated groups have demonstrated an operational capability to conduct dramatic  mass casualty attacks against both hard and soft targets inside the United States and abroad   The most severe threats revolve around al Qaeda and its affiliates  long standing intent to develop  procure  or acquire chemical  biological  radiological  and even nuclear  weapons for mass casualty attacks    CIA Director Porter Goss also said that we ve created a breeding ground for terrorists in Iraq and a cause worldwide for the continuing recruitment of anti American extremists     His assessment was clear  The Iraq conflict  while not a cause of extremism  has become a cause for extremists Islamic extremists are exploiting the Iraqi conflict to recruit new anti U S  jihadists These jihadists who survive will leave Iraq experienced in and focused on acts of urban terrorism  They represent a potential pool of contacts to build transnational terrorist cells  groups  and networks in Saudi Arabia  Jordan and other countries    American forces served bravely and with great honor in Iraq  But the war in Iraq has made it more likely   not less likely   that we will face terrorist attacks in American cities  and not just the streets of Baghdad  The war has clearly made us less safe  and less secure     It has significantly increased the challenges to our intelligence community  And it underscores the vital need to have a Director of National Intelligence who understands that it is Al Qaeda   not Iraq   that has always been and remains the greatest threat to our national security     In my view  we have no higher priority than to do everything we possibly can to track down and secure the nuclear materials missing from Russian stockpiles or from any other source that might be available to terrorists  The nuclear clock is ticking  and we are living on borrowed time    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
