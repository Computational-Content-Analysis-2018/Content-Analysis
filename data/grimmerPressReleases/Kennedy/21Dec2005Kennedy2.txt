         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  the United States Senate passed a Budget bill that contains cuts in education  health care and social services and will touch the lives of every American  The vote  which was 51 50 after having to bring Vice President Cheney into the Senate to vote  further demonstrates that the Bush Administration is out of touch with Americans  At Christmastime  it will be the neediest members of our society who have to tighten their belts  The Republicans have decided to leave tax give aways for the wealthy under the Christmas tree while leaving middle class families out in the cold     The cuts made in spending today will be used to fund a larger package of tax cuts totaling over  94 billion dollars  including give aways for America s wealthiest  The most egregious of these will mean millionaires will receive  32 000 in tax breaks while the working family will receive just  29 00     Senator Kennedy  who has been an outspoken opponent of the cuts said  This bill robs from the poor so Republicans can provide tax give aways to the rich  Republicans are good at the rhetoric and making it look like they want to help our neediest citizens  but when it comes to putting their money where there mouth is they fall shortvery shortand it s our nation s poor that have to pay  The future of this country was dealt a serious setback today when grant assistance for students was dropped  when Medicaid participants were given the cold shoulder and when working families across the country were told that their needs should take a back seat to tax breaks for the wealthy    House Reconciliation Bill Cuts Important Low Income Programs   Welfare Reauthorization  TANF   The legislation includes new work requirements in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  TANF  program   States would have to meet much higher work participation rates in 2007  starting just ten months from now  or else face fiscal penalties   The conference agreement would remove from states the flexibility they now have to apply different types of work related requirements to people receiving assistance funded entirely with state maintenance of effort dollars   29 states  not including Massachusetts  use state dollars in a separate program that counts towards maintenance of effort dollars  This is a critical option in the original TANF law that gives states the flexibility to serve populations that would not be able to participate for the hours and activities required to be countable under federal law  Both houses of the MA legislature have approved a bill that would direct Massachusetts to use separate state funds countable towards maintenance of effort dollars to serve families where the parent is disabled  caring for a disabled family member or has other major barriers to employment  If the option to use separate state dollars in this way is eliminated  there will be enormous pressure on Massachusetts and many other states to cut off assistance to vulnerable families who would otherwise count against the state s work rate   The conference report also imposes unrealistic work requirements on two parent families  In effect  this requirement means that any state that provides assistance to two parent families will almost certainly fail to meet the work participation requirements and will face fiscal penalties   CBO estimates that if states attempt to meet the work requirements in the conference report by placing more parents in welfare to work programs  rather than by reducing the number of poor families receiving assistance at all   the costs to states would be  8 4 billion over the next five years    Child Care  Despite this increase in required work  the bill fails to allow child care funding to keep pace with even inflation   The House bill provides only  1 billion for child care assistance  This is far less than the  6 billion in the Senate welfare reauthorization bill   Child care funding in the bill falls  11 billion short of the amount that CBO has estimated states need to meet the new work requirements and ensure that current child care funding keeps pace with inflation   An estimated 255 000 children in low income working families would lose child care assistance in 2010  States will shift resources away from child care subsidies for these families to help meet the costs of new work requirements   The bill will harm children in Massachusetts  There are already 13 500 children on waiting lists for child care in Massachusetts    Child Support  The conference agreement includes a provision in the House bill that would prohibit States from receiving federal matching dollars when they reinvest incentive funds into their child support systems  these funds are earned by States only when they achieve certain performance benchmarks in collecting child support    This change will cut federal child support funding by  1 5 billion over the next five years   4 9 billion over the next ten years   The cuts will result in a  2 9 billion reduction in the amount of child support collected over the next five years  and an  8 4 billion loss over the next ten years   In Massachusetts  over  58 million in child support payments will be lost over the next five yearsalmost  170 million will be lost over the next ten years    LIHEAP  The Reconciliation bill contains an additional  1 billion in FY 2007 dollars for LIHEAP   This one time obligation is split  250 million for formula funds and  750 million for contingency or emergency funds  Unfortunately this money is for next year and will do nothing to help keep low income families warm this winter  In addition  emergency funding is given out at the discretion of the President  It s possible that he could release little to no emergency funds in FY07   For FY06  LIHEAP is funded at  2 5 billion in regular funding and  1 683 billion in contingency funding  DOD and Labor HHS combined   However  with a 1 percent across the board cut to discretionary programs LIHEAP will receive  2 475 in regular funds and  1 666 billion in contingency  We are still far short of the programs authorized level of  5 1 billion   In Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves 134 000 needy families  Right now  these families receive a maximum benefit of  765 for the current heating season  This is enough for only one tank of oil  It takes at least two to four tanks to make it through the winter  Massachusetts may not see an increase over last years funding level in FY06  it all depends on when  if  and how the President releases the contingency or emergency funds    Medicaid  The House bill cuts Medicaid by  6 9 billion over the next five years and  28 4 billion over 10 years  Massachusetts could be cut by about  195 million over 5 years and  804 million over 10 years      17 million people would face higher Medicaid cost sharing  although the number could be as high as 30 million  including 13 children  The conference report lets states require co payments and deductibles on many Medicaid beneficiaries who do not pay cost sharing under current law  and increase cost sharing for beneficiaries who currently pay some cost sharing      Most of the savings from higher cost sharing would result because enrollees wouldn t access needed health care  CBO previously estimated that 80  of the projected savings results from decreased use of services  Health providers would be allowed to deny services if the enrollee doesn t pay the required cost sharing    resulting in higher spending in other areas like emergency room visits      States will be able to provide any child  regardless of how low their family income  with a lesser benefits package than current law requires  This could impact all 25 million children who receive health coverage through Medicaid    Education     The Conference report makes the biggest cuts to student loan programs in history   12 7 billion   and instead of putting those funds back into increased aid for all needy students  the bill will help fund tax giveaways for the rich     While this report includes some new aid for students studying math and science  the new program fails to prioritize the neediest students  and it imposes so many hurdles to getting the aid that it is sure to leave behind those who most need help to stay in school     Nearly 80 000 students at Massachusetts colleges and universities received over  180 million in Pell grants last year       While the Senate proposal would have delivered an estimated  120 million in additional aid for all Pell eligible students in Massachusetts over the next five years  the Conference report provides only a fraction of this amount and limits eligibility to only a small subset of Massachusetts Pell grant recipients     LABOR HHS APPROPRIATIONS BILL  AMERICANS DESERVE BETTER   Education    Base bill includes smallest increase in Head Start funding since 1986     o Head Start will increase only  11 million  leaving over 750 000 eligible preschool children without services  o In Massachusetts  15 000 eligible children would not be served    If a 1  cut is enacted  Head Start funding in the bill will be cut by  68 5 million  and 9 400 children would be dropped from the program     Even Start funding is slashed by more than half  from  225 million to  99 million  o Over 30 250 children will be dropped from the program    If a 1  cut is enacted  Even Start funding will be cut by another million dollars  and 235 more kids will lose services     As requirements under the No Child Left Behind Act are more demanding than ever  the Republican proposed bill cuts  780 million in funds for these programs     If a 1  cut is enacted  the bill will cut funding for No Child Left Behind by an additional  237 million  leaving the funding level  1 billion lower than last year s level     Title I funding for disadvantaged students  the law s key program  is  9 9 billion lower than the amount promised in the law  o Nationally  3 1 million children would be left behind  o Over 52 000 Massachusetts children would be left behind  o If enacted  Massachusetts schools would see cuts of over  4 million in Title I funding     If a 1  cut is enacted  Title I funding will be cut by  128 million  meaning 160 000 fewer kids will be served than last year    2 680 fewer in Massachusetts     Includes no new funding for after school programs   o Funding in the bill   991 million  is less than half the amount promised under NCLB   o At this funding level  1 65 million children would be left out of after school programs    31 500 in Massachusetts alone    If a 1  cut is enacted  after school funding would be cut by 10 million dollars  taking after school programs away from over 13 000 children  In Massachusetts  230 children will be dropped from programs     Smallest increase for IDEA in a decade   o It increases IDEA Part B grants by  100 million from the FY05 level to  10 7 billion   o The federal contribution toward special education will decrease from 18 6  in FY05 to 18  in FY06     If a 1  cut is enacted  the federal share will decrease to 17 8       Pell Grants are frozen for the fourth year in a row   o The maximum Pell grant remains at  4 050 despite tuition rising 45  at four year public colleges since 2001     Labor    Job training programs cut     o The bill cuts funding for adult and youth training programs by more than  60 million  This would mean a cut of  3 million in Massachusetts    If a 1  cut is enacted  funding will be further reduced by over  600 000 nationally  and by  30 000 in Massachusetts      Funding cuts for Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services  even in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and with 8 million Americans unemployed  including more than 160 000 in Massachusetts     This bill prohibits OSHA from enforcing respiratory safety standards to protect health care workers from deadly infectious diseases     Workplace safety programs failed to receive adequate funding as workplace deaths rise    Health NIH  If the Republicans succeed in a government wide spending cut  NIH will lose money relative to last year  This has only happened four times in the entire history of NIH   This is the lowest NIH funding level in 35 years   NIH is the engine of discovery that fuels modern medicine and our biomedical economy  The tank has been low for the past two years and now the Administration and Republican Congress has us running on fumes   You can t buy a car and refuse to pay for the gas     CDC  Critical health promotion and prevention programs will be cut in the bill  CDC will be cut by  307 million and programs focused on health promotion activities are cut by over  50 million   Preventive health block grants that support a wide range of public health functions will be cut by 25  and grants to states for bioterriorism and emergency preparedness is cut 12      HRSA  There are 45 million Americans who lack health insurance  but this bill funds community health centers that serve as a safety net of care for the most vulnerable  at less that half of the levels passed by the Senate   This means that there will be no new community health centers in 2006   Overall  funding for critical health professions training programs that encourage diversity in the health professions and train health care providers to that will deliver care in underserved areas are cut 52    Several vital programs strive to encourage better health care for America s most vulnerable are eliminated in this bill including geriatric training grants and funding for rural emergency medical services   With a 1  across the board cut  several programs including family planning  HIV AIDS prevention programs will now receive a decrease in funding  despite the growing need for these services     TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST     Ironically    and sadly    these cuts to the budget come as Republicans will try this week to secure over  90 billion in new tax breaks for the wealthiest      Bush and House Republicans want a  90 billion package that will extend the president s dividend and capital gains tax cuts for investors   The Senate Republicans approved a  58 billion alternative  without Bush s priority of extending capital gains and dividend cuts past their 2008 expiration date       According to the Tax Policy Center  the capital gains and dividend tax cuts in the House Republican bill alone will save the average millionaire over  32 000 per year  above and beyond the enormous cuts they ve gotten already from this Administration      Most of the benefits of this extension would flow to taxpayers who make more than  1 million per year  which the New York Times calls morally reprehensible at a time when so much is being cut from domestic programs      Estimates based on data from the Urban Institute    Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center show that if all of the Bush tax cuts are made permanent  the richest 1  of taxpayers will receive an average tax benefit of  58 200 each year  This represents a 7 3  change in their after tax income  By contrast  middle income taxpayers will receive an average annual tax cut of just  655  This would represent only a 2 5  change in their after tax income     The Bush tax cuts already enacted cost nearly two trillion dollars  plus additional interest on the higher national debt       On top of those tax cuts already in place  the President is proposing another  1 5 trillion dollars of extended tax cuts between FY 2006 and 2015  with another  300 billion in additional interest   Even this understates the real cost of making the tax cuts permanent  because nearly all the cost occurs in the five years after 2010  Thus  the real ten year cost  FY 2011    2020  would be nearly  3 0 trillion dollars      In January 2002  Senator Kennedy was the first major Democratic official to call for a rollback of those Bush tax cuts that benefited only wealthy taxpayers  specifically    1  restoring the rates of the top three brackets    39 6   36   and 31  to their 2001 levels    2  maintaining the partial phase out of exemptions and deductions for high income taxpayers contained in the 2001 tax code    3  maintaining the estate tax on estates over  3 5 million   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
