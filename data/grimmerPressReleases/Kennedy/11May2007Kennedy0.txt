generous support for Bostons children  and for sharing your evening with us  Were very proud of all that ACCESS does to bring greater hope and opportunity to young people across our city pursuing their education  We can all agree that education deserves high priority   Its long been the key to opportunity  progress  and prosperity in America  and never more so than today  America is strongest when our public schools are strongest  when all American children can attend good schools and have good teachers to help them learn  Schools shape the character of our citizens   They encourage each generation to participate in our democracy  and to serve our country and our communities Its even more essential in todays new economy  because we cant lead America forward without a well educated citizenry and skilled workforce In short  education is the powerful engine of the American dream   And the responsibility for improving education and delivering opportunity to all is one of the most important missions of our democracy  Our nations founders understood this   John Adams emphasized it when he drafted our state constitution in 1780  and called education necessary for the preservation of the peoples rights and liberties   Every young American should have the chance to learn in a good school  graduate  and become a productive member of society  Thats why were here tonight  ACCESS has an indispensable role here in Boston because of all you do to improve the education and the lives of our youth with the greatest needs  and by helping them to graduate from high school and attend college  Were proud of our schools   This past year  Boston Public Schools won the Broad Prize for their outstanding progress and innovative reforms   Our schools have become national models because of their leadership in providing after school programs  transforming learning at the high school level  and expanding the school day           The number of students taking Advanced Placement courses in our schools is ten times higher than it was six years ago   74 percent of our high school graduates attend college or enroll in specialized training  a rate higher than the national average for urban and suburban school districts   Were very proud of that    But we know theres still much to do to break down the barriers of poverty that limit education  14 percent of children under age 6 in Massachusetts live in poverty   For them  its a struggle just to get by  day after day 20 percent of students in Boston fail to graduate from high school  and without a high school diploma  theyre three times more likely to live in poverty If they cant go to college  theyre twice as likely to live in poverty as those who earn a college degree Fortunately  ACCESS is changing all that   You live by the ancient saying  that the mind is not a vessel to be filled  but a fire to be ignited   Your assistance to students helps ignite the fire of learning   And your resources enable those with the greatest financial need to open the golden door of college opportunity  It makes all the difference The new Congress is doing all it can to help remove the economic barriers to higher education   Were reforming the student loan program so it works for students  not banks   Savings from these reforms will be used to increase student grants instead of loans  to reduce loan payments  and to provide loan forgiveness for those going into public service careers  Each year  shocking as it seems  400 000 qualified low income students across the nation do not attend a four year college because they cant afford it   We cant afford it either  we cant afford to waste that kind of talent  In todays global economy  with India and China dramatically enrolling more and more of their students in college  the United States cant afford not to educate each and every one of our own citizens Were deeply engaged in that battle here in Boston   And tonight we pay tribute to those who have fought many a fierce battle to strengthen and support our schools  and who have steadily helped us make the progress we so greatly need      Bob Beal  Barbara Lynch  and Clayton Turnbull are champions at improving opportunities for young people in Boston  and giving more and more of our students the chance they need to learn and succeed   Your support of our students and schools is truly a labor of love   Were here tonight to say thank you and to recognize the outstanding work you do            The measure of our nation and our democracy is rooted in how well we care for others  provide for those less fortunate  and enable every child and every family to achieve the American dream   Thats why we are here tonight  to help our children  to help our communities  and to help our great city  Thank you all so much for joining in that noble cause that means so much to our city and its future   Summary of Chairman Kennedys Sunshine ActThe Student Loan Sunshine Act Protects Students and Families by The Student Loan Sunshine Act protects students and parents from exploitation by private lenders and lenders who offer gifts to colleges as a way to secure loan business   It requires full disclosure of special arrangements that lenders and colleges have to offer loan products at the college  bans lenders from offering gifts over  10 to college employees  and encourages borrowers to maximize their borrowing through the governments loan programs before taking out private loans with higher interest rates Ending Inappropriate Lender Practices         The Act prohibits lenders from offering any gift worth more than  10 to a college employee  including free or discounted trips  meals  invitations to entertainment events or other form of hospitality            It also prohibits lenders from offering services to financial aid offices that create a conflict of interest  such as lending staff during peak loan processing times         It prohibits college employees from serving on lender advisory boards or a lenders board of directors  and prohibits college employees from entering consultancy arrangements with lenders         It prohibits lenders from entering arrangements with colleges that require the college to brand the lenders loan product with the colleges emblem or logo  Giving Students and Families More Information About Special Arrangements Between Lenders and Colleges  and the Terms and Conditions of Loans  and Preferred Lender Lists         The Act requires lenders to report any special arrangements they have with colleges to make loans to the Secretary of Education  including the terms of the arrangement related to marketing  recommending  endorsing student loans  and any benefit  direct or indirect  provided to or paid to any party in connection with the loan arrangement         The Act requires the Secretary of Education  together with members of the higher education community and students  to develop a clear  easy to use model format for reporting the terms and conditions of student loans  similar to the APR disclosure required for other types of loans         The Act requires colleges preferred lender lists to  include at least three non affiliated lenders  clearly and fully disclose why the college has identified a lender as a preferred lender  and state that students do not have to borrow from the preferred lender list  Encouraging Borrowing Through the Governments Loan Programs  and Discouraging Overborrowing through Direct to Consumer Education Loans         The Act requires all lenders of direct to consumer private educational loans to clearly and prominently state that borrowers may qualify for low interest loans through the Federal governments loan programs   It also requires these lenders to clearly disclose how the interest rate is determined  sample loan costs disaggregated by type  information on any and all fees  information on collection in the case of default  and information on Better Business and state consumer agency or state attorney general complaints against the lender and their resolution         Before a DTC lender can offer an education loan of more than  1000  the Act requires the lender to notify the borrowers college of the amount of the proposed loan  so the school can advise the borrower if the loan exceeds whats necessary to cover the students cost of attendance after other aid sources are factored in         The Act bars lenders from offering a private loan through a college  also known as an alternative loan  until the college has informed students and parents of all their options for borrowing under the governments Title IV loan programs    including information on any terms and conditions of Title IV loans that are more favorable than the private loan  Facts about Private Loans  Lender Gifts  and Preferred Lender Lists Private Loans        Private student loans now total  17 3 billion  and have grown at an average rate of 27 percent per year since 2001   In 2001 02  private loans accounted for 12 percent of total education borrowing  in 2005 06  they accounted for 20 percent   Unlike loans offered through the federal governments loan programs  private loans frequently carry much higher interest rates  especially for students without credit histories and families without strong credit ratings         Some lenders are increasingly using questionable methods to market private loans to students and their families and court the favor of colleges and universities   For example                 The private loan company Loan to Learn invited college officials and their spouses to attend an all expenses paid education conference in the West Indies                 The private loan company Student Loan Xpress has offered 100  loan approval at colleges if the college agrees to brand the private loan with the colleges name and emblem  making the loan appear to be offered by the college  not the private lender                 Other private loan companies encourage borrowers not to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid  FAFSA     which allows borrowers to obtain loans at lower interest rates  while not prominently disclosing the fact that private loan interest rates are typically much higher  Lender Gifts        Lenders who participate in the governments Federal Family Education Loan  FFEL  program also engage in questionable tactics  like offering educational conferences at luxury hotels  and offering college officials free entertainment and tickets to sporting events   Many lenders offer their staff to work in financial aid offices during peak loan processing times  print materials for financial aid offices  and even e mail students on behalf of the financial aid office  Preferred Lender Lists        Most colleges maintain preferred lender lists and encourage students to borrow from the list   While some colleges use a rigorous process to ensure that these preferred lenders offer the best loan terms and conditions to students  others dont  and many preferred lender lists dont clearly state why the lenders have earned preferred status   Some preferred lender lists dont offer a real choice of lenders at all  because all the names on the list are subsidiaries of the same big lender                                   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
