         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on Bush s speech on rebuilding Iraq    President Bush continues to hope that the American people will believe the same old slogans about victory in Iraq if he repeats them often enough and loud enough  But hope is not a policy  The American people  and our men and women in uniform  deserve an honest plan for Iraq  not a public relations offensive     The Iraqi people want jobs  security  and basic services  and the President s words will continue to ring hollow until these urgent needs are met  Nearly half of the funds appropriated by Congress remain unspent  and millions of dollars have been lost to corruption     The President s rosy pre war predictions about Iraq s economy and resources for reconstruction was obviously false  with up to 50  unemployment today  much of the country still without electricity and water  and oil supplies remaining at pre war levels  If the President had listened to those who cautioned him on the likelihood of difficult conditions in post war Iraq  America and the Iraqi people would be in a different place today  He s obviously given the reconstruction of Iraq the same low priority he s given the reconstruction of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina     In addition to rebuilding Iraq  President Bush needs to rebuild trust with the American people  who were wrongly and repeatedly deceived about the case for war  Attacking those that offer real solutions won t do that  As he himself stated in 1999 about the war in Kosovo  I think it s also important for the President to lay out a timetable as to how long they will be involved and when they will be withdrawn  Why is it so hard for him to apply his own advice to Iraq     If we hope to create a new national consensus on Iraq  President Bush has to admit his mistakes  end the constant cover ups and produce a realistic strategy to achieve victory and begin to bring our troops home  We have no choice but to win this war  and Democrats should be proud that they have forced this debate into the public arena so that real solutions for victory can be put forth     IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION   Status of Funds   Of the  21 billion appropriated to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund  IRRF  since FY2003  approximately  11 billion  50   has been spent by early October 2005    Cost of Insecurity   Estimates for project security costs range from 10 50   depending on location and type of activity  A Department of Energy brief estimates that it as much as 40  for large scale infrastructure projects    The Special Inspector General for Iraq reported in October 2005 that 412 contractors had been killed since the start of reconstruction    Other problems related to insecurity include sabotage of projects and pre existing infrastructure  cost overruns  project delays  project oversight and monitoring  difficulty attracting and retaining qualified personnel and private investment    The Special Inspector General for Iraq reported in October that many planned projects will have to be left on the drawing board    Reconstruction Results   While project completion rates are improving  objectives in critical sectors have not been met    Iraq s crude oil production and overall power generation are lower than before the 2003 conflict    According to the State Department  refineries have struggled to keep up with the need for refined oil products because of insurgent attacks on pipeline systems  power outages and operational problems  In September a rationing system for gas had to be implemented in Baghdad    A recent survey found that 85  of households lack stable electricity and 54  lack access to clean water    A recent GAO audit found there are no meaningful measures to determine how U S  efforts are improving access to essential services    Economic Conditions   The Government of Iraq estimates unemployment at 28   A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies says unemployment and underemployment is closer to 50  of the work force  and many of these workers are youth under 25  significantly contributing to instability     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
