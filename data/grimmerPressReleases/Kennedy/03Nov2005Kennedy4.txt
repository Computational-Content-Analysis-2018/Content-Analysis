         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today Senators Kennedy  Enzi  Landrieu  Dodd  and Alexander were successful in their effort to provide one time  temporary impact aid to local school districts and private schools impacted by Katrina  The measure also cuts fees on student loans so that college is more affordable for all Americans  taking advantage of extra savings created by the underlying bill through cuts to banks subsidies in the student loan program  Prior to the voice vote in support of their amendment  the Senate voted overwhelmingly to defeat the Ensign Santorum Kyl effort to turn the bi partisan measure into a voucher bill     So many schools in the Gulf Coast region and around the country have graciously opened their doors to children without the assistance they deserve  I believe that the response to Katrina should be as generous as the American people are  Senator Kennedy said  Today I am proud that the Senate has put aside politics and ideological battles to get the necessary aid to these schools and to these children without further delay  My wife is from Southern Louisiana so we feel a special appreciation for the way that so many schools are ministering to those who lost so much     Without this increase in resources only 21 of 117 schools in New Orleans are expected to re open during this school year  Over 370 000 students have been displaced by the hurricane and currently  223 000 public and private students from Louisiana remain displaced  Across the country  444 private schools have opened their doors to displaced students from the Louisiana  Alabama  and Mississippi  The aid provided by this measure would flow through the public school system and maintain public accountability while assisting both public and private schools across the country that have generously taken in thousands of students     The Katrina relief portion of the measure totals  1 66 billion and each eligible district will receive quarterly installment payments for each student enrolled in a given quarter in either a public or a private school in that district  Maximum total payment is  6 000 per student and  7 500 per student with disabilities  not to exceed cost of tuition at private schools  The measure would also reduce origination fees for student borrowers by one half of one percentage point  totaling approximately  900 million  A summary of the bill is below     In the past several weeks to help develop his education legislation  Senator Kennedy has visited New Orleans  spent time with evacuees at Camp Edwards in Massachusetts and met with recovery experts and officials from the area to determine the best course of action to help get schools back on their feet and accommodate displaced students  He recently met with the U S  Conference of Catholic Bishops and discussed provisions in the proposal for aid to private schools  At a HELP Committee hearing he convened with Senator Enzi  Kennedy heard moving testimony from Superintendent Diane Roussel of Jefferson Parish who said  Money isn t always the answer to solving the ills in our public schools  but when we re talking about equipment  supplies  rebuilding  and maintaining our teaching workforce  money is the answer     Main Points on the Bill    Summary of Enzi Kennedy Amendment to Reconciliation Bill   This amendment redirects additional savings generated by cuts in bank subsidies in the education provisions in the Reconciliation bill to two purposes    1  Further decreasing origination fees for student borrowers by one half of one
