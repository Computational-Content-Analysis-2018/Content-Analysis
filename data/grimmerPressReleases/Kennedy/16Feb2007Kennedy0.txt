         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DCToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the United States Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  convened a hearing on college affordability  As part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act  Senator Kennedy is working to increase need based grants for low income students  provide more help for borrowers struggling to repay their student loans  and reform the federal student loan programs so they work for students  not the banks Witnesses at todays hearing include Suze Orman  host of The Suze Orman Show  Tamara Draut  author of Strapped  Why Americas 20 and30 Somethings Cant Get Ahead  Dr  Jon Oberg  former Department of Education researcher  and Dr  Sandy Baum  Senior Policy Analyst for The College Board and Professor of Economics at Skidmore College  Senator Kennedy said  America cant be America without an educated citizenry  Its essential to the nations strength  Congress rose to a similar challenge after World War II  For every dollar we invested in the G I  bill of rights  The Greatest Generation produced  7 in economic growth  and we must do the same today  because the need is so great and the stakes for the future are so profound The cost of college has more than tripled in the last 20 years  with the average cost of attending a 4 year public college almost  13 000  As a result  400 000 qualified students dont attend a 4 year college each year because they cant afford it  Loan debt is forcing borrowers to delay major life choices  such as buying a home  getting married  or starting a family  It prevents some borrowers from accepting their dream job  because it doesnt pay enough Senator Kennedys proposals to both increase aid for students  as well as reforming the student loan system have broad support and remain at the top of Chairman Kennedys education agenda  Summaries of those proposals are available below  The hearing was webcast and is available online at www help senate gov  STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDYCollege Affordability Hearing As prepared for delivery I welcome our colleagues and witnesses for our hearing this morning on the increasingly serious problem of college access and affordability  Its affecting countless young peoples basic life choices  from choosing a career to getting married  to buying a house and starting a family  I have a few charts that illustrate the challenges  its not too much to call it a crisis Its keeping 400 000 qualified students a year from attending a 4 year college  Its forcing many to rule out careers in public service  such as teaching  social work or law enforcement  They may be lower paying jobs  but many find them deeply rewarding in other ways  and they bring large rewards to our society  Its contributing to the increasing economic inequality in todays America  in which low income and first generation students are far less likely than others to earn a college degree  even though higher education is more important than ever to keep the doors of opportunity open in our modern society  In a word  its a crisis thats tarnishing the American dream for millions  and we in Congress cant ignore it any longer  Today  60 percent of new jobs require some post secondary education compared to only 15  of new jobs half a century ago  A major cause of the problem is cost  The cost of college has more than tripled in the past 20 years  and federal aid hasnt kept up  Twenty years ago  the maximum Pell grant covered 55  of the cost of tuition  fees  room and board at a public 4 year college  Today it covers only 32  of those costs  As a result of rising costs and declining aid  more and more students are borrowing money to pay for college  In 1993  less than half of all graduates of four year colleges used student loans to finance their education  This year  its two thirds  The average college student graduates today with  17 500 in federal student loans on graduation day  At public universities  student loan debt has more than doubled since 1993  Last month  the House of Representatives passed the College Student Relief Act  which cuts interest rates on new subsidized student loans in half  Because the last Congress allowed interest rates to rise  typical student borrowers  already straining under  17 500 in debt  have to pay an additional  5 800 for their college loans  The House bill would prevent this  Thats good news for millions of borrowers across the country  and I commend Chairman George Miller and Speaker Pelosi for their leadership in making this legislation such a high priority at the beginning of this new Congress  and I hope the Senate will do the same  We also need to do more to increase grant aid  Pell grants have been a lifeline to college for many low income and middle income students for more than 30 years  But last year  the average Pell Grant fell for the first time in six years  In the recent funding resolution  Congress took a significant step forward with a modest increase in the maximum Pell Grant by  260  from  4 050 to  4 310  My hope is that we can raise it to  5 100 in this Congress To prevent unreasonable debt burdens on students  we should cap student loan repayments at 15  of discretionary income  and offer loan forgiveness after 10 years to students who go into public service  Its also long past time to reform the federal student loan programs  so they work for students and families  not the banks  Its a scandal that has allowed these student loan programs to become corporate welfare for big lenders  We pay enormous subsidies to lenders to take part in the federal student loan programs  and we ignored the enormous growth of the student loan industry  Forty years ago  subsidies were needed to persuade lenders to take part  But todays  federal subsidies make student loans the second most profitable business for banks  after credit cards  Somethings obviously not right Of the two basic programs  the federal Direct Loan program costs taxpayers much less than the private loan guarantee program funded by the banks and heavily subsidized by the Treasury  We need real competition between the two programs  and we could use the obvious savings from such competition to increase need based aid The difference between the two federal loan programs is obvious when you look at these charts prepared by the Government Accountability Office  Here is the program funded by the big lenders  Its an incomprehensible maze of rules and responsibilities  involving organizations the Direct Loan program doesnt need  and with money changing hands every which way The Direct Loan program  by contrast  is much simpler  Instead of having lenders and guaranty agencies as middlemen  the government simply lends funds directly to the students  which is one reason why the this program is less expensive for taxpayers than the one funded by the banks  Clearly  the Direct Loan program is the better alternative In addition  the private student loan market has grown thirteen fold  thirteen fold   in the last decade  Students deserve protection from such gouging  We also need to be the insight over the sweetheart deals that lenders and schools are increasingly making to offer these loans to students  No students should have to mortgage their future in order to pay for higher education today All these issues will be addressed in this years reauthorization of the Higher Education Act  America cant be America without an educated citizenry  Its essential to the nations strength  Congress rose to a similar challenge after World War II  For every dollar we invested in the G I  bill of rights  The Greatest Generation produced  7 in economic growth  and we must do the same today  because the need is so great and the stakes for the future are so profound So I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses today  and to working with my colleagues in the months ahead to get the job done  The Student Debt Relief ActSenator Edward M  KennedyFact Sheet  The cost of attendance at a public four year college increased from  10 375 to  12 796 from 2001 02 to 2006 07  The total cost at a private  4 year institution increased from  27 404 in 2001 02 to over  30 000 in 2006 07   College Board  Trends in College Pricing  2006    Even after financial aid is taken into account  31 percent of an average familys income is needed to cover annual expenses at a public four year college and 72 percent of an average familys income is needed at a private four year college   The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education   The purchasing power of the Pell Grant is declining  Today  the maximum Pell Grant only covers 32  of the total cost of attendance at a public 4 year institution while it covered 55  of the those costs 20 years ago  College Board  Trends in Student Aid  2006   Less than half of college students graduated with debt in 1993  but two thirds of college students graduated with debt in 2004  Project on Student Debt   Between 1993 and 2004  the average amount of federal student loan debt upon graduation from a 4 year college more than doubled from  7 650 to  17 400  NCES  NPSAS 1993 and 2004    Unmanageable debt is affecting students decisions to enter public service careers  Twenty three percent of public college graduates and 38 percent of private college graduates would have an unmanageable debt level if they were to live on a starting teachers salary  The outlook is even bleaker for social work  student debt would be unmanageable for 37  of public college graduates and 55  of private college graduates living on the starting salary of a social worker   State PIRGs Higher Education Project  2006  Senator Kennedys Student Debt Relief Act   Cuts student loan interest rates in half  from 6 8  to 3 4   This would save the current typical student borrower  2 280 over the lifetime of his or her loan and save the beginning college student  4 420 when fully phased in   State PIRGs Higher Education Project   Immediately increases the Pell Grant from  4 050 to  5 100  With an increase in the Pell Grant  over 285 000 more college students would be eligible for the Pell Grant next school year  The estimated average grant for next year would increase by  647  from  2 442 to  3 089   American Council on Education   Caps federal student loan payments at 15  of a borrowers discretionary income  Forgives student loans after 25 years  and provides an option for 10 year loan forgiveness for individuals in public service careers  like teaching  law enforcement  and social work   Generates  13 billion in savings  at least  10 billion for increased aid  at no cost to taxpayers  by reforming the student loan programs to encourage the use of the governments less expensive Direct Loan Program   Congressional Budget Office  Student Loan Sunshine ActSenators Edward M  Kennedy and Richard J  Durbin The Student Loan Sunshine Act protects students and parents from exploitation by private lenders and lenders who offer gifts to colleges as a way to secure loan business  It requires full disclosure of special arrangements that lenders and colleges have to offer loan products at the college  bans lenders from offering gifts over  10 to college employees  and encourages borrowers to maximize their borrowing through the governments loan programs before taking out private loans with higher interest rates The Student Loan Sunshine Act Protects Students and Families by Ending Inappropriate Lender Practices  The Act prohibits lenders from offering any gift worth more than  10 to a college employee  including free or discounted trips  meals  invitations to entertainment events or other form of hospitality   It also prohibits lenders from offering services to financial aid offices that create a conflict of interest  such as lending staff during peak loan processing times   It prohibits lenders from entering arrangements with colleges that require the college to brand the lenders loan product with the colleges emblem or logo  Giving Students and Families More Information About Special Arrangements Between Lenders and Colleges  and the Terms and Conditions of Loans  and Preferred Lender Lists  The Act requires lenders to report any special arrangements they have with colleges to make loans to the Secretary of Education  including the terms of the arrangement related to marketing  recommending  endorsing student loans  and any benefit  direct or indirect  provided to or paid to any party in connection with the loan arrangement   The Act requires the Secretary of Education  together with members of the higher education community and students  to develop a clear  easy to use model format for reporting the terms and conditions of student loans  similar to the APR disclosure required for other types of loans   The Act requires colleges preferred lender lists to  include at least three non affiliated lenders  clearly and fully disclose why the college has identified a lender as a preferred lender  and state that students do not have to borrow from the preferred lender list  Encouraging Borrowing Through the Governments Loan Programs  and Discouraging Overborrowing through Direct to Consumer Education Loans  The Act requires all lenders of direct to consumer private educational loans to clearly and prominently state that borrowers may qualify for low interest loans through the Federal governments loan programs  It also requires these lenders to clearly disclose how the interest rate is determined  sample loan costs disaggregated by type  information on any and all fees  information on collection in the case of default  and information on Better Business and state consumer agency or state attorney general complaints against the lender and their resolution   Before a DTC lender can offer an education loan of more than  1000  the Act requires the lender to notify the borrowers college of the amount of the proposed loan  so the school can advise the borrower if the loan exceeds whats necessary to cover the students cost of attendance after other aid sources are factored in   The Act bars lenders from offering a private loan through a college  also known as an alternative loan  until the college has informed students and parents of all their options for borrowing under the governments Title IV loan programs    including information on any terms and conditions of Title IV loans that are more favorable than the private loan  Facts about Private Loans  Lender Gifts  and Preferred Lender Lists Private Loans Private student loans now total  17 3 billion  and have grown at an average rate of 27 percent per year since 2001  In 2001 02  private loans accounted for 12 percent of total education borrowing  in 2005 06  they accounted for 20 percent  Unlike loans offered through the federal governments loan programs  private loans frequently carry much higher interest rates  especially for students without credit histories and families without strong credit ratings   Some lenders are increasingly using questionable methods to market private loans to students and their families and court the favor of colleges and universities  For example  o The private loan company Loan to Learn invited college officials and their spouses to attend an all expenses paid education conference in the West Indies  o The private loan company Student Loan Xpress has offered 100  loan approval at colleges if the college agrees to brand the private loan with the colleges name and emblem  making the loan appear to be offered by the college  not the private lender  o Other private loan companies encourage borrowers not to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid  FAFSA     which allows borrowers to obtain loans at lower interest rates  while not prominently disclosing the fact that private loan interest rates are typically much higher  Lender Gifts Lenders who participate in the governments Federal Family Education Loan  FFEL  program also engage in questionable tactics  like offering educational conferences at luxury hotels  and offering college officials free entertainment and tickets to sporting events  Many lenders offer their staff to work in financial aid offices during peak loan processing times  print materials for financial aid offices  and even e mail students on behalf of the financial aid office  Preferred Lender Lists Most colleges maintain preferred lender lists and encourage students to borrow from the list  While some colleges use a rigorous process to ensure that these preferred lenders offer the best loan terms and conditions to students  others dont  and many preferred lender lists dont clearly state why the lenders has earned preferred status  Some preferred lender lists dont offer a real choice of lenders at all  because all the names on the list are subsidiaries of the same big lender  Student Aid Reward  STAR  ActShort Summary Boost College Scholarships at NO COST to the TaxpayerThe bipartisan Student Aid Reward  STAR  Act  S  754     introduced by Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA   Senator Gordon Smith  R OR   Congressmen Tom Petri  R WI   and Congressman George Miller  D CA   provides billions in additional college scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students at no additional cost to taxpayers  The plan is simple  the STAR Act encourages colleges to utilize the less expensive of the federal governments student loan programs  Currently  there are two main student loan programs that provide essentially the same loans and interest rates to students  but one costs billions more annually than the other  In the first program  loans are issued from U S  Treasury funds  and private companies are contracted to service and collect student loan payments  In the second program  the federal government underwrites and subsidizes loans issued by private lenders and banks  These loans bear virtually no risk for private banks  yet have an assured rate of return and are guaranteed against default by the government  The first program is much less expensive  because it secures loan capital at a lower rate  eliminates the middleman  lenders   and cuts out billions in unnecessary subsidies to banks  1   _ftn1 The Congressional Budget Office reports that the STAR Act would generate more than  13 billion 1  in additional college scholarship aid  at no additional cost to taxpayersAccording to President Bush s 2007 education budget  student loans made through the more expensive program cost  6 more for every  100 lent than the same loans made with U S  Treasury funds  2   _ftn2 The STAR Act calls upon the Secretary of Education to determine which program is more efficient  Schools would then be rewarded with additional scholarship funds for utilizing the more efficient of the two student loan programs  The competition will encourage the federal loan programs to improve the efficiency of their operations  Schools  students  and taxpayers would all be the beneficiaries    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
