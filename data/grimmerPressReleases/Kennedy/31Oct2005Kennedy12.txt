         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Rather than selecting a nominee for the good of the nation and the court  President Bush has picked a nominee whom he hopes will stop the massive hemorrhaging of support on his right wing  This is a nomination based on weakness  not on strength   After insisting that Harriet Miers shouldn t even get a hearing because she couldn t prove she was extreme enough  the far right has now forced the President to choose a nominee that they think has views as extreme as their own   There are many serious questions about whether Judge Alito is a mainstream nominee fit to fill the seat of Justice O Connor  She was able to unite and strengthen our country through her careful  non ideological approach to the law   Although he is clearly intelligent and experienced on the bench  that is only the beginning of our inquiry  If confirmed  Alito could very well fundamentally alter the balance of the court and push it dangerously to the right  placing at risk decades of American progress in safeguarding our fundamental rights and freedoms   After stating that he believed in a diverse bench  President Bush took the nation a step backwards today  Apparently  he couldn t find a woman or minority or a mainstream nominee that meets the litmus tests of the right wing  and instead put forth a nominee with a troubling record on the rights and freedoms important to America s families   The Senate will now fulfill its constitutional role and conduct thorough and fair hearings to determine Judge Alito s fitness to sit on the highest court in the land  There are few decisions as important as picking a Supreme Court Justice  and the Senate must not be rushed in considering this nomination   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
