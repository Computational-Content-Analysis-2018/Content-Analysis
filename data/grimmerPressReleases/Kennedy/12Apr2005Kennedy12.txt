         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement in reaction to AARP s study showing that prescription drugs rose an average 7 1  in 2004  more than twice the general inflation rate    When it comes to the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs  most Americans are beyond the breaking point  It s high time for the Bush Administration either to pressure the drug industry to lower its prices or to stop opposing legislation to import cheaper drugs from Canada and other industrialized nations  Americans wonder how much longer the Bush Administration is going to let the drug companies get away with enormous profits at our expense   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
