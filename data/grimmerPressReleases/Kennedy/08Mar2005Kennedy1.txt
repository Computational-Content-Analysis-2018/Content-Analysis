         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  This bankruptcy bill is mean spirited and unfair  In anything like its present form  it should and will be an embarrassment to anyone who votes for it   It s a bonanza for the credit card companies  which made  30 billion in profits last year  and a nightmare for the poorest of the poor  and the weakest of the weak   It favors the credit card companies  the giant banks and the big car loan companies at every turn  It favors the worst of the credit industry    the interest rate gougers  the payday lenders  and the abusive collection agencies  It hurts real people who lose their savings because of a medical crisis  or lose their jobs because of outsourcing  or suffer major loss of income because they were called up for duty in Iraq or Afghanistan  It protects corporate interests at the expense of the needs of real people   It does absolutely nothing about the glaring abuses of the bankruptcy system by the executives of giant companies like Enron and Worldcom and Polaroid  who lined their own pockets  but left thousands of employees and retirees out in the cold   It favors companies like MBNA  a top credit card issuer  with over  80 billion in loans  and which has contributed  7 million to federal candidates   half a million dollars to President Bush alone  and spent over  20 million in lobbying  since 1997  when their lobbyists wrote this bill   On the other side  are people like special ed teacher Fatema Hosseini on the front page of yesterday s Washington Post  She fell on hard times when her husband left her and their three children  After her credit card debt reached  25 000  she stopped using the cards and took a second job to try to pay down that debt  She paid  2000 a month  but was hit with very high interest rates  which were raised even higher because of missed payments  heavy late fees and over limit penalties  She made no new purchases  but by last June her  25 000 debt had nearly doubled to almost  50 000  The longer she tried to pay what her statements told her were her minimum payments  the more her debt went up   When all of her salary was going for payments  she had no choice  she was forced into bankruptcy  in the hope of getting the fresh start the nation has long provided to its working people when they hit bottom   This bill says to companies like that  We ll help you scare that teacher out of going into bankruptcy  by making the bankruptcy process expensive and burdensome to people like her  If we can t scare her away  we ll help you squeeze your high interest rates out of her for a few years longer  even though she can t possibly pay off the amounts she owes  We ll take sides with companies like you and against people like her  That s what this bill says   We all know that s wrong  How could the U S  Senate possibly do something so immoral and unreasonable and unfair to our constituents when they are most in need of our help  Where are the vaunted values our colleagues talk about so much  Why didn t the Judiciary Committee do something about this travesty before it reached the floor  Why haven t we fixed it on the floor after more than a week of debate   This bill was bulldozed through the Committee on the pretense that we should not deal with its serious problems there  but should wait until it reached the full Senate  for serious negotiations and basic improvements  We were assured that there would be good faith discussions and compromises  and that all reasonable amendments would be given fair consideration   But now  there has been no good faith at all   no meaningful discussions  no negotiation  no real consideration of any of the very reasonable amendments that have been proposed to give this bill some shred of balance and fairness   On the contrary  the Republican leadership has invoked the strictest possible party discipline  When individual Republicans say they want to support or offer constructive amendments  they are ordered not to do so  Even when a Republican identifies a serious gap in the bill  like the very basic jurisdiction outrage pointed out by Senator Cornyn  an outrage that has prejudiced workers and retirees in almost every state  the Republican leadership has said  No  and refused to let the amendment be called up   The excuse for this bad faith and breach of promise is itself bizarre  the Republican leaders say they cannot upset the delicate compromise reached two Congresses ago  But the only real compromise was one that had the Schumer amendment in it  This year s bill doesn t have that amendment in it  In committee  Senator Schumer discussed his amendment  but I didn t see the other side jumping up to adopt it in order to restore and preserve the so called compromise  The floor leaders haven t indicated that they plan to accept this amendment to restore and preserve the supposed compromise   Let s be clear  Any pretense of protecting a previous compromise disappeared when the bill s sponsors unilaterally took the Schumer amendment out of the bill before introducing it this year  So there is no compromise before us in the first place   What s more  even that 2001 bill is now totally obsolete  A great deal has happened in the past four years that helps us understand the real issues in this bill    and shows that abuse of the system by consumers is not the real problem    We have now felt the full impact of the Bush economic decline that brought record levels of sustained unemployment    We have seen an explosion of medical costs  prescription drug costs  and health insurance costs    We have seen job after job eliminated or downgraded or outsourced    Half a million guardsmen and reservists have been called to active duty in Afghanistan or Iraq  leaving their families and their jobs and their small businesses behind to suffer the economic consequences    We have seen the enormous harm caused to employees and retirees by corporate mismanagement and fraud at major companies like Enron  Worldcom and Polaroid  which abused the bankruptcy laws to avoid their obligations to their own loyal workers    We have seen credit card rates go higher and higher  as high as 30  or more  plus fees and penalties and charges  raising credit card profits by another 10 billion dollars  even as general interest rates remain low     We have seen the credit companies use a self help remedy for the problems they create by their own indiscriminate and predatory marketing practices  they charge still higher risk based rates to the very same people who can t even afford the lower bait and switch rates  We now know a lot more about the abuse of bankruptcy problem this bill was supposedly designed to address  Four years ago we were told we were a nation of bankruptcy abusers  But now  thanks to the careful study of actual bankruptcy case files  we know the truth   We know that 50 percent of families who go bankrupt have suffered from serious medical problems and have exhausted their savings  Most of those families had paid for health insurance  but it left them with no financial protection from serious illness or accidents   Most of those families tried in every way possible to avoid bankruptcy for years  They gave up food and medicine and utilities and other necessities of life  and even transferred their elderly parents into less adequate nursing homes  But facts like that don t bother the sponsors of this bill    they just make it up as they go along  In the past week for example    Some of us offered amendments that would exempt people from the burdensome procedures in this bill if their finances were devastated by medical problems  or because they were called up for military duty  We were voted down  Instead  the bill s sponsors introduced  and then adopted  a devious amendment which they said would do what our amendments did  But of course it did nothing of the kind  It simply added some words about medical costs and military call ups in a way that did not change the real substance of the committee bill    The sponsors also said our amendments exempting those below median income from the means test process were unnecessary  because low income filers were already exempt  If they really mean what they say about no means testing for people below median income they should not be refusing to accept our amendment which makes that exemption absolutely clear     Another Democratic amendment would have placed a limit   a generous limit of 30     on the interest rates any credit card company can charge  It very carefully stated that it would not change the status quo in states which already had lower limits  That did not stop the bill s supporters from claming that the bill would be an intrusion on states  rights because it would lift the limit in states with a lower limit    And perhaps the most outrageous claim of all  one which I thought was dead and buried after it was dragged out in 2001  was dragged out again    big blue chart and all    and further inflated  in their debate  The sponsors repeated that old chestnut  that every American family is paying  400 a year in a hidden bankruptcy tax for abuses that this bill would stop  Only now they say this mysterious tax has risen to  550 per person per year   Here s how the original  400 number was calculated    The debts discharged from all consumer bankruptcies each year are about  40 billion  There are about 100 million families in the U S  Therefore  those consumer bankruptcies must be costing each family  400 per family    But this phony math assumes that every dollar discharged in bankruptcy    100     could have been collected in full  if not for massive abuse of the system by every consumer who goes bankrupt  It assumes that the credit card companies and payday lenders and other lenders who collect this debt under the bill would somehow distribute it to all 100 million American families  instead of keeping it for themselves  Obviously neither of these assumptions is true    Even the bill s supporters have long ago conceded that the maximum conceivable amount recoverable from consumer bankrupts is about 10  of the total  Other estimates conclude the real number is a small fraction of that   We don t have to guess what a responsible lender s loss from bankruptcy abuse might be  The lead off pro bill witness at our hearing on the bill was the head of a Wisconsin community credit union  testifying for the national Credit Union lobby  He told us that in the past 9 years  his Credit Union has had an average of 10 bankruptcies a year from his 11 300 members  He estimated that the 9 year loss from abusive cases was  15 000 75 000    with the higher figure based on an unlikely assumption of 15  abuse  His credit union s loss from possible abuse  spread across its entire membership  was 15 to 74 cents a year per member   not per every family in his county or state  but just his members  Yes  a real 15 cents instead of the mythical  400 dollars we ve heard about for years  and on the floor last week   Why is that lender s loss from abuse so low  Because that credit union cares about its members  who are also its owners  It gives them a credit level appropriate to their finances  and does not promote across the board increases in credit limits  It routinely monitors credit card debt for signs of trouble  When members hit hard times  the credit union does not pounce on them  It looks for ways to help them out  In short  it is a careful and responsible lender  not a predatory lender   Hello  Could this tell us something about the real problem here  Perhaps the credit card companies who are really pushing this bill should think again about having solicitation desks every fifty feet in the airport  offering gifts to anyone who signs up for a card  Perhaps they should think twice about offering multiple cards to young college students  Perhaps they should not encourage people to raise their card limits recklessly or send them pre printed checks against their accounts in junk mailings  Perhaps they should not send monthly statements urging their customers to pay only the monthly minimum and pile up their debt   This bill does nothing to prevent the enticements that the credit card companies use to run up their profits  It does nothing to prevent the real abuses of the system by those who use unlimited homestead exemptions or protective trusts to hide tens of millions of dollars from the bankruptcy process   We still have time for common sense amendments on all of these issues  but unless there is a change in direction  Republican party discipline will be invoked to defeat them   In fact  the present Bankruptcy system has an effective way of dealing with real abusers  Bankruptcy judges can and do deny the petitions of those who have defrauded or abused the bankruptcy process  The corporate sponsors of this bill know that  but their real motivation is only partly to squeeze millions more dollars from the people who do get into the bankruptcy system   The more insidious purpose of this bill is to frighten people away from the system altogether  by making it so burdensome and expensive  that they delay filing for bankruptcy or never file  That way  the predatory lenders can continue to collect excessive interest and fees and penalties month after month from people who cannot afford to pay them   What this bill does to catch the very small number of potential abusers    most of whom can be caught and screened out under the existing system    is to impose huge new paperwork and filing and counseling and other barriers on all those who seek to enter the system  whether they are above or below the median income level  and whether or not there is the slightest indication that they are trying to game the system   Why else would the bill place such strict and intolerable personal liability on the bankruptcy lawyer for mistakes made in the detailed information provided by the client  In Boston and throughout the country  pro bono lawyers from leading firms now lend a hand with bankruptcy filings to people down on their luck  The sponsors know that if this bill passes  those firms will not let their lawyers do that public interest work  because the risk will be too high   There is so much wrong with this bill that we must take the time to get it right  That is why we must have a serious discussion and negotiation and amendment process   That is why we must defeat tomorrow s cloture vote and continue to seek a bill that is not an embarrassment to the Senate and the fundamental principal of fairness and simple justice for all  It s wrong  deeply wrong  for the Senate to rubber stamp the greed of the credit card industry    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
