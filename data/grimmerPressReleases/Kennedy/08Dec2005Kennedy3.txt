         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today  Senator Kennedy announced his opposition to the Patriot Act Conference Report and signed on to a letter from Democratic Conferees proposing a three month extension for the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act to make this a better bill  Below is a statement from Senator Kennedy and a fact sheet on his objections to the conference report    The entire country    really  the entire world    has been watching to see whether we can achieve the right balance between national security and our Constitution  The 9 11 Commission Report Card says it all  We need to do better at protecting our citizens and monitoring the effectiveness of the tools used in the war on terror    Unfortunately  the House waited six months to appoint conferees so there is now a rush to meet the deadline for the expiring provisions  With so much at stake  there are too many remaining concerns to rush this bill    including the continued use of the most far reaching investigatory tools  particularly the lack of restrictions on the use of National Security Letters if there is no demonstrated link to terrorism  We should extend the deadline and work together so that we can get these critical issues right to best protect the American people and their constitutional rights    FACT SHEET ON THE PATRIOT ACT CONFERENCE REPORT Senator Kennedy opposes the conference report because there is more to be done to address concerns raised across the political spectrum  The House delayed appointment of conferees for six months    leaving us with less time to consider these issues carefully before the end of the year  Congress should take more time  and extend the deadline for these expiring provisions  in order to achieve a bipartisan compromise that reaches the right balance between national security and the protection of civil liberties  Below are his objections  as well as a list of some gains that he helped achieve     Core PATRIOT Act Provisions    The conference report fails to include a sunset on the use of National Security Letter NSL  authorities despite recent  troubling reports on the use of this tool  Senator Kennedy raised this as one of his key priorities during the first and only meeting of the conferees    Despite concerns raised repeatedly by Senator Kennedy  there was no change to the standard for issuing a NSL and no restrictions on use of NSLs to obtain information    even if there is no demonstrated link to terrorism    The judicial review procedure for challenging a NSL or Section 215 order are arguably worse than nothing  Indeed  it changes the procedure in a manner that will unduly favor the government  If a high level government official certifies that nondisclosure may endanger national security or interfere with diplomatic relations  the certification is conclusive unless made in bad faith    The conference report fails to address the concerns raised    across the political spectrum    about the burden on the government in order to begin an investigation  The federal government should have to demonstrate a connection between the records sought and a suspected terrorist  The conference report weakens the Senate provisions which required individualized suspicion for a search conducted under Section 215  With the Senate Democratic conferees  Senator Kennedy achieved some meaningful reforms in the report    Public reporting on aggregate numbers of Section 215 orders   Public reporting on aggregate numbers of National Security Letters  NSLs  issued to Americans   More detailed reporting to Congress on the number of Section 215 orders issued for certain sensitive records  library  bookstore  firearms  tax return  educational  medical    Inspector General audit on FBI s use  including any improper or illegal use  of section 215   Inspector General audits on FBI s use  including any improper or illegal use  of NSLs   Report on detaining activites by DOJ  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
