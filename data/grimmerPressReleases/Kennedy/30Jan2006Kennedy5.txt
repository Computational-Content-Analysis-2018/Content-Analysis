         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  KENNEDY  First of all  I thank my friend  Senator Kerry  for his strong commitment on this issue  and his eloquence  passion and support of this position  Mr  President  this is a time in the United States Senate and this is a battle that needs to be fought  This vote that we are casting with regard to Judge Alito is going to have echoes for years and years to come  It is going to be a defining vote about the Constitution of the United States  about our protections of our rights and our liberties    the Constitution of the United States  Now  people in my state at this particular time are concerned about the difficulties that they re having with prescription drugs  They re concerned about their problems they re having paying their oil bill  They re concerned about their problems paying for the education of their children  They re troubled by what they see with Katrina  They re bothered by what they know about the corruption here in Washington  and deeply troubled by what s happening in Iraq  They haven t really had the chance to focus about what is the meaning of this vote here in the United States Senate this afternoon KENNEDY  But all you have to do  Mr  President  is look back into the history  Look back into the history of the judiciary  Look back to the history of the 5th Circuit  that were making the decision in the 1950s  Look at the record of Judge Wisdom  Judge Tuttle  Judge Thompson of Alabama  the courage that they demonstrated that said at last we are going to break down the walls of discrimination in this country that have gripped this nation for 200 years  Our founding fathers failed the test when they wrote slavery into the Constitution  Abraham Lincoln pointed the way  and we passed the 13th  14th  15th Amendment and had a Civil War  but we didn t resolve this issue  It was only until we had the courage of those members of what branch of government  Not the United States Congress  not the United States Senate  not the executive  the judiciary  the 5th Circuit  We re talking now about the Supreme Court  But they are the ones that changed this country inevitably with what we call the march toward progress  The march toward knocking down the walls of discrimination that permitted us to pass a 1964 Civil Right Act and public accommodations so people whose skin was not white could go into restaurants and go into hotels  Public accommodation  The  65 act for voting rights   68 act for public accommodations  The 1973 act to say that women are going to be treated equally  The Americans with Disabilities Act that said the disabled are going to be a part of the American family  All of that is the march to progress     And my friends  the one organization  the one institution that protects it is the Supreme Court of the United States  Too much blood has been shed in those battles  Too much sweat  too many tears to put at risk that march for progress  And that is what we are doing with this nominee  Mr  President  He failed to demonstrate before the Judiciary Committee that he was committed to the continuing march of progress  He doesn t have to say how he s going to vote on a particular case  but he has to make it clear that he understands what this nation is all about  why we are the envy of the world  the progress we have made to knock down the walls of discrimination and prejudice and open up new opportunities for progress for our people  That s the definition of America  Why are we going to put that at risk in putting someone on the Supreme Court that is not committed to that progress  Not that they take a particular issue    a particular position on an issue  That is what is before us  We have a responsibility to try and present this to the American people  Our constituents that are working hard  taking care of their kids  trying to do a job across this country  they are just beginning to focus on it  It just came to the Senate floor just last Wednesday    today s Monday  What s the next business  What s the next measure on the calendar  Asbestos  Isn t that interesting  Anything more important than spending time and permitting the American people to understand this issue  I don t believe so  And that is what our vote at 4 30 is about  Finally  I d just say  Mr  President  if you are concerned and you want a justice that s going to stand for the working men and women in this country  it s not going to be Judge Alito  If you are concerned about women s privacy rights  about the opportunity for women to gain fair employment in America  it s not Judge Alito KENNEDY  If you care about the disabled  the Rehabilitation Act that we passed  the IDEA Act to include children in our schools that we passed    it s been on the books for 25 years    the Disability Act that we have passed to bring all of the disabled into our society  if you are looking for someone that is going to be a friend of the disabled  it s not going to be Judge Alito  And finally  if you are looking for someone that is going to be willing to stand up to the executive branch of government at a time that he is going to exceed his power and authority and the law of this country  it s not going to be Judge Alito  It s not going to be    he s not going to be like Sandra Day O Connor at the time of the Hamdi case that said  Oh no  no president  even in time of war  is above the law in this country  He s not going to be like Warren Burger who said no at the time of the Watergate    No  you have to surrender the papers at the time of the break ins that we saw under Watergate     No  Mr  President  This is the time  This is the issue     This happens to be the wrong judge at the wrong time for the wrong court  And I hope this body will give us the time to be able to explain this in greater detail to our fellow American citizens so a real vote can be taken  And when it is  I believe that this nominee will not be approved     I understand my time has expired
