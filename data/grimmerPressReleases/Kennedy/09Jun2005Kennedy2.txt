         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The contents of the Downing Street Minutes confirm that the Bush Administration was determined to go to war in Iraq  regardless of whether there was any credible justification for doing so  The Administration distorted and misrepresented the intelligence in its attempt to link Saddam Hussein with the terrorists of 9 11 and Osama bin Laden  and with weapons of mass destruction that Iraq did not have In addition  the Downing Street Minutes also confirm what has long been obvious    that the timing of the war was linked to the 2002 Congressional elections  and that the Administration s planning for post war Iraq was incompetent in all its aspects  The current continuing crisis is a direct result of that incompetence Many of you have worked hard for the American people  the media and those in government to speak out about the Downing Street Minutes and the Iraq war  You can join me in speaking out as well The policy of shoot first  ask questions later took us into an unjustified war  and without a clear concept of what winning the war actually means President Bush constantly talks about the progress that is being made in Iraq against the insurgency  but he s looking for good news with a microscope  All anyone can see is Mission Mis accomplished and the continuing losses of American lives  the deaths of thousands of innocent Iraqis  the torture scandal  and the ominous decline in our nation s moral authority in the world community We know the Administration had been planning to invade Iraq for many months before the invasion actually began  We know the Administration twisted the intelligence to make the facts fit their plan  We know that the Administration never really intended to give the U N  weapons inspectors a reasonable chance to succeed  The Downing Street Minutes demonstrate that the Administration knew their case for war was paper thin  and that in order to go into war with the support of our allies  we had to demonstrate some willingness to go along with the UN inspection process  But the Administration continued to misuse its intelligence  distort the facts and pay only lip service to the UN s role in disarming Iraq We never should have gone to war for ideological reasons driven by politics and based on manipulated intelligence  The Downing Street Minutes provide even more proof that this is exactly what happened on Iraq  The Administration s dishonesty  lack of candor  and lack of planning have brought us to where we are today  with American soldiers dying  Iraqi civilians living in constant fear  and with no clearer picture of our strategy for victory in Iraq than when we started    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
