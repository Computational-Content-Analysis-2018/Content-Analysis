         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Wednesday evening President Bush declared  through the Federal Emergency Management Agency  that Bristol County would be receiving federal assistance  covering a majority of municipal expenses  This declaration  however  falls short in two key ways  First  it covers municipal damages only in Bristol County and secondly  it does not make available resources to private citizens who have suffered damages    Senator Kennedy and his colleagues have asked President Bush to declare the entire Commonwealth a federal disaster area therefore opening the door for federal assistance for both public and private expenses  incurred in communities across the state     Senator Kennedy said  I m optimistic that the White House will approve this request and recognize the need of Massachusetts  residents in communities affected across the state  I learned so much touring Taunton on Wednesday and I was reminded of the strength and cohesiveness of these communities  We re all in this together    The text of the letter is below  PDF with signatures available upon request      30    Dear Mr  President    We re writing to express our appreciation for your decision to make federal public assistance available to Bristol County  and to urge you to expand the declaration to a major disaster that will make both public and individual assistance available for Bristol  Berkshire  Franklin  Hampshire  Hampden  Worcester  Essex  Middlesex  Norfolk  Suffolk  and Plymouth counties in our state  The recent flooding has created havoc in the lives of thousands of our citizens  and they deserve an immediate  clear and generous response by the Administration to reassure them that federal assistance will be available     You have the authority to make federal disaster assistance available before preliminary disaster assessments are complete  We urge you to exercise that authority in light of the obvious extent of this disaster  Across the Commonwealth  families are being sheltered in schools or with relatives  sewage is backing up into their basements  and power outages are common  Now is the time to use the full scope of your authority to provide relief and security to the flood victims of Massachusetts    Some families have now been out of their homes in Western Massachusetts for nearly two weeks  The flooding began before Columbus Day  and the damage has now expanded across the state  so that families are being dislocated from their homes  their jobs and their communities     Our regional FEMA office is over extended  Today  there are only six FEMA assessment members in the Commonwealth  when twice that number is needed to make damage assessments  Already  over 2000 properties have been identified with some level of damage  including 69 destroyed homes  Thousands of households have been evacuated because of the flood  The Whittenton Pond Dam in Taunton remains in critical condition and could create a huge demand for individual assistance very quickly     For these reasons  we urge you to act immediately to declare a major disaster for these flood affected areas  Please do not make our constituents wait any longer     Respectfully   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
