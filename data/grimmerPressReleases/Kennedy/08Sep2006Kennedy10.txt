         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the Senate Intelligence Committees report on pre Iraq war intelligence   The report leaves no doubt that the Bush Administration was willing to retrofit the facts to manufacture a phony case for war with Iraq that America never should have fought  Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with Al Qaeda  Imagine how much safer we would be today if President Bush had stayed the course in fighting the real war on terror against Al Qaeda  This report shows not only that we need a new policy in Iraq  but we also need a change in Congress to hold the Administration accountable for our national security      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
