         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Last night the House passed the Employment Non Discrimination Act with a strong bipartisan vote  The House bill prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on the job because of their sexual orientation  It protects Americans from being fired  denied a job or promotion  or otherwise intentionally discriminated against because of their sexual orientation  Although the bill is narrower than many of us had hoped  the House action is still a main step in the long journey toward full civil rights for every American        In the Senate  I will work to move the Employment Non Discrimination Act this Congress  The bill that the House passed is being held at the desk and Im working with leadership to move this bill forward as quickly as possible     This nation was founded on the principle of equal justice for all  That noble goal represents the best in America  that everyone should be treated fairly and should have the chance to benefit from the many opportunities of this country  The House action brings us closer to that goal      Forty three years ago  President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964  At that time  some in our country were violently opposed to outlawing racial discrimination  and it was very difficult for Congress to reach a consensus  But the best in America  and the best in the Senate  prevailed  My first major speech in this body as a freshman Senator was on the Civil Rights Act  I said then that I firmly believe a sense of fairness and goodwill also exists in the minds and hearts of Americans  and that laws creating the conditions for equality will help that spirit of fairness win out over prejudice  I still believe that today       Since the 1964 Act was passed  weve seen enormous progress in this beloved nation of ours  Civil rights laws giving national protection against discrimination based on race  national origin  gender  age  and disability have made our country a stronger  a better  a fairer land  African Americans  Latinos  Native Americans  and Asians have made extraordinary advances in the workplace  People with disabilities have new opportunities to fully participate in our society  The workplace is far more open to women in ways that were barely imagined four decades ago  In countless businesses  large and small   glass ceilings are being shattered  Women and girls have far greater opportunities in the classroom and in the boardroom     But that progress has left some Americans out  Civil rights is still the nations unfinished business  Today  its perfectly legal in most states to fire an employee because of sexual orientation or gender identity  Many hard working Americans live every day with the knowledge that  no matter what their talents and abilities  they can be denied a job simply because of who they are  Many young students grow up knowing that no matter how hard they study  the doors of opportunity will be locked by prejudice and bigotry when they enter the workplace      Although some states have outlawed job discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity  in most of the country  workers have no recourse at all if they fired because simply because of who they are  Thats unacceptable  and we have a duty to fix it  and to do so on our watch      In the past 40 years  our country has made great progress in guaranteeing fairness and opportunity       When we passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and then the Fair Housing Act of 1960  we took courageous steps  and we were proud that the Senate did the right thing each time  We must also do the right thing    the courageous thing    today  In the 1960s  these laws were controversial  But today  none of us  Democrat  Republican  or Independent  would question that they were the right steps to take  and we must take the right steps today       Over the years  the Senate has recognized time and again the importance of our goal of equal employment opportunity  Even if we have sometimes disagreed over the years about its proper interpretation  there is no division among us that the principle of equal employment opportunity is a core American value      That is what the Employment Non Discrimination Act is all about    equal job opportunities for all Americans  By extending the protection of Title VII to those who are victimized because of their sexual orientation  we are moving closer to that fundamental goal  No one should be denied a job simply because of who they are      That ideal is at the heart of the Employment Non Discrimination Act     In 1996  we fell one vote short of passing the bill in the Senate  In the decade since  public support for outlawing such discrimination has only grown stronger  Now that the House has acted  I hope that we will be able to finally succeed in the Senate in passing the Employment Non Discrimination Act this Congress  and I look forward to the coming debate      America stands for justice for all  Congress must make clear that when we say all we mean all  America will never be America until we do             Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
