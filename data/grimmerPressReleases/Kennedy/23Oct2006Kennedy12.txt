         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washington  DC  Today Senator Edward Kennedy and former Senator John Edwards joined the organizers from five of the six states that have minimum wage initiatives on the ballot this year on a conference call   Arizona  Colorado  Missouri  Nevada and Ohio   The minimum wage measures are expected to pass in all of the states and extensive get out the vote efforts are underway   Senators Kennedy and Edwards discussed how the state efforts demonstrate the need for prompt federal action to raise the minimum wage   Senator Kennedy  a lifelong champion of raising the minimum wage  has been fighting to pass his bill that would raise the minimum wage from  5 15 to  7 25 over 2 years   While his plan has bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate  Republican leadership has repeatedly blocked the bill from passage   Senator Edwards has been traveling around the country to build grassroots support for state ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage   He has been working closely with minimum wage coalitions in Arizona  Colorado  Montana  Missouri  Nevada and Ohio to support their efforts to raise the minimum wage  Its shameful for the Republican leadership to play political games with the lives of working families  But luckily  the American people understand what the Republican Congress does not  that no one who works hard for a living should have to live in poverty   Thats why weve seen a national movement for a fair minimum wage  Its been spreading like wildfire across this great nation  Senator Kennedy said  I promise that if Democrats regain control of Congress the first thing well do is pass a minimum wage increase for all hardworking Americans    Raising the minimum wage is one of the most important steps we can take to lift more working families out of poverty and into the middle class  said Senator Edwards   The federal minimum wage is a national disgrace and since Republicans in Congress continue to block efforts to raise the minimum wage  I am proud to join the state minimum wage coalitions in their efforts to raise the minimum wage this November  The state organizers on the call were  Steve Adams  Chair  Coloradans For A Fair Minimum Wage   Daniel Thompson  Chair  Give Nevada a Raise  Michael McGrath  Chair  Arizona Minimum Wage Coalition  Lenny Jones  Campaign Director  Give Missourians a Raise  Doug Mitchell  Campaign Manager  Raise Montana  Tim Burga  Co Chair Ohioans for a Fair Minimum Wage  Katie Gall  Co Chair Ohioans for a Fair Minimum Wage  C J  Prentiss  Minority Leader  Ohio State Senate  Co Chair Ohioans for a Fair Minimum Wage   Below are facts about the minimum wage  and Senator Kennedys plan   Also included are the statistics raised on the conference call regarding the impact of minimum wage increases on employment growth    RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS Senator Kennedys Fair Minimum Wage Act would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps                 5 85 60 days after enactment                6 55 one year later                7 25 one year after that The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office   37 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children    Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s     An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem   Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year earn  10 700 per year  almost  6 000 below the federal poverty guidelines of  16 600 for a family of three   Since then the minimum wage was last raised in 1997  its real value has eroded by 21 3 percent    Every day the minimum wage is not increased  it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind  Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase   Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  4 00 below what it was in 1968   To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  9 37 an hour today  not  5 15    Nearly fifteen million Americans will benefit from a minimum wage increase to  7 25 an hour  6 6 million directly  and another 8 3 million indirectly   Fifty nine percent of these workers are women  and forty percent are people of color   Eighty percent of those who would benefit are adult workers  not teenagers seeking pocket change   Fifty four percent of workers who will benefit are full time employees  and more than a third of these adults are sole breadwinners for their families    Increasing the minimum wage will help more than 7 3 million children whose parents would receive a raise     Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 400 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families   It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy                 15 months of groceries              19 months of utilities              8 months of rent              Over two years of health care              20 months of child care              30 months of college tuition at a public  2 year college  This year  the Senate raised its pay by  3 100 and is set to receive an additional  3 300 raise in 2007   It is shameful that Members of Congress received our eighth pay increase in nine years  yet we have not provided a single pay increase to the lowest paid workers    The salaries of lawmakers have gone up by  31 600 since 1997  while minimum wage workers continue to earn just  10 700 a year    History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation   In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades   Nearly 12 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 248 000 per month     In contrast  in the last four years  the minimum wage has held steady  but only 4 9 million jobs have been created   States across this country have raised their own minimum wages without adverse economic consequences   Study after study has shown that raising the minimum wage has not cost jobs in the states   An Economic Policy Institute study of Washington  Oregon  and Alaska showed that increases in the state minimum wage had no impact on the state unemployment rate   Similarly  the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center has found that after the last two minimum wage increases in Massachusetts in 2000 and 2001  employment grew more quickly in sectors with the most minimum wage workers  including leisure  hospitality  and the service sector   A recent Gallup poll found that 86  of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business  and three out of four small businesses said that a 10  increase in the minimum wage would have no effect on their company  Additionally  nearly half of small business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased  and only 16  of owners think the minimum wage should be reduced or eliminated entirely   Britain has the second largest economy in Europe  after Germany    They implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty   They raised their minimum wage to about  9 51 per hour last year  and they are planning to raise this rate to about  9 89 in October of this year   Ireland has an extremely robust economy  with impressive growth over the last decade  and the fourth largest GDP per capita in the world   The minimum wage rate in Ireland is 7 65  hour  about  9 65  and yet their unemployment rate is lower than the U S    Laura Capps Melissa
