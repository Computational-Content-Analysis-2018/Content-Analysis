         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FACT SHEET INCLUDED  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement  also included is a fact sheet on the Presidents health care proposal I welcome the President s call to make health care a priority for Congress  But to solve the health care crisis  we need not just action   but the right action  The President s proposals are an opportunity missed  They will not improve access to good coverage  and won t help working families afford the spiraling cost of health care  They will do little to improve the quality of health care  Republicans and Democrats alike should come together to build on the lessons from the states to see that all Americans have quality  affordable health care  The Health Care CrisisHealth care in America is in crisis  Over the last six years  the cost of health insurance premiums has soared 87 percent  while wages have grown only 20 percent  Over the same period  the number of Americans without health insurance has increased by over 6 million  and millions more worry that their existing coverage is inadequate to meet their medical needs Bold action is needed to address the crisis  and states have begun to answer that call  Massachusetts  California  Pennsylvania  and other states have all proposed major health reforms designed to make coverage more affordable and more accessible  Serious reform is needed at the national level to see that every American has quality  affordable health care  just as the President and members of Congress receive now  Presidential leadership is important  but we must make sure that the reforms we undertake are the right course The Presidents ProposalHealth benefits are not currently taxed  President Bushs proposal would tax health benefits for the very first time  At the same time  the President proposes creating a new tax deduction for health benefits  This would be set at  15 000 a year for a family policy  and  7 500 for an individual  This policy would immediately impose a new tax on nearly 7 5 million Americans who now have good employer sponsored coverage  It penalizes workers with good health care  many of whom are middle or lower income    and creates a disincentive for employers to provide comprehensive coverage  particularly those whose employees are older or sicker  The tax deduction that the President has proposed would disproportionally benefit upper income Americans  since its value increases for those in higher tax brackets  It taxes middle class Americans to benefit the wealthiest The Presidents proposal also does nothing to improve access to health coverage for those who cannot obtain it now  either because their employer does not offer it or because they cannot obtain policies on the individual market due to a history of illness  Placing the entire burden of health care on individuals and working families is no solution to the crisis  Real reform involves a shared responsibility among individuals  government and business The Bottom Line  Presidential leadership on health care is crucial to addressing the major problems the American people face in affording quality health care  While the Administrations current proposal is deeply flawed  the attention that the President is devoting to the issue could signal real progress in addressing the health care crisis    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
