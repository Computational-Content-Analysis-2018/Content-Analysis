         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  MASSACHUSETTS DELEGATION URGES FEMA TO RECONSIDER DISASTER ASSISTANCEWashington  D C  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  joined by his colleagues in the House and Senate  sent the following letter to the Federal Emergency Management Agency  strongly urging them to reconsider their decision not to declare red tide affected communities a disaster site Kennedy said  There is a strong precedence for FEMA to declare a fishing disaster and I urge them to reconsider their decision  Our shellfishermen and our local economies have experienced severe economic hardship throughout the red tide disaster and are in dire need of assistance Our shellfishermen and their families are living and breathing testimony to why the administration needs to reverse course and provide badly needed assistance right away  Over the years we ve issued disaster declarations for similar devastation  and the government needs to provide that same relief in our state  said Senator John F  Kerry Congressman Delahunt said  If there were ever a natural disaster that cried out for FEMA aid  we re facing it now  Even with Red Tide  our shell fishermen need to make mortgage payments and put food on the table  and that s precisely what these emergency programs are supposed to help do I am disappointed that FEMA has chosen not to provide this valuable assistance to our region  especially given the fact that the Agency has declared disasters in similar situations in the past  I will continue working with my colleagues to seek additional federal help for those who are being hurt economically because of the red tide  said Congressman Frank Congressman Stephen F  Lynch said  The Commerce Department and the Small Business Administration have already recognized the severity of the situation faced by Massachusetts shellfishermen and their families  I am disappointed in FEMA s refusal to join those agencies and step in and help these communities to weather this natural disaster  We are urging President Bush to overturn FEMA s ruling  and deliver the relief that these families need and deserve FEMA s decision is a disappointing one  Rep  McGovern said  The red tide is creating enormous difficulty for families in Massachusetts and the state s economy  I hope the White House recognizes the seriousness of the problem and takes appropriate action Congressman Markey said  FEMA s refusal to declare the red tide outbreak as a major disaster area in Barnstable  Bristol  Dukes  Essex  Nantucket  Norfolk  Plymouth  and Suffolk is disappointing and short sighted  For the families and businesses across Massachusetts that have been devastated by this outbreak  I hope FEMA will reconsider this decision and give these families the relief that they need We are extremely disappointed with this decision and urge that it be reversed as soon as possible so that those impacted by this severe outbreak of red tide will have access to economic assistance  Some scientists believe this outbreak will last through the summer  creating significant financial hardship for those in the industry  stated Congressman Capuano Congressman Tierney said  Precedent indicates that it is appropriate to issue a Disaster Declaration in the event of severe toxic algae damage  The Bush Administration should immediately reconsider its denial of emergency relief from FEMA and act now to help the devastated Massachusetts families in need of relief    June 24  2005Michael D  Brown Under Secretary of Homeland Security For Emergency Preparedness and Response 500 C St  S W  Washington  D C  20472Dear Secretary Brown We are writing to express our extreme disappointment and frustration in your refusal to declare a major disaster for the counties of Barnstable  Bristol  Dukes  Essex  Nantucket  Norfolk  Plymouth  and Suffolk as a result of the current massive outbreak of red tide  We urge you to reconsider that decision  The shellfisheries of these coastal areas have already been shut down for weeks  and the effects upon the industry and the local economies have been severe  Over 1 700 commercial shellfishermen have lost their means to earn a living to support their families as a result of the disaster  Experts estimate that  3 million a week is being lost in wages in that industry and related industries  The red tide continues to spread and shows few signs of dissipating  Earlier this week  the Secretary of Commerce declared the Maine coastal areas a disaster and the red tide is threatening to enter Rhode Island In your letter to Governor Romney explaining your decision  you state that the impact of this event is not of the severity and magnitude that warrants a major disaster declaration  We believe it does and we invite you to visit the affected areas to see for yourself the massive economic hardship the red tide has had upon these important parts of the economy of our state There is a precedent of FEMA issuing a Disaster Declaration because of the red tide  In September 1972  FEMA issued Disaster Declaration Numbers 356 and 357 as a result of toxic algae in the waters of Massachusetts and Maine  In August and September 1994  FEMA issued Disaster Declaration Numbers 36  37  and 38 for the states of Washington  Oregon  and California because of the effects on the salmon habitat after El Nino devastated the fishing industry there  FEMA granted the three states over  10 million  including funds for mitigation expenses We believe these examples of FEMA action in previous fishing or shellfish disasters  combined with the destructive economic impacts of the current red tide disaster merits a Disaster Declaration  and we urge you to issue the Declaration as soon as possible to provide the relief these counties and these devastated families so urgently need and deserve With respect and appreciation Sincerely    Kennedy  Melissa Wagoner 202 224 2633
