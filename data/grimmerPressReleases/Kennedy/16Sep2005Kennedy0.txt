Americans receive the attention they deserve  Before he left  Kennedy introduced a bipartisan Katrina Recovery bill to bring much support and relief to students  educators  and schools affected by the disaster  Our government must respond in ways that are as good and compassionate as the American people  We can t just fix the hole in the roof  We need to rebuild the whole foundation  said Senator

and the floods  we must rebuild it for everyone to be a more just and fair land    Senator Kennedy has proposed the Gulf Coast Regional Redevelopment Authority  modeled after the Tennessee Valley Authority  to focus full energies on the challenge of rebuilding the Gulf and ensuring new and continued economic prosperity for its residents  It would allow governors and mayors and citizens and communities to work together to plan  help fund  and coordinate for the reconstruction of that damaged region and be led by an eminent American with cabinet rank  Last week Kennedy met with NAACP President Bruce Gordon and other African American Leaders in the United States Capitol to understand the real consequences of government policies that don t unite America  and to discuss an agenda that unites all Americans and provide opportunities to achieve the American dream    Kennedy and Enzi introduced the first part of legislative relief effort on education last night and plan to offer the health and labor components next week  Last week he and Senator Enzi convened two meetings with recovery experts and officials from the area to determine the best course of action to help  They learned that 700 schools and 30 colleges and universities have been damaged and destroyed and an estimated 473 000 students have been affected by the disaster  most of whom have been displaced  Kennedy s bill begins the process by strengthening support for educational institutions and addresses the needs of early education  elementary and secondary education  higher education  and students with disabilities  The provisions of the bill are outlined below     About his bill  Senator Kennedy said  This disaster reminds us that we are all part of the American family   and we have a responsibility to help members of that family when they are in need  Children can t lose a year of school  college students should continue pursuing their degrees  parents need extra help to pay to keep their kids in college and everyone deserves the support needed to cope with and overcome this tragedy  In the weeks and months ahead  we must also focus on rebuilding and reconstructing the schools devastated by the tragedy so that  as soon as possible  children can return to schools fully stocked with the resources they need     SUMMARY OF HELP COMMITTEE KATRINA EDUCATION BILL   Early
