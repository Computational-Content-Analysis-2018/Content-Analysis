         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  GIBSON  For some Democratic thoughts about the speech we turn to Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy  who is joining us live from Capitol Hill this morning     Senator  good to have you with us  And I apologize for my voice KENNEDY     It s good to be here GIBSON  But  in your mind  the most important subject the president can address tonight and the most important thing you think he ll say KENNEDY  Well  first of all  all our hearts and prayers are for Bob and Doug in Iraq  We ve all been touched by that tragedy  And we reach out to their families  I think one of the important areas that the president will consider is health and health policy  This will be the first time in five years that the president has given any kind of focus and attention to the great challenges that we re facing on rising costs and increasing uninsured people in the country today  More than 2 000 people every single day are uninsured  And  if the president is going to follow the  sort of  fiasco that we had on private    on Social Security  we ll hear more gimmicks than real substance and real change  I think there s a way of making sure that all Americans are covered with health care and that is to take the tried and true program of Medicare  which is trusted by the American people  has been a great success  and gradually expand it to include all Americans     That would be a substantive program  I think  which would have broad  bipartisan support     Americans want something that s real  They don t want another gimmick  And they don t want another cliche GIBSON  Senator  it was interesting listening to Dan Bartlett a moment ago  when I talked to him earlier  saying that  We re going to try to set aside politics as normal and elevate the level of debate  You might read that as saying  We know our poll numbers are low and therefore we re going to have to reach out to the other party     Do you get a sense that this White House is truly willing to compromise on anything KENNEDY  Well  we have seen  at times    when the president first became president  we worked closely with him on an education bill which was extremely important  But we found out that the education bill was reform and resources  And we tried to reform the system but the administration was lagging in the resources     But I think the American people are going to want really substantive answers to the challenges that they re facing  I mean  most families are working hard  they want a healthy family and they want opportunities for their children  And what they are seeing today is their home heating bills are going up through the roof  They re seeing that the Medicare prescription drug program of this administration is an absolute disaster  45 different programs in my own state of Massachusetts  People can t figure out how in the world to deal with it  And they re also finding the education costs are out of sight  So they really want some practical answers to the kind of things that most families are concerned about and dealing with every single day GIBSON  Let me just get to this issue  You mentioned health care  On that particular point  let me get to this question of whether Democrats and Republicans really do have room to work together  The president  it is widely believed tonight  will talk about Health Savings Accounts  sort of 401 k  plans for health  And yet you ve said that doesn t help the average worker  it just helps the rich who have some money to set aside for such programs KENNEDY     That s true GIBSON     So do you think  really  you re going to get something that the two of you can work together in that area KENNEDY  Well  I think  if we re talking about just health savings accounts  higher deductibility    look  you need a very generous income to be able to take advantage of increasing deductibility and offsetting expenses  And the association health plans may work for a few very young people that are very  very healthy  But what we re talking about are families in this country and we re talking about how are we going to really deal with their challenge  We re finding out every single day more and more families are losing their health care  more and more families are paying higher and higher premiums  And the prescription drug program is a disaster  If the president came tonight and said  Look  let s start off with the prescription drug program  It didn t work  Our program didn t work for the American people  Medicare works for hospitalization and doctor care  Let s  Democrats and Republicans  work together to let the prescription drug program put in place be a good one  that would be an excellent start  There would be hallelujahs in the Democratic Party and Republican and we d get something done and then we d go ahead and build GIBSON     All right  Senator  I appreciate you being with us KENNEDY     Thank very much GIBSON     Thank you
