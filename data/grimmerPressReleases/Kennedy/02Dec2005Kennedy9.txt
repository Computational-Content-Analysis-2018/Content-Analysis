         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy has sent the following letter to Department of Defense Inspector General Thomas Gimble calling for an investigation into U S  dealings with the Lincoln Group in placing U S  authored stories in Iraqi press publications    Senator Kennedy said  The Pentagon s devious scheme to place favorable propaganda in Iraqi newspapers speaks volumes about the President s credibility gap  If Americans were truly welcomed in Iraq as liberators  we wouldn t have to doctor the news for the Iraqi people  They want security  jobs  and basic services  No amount of Bush Administration propaganda can hide the fact that two and a half years after the fall of Baghdad  these basic needs still aren t being met      30    December 2  2005   Thomas F  Gimble Inspector General Department of Defense 400 Army Navy Drive Arlington  VA  22202   Dear Mr  Gimble     Recently  the Los Angeles Times and New York Times reported that the Department of Defense contracted with the Lincoln Group to attempt to influence Iraqi public opinion about US military activities  These reports stated that the Department of Defense paid the Lincoln Group to pose as freelance journalists and place articles favorable to the US with Iraqi press  but with the apparent intention that the role of US government would not be apparent or acknowledged publicly  In addition  the reports suggested that the government paid Iraqi journalists to write favorable stories    As a matter of policy  the reports  if true  are contrary to our efforts to encourage the Iraqis to develop a free and independent press  Any attempts to control the media would contradict this basic principle of democracy    Further  as a matter of law  these reports raise serious questions about whether the Department of Defense engaged in covert activity by concealing the role of the government  This perception is reinforced by suggestions that there are classified aspects to this activity    Since 1991  Section 503 of the National Security Act has restricted covert activity by requiring a written Presidential finding that the activity is necessary to support identifiable foreign policy objectives of the United States  and also requiring the activity to be reported to the Congressional Intelligence Committees    I request you to investigate this program  determine under what authority the program was conducted  whether it conformed with statutory requirements applicable to covert activity  and whether the contract with the Lincoln Group was proper     With respect and appreciation    Sincerely    Edward M  Kennedy  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
