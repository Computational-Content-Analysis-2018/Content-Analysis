         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Once again  this Administration and its Republican allies in Congress have looked at what needs to be done to deal with a major health threat    and decided to do the opposite  It s unbelievable that with the threat of a life threatening flu epidemic looming over America  the Republican Congress is denying the resources we need to keep our families safe and healthy  The nation waited five long years for the Administration to release a plan for pandemic flu  We can t afford to wait yet again for the funding to put plans into action   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
