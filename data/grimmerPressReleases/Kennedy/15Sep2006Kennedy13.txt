         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  DC  As Congress continues to negotiate the Department of Defense funding bill  Senator Kennedy is fighting to retain a provision that would make it easier for soldiers to arrange for care for their families  The measure would also allow the Secretary of Labor to encourage private employers to provide similar flexibility for workers  The language may be stripped from the bill  despite its support from family and armed services groups including the National Guard Association of the United States  the National Military Family Association  the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States  and the Military Officers Association of America    We know how challenging deployment is on families  Senator Kennedy said  This program is essentially a cost free way to make their lives a little easier   Specifically  the provision allows federal employees to be designated caregivers and to use sick and other forms of existing leave to care for family members of active duty military  It also gives the Department of Labor the authority to create a pilot program to encourage private employers to set up similar programs        Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
