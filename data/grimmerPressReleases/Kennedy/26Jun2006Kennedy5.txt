         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on General Caseys plan to draw down troops   It s obvious that the only timetable the Administration cares about on Iraq is the November election  Last week  Senate Republicans marched lockstep in defeating our Democratic proposal calling for our troops to begin to come home this year  Yet now we learn that our military leaders agree with our proposal  And still  Karl Rove and some Republicans continue to engage in the scurrilous tactic of questioning the patriotism of Democrats who seeks to bring our troops home    This debate is about real men and women in our armed forces who are bravely putting themselves on the line every day in Iraq  It s wrong to play election politics with their lives          Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
