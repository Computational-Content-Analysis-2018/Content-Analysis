         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  this so called compromise doesnt do nearly enough to end the war  and I intend to vote against it I support our troops  Theyve fought bravely and with great courage under extraordinarily difficult circumstances  But it was wrong for the President to send our troops to war without a plan to win the peace  and its wrong for Congress to keep them in harms way on the current failed course The best way to protect our troops is to bring this war to an end    not to pour more American lives into the endless black hole our Iraq policy has become  Its wrong for Congress to continue to defer to a presidential decision that we know is fatally flawed The American people know this war is wrong  Its wrong to abdicate our responsibility by allowing this war to drag on and on while our casualties mount higher and higher The President was wrong to get us into this war  wrong to conduct it so poorly  wrong to ignore the views of the American people  and wrong to stubbornly refuse to sign legislation requiring a timetable for the orderly and responsible withdrawal of our combat troops from Iraq It is time to end the continuing tragic loss of American lives and begin to bring our soldiers home  For the sake of our troops  we cannot repeat the mistakes of Vietnam and allow this war to drag on long after the American people know its a profound mistake      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
