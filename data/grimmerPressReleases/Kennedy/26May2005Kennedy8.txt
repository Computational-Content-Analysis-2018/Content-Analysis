         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I oppose John Bolton to be our Ambassador to the United Nations    It s premature for this nomination even to be brought before the Senate  until we have the opportunity to see all the obviously relevant information on Mr  Bolton s record     The obvious conclusion from the Administration s stonewalling is that the documents being withheld from the Senate contain nothing to support the nomination and will only make it even clearer that Mr  Bolton is the wrong choice for this extremely important position     The United Nations is the world s preeminent diplomatic body  We need a representative there who is a strong and effective leader  who believes in diplomacy  and who has a proven record of using diplomacy to advance America s foreign policy and national security objectives     Now  more than ever American needs to put our best face forward to the international community  We can    and should    do far better than John Bolton     Jeane Kirkpatrick  who served as the United States  Ambassador to the United Nations under President Reagan  has spoken of the need to approach the job of U N  Ambassador in a low key  quiet  persuasive and consensus building way  As she says  John Bolton may do diplomatic jobs for the U S  government  but John is not a diplomat    In fact  John Bolton is more a bully than a diplomat  His confirmation hearings suggest that on many occasions he twisted the intelligence to fit his views  and wrongly pressured analysts to produce intelligence conclusions at odds with the facts    He continually sought to exaggerate the intelligence about Cuba s possible biological weapons activities and support for terrorism    He continually sought to exaggerate Syria s nuclear activities beyond what the intelligence analysts regarded as accurate       In discussing Mr  Bolton s proposed testimony on Syria  Robert L  Hutchings  former Chairman of the National intelligence Council  said  He took isolated facts and made much more of them to build a case than I thought the intelligence warranted  It was a sort of cherry picking of little factoids and little isolated bits that were drawn out to present the starkest possible case     Rather than accept the analysis produced by the intelligence community  Mr  Bolton insisted on advancing his own views and retaliated against those who disagreed with him  He should be held accountable for this behavior   not rewarded and promoted     The lessons of the Iraq war are abundantly clear  We need to make decisions based on facts and sound analysis of intelligence  We need to encourage intelligence analysts to speak truth to power when intelligence is in danger of being distorted  manipulated  or misrepresented  We can t demand the results we want and try to fire people who refuse to go along  But that s precisely what Mr  Bolton repeatedly tried to do     He tried to fire Christian Westermann  a State Department intelligence analyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research  who disputed the misleading language that Bolton tried to use about Cuba and biological weapons     John Bolton summoned Mr  Westermann to his office to intimidate and bully him         According to one of Mr  Westermann s supervisors at the State Department  Thomas Fingar  Bolton complained to him that he  Bolton  was the President s appointee  that he had every right to say what he believed  that he wasn t going to be told what he could say by a mid level INR munchkin analyst     Mr  Bolton even raised it with Assistant Secretary of State  Carl Ford  As Ford said  I remember going back to my office with the impression that I had been asked to fire the analyst I came away with the impression that I had just been asked to fire somebody in the intelligence community for doing  what I consider  their job    Mr  Ford described Mr  Bolton as a quintessential kiss up  kick down sort of guy   I don t have a second a third or fourth  in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people  He described his behavior in reaching five or six levels down in the bureaucracy to excoriate an analyst as professionally unacceptable    In another incident  the National Intelligence Officer for Latin America had said that a speech by Mr  Bolton on Cuba did not accurately reflect the assessment of the intelligence community  So what did John Bolton do  He personally went to the CIA to try to have him fired    Mr  Bolton s contempt for anyone with opposing views was not limited to intelligence officers who disagreed with him     When two State Department officers in the nonproliferation Bureau disagreed over policy  he sought their removal     He accused Rexon Ryu  a career civil servant  of intentionally withholding a cable on the UN inspection process in Iraq from his office  In fact  the cable had been provided to at least two bureaus under Mr  Bolton    the Bureau of Arms Control and the Bureau of Verification and Compliance  At worst  it was an inadvertent error  Yet  nine months later  John Bolton denied Mr  Ryu a significant new assignment as the point person for the Nonproliferation Bureau for the upcoming G 8 summit     In the case of a State Department lawyer  Mr  Bolton tried to remove him from a legal case on China sanctions  based on a misunderstanding of a position the lawyer had taken     John S  Wolf  who served under Mr  Bolton as Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation  put it plainly  I believe that it would be fair to say that some of the officers within my bureau complained that they felt undue pressure to conform to the views of the under secretary  versus the views that they could support    These are not isolated incidents of disgruntled employees  They represent a clear and troubling pattern of a bully who repeatedly tried to silence opposition by attempting to intimidate analysts and subordinates into conforming to his views    Sadly  his view is not one that envisions a great and important role for the United Nations  On the contrary  Mr  Bolton has shown nothing but disdain for the United Nations  He has continued to articulate a vision of a go it alone foreign policy     Speaking to the World Federalist Association in In February 2004  he said  There is no such thing as the United NationsThere is an international community  that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and that is the United States  when it suits our interest and when we can get others to go along    He said  The Secretariat building in New York has 38 stories  If you lost 10 stories today  it wouldn t make a bit of difference    His disdain for other nations was on full display in 2000  when he said in an interview  If I were redoing the Security Council today  I d have one permanent member because that s the real reflection of the distribution of power in the worldthe United States    These are not the views of a person who is supposed to represent America s diplomatic interests in the international community  These are not the views of an individual who  as the Administration argues  is well suited to reform the United Nations     These views are likely to make Mr  Bolton less effective  not more effective  pursuing our interests at the United Nations  We can t expect the support of other nations on issues that matter to the United States  if we show nothing but contempt for other nations     In fact  on one highly important issue where diplomacy is desperately needed    North Korea    Mr  Bolton has been consistently wrong     North Korea is an enormous challenge for our foreign policy  The Administration has been extraordinarily inept in handling it and time is not on our side    The nuclear threat from North Korea continues to grow  North Korea is already the greatest proliferator of ballistic missiles  Desperate  and strapped for cash  the threat is very real that North Korea could be a source of nuclear material for Al Qaeda terrorists     We agreed to the Six Party Talks  but have not effectively engaged the North Koreans  At Mr  Bolton s urging  our policy s been AWOL so far     The results may be deadly  When President Bush came to office  North Korea s plutonium program was inactive  Its nuclear rods were under seal     Then the President called North Korea part of his Axis of Evil  As we prepared for war with Iraq over nuclear weapons that did not exist  we learned that North Korea had begun a secret uranium enrichment program  When we confronted North Korea  but then refused to negotiate with it  North Korea expelled the international inspectors and began producing plutonium for nuclear weapons  On the eve of war with Iraq  North Korea pulled out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty     At the beginning of the Bush Administration  North Korea was already thought to have two nuclear weapons  They are now believed to have up to eight such weapons    and possible more    and they may well be preparing for a nuclear test    One of our worst national nightmares is nuclear material or even nuclear weapons in the hands of al Qaeda  with North Korea as their supplier     The person guiding President Bush s policy on North Korea was John Bolton  His policy s been a failure  yet the Administration now wants to promote him to be our Ambassador to the U N    Mr  Bolton was not able to advance effective diplomacy as Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Affairs  and there is no reason to believe he can advance America s interests at the U N    Elizabeth Jones  the former Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia who served with Mr  Bolton at the State Department  has said that if John Bolton becomes U N  Ambassador  the fundamental problem would be a reluctance on his part to make the kinds of minor  symbolic concessions necessary to build consensus among other governments and maintain the American position    The challenges facing America are serious    terrorism  war  ethnic conflict  ancient and modern rivalries  disease and poverty  human rights   all these are still the pressing daily realities for peoples throughout the world     The need for a strong United Nations as an effective international organization and a strong U S  Ambassador to advance our interests is clear and compelling     As Franklin Roosevelt said about America in 1945  We have learned that we cannot live alone  at peace  that our own well being is dependent on the well being of nations far away  We have learned to be citizens of the world  members of the human community  It is not a Republican or Democratic or American community  It is a world community    In the age of instant global communication  trade zones that span hemispheres  transnational criminal gangs  international terrorism  and the prospect of nuclear devastation    the need of nations to work together is greater than ever  The challenges we face today are too complex  too immense  and too pervasive for the United States or any nation to face alone     The United Nations is the one and only organization through which the nations of the world can link their unique strengths in a realistic hope of building a peaceful future for all humanity    We need a representative at the United Nations who supports that vision and is committed to that future for us all  John Bolton is not the person for that job  and I urge my colleagues to vote against him    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
