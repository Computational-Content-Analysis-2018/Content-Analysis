Employee Free Choice Act will help to create an  atmosphere where workers can choose a union free from employer coercion    Majority Sign UpEmployees Choose A Union When A Majority of Workers  Sign Cards Endorsing the UnionProblem   Union elections are  often the focus of employer intimidation and coercionemployers illegally fire  employees for union activity in more than one quarter of all organizing efforts     In 2005  over 30 000 workers were discriminated againstlosing wages or even  their jobsfor exercising their freedom to associate  Solution   The  bill provides that workers can choose a union when a majority of them sign valid  cards stating they want a union as their bargaining representative   Existing  law allows for majority sign up  but only at the employers discretion   The  National Labor Relations Board  NLRB  will determine the validity of the cards   Reaching First Contract Through Mediation and  ArbitrationProblem  34 percent of union victoriesmore than  one third of hard won electionsdid not result in a contract for workers   This  renders employee choice meaningless Solution   The bill provides that  if the parties dont reach a contract within 90 days  either one can seek  mediation from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service  FMCS    If there  is no agreement after 30 days of mediation  the dispute will go to arbitration   the result of which will be binding on the parties for two years     Strengthens Remedies for Employer Coercion When Employees are  Trying to Organize or get a First ContractProblem   Employers  fire pro union workers in 25  of organizing drives  But remedies for this  coercion are inadequate  An employee must often spend years to prove her  caseand then she is only eligible to receive back pay and reinstatement to her  job  Solution   Injunctions   The NLRB must go to court to get  an order stopping an employer that is firing or discriminating against workers  based on their union activity during an organizing or first contract drive    Treble Backpay  An employer that discriminates against a worker during an  organizing campaign or first contract drive must pay three times back pay   Civil Penalties  Imposes civil fines up to  20 000 per violation if an employer  willfully or repeatedly violates workers rights during an organizing campaign  or first contract drive    STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY Employee  Free Choice Act Hearing As Prepared for Delivery March 27  2007      The  fundamental promise of the American Dream is that hard work leads to success and  a better life for families   Its a vision of shared prosperity where we all  work hard to expand the economic pie  and we all reap the benefits   Unfortunately  the American Dream has become a false hope for many working  families   America is no longer growing together   We have an economy that works  for Wall Street  but not for Main Street   Our hearings so far have  demonstrated the growing insecurity faced by millions of working Americans  Men  and women are working harder than ever and not receiving their fair share of the  nations prosperity Since President Bush took office  corporate profits  have increased 65 percent  Productivity is up 18 percent  But household income  has declined significantly and the wages of working Americans are stagnant   Six  million more have lost their health insurance  and their retirement security is  fading as well   Only 1 in 5 workers today earns a guaranteed pension  The  American dream is increasingly out of reach    Its time to return to a  world where workers obtain their fair share of the nations economic growth  The  best way to do so is to give them a stronger voice in the workplace   Unions  were fundamental in building Americas middle class  and they still have a vital  role today in preserving the American dream  In 1960  when private sector union  membership was at its peak  all Americans shared in the nations rapidly growing  prosperity  The rising tide of prosperity truly did lift all boats    Now  union membership has sunk to record lows  and working families are  falling farther and farther behind   Inequality is rising to record levels not  seen since the gilded age  and only those at the very top are profiting from our  economic growth Today  we have a system where CEOs demand strong  contracts with inflated salaries for themselves  but fight to keep workers from  having a voice on the job   Our workplaces have become less democratic  and the voices of working people have been silenced   In 2005  more than 30 000  workers were illegally fired or retaliated against for trying to exercise their  right to have a union in the workplace   Every 17 minutes  a worker is fired or  punished illegally for supporting a union   Unscrupulous employers  routinely break the law to keep unions outthey intimidate workers  harass them   and discriminate against them   They close down whole departmentsor even entire  plantsto avoid negotiating a union contract   Its illegal and its  unacceptable  but it happens every day  It happens to workers like Jeff  Lemon of Beaver County  Pennsylvania  who worked in the Beaver County Times  distribution center   When he and his co workers werent given the raises  promised by the company  they tried to form a union and asked the National Labor  Relations Board to conduct an election   At that point  the company launched its  anti union crusade   Management threatened to eliminate their jobs and  replace them with outside contractors   They forced everyone to sit in meetings  and listen to why the union shouldnt be allowed in   They spied on workers when  they distributed information about the union at community events   And they  fired Jeff for his union activity Despite the threats and intimidation   the employees voted for the union two years ago  But  they still dont have a  contract  because the company keeps stalling and refusing to reach any kind of  agreement   The National Labor Relations Board ruled that Jeff was unlawfully  fired for his union support  and the company is appealing the ruling and  refusing to restore him to his position   It could be years before he gets back  the job he needs Stories like Jeffs are all too common   The current  system is broken   The law isnt protecting workers  and it cant stop the  anti worker tactics that take place every day   Penalties for misconduct are so  minor that employers treat them as just another cost of doing business   The  rules of the NLRB are so biased that workers never get a chance to have their  voices heard   The atmosphere becomes so tainted that its impossible  for workers to make a free choice about whether they want a union   Thats why we need the Employee Free Choice Act   It will make America  stronger by improving our economy  and restoring security and prosperity to the  American middle class   Union wages are 30 percent higher than  non union wages   80 percent of union workers have health insurance  compared to  only 49 percent of non union workers   Union members are almost twice as likely  to have paid sick days  and are four times more likely to have a secure   guaranteed pension   Unions mean the difference between an economy thats fair   and an economy where working people are left behind   The Employee Free  Choice Act will fix our broken system by leveling the playing field for  employees in three critical ways   It supports the right of workers to choose  their own representative  It requires employers to come to the table to talk   And it puts real teeth in the law by strengthening the penalties for  discrimination against workers who favor a union   These reforms will  enable hardworking Americans to make their own decision about whether they want  to bargain together  without the threat of harassment and retribution  or the  fear of losing their livelihood   It will empower American workers to work  together to ensure fair treatment on the job and build a better life for their  families The Employee Free Choice Act is about more than changing our  labor laws  its about giving workers basic dignity and respect in the  workplace  Its the first of many steps we need to take to restore the voice of  the American worker  which has been silenced far too long   I look  forward to hearing from our witnesses today about this important bill and how we  can best help Americas working families build a better life and a better future  for themselves and their children                                                                                                                                                                                                 Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner March 27
