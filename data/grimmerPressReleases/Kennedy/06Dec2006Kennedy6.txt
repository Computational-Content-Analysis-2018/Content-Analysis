to a giant of sports in Massachusetts we are proud to call our own  I was honored to speak at his memorial service in Boston  and Im honored today to offer this resolution on the one and only Arnold Red Auerbach  who died in October at the age of 89   Red was a pioneer in sports and in civil rights as well  Hes been widely praised as one of the architects of the new Boston  Hell never be forgotten  and therell never be another like him   Basketball was his sport  and the Celtics he led with the legendary Bob Cousy and the incomparable Bill Russell set the gold standard for the NBA for many years  and transformed his city as well as his sport    The stories of his competitive drive have become legendary  Red had a deep and abiding passion for life and for living each day as if it was a gift from above  Whenever you were in his presence  you could sense the powerful joy that comes to the rare few like Red Auerbach  who know theyve done everything possible in every way on every day to achieve their dream   Red Auerbach was a great coach  and also a great man  He believed in winning  but he also believed that every individual should have the chance to be a winner  In the 1950s  before every Celtics game Red would invite a few children to play a brief game of basketball  complete with uniforms  official referees  and all the rest on the famous Boston Garden parquet floor  One player would be from the CYO  one from Chinatown  one from Roxbury and one from the Young Mens Hebrew Association  Long before anyone ever dreamed of it  Red had created his own Rainbow Coalition  and he continued to champion civil rights all his life  He was the first to go overseas with American players to teach basketball to children in Europe and Asia  and he deserves immense credit for making it the international game it is today  But his heart was in Boston  where he single handedly put basketball on the map  He created the famous Celtic magic  mystique  and renewed it year after year with exciting basketball  In the end  he led the Celtics to 9 world championships as coach  8 in a row  and 16 world championships altogether  He was voted greatest coach of all time by the Professional Basketball Writers of America  Few giants in the world are known by one name  Cher  Madonna  Elvis  Bono  and our very own Red  Hell be greatly missed  and never forgotten  and his record of success will probably never be matched anywhere  Its an honor to urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this resolution  Even if you rooted against the Celtics  Red Auerbach made your home team great too       The text of the Auerbach Senate Resolution 624 is below  Whereas Arnold Red Auerbach was born on September 20  1917 in Brooklyn  NY  the son of immigrants from Minsk  Russia  Whereas Red started playing basketball as a public school student in Brooklyn and later became a star guard for Eastern District High School  making all scholastic second team in his senior year  Whereas Red started his coaching career at St  Albans Prep School and Roosevelt High School in Washington  DC  before serving in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946  Whereas in 1946  Red began his professional coaching career with the Washington Capitols in the Basketball Association of America  BAA  and led the team to the 1947 and 1949 division titles  joining the Boston Celtics as coach in 1950 after the BAA merged with the National Basketball Association  NBA   Whereas Red s record of success on the basketball court and in the Celtics  front office is unmatched  Whereas during Red s 16 years coaching the Boston Celtics  the team won 9 NBA championships  with a record 8 in a row  Whereas when Red retired from coaching in 1966 to become general manager of the Celtics  he was the winningest coach in NBA history with 1 037 victories and had won almost two thirds of the games he had coached over a 20 year NBA coaching career  Whereas during his nearly 57 year tenure with the Celtics as Head Coach  General Manager  Vice Chairman of the Board and President  Red was the architect of one of the greatest dynasties in the history of professional sports  Whereas Red infused the Celtics organization with the values of teamwork  respect  tenacity and loyalty  creating a culture known as Celtic Pride that will be forever associated with the Boston Celtics franchise  Whereas Red s imprint on the Celtics  the NBA and the game of basketball is permanent and visible today in innovations that Red developed  including the Sixth Man role and fast break style of play  Whereas Red was an effective and tireless ambassador for the game of basketball  both in the United States and overseas  conducting clinics  barnstorming with the Celtics  starring in the successful television series Red on Roundball  writing seven books on basketball  including the influential Basketball For The Player  The Coach and The Fan  and participating with Celtic great and Hall of Famer Larry Bird in the instructional video   Winning Basketball   Whereas Red received numerous awards and honors in recognition of his extraordinary achievements  such as selection as the NBA Coach of the Year in 1965  induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969  designation as the NBA Executive of the Year in 1980  and selection as The Greatest Coach in the History of the NBA by the Professional Basketball Writers  Association of America in 1980  Whereas Red s lighting of his cigar in the closing moments of an imminent Celtics  victory became an enduring symbol of success in Boston and around the world  Whereas Red s legacy extends beyond the game of basketball and includes his important contributions to the advancement of a colorblind society through his decision to draft the NBA s first African American player  Chuck Cooper  in 1950  hire the first African American head coach in professional sports  Bill Russell  in 1966  and field the first starting lineup in the NBA consisting entirely of African American players in 1964  Whereas the name Red Auerbach will forever be synonymous with winning  intensity  integrity and charitable causes  Now  therefore  be it Resolved by the House of Representatives  the Senate concurring   That it is the sense of Congress that    1  Arnold Red Auerbach was a basketball genius who embodied the values of creativity  determination  versatility and commitment to helping the less fortunate   2  Red Auerbach was a leader in the effort to break prevailing racial barriers in professional sports  through his decisions to draft  hire and prominently feature African Americans on the Boston Celtics basketball team  and  3  Red Auerbach s place among the greatest coaches and executives of all time is assured  his contributions to the betterment of society will always endure  and his life exemplifies the very best ideals of the United States    Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley   617  565 4472
