         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC   Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy will offer an amendment to the bankruptcy bill to raise the minimum wage  Senator Kennedy s proposal takes into account that the current minimum wage is grossly inadequate to live on in this economy with nearly 36 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  His proposal would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps  Currently the minimum wage is  5 15   Senator Kennedy will attach this amendment to the bankruptcy bill because raising the minimum wage is critical to preventing the economic freefall that often leads to bankruptcy  Approximately 500 000 households below the poverty line file for bankruptcy every year and amending the bankruptcy bill would help many of the people this legislation is likely to hurt  low income families  minorities and women   With few savings  and little safety net  minimum wage workers are one pink slip or one medical emergency away from bankruptcy  Senator Kennedy said  We can no longer turn our backs on our fellow citizens and it s time for the Republican Party to join us in raising the minimum wage for the 7 3 million employees across the country   The last time the Congress voted to raise the minimum wage was in 1996 and three times in the last Congress the Republican leadership brought down a bill rather than having a clean vote on the minimum wage  Kennedy declared today that he would oppose any effort to add to the minimum wage so called overtime cuts that would be the death of the 40 hour workweek and the American weekend   FACT SHEET ON MINIMUM WAGE    The Fair Minimum Wage Amendment of 2005 would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps     5 85 60 days after enactment    6 55 one year later    7 25 one year after that   The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 4 3 million since President Bush took office  Nearly 36 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Among full time  year round workers poverty has doubled since the late 1970sfrom about 1 3 million then to more than 2 6 million  An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem    The last time Congress voted to raise the minimum wage was in 1996  That increase raised it from  4 25 to  4 75 in 1996  and then in 1997 to its current  5 15 an hour    Three times in the last Congress the Republican leadership brought down a bill rather than let us have an up or down vote on the minimum wage    first on the State Department Bill  then on the Welfare Bill  and finally on the Class Action Bill    Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  earn  10 700 a year   5 000 below the poverty line for a family of three  Since the last increase in 1997  the value has eroded by more than 15 percent    Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  3 50 below what it was in 1968  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be  8 70 an hour today  not  5 15    Nearly seven and a half million workers will directly benefit from the minimum wage increase  More than eight million more will benefit indirectly  That s fifteen and a half million workers who will get a raise    Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 370 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families  That s enough for a minimum wage family to buy  o Almost two years of child care o Full tuition for a community college degree o A year and a half of heat and electricity o More than a year of groceries o More than 9 months of rent   In the past eight years  Members of Congress will have raised their own pay seven timesby  28 500  In those same eight years minimum wage workers have not gotten a single raisethey continue to earn  10 700 a year    The current minimum wage fails to provide enough income to enable minimum wage workers to afford adequate housing in any area of this country    History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation  In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades  More than 11 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 232 000 per month  There were ten million new service industry jobs  including more than one and a half million retail jobs  of which nearly 600 000 were restaurant jobs    A fair increase is long overdue  Congress should act as quickly as possible to pass a minimum wage increase that reflects the losses suffered as the result of our shameful inaction in the past  No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty   Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy On Raising the Minimum Wage   As Prepared for Delivery    March 3  2005  I now offer an amendment to raise the minimum wage  I heard my friend Senator Hatch say that it s been eight long years since Republicans have been trying to pass the Bankruptcy bill  Well  I say to my friend from Utah  it s been eight long years since Democrats have been trying to pass an increase in the minimum wage  That s eight long years that minimum wage workers have been earning  5 15 an hour  For employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  that s  10 700 a year     5 000 below the poverty line for a family of three   That s why I m offering this amendment  which will raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps    by 70 cents 60 days after enactment  70 more cents a year later  and another 70 cents one year after that   This amendment deserves a vote  and it deserves a clean vote without any poison pills attached to it  I will oppose any effort to add to the minimum wage so called comp time proposals that would be the death of the 40 hour workweek and the American weekend   Three times in the last Congress the Republican leadership brought down a bill rather than let us have a vote on the minimum wage    first on the State Department Bill  then on the Welfare Bill  and finally on the Class Action Bill  It s long past time to have a clean vote on raising the minimum wage   Actions speak louder than words  The words we heard yesterday from the Republican Leadership are about their anti poverty agenda  But at this very moment their actions on the Senate floor belie those hopeful words  Instead of extending a helping hand to those struggling hardest to make ends meet  they are pushing hard for a bankruptcy bill that robs the poor to fill the already brimming pockets of the credit card industry  The Republican proposal is little more than smoke and mirrors  If the Senate is serious about an anti poverty agenda we will end the hypocrisy of easy rhetoric and take the long overdue actions that are so obviously needed as part of a genuine anti poverty agenda  Let s start by raising the minimum wage   My colleagues may argue  but this is the bankruptcy bill    the minimum wage is not relevant to the bankruptcy bill  I say to my friends  nothing could be further from the truth   Raising the minimum wage is critical to preventing the economic free fall that often leads to bankruptcy   Amending the bankruptcy bill to increase the minimum wage will help many of the people this so called bankruptcy reform is likely to hurt    low income families  minorities and women   Working families are being squeezed in every direction by the Bush economy  Families are just barely balancing on a cliff of piling bills  just hoping they won t topple over  Their costs are increasing  but their wages are stagnant  Since President Bush took office  the cost of housing has gone up 33 percent  college tuition has gone up 35 percent  and health insurance has gone up 59 percent   For minimum wage workers  prices have increased every year since 1997  but their paychecks have remained exactly the same  They are still earning  5 15 an hour  If inflation is taken into account the real value of the minimum wage is even lower     4 38 an hour   With few savings  and little safety net  minimum wage workers are one pink slip or one medical emergency away from bankruptcy   We teach our children the importance of hard work  We encourage them to do their best in school and to be good citizens  We tell them their reward will be good jobs that fulfill their hopes and dreams and enable them to support strong and healthy families   That s what America is about   But for 36 million Americans who live and work in poverty today  that dream is unfulfilled  They work as hard as any American often even harder  But too often they struggle and are forced into bankruptcy because the minimum wage won t cover their bills and give their families the support they need   For them  the minimum wage is the American nightmare  not the American dream  We can no longer turn our backs on our fellow citizens  But that is exactly what is happening here in the United States Senate   This is not just an economic issue  It is also a women s issue  Women are three times more likely than men to be responsible for lifting their families out of bankruptcy  Mothers are three times more likely than men without children to go bankrupt  If things continue as they are  one in six single mothers will file for bankruptcy by the end of the decade   Divorced women are often forced into bankruptcy because they are owed child support or alimony  They re trying to raise their children  but they face a daunting challenge  and this bill will make it even harder to meet that challenge  Yet sixty one percent of those who will benefit from a minimum wage increase are women  and one third of those women are mothers   This is also a civil rights issue  African American families and Hispanic families disproportionately face the threat of bankruptcy and the burden of a low minimum wage  Hispanic homeowners are three times more likely to file for bankruptcy than other Americans  and African American homeowners are six times more likely  They will be disproportionately harmed by this bankruptcy bill   But African Americans and Hispanics also comprise more than a third of those who will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage  This amendment will help these families meet their basic needs  In fact  one million African Americans  and more than 1 4 million Hispanic workers  would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage   This is a family issue  Low income families struggling to meet their obligations often find themselves facing bankruptcy  Some argue that the rise in bankruptcy filings is due to a lack of responsibility  But too often the problem is a matter of basic home economics  Families going into bankruptcy have less income than most Americans  A raise in the minimum wage will give many of them the economic boost they need to avoid bankruptcy  It will give these low income wage earners the help they deserve to care more effectively for their families    to buy the food and clothing  and health care they need  without going into debt   The level of the minimum wage is so low today that many workers have to work long hours to make ends meet  The increase in work hours has a damaging impact on every aspect of life    on families  on personal time  and even on employers  who get less productivity from overworked employees   According to the Families and Work Institute  three out of the top four things that children would most like to change about their working parents are these  They wish their parents were less stressed out by their work   They wish they were less exhausted by their work  They wish they could spend more time with them   Employers pay a high price for overworked employees  Productivity suffers  Turnover goes up  Employees are more susceptible to illness   Raising the minimum wage won t solve all of these problems  But a higher minimum wage will mean that more employees can work fewer hours  and have more hours a week of family time and personal time  Fewer minimum wage workers will be forced to make the impossible choice between paying the rent and buying groceries  or between paying the heating bill and buying clothes   Low wage workers were hit especially hard by the recent recession  and they are left out of today s so called economic recovery  In the past four years  low income workers have faced greater poverty and even growing hunger  while corporations and wealthy Americans have reaped the benefits of multiple tax breaks and soaring profits   The real value of the minimum wage has fallen dramatically over the past 30 years  and minimum wage workers are being left behind  Working families have waited long enough   Our Republican colleagues want to raise it by only a grudging  1 10  That would leave out more than 5 5 million workers  An increase in the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour for full time  year round workers will add  4 400 to their annual income  enough to make a difference in their lives  It s enough for a low income family of three to pay for   More than a year of groceries   Over 9 months of rent   A year and a half of heat and electricity  or  Full tuition for two years to earn a community college degree  It s long past time for Congress to give these hard working Americans a raise  In the past eight years  Members of Congress have raised our own salaries seven timesby a total of  28 500while minimum wage workers still continue to earn the same  10 700 a year they earned in 1997  Minimum wage workers deserve a raise too   In the current economy  millions of Americans are suffering  Nearly eight million are unemployed  Forty five million are without health insurance  Thirteen million children live in poverty  Poverty itself has doubled for full time  full year workers since the 1970s  Minimum wage employees work 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  and they deserve to be fairly paid   At the current minimum wage  workers can t afford adequate housing in any area of this country  A worker earning the minimum wage in Massachusetts  Pennsylvania  Utah  or many other parts of the country  would have to work more than 100 hours a week to afford a two bedroom apartment  That means working more than 20 hours a day five days a week  or more than 14 hours a day seven days a week   Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than three dollars and fifty cents below its peak in 1968    three dollars and fifty cents  To have the same purchasing power it had then  the minimum wage would have to be  8 70 an hour today  not  5 15   More than 7 million workers will directly benefit from this minimum wage increase  Nearly two thirds of these employees are adults  and more than a third of them are the sole breadwinners in their families   History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage does not have a negative effect on jobs  employment  or inflation  In the first four years after the last minimum wage increase  the economy had its strongest growth in three decades  More than 11 million new jobs were added  at a rate of more than 200 000 a month   Compare that to the 760 000 private sector jobs lost since President Bush took office  Raising the minimum wage won t cause more job losses    but staying the course on the Bush Administration s failed economic policies will   We must act at long last to raise the federal minimum wage   Overwhelming numbers of citizens in Nevada and Florida showed the way last November  by voting for a higher minimum wage in their states  It s time for the Republican Party to stop obstructing a vote on raising the minimum wage for all employees across the nation  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment  and improve the lives of millions of American families   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
