         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the Military Commissions Act  The Military Commissions Act is seriously flawed  The Administration negotiated the final bill in secret with Republican leaders and rushed it through Congress in a blatant attempt to gain a partisan advantage before the Senate and House adjourned for the election  It gives the President excessive power to label and detain enemy combatants  Its evisceration of the writ of habeas corpus for all non citizens is almost surely unconstitutional  and so is its attempt to legalize the use of evidence obtained by torture  The Administration initially tried to establish military commissions without congressional approval  but it failed to bring any detainee to justice in the five years since 9 11 and the commissions were struck down by the Supreme Court last term  The Administrations new scheme is likely to suffer the same fate  and Congress will have to pass further legislation to try to get it right  The White House and the Republican Congress should stop playing politics with national security and take their responsibility to protect the American people seriously by obeying the Constitution and the rule of law   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
