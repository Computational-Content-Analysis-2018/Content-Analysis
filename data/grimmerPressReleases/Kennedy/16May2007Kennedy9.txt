         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  the National Assessment Governing Board released the 2006 results for the National Assessment of Educational Progress  NAEP  for U S  history and civics  The performance of 4th  8th and 12th graders in U S  history was last assessed in 2001  and their performance in civics was last assessed in 1998   Senator Kennedy  The scores released this morning show that we ve made some progress  but there s a great deal more to do to ensure that all students are familiar with the lessons of our nation s past and their role in its future  Senator Alexander said  The good news is that across the board student achievement in American history is increasing   This is crucial because U S  history is the most important subject our children study  but has been their worst subject   It is the most important subject because without an understanding of our founding documents and principles  we would be simply another United Nations instead of the United States of America  Also today  Senators Kennedy and Alexander re introduced their bill  The American History and Civics Achievement Act  The bill passed the Senates Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee in September of 2006   Information on the bill  including a summary  is below  The bill was introduced this morning   SENATORS KENNEDY AND ALEXANDER INTRODUCE AMERICAN HISTORY AND CIVICS ACHIEVEMENT ACT Call for greater focus on teaching and learning in essential subjects WASHINGTON  D CToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Senator Lamar Alexander re introduced legislation to establish a new  10 state pilot program under the National Assessment of Educational Progress  NAEP  to assess and improve the knowledge of American history and civics   The National Assessment Governing Board released results earlier today in Boston  Massachusetts  detailing the achievement of students nationwide in U S  history and civics   Results show there has been slight progress among lowest achievers in grade 4  and some progress since the assessments were first administered  yet continued underachievement among most American learners in the subjects   Teaching the lessons of our nations past  and instilling the values of civic responsibility and of the founding of our democracy  is an essential role for Americas schools  said Senator Edward M  Kennedy   This is an important step forward for states to enhance their history standards and restore the teaching of history and civics in our nations schools  U S  history results showed an increase in student achievement in grades four  eight  and twelve  with the greatest gains achieved by low performing elementary school students   However  only 65 percent of eighth grade students and less than half of high school seniors mastered basic levels on the assessment  Scores were slightly higher on the civics assessment  with 70 percent of eighth graders and 66 percent of twelfth graders scoring at or above the basic level   Our pending immigration debate in the Senate has shed even more light on the importance of making sure our students are learning American history and civics  Alexander said  Our purpose in creating public schools 150 years ago was so that immigrant children could learn to read and write in English  learn math  and learn what it means to be an American  Kennedy and Alexander agreed last Congress on the need for additional data and a state by state analysis of learning in American history and civics   Legislation proposed today would provide  14 million to enable the National Governing Board to select 10 geographically diverse states to participate in a state level assessment of American history and civics under the NAEP  and deliver comparable state by state results  The Senators plan to pursue the legislation as part of the upcoming reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act  This bill was previously passed by the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee in September of 2006   The American History and Civics Achievement ActSenators Edward M  Kennedy and Lamar AlexanderFindings The strength of American democracy and our standing in the world depend on ensuring that our children have a strong understanding of our Nation s past   Yet  in 2006  30 percent of fourth graders  35 percent of eighth graders  and 53 percent of twelfth graders scored below basic on the National Assessment of Educational Progress assessment in U S  history    Similarly  27 percent of fourth graders  30 percent of eighth graders  and 34 percent of twelfth graders scored below basic on the National Assessment of Educational Progress assessment in civics   The American History Achievement Act recognizes the challenge in improving the teaching and learning of U S  history and civics in our nations schools  and seeks to promote an appreciation among students for the defining events in our Nation s history and recognize that knowledge of such events can be a catalyst for civic involvement   National Assessment of Educational ProgressThis Act amends the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act to direct the Commissioner for Education Statistics to give a priority to conducting national NAEP assessments of student achievement in U S  History at least once every 4 years in grades 4  8  and 12  It also requires the Commissioner to conduct trial State NAEP assessments  in at least ten geographically diverse States  of student achievement in U S  History in grades 8 and 12  and in Civics in grades 8 and 12  These assessments are to be conducted in connection with previously scheduled NAEP assessments administered to a national sample of students  National Assessment Governing Board The National Assessment Governing Board  in consultation with the Commissioner for Education Statistics  shall select the States that will participate in the trial State assessments  Authorization of Appropriations This Act authorizes  7 million for the fiscal years 2008 and 2009  to conduct the trial assessment  and such sums as may be necessary for succeeding fiscal year  Not more than  500 000 per fiscal year shall be used by the National Assessment Governing Board to develop and administer the trial State assessments       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
