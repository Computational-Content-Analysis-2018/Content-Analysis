         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C  Today  marking a dramatic step forward in healthcare  Senator Edward M  Kennedy s bill  the Wired for Health Care Quality Act of 2005 passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent  The bill will improve the care that patients receive  as we know that care declines in quality when physicians do not have access to timely information about the patients they serve  The bill will help curb health care costs  as we know that costs skyrocket when tests or procedures are duplicated because critical records are missing or inaccessible  The bill will save money  as we know that wasting scarce health care dollars on needless administrative costs drives up insurance premiums  and means that care is less affordable and less available  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act of 2005 sets forth the goal posts for improving health care through technology  reducing administrative costs and diminishing fatal errors caused by lack of information  Senator Kennedy has been speaking out on the benefits and need for health information technology since 1977    Senator Kennedy said  We have a responsibility to make the miracles of modern medicine available to every American  However  in our health care system  medical errors are all too common and coordination of care is often poor  Americans deserve a health care that controls rising costs and prevents premiums from crushing our health care system  Today is the first day of the future of health care    IT systems are linked securely and with strong privacy protections to a patient s medical records and can improve care by warning a doctor or nurse if an order or prescription may harm a patient  These systems can issue reminders for screening tests  so that needed preventive care is not overlooked  Computerized records also allow doctors to look at a patient s entire medical record at once  improving care coordination in our fragmented health care system    The savings from better IT use are enormous  The Federal government s estimate is that the nation would save  140 billion each year from proper IT use  These savings from health IT could cut the cost of a family s insurance policy by over  700  which equates to approximately a month of free health care  Despite the benefits of investment in health IT  utilization is low  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act of 2005 will give health care providers the assistance they need to invest in lifesaving health IT    Kennedy also said  Premiums are going through the roof  The ranks of the uninsured grow every day  When millions of Americans struggle to afford health care for their families  it is profoundly wrong to squander more than half a trillion dollars each year on administrative expenses from using obsolete paper records instead of modern information technology throughout the healthcare system    STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY SENATE CONSIDERATION OF THE WIRED FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY ACT November 18  2005   Today the Senate has the opportunity to pass legislation that can help transform our health care system and save lives  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act will improve the use of life saving health information technology in hospitals and doctors  offices across the country  In so doing  we ll improve the quality of care  lower administrative costs  and reduce medical errors    This legislation is being considered by the Senate because of the leadership and commitment of the Chairman of our Health Committee  Senator Enzi  He made health information technology a priority for our committee  and he s guided this legislation to the Senate floor  Successful legislation takes creative thinking and hard work    and Senator Enzi has supplied an abundance of both to this measure    I also thank our partners in this legislation  Senator Frist and Senator Clinton  As a surgeon  Senator Frist knows first hand the importance of making sure that doctors have the information they need to provide the best possible care for patients    and that they get that information in time for it to be of value  It s inconceivable that in the twenty first century  doctors are asked to treat patients in life or death situation without knowing their medical histories or even the medications they re taking    but that happens every hour of every day in hospitals and emergency rooms around the country  Senator Frist has been tireless in his commitment to correcting this unacceptable situation    Senator Clinton has done an excellent job as well  She s championed better studies of the comparative effectiveness of medications  she s dedicated to improving the quality of care for every patient  and this legislation owes much to her ability and commitment    This legislation is urgently needed  because we live in a new era of medical miracles and rapid changes in medicine                 Modern electronics have given doctors implantable pacemakers to save patients from sudden cardiac failure                The sequencing of the human genome offers extraordinary opportunities for new cures and better treatments                But there is another medical miracle to add to the list                 Modern information technology can transform health care as profoundly as any of these discoveries    We have a moral responsibility to make the miracles of modern medicine available to every American    but we have failed to meet that responsibility  Costs are crushing our health care system  Premiums are going through the roof  The ranks of the uninsured grow every day  Families are forced to choose between paying the cost of health care or paying for food  rent  and college tuition  That s not the American dream     Information technology alone can t solve these problems  but it can help substantially  Electronic medical records  Software to warn if a treatment could harm a patient  Computer prescribing  These and many other applications of information technology can save lives and dramatically reduce costs    Despite the wonders of modern medicine  too many patients today are harmed by preventable mishaps  They waste hours and face new risk when tests must be duplicated  because a crucial record is locked in another archive  Too many doctors only guess at the right course of treatment  because they don t know a patient s medical history  Millions of patients are needlessly put at risk  and billions of dollars are wasted    When so many Americans are already struggling to afford health care for their families  it s profoundly wrong to squander more than half a trillion dollars each year on administrative expenses    The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that better use of information technology will save  140 billion every year  Such savings would produce a technology dividend worth over  700 on the cost of an average family s insurance policy  That s like getting one month free every year    Other nations are already using this extraordinary technology to cut costs and save lives    but America lags behind  We can t continue to allow the high cost of health care to price American goods and services out of the global marketplace     The need to invest in this technology is urgent  In the words of Secretary Leavitt  Every day that we delay  lives are lost  The time to act is now  The bill before us will improve care  save lives and make health care more affordable for every American    The need to reduce medical errors is especially urgent  It s already six years since the Institute of Medicine reported that medical errors cause 98 000 deaths every year  According to the National Patient Safety Foundation  forty two percent of Americans have been affected by a medical error  either personally or through a friend or relative  One out of every three of those affected said that the error had a permanent negative effect on the patient s health  The exact figures may be the subject of debate  but it s undeniable that preventable deaths occur in our health care system all too often  For even one patient to die needlessly in our health care system ought to be unacceptable     Our response should be broad based  New technology  new ideas  and new ways of practicing medicine all have a role in improving the quality of care and saving lives  We no longer expect airline pilots to navigate by looking at the stars or local landmarks  Engineers no longer rely on slide rules to design strong buildings  In virtually every field except medicine  professionals use computers to expand their skills  Yet in medicine  we expect doctors to keep in their heads the possible interactions of the dozens of medications that a patient may be receiving  Under these circumstances  the wonder is not that errors occur  but that they don t occur even more frequently     The evidence that information technology can save lives is undeniable  In terms of drug safety alone  a recent analysis by the RAND Corporation estimates that by using computerized data  the nation could prevent 2 2 million adverse drug events  and 1 million additional days in the hospital    What we have today  in the words of the Institute of Medicine  is a quality chasm  Doctors repeat tests that have already been performed  Residents take medical histories that have already been taken  Patients show up for doctor s appointments that are essentially a waste of time because the tests have been performed but the results have not yet been delivered     Information technology can help close this gap by improving the coordination of care  providing guidance on the best methods of care and reminding busy physicians when it s time to schedule preventive screenings  The Veterans Administration is a national leader in using IT to improve quality  and patients get better preventive services there than almost any other patient group in America gets  especially in areas such as proper cholesterol screening  eye exams for diabetic patients  and proper immunization against pneumonia    Electronic medical records improve the quality of care  and can also improve our ability to monitor drug safety  detect outbreaks of disease before they become epidemics and decide which treatments are most effective for patients    Electronic medical records can be critical in a natural disaster  The devastation of Hurricane Katrina was compounded because most hospitals kept their records on paper  As a result  medical histories of tens of thousands of hurricane survivors were irretrievably lost  It would be inexcusable if we didn t make the investments needed for the nation to benefit from these innovations     Information technology doesn t simply improve the quality of care    it reduces costs as well  According to the Institute of Medicine  each prescription error that s prevented saves  4 000 in additional care  This isn t just a theory  Since 1996  when the Veterans Administration began investing significantly in information technology  its costs per patient have actually decreased by 7   while private sector costs per patient have increased by 62     Excessive administrative costs are weighing down our health care system  We re spending over  500 billion a year on such costs    nearly 33 cents out of every health care dollar  These already high costs are also growing 50  faster than other health costs  It can cost as much as  20 to process a single insurance claim using antiquated paper records    and nearly half the 18 billion insurance claims in America are still settled in this old fashioned way every year  We know that paper based records are prone to error  About one in four health insurance claims is initially rejected because of errors  By contrast  in the financial industry  only 1 in 10 000 ATM transactions has an error    Despite clear evidence that health IT saves lives and cuts costs  its use is still scandalously low  Our health care system should be the envy of the world  but nations from Australia to Scandinavia are outpacing us in this technology  In Sweden and Holland  nine out of ten primary care physicians use electronic medical records  In Britain  Austria  Finland and many other nations  it s over half  But in the United States  less than a quarter of all doctors use electronic medical records    Obviously  there are significant barriers to the adoption of health information technology that Congress should also address  Many providers don t have the financial ability to absorb the costs of buying the equipment  making the transition to computer systems  and training staff  It costs a physician s office  30 000 and significant aggravation to install the system  The savings from its use tend to come over the longer term  while the costs are immediate  which is a major financial barrier to hospitals  physicians  and nursing homes already drowning in red ink  Providers get savings over the long run  but the largest share of the savings goes to payers  not providers  If a diabetic is kept out of the hospital by better management of his condition as the result of information technology  that s a loss of revenue to the hospital     This bipartisan legislation will help overcome these barriers  It requires the development of standards on interoperability and other technical measures for health information technology  and it establishes a public private consultation to develop those standards     But standards without federal resources are not enough to achieve the goal of a modern health care system that we all share  That s why the legislation includes financial assistance to hard pressed providers to meet the technical standards  It provides this assistance in three ways in recognizing the fact that different health care providers and different communities will have different needs  It authorizes direct grants to needy providers  It authorizes financial assistance to establish regional networks  And it creates an innovative federal state  public private partnership to modernize health care by enabling states to fund low interest loans to help health professionals in financial need to acquire the technology to improve the quality and efficiency of health care     Getting the right hardware and software into the hands of doctors is only half the battle  It is also essential to see that doctors have access to the knowledge necessary to make the technology a success  The legislation establishes a Best Practices Center where technology users can learn from the experience of others who have established such networks  It sets up a Help line at the Department of Health and Human Services to answer technical questions and help meet technical requirements  To assist doctors in sorting through the confusing array of options for this technology  the legislation establishes a certification program  so that providers can quickly determine whether particular systems meet the applicable technical standards    There are many Senate colleagues who deserve great credit for their thoughtful contributions to this legislation and for their leadership in getting to this moment    Again  I commend the Chairman of our Health Committee  Senator Enzi  for his impressive leadership on this issue  It s been a privilege to work closely with him and his staff since the beginning of this year and to deal with this priority    The pending legislation combines the bill that Chairman Enzi and I introduced and the bill that Senator Frist and Senator Clinton introduced  We ve also had broad input from many other committee members  and we ve produced a better bill because of it    Senator Dodd was a leader on the issue in the last Congress as well  and our bill includes many of his ideas  especially on making sure that standards are widely available                Senator Ensign made sure that best practices are front and center in implementing this technology    Our subcommittee chairman  Senator Burr  has a strong interest in using information technology to improve our ability to respond to bioterrorist attacks or other disease emergencies  when lost hours can mean countless lost lives    Senator Reed of Rhode Island had the innovative idea of including a 1 800 number to help providers on technical questions  Senator Harkin contributed important proposals to use the technology to improve the treatment of chronic diseases    Senator Reid of Nevada has shown impressive leadership in making sure technology improves the lives of American families  and I thank him for his strong support    Senator Snowe and Senator Stabenow have a major commitment to effective funding for this technology  and I look forward to working with them on this issue in the days to come  I also commend Senator Snowe for her strong commitment to protecting the privacy of electronic medical data    I also commend Steve Northrup and Katy Barr of Senator Enzi s staff  Andrea Palm of Senator Clinton s staff  Liz Hall of Senator Frist s staff  and my own health staff  for their effective work on this issue for so many months     I thank these and all our Senate colleagues who contributed to the legislation we consider today  I look forward to working with all of you and with our colleagues in the House to see this needed measure signed into law as soon as possible    Facts About Health Care and Health Information Technology   Health Care Quality Has Significant Problems     Between 44 000 and 98 000 Americans die each year from inpatient medical errors a The Institute of Medicine        Overall  adult Americans receive recommended care only 55  of the time        Nearly 30  of health care spending  or up to  300 billion each year  is for treatments that may not improve health status  may be redundant  or may be inappropriate for the patient s condition     Health Care is Expensive     National health care spending now exceeds  1 7 trillion per year             Health care spending and health insurance premiums continue to rise at rates much higher than the rate of general inflation      Health Information Technology Improves Quality and Saves Money      Computerized entry of physician orders such as prescriptions can reduce adverse drug reactions by 75             Automated computerized reminders can increased physicians use of recommended medical interventions by up to 46        Savings in the range of  140 billion per year  close to 10 percent of total U S  health spending  could be achieved through widespread adoption of health IT        System wide savings would result in a reduction of  700 in family in medical insurance premiums per year      Health Information Technology is Underutilized     Only 10  of hospitals have operational computerized prescribing systems  with another 20  currently installing them  This means 70  do not use these systems        The United States ranks just 12th in adoption of health information technology when compared to 15 European Countries     The Wired for Health Care Quality Act  S  1418    Background   The need to invest in modernizing health care cannot be ignored any longer  Patient care declines in quality when physicians do not have access to timely information about the patients they serve  Health care costs skyrocket when tests or procedures are duplicated because critical records are missing or inaccessible  Wasting scarce health care dollars on needless administrative costs drives up insurance premiums  and means that care is less affordable and less available     IT systems linked securely and with strong privacy protections to a patient s medical records can improve care by warning a doctor or nurse if an order or prescription may harm a patient  These systems can issue reminders for screening tests  so that needed preventive care is not overlooked  Computerized records also allow doctors

is that the nation would save  140 billion each year from proper IT use  These savings from health IT could cut the cost of a family s insurance policy by over  700  Despite the benefits of investment in health IT  utilization is low  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act will give health care providers the assistance they need to invest in lifesaving health IT    The legislation helps develop standards for IT and improves Federal use of health IT by      Requiring the developments of standards on interoperability and other technical measures for health IT system  and establishing a public private consultation to develop those standards                   Authorizing in statute the National Coordinator for Health IT                   Requiring all Federal IT purchases to conform to these standards    The legislation assures strong privacy protections for patient data kept in electronic form by                   Forbidding funding under the bill to any IT system that lacks strong privacy and security protections                   Requiring recipients of funding to notify patients if their medical information is wrongfully disclosed      Requiring that the national strategy on health IT includes strong privacy protections  including methods to notify patients if their medical information is wrongfully disclosed    The legislation provides financial assistance to cash strapped providers to enhance their use of IT  systems that meet these technical standards by                   Giving grants to financially needy providers to enhance their use of health IT                   Providing financial assistance to establish regional health IT networks      Creating an innovative Federal State public private partnership to modernize the health care system by allowing States to fund low interest loans to help health care professionals in financial need acquire the health care IT systems that will improve the quality and efficiency of health care     The legislation will help providers improve use of IT to improve quality by      Establishing a Best Practices Center where IT users can learn from the previous experience of others who have established regional health IT networks      Setting up a Help line at HHS to assist providers with technical questions on implementing IT systems and complying with technical requirements      Funding novel training programs to help train health professionals at the start of their careers in better use of IT      Establishing a certification program so that providers can quickly determine whether particular IT systems meet the applicable technical standards      Developing risk adjusted measures of health care quality through extensive consultation with health professionals  and providing for reporting of the degree to which health care providers receiving funds achieve those measures      Studying licensure requirements of physicians to see if these impose barriers to better use of health IT and
