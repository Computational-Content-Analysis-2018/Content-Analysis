         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the United States Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pension Committee  sent the following letter to the Presidents of the University of Texas at Austin  Johns Hopkins University and the University of Southern California  In his letter  Kennedy asks for documents detailing the relationship between the universities and their preferred lender  Student Loan Xpress This letter is part of Chairman Kennedys ongoing investigation into the student loan industry April 11  2007Dear XX I am writing about information that has come to my attention which raises concerns about possible waste and fraud in the federally guaranteed student loan program at the University of Texas at Austin   Specifically  it has been reported that Lawrence W  Burt  associate vice president and director of student financial aid  owned shares in a student loan company that the Universitys financial aid office designated as a preferred lender  Student Loan Xpress   The volume of loans made by Student Loan Xpress to University of Texas students increased 74  from 2002 to 2003 and has increased since that time   The period of time during which the initial surge in loan volume occurred corresponds with the dates that Mr  Burt apparently held stock in the company In light of these events  I ask that you provide to my office information and documents concerning the financial aid offices relationships with private lenders providing federally guaranteed student loans to University students  including Student Loan Xpress   Please see the attached Document Request for specifics   I ask that you coordinate the production of documents with Nicholas W  Bath  Counsel to the Committee  at  202  224 6912 Thank you for your consideration                  Sincerely                 Edward M  Kennedy                ChairmanEnclosure   Document Request and Instructions Please produce the documents described below by
