         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633I m very pleased that the Committee is taking up the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act today  I commend Chairman Enzi  Subcommittee Chairman Isakson  and Ranking Subcommittee Member Murray for their dedication in pursuing safety protections  I also commend Senator Byrd and Senator Rockefeller  who have been tireless in seeking improvements in mine safety The need for the legislation is clear  This year began with the shocking tragedies at the Sago and Alma mines in West Virginia  where 14 coal miners were killed  In February  Chairman Enzi led a Committee trip to West Virginia to meet the families of the men who died  It was one of the most moving visits that I have had in my years in the Senate One strong impression from our trip is that it is the miners and their families who are the real experts in mine safety They are the ones who understand what it means to go underground every day  Some family members of miners are here with us today  and I hope that they will continue to provide their views as we move this legislation forward We ll learn more lessons in the weeks ahead from the investigation of Sago  But some lessons are already painfully clear  The miners who died could have survived with adequate oxygen  Instead  their self rescue units didn t work  and they had to share precious oxygen with each other  They had no realistic way to let rescuers outside know where they were  so they resorted to banging on pipes with sledge hammers  wasting precious energy and oxygen  This should never have happened and we need to be sure that it never happens again Our bill requires every company to have a comprehensive emergency response plan  so companies and miners will know ahead of time how to respond  To address the tragic problems we saw at Sago  every mine will have to provide at least two hours of oxygen for every miner  plus additional oxygen along evacuation routes and for trapped miners awaiting rescue  Mines will also have to inspect and replace these units regularly  so that no miner has an oxygen pack that doesn t work All mines will be required to have back up telephone lines immediately  and to adopt two way wireless communications and electronic tracking systems as soon as technologically possible  They will also have to install fire resistant lifelines  so miners can learn the best way out in an emergency One of the most moving aspects of the Sago and Alma response was the outpouring of support from other miners around the country  They wanted to do everything they could to rescue their brothers and sisters trapped underground  Our bill guarantees that every mine in the country will have a person on staff trained in emergency response who knows the mine  It strengthens requirements for training and drilling of mine rescue teams  It also reduces the time required for a rescue team to reach a mine to one hour  from the current two hours We don t yet know why the seals at the Sago Mine failed  but it is clear that they did  Our standards for these protective barriers lag far behind other developed nations  That is why this bill requires the Mine Safety and Health Administration to issue a new regulation in 18 months to improve these standards We also need to increase safety awareness in mines  to prevent accidents before they happen  Too many mining companies have been paying fines that cost less than parking tickets  Under the bill  companies can no longer treat violations of health and safety laws as a cost of doing business  We impose new minimum penalties for safety violations that put miners at risk  We take even stronger action against companies that recklessly subject their employees to serious risk of injury or death Research is also an important part of safety  The Navy has technologies to communicate with submarines on the bottom of the ocean  NASA can talk to people on the moon  It s time to bring mine safety technology into the 21st century too  Our bill creates an interagency task force so that NIOSH will have the benefit of the advances made by other industries and agencies This bill is an important step in strengthening the response to mine emergencies  But there is more to be done  Our bill requires MSHA and NIOSH to test refuge chambers to see if they can be used to protect miners in a fire or explosion  It addresses safety issues raised by ventilating mines with belt air  particularly the problem of fires on mine conveyor belts  We also require the Secretary of Labor to report to us on addressing these problems I commend Senator Enzi and Senator Isakson for agreeing to work together and to hold hearings on these critical issues in the future We can t bring back the brave miners who died in the tragedies earlier this year  But we can and must honor their memory by making all our mines safer I thank my colleagues  and I urge them to support the bill THE MINER ACT MAKES AMERICA S MINES SAFERMiners will have more emergency oxygen to help them survive a disaster  The bill requires each miner to have at least 2 hours of oxygen and stores of oxygen every 30 minutes along escape routes for miners trying to evacuate   The bill also requires additional caches for trapped miners   Emergency supplies will be carefully monitored for reliability All mines will have flame resistant lifelines to guide miners out in an emergency Seals for abandoned sections of mines will be stronger  Within 18 months  the Secretary must issue a higher standard for sealing off abandoned areas of mines to prevent dangerous explosions The Secretary will have new enforcement powers  The bill  Sets substantial new minimum penalties for serious violations   Gives the Secretary clear authority to shut down a mine for noncompliance with Department orders All mines will have state of the art two way wireless communications and electronic tracking systems in place  as soon as technological feasible  but not later than three years Mine rescue team response will be faster and better  The bill  Requires rescue teams to be more familiar with the mines they cover  be located closer  and have better training   Includes special provisions for small mines that are realistic  but also provide a higher level of protection for their miners than under current law The bill creates new liability rules to encourage companies to have mine rescue teams and miners to participate in them  The bill clarifies that neither rescue team members nor their employers are liable for any injuries or deaths that occur as a result of rescue activities The bill encourages technological advances and a new generation of skilled miners and safety inspectors  The bill  Focuses NIOSH s mine safety activities and creates an interagency working group to facilitate development of new technologies   Directs expert study on belt air and flammability of belts and field tests of refuge chambers   Creates a grant programs to improve safety training   Creates a scholarship program to increase the skilled workforce for mining operations and the inspector corps   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
