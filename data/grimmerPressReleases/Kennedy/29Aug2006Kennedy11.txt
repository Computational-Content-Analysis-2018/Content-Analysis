         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       FACT SHEETS INCLUDED       Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina  Also attached are fact sheets on education  health care  employment  housing  national service  federal aid  and the levees in the Gulf Coast demonstrating how the Administration failed a year ago and continues to fail today   Every American remembers the destruction and tragedy wrought by Hurricane Katrina  As entire communities were uprooted by the storm  we came together as a nation to lend a hand to our fellow citizens who lost so much  Countless Americans prayed  donated money  and volunteered to help any way they could  Clearly  the enormous task of rebuilding the Gulf is far from over  But as every American knows  the Administration failed the people of the Gulf one year ago and it continues to fail them today  Hundreds of thousands of dislocated families still are without jobs and unable to return to the Gulf  And we still have not taken the steps required to protect New Orleans from future storms and floods  This year long failure to move aggressively to rebuild these communities is a devastating reminder of how this Administration has failed to keep faith with the American people  Now as much as ever we need the Administration to understand that New Orleans and the Gulf are a treasured part of our country that should no longer be ignored  We owe it to its people and to the nation as a whole to restore its economy and its rich and vibrant culture    Katrina One Year Later Education Fact Sheet  A key indicator of recovery is whether schools reopen this fall  By this measure  the Bush Administration clearly has dropped the ball   Senator Edward M  Kennedy    Less than 2  of federal aid following Katrina has gone to rebuilding the education system  and its recovery has been slow     Pre Katrina  there were 271 child care centers in New Orleans including Head Start and Early Head Start  As of July  2006  58 centers are open which represents 21 4  of the Pre Katrina total   LSU Health Sciences Center    Only 53 public schools are preparing to open in New Orleans this fall  less than half the schools that served the area pre Katrina  As of August 22  only 26 public schools had opened   Tulane University  August 2006    Even the public schools that plan to open are struggling with a serious shortage of qualified teachers  due to a lack of affordable housing and other factors  Schools in New Orleans still need to hire an estimated 300 teachers to serve children enrolling this fall   Louisiana Recovery Authority    The higher education institutions in the New Orleans area are also struggling to recover  suffering from reduced enrollments  loss of faculty and research funding  and housing shortages for faculty and staff    The colleges and universities in Louisiana suffered an estimated  1 billion in property damage alone  but have received only  95 million in federal assistance so far   Broken Promises Report  Senate and House Democrats  August 2006    In June  Congress rejected a  200 million proposal that would have leveraged up to  800 million in low cost loans to help the institutions throughout the Gulf Region get back on their feet   Katrina One Year Later Health Care Fact Sheet  Health care on the Gulf Coast should be a critical focus of the President and Congress  yet it s one of many priorities ignored by a Republican led government  After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  the Administration promised to rebuild the health system  One year later  just half the hospitals in New Orleans have re opened  and most are operating at limited capacity  The Administration pledged to bring doctors and nurses to the region  to provide care for survivors and their families  but health worker shortages remain a critical concern  An effective health care system is vital for reconstruction  It s long past time for the Administration to show some real leadership and invest in the health and healing of Gulf Coast families    Promise  The President will work with Congress to ensure continuity of    health care    President Bush  September 15  2005  Reality   For many months after Katrina  most residents of New Orleans could access health care through only 1 trauma center and a few volunteer medical clinics    Only 2 of 13 New Orleans public health care clinics had reopened by February of this year  Of the 90 safety net clinics open before Katrina  just 14 have remainedmost operating at limited capacity    As of February 2006  just 2 of 76 pharmacies in New Orleans had re opened    Six months after Katrina  just 3 of 23 hospitals in the New Orleans were operating    Charity Hospital  the Gulf Coasts level 1 trauma center  and 7 of Louisiana State Universitys 10 teaching hospitals in New Orleans were severely incapacitated by the Hurricane  Before Katrina  these hospitals provided two thirds of all inpatient care for the areas uninsured     Promise  To relieve the burden on local health care facilities in the region     were sending extra doctors and nurses to these areas    President Bush  September 15  2005  Reality   There were over 2 600 physicians in New Orleans before Katrina  Earlier this year  there were just 1 200 doctors    Today  New Orleans has vacancies for nearly 1 000 nurses  Health care workforce recruitment and retention remains a critical problem in most regions devastated by the Hurricanes    In the New Orleans area  health care experts estimate that  400 million in immediate federal assistance is needed to help keep hospitals  physicians  and nurses working    Most survivors of Hurricane Katrina have suffered from emotional and psychological trauma  Yet in August 2006  Louisiana continues to experience a critical shortage of facilities to treat people with mental health or substance use problems    The Louisiana Recovery Authority cites health worker shortages  health care workforce education  and graduate medical education as top priorities for rebuilding the health system destroyed by Hurricane Katrina  Yet the Administration proposed cutting funding for federal programs that help train new health professionals by 40  in 2007    Promise  We will not allow bureaucracy to get in the way of saving lives    President Bush  September 3  2005  Reality   Since Katrina  the number of uninsured living in St  Tammanys Parish in New Orleans has tripled  Yet in September 2005  the Administration blocked legislation that would have provided 5 months of temporary Medicaid coverage for Katrina survivors   In 2005  hospitals in Orleans lost  313 million from hurricane damage and uncompensated care to survivors of the disaster    The Administrations plan to provide Medicaid coverage for Katrina survivors in Louisiana was intended to help reimburse hospitals for uncompensated care  but its proven too inflexible for providers to actually access the appropriated funds    Baton Rouge hospitals have not been reimbursed for medical services provided to New Orleans evacuees  which has caused a strain on local medical systems    While the federal government received offers of much needed help from more than 100 medical schools nationwide  not a single academic centers contributions were ever employed by the Administration     Promise   This government will learn the lessons of Hurricane Katrina    President Bush  September 15  2005  Reality   Mississippis Health Department found communications and other supplies purchased through the HRSA Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness program and CDCs Public Health Preparedness grants to be vital during and after Katrina   but these programs have both been flat funded in the Presidents 2007 budget request  which amounts to a cut in funding given inflation     New Orleans Health Facilities Before and After Hurricane Katrina    Before  Six Months After Staffed inpatient beds 2 269 453 Safety net clinics 90 19 Physicians 2 664 1 200 Emergency Medical Services units 15 17 7 Nursing home providers 51 29 Nursing home beds 4 954 2 735      Katrina One Year Later Gulf Coast Workers Are Still At Risk   The working men and women of the Gulf Coast are being victimized again  FEMA failed the residents of the Gulf Coast during the storm and its aftermath  and now the Republican Congress and Department of Labor are failing workers during the reconstruction          Senator Edward M  Kennedy   Katrina evacuees are suffering from extremely high unemployment  According to the most recent data  for the 42  of evacuees who have not returned to their pre Katrina homes  the unemployment rate is 23     Katrina evacuees desperately need an extension of their unemployment benefits  which for many expired in early June  But the Republican leadership blocked a bipartisan proposal to give Katrina evacuees an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits  This refusal to provide Katrina survivors with a full year of unemployment benefits runs contrary to past practice during disasters and economic downturns  even though Katrina was the worst natural disaster in American history    Those Katrina survivors who have been able to return home are joining thousands of other workers who have flocked to the Gulf Coast region to join the reconstruction effort  Many are being exploited by unscrupulous employers  and the Department of Labor is allowing the abuses to continue    Gross violations of wage and hour laws  as well as health and safety standards  are rampant in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast region  At the same time  the Department of Labors enforcement efforts have been weak    An large number of workers are not being paid for their work or are being forced to work overtime and then not being paid overtime rates  A recent survey found that 60  of workers interviewed had experienced wage theft  Yet  the Department of Labor has pursued only about 300 charges against employers  and has resolved only about 100 of these cases    Workers are being subjected to extremely hazardous work conditions  including toxic mold and asbestos  without adequate workplace safety training  basic safety measures  or personal protective equipment    Contractors are suppressing complaints by threatening workers with retaliation if they speak up    Many of these reconstruction workers are among the most vulnerable in the workforce  undocumented laborers and low wage workers  with little enforcement of health and safety laws by the Department of Labor   Katrina One Year Later Housing and Basic Services   Hundreds of thousands of families displaced Katrina are still waiting to go home   Senator Edward M  Kennedy   Throughout the Gulf Coast  millions were displaced from their homes  and in New Orleans alone 160 000 homes and apartments were destroyed or suffered major damage   Source  Brookings Institution  August 2006    More than 450 000 people were initially displaced in greater New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina  and approximately 200 000 residents continue to be displaced from their homes    Source  NSF UC Berkeley Study  July 31  2006    Its estimated that homes of about 268 000 people  more than half of the citys population saw floodwaters higher than 4 feet after Katrina and the levees were breached   Source  RAND  January 2006     15 3 billion in claims by National Flood Insurance Program Policy Holders in the Gulf Coast have been paid out  However  62 849 damaged homes in the region are without flood insurance  with more than half of those households in Louisiana   Sources  FEMA 8 18 06 and FEMA Weekly Report 8 16 06    FEMA says it now has more than 112 000 occupied trailers in the Gulf Coast primarily in Louisiana and Mississippi but it cannot provide the numbers still waiting for trailers  However  news sources report that even though 10 000 trailers are being stored  in St  Bernard Parish alone there are 1 200 families have but do not have utilities and 400 more have no trailers at all   Sources  FEMA By the Numbers  8 23 06  AP  Thousands of Hurricane Victims Still Living in Trailers  Others Still Waiting August 20  2006     Until six months ago  there was no housing demolition or permit activity for repairs and renovations in New Orleans  Orleans and Jefferson Parish are now up to 300 demolitions total  and more robust activity can be seen in Plaquemines Parish  No data is available for St  Bernard Parish   Source  Brookings Institution  August 2006    Housing affordability is becoming a concern  With so many damaged or unlivable homes  families and workers are competing for limited available housing  Home prices and rent are rising  particularly in less damaged suburban areas  This will only get worse as more families and workers return to the region   Source  Brookings Institution  August 2006     17 billion in Community Development Block Grant money has been allocated to rebuild damaged housing and other critical infrastructure  Yet  only this week  Mississippi and Louisiana have had their plans for distributing up to  150 000 per household approved   Basic Services in New Orleans  The majority of key public services have not been restored and are functioning at less than half capacity  Source  Brookings Institution  August 2006    o Less than half of all bus and street car routes are running and only 17  of buses are in use  It has been this way since January 2006   o Gas service is back up in only 41  of homes and businesses  and electricity is up in 60  for those that had it prior to Katrina  Large sections of Lakeview and the Lower Ninth Ward remain without gas and electricity       Katrina One Year Later National Service Response   The national service community has been at the heart of the recovery efforts  yet the Administration and Republican Congress continue to cut and underfund their programs  Our first responders to national disasters  and those organizations focused on civic responsibility shouldn t be last in line for funding          Senator Edward M  Kennedy   National Service Response Fact Sheet   In coordination with the Red Cross  FEMA and state and local authorities  over 35 000 national service participantsincluding members of AmeriCorps  Learn  Serve America  National Civilian Community Corps  and Senior Corpshave provided service in response to the hurricanes     These national service volunteers have contributed over 1 6 million service hours and have leveraged almost 93 000 volunteers    Despite the impressive work done by these programs  the President and the Republican Congress have proposed major cuts    Members of the National Civilian Community Corps  NCCC  deployed to the Gulf within 24 hours of Katrina landfall and have been there ever since  Over 1 600 NCCC members have served on more than 100 separate disaster service projects in the Gulf Coast region  Yet  the Presidents budget cuts funds for NCCC by  20 million    Tens of thousands of students supported by Learn  Serve America have raised funds for hurricane relief  assembled disaster relief kits  and even traveled to the Gulf region to perform service projects  Yet  the Presidents budget slashes funds for Learn  Serve and provides only  34 million  These cuts will mean that 300 000 fewer students will be able to serve through Learn  Serve  there will be a loss of  34 million in leveraged private and community resources  and there will be a decline of 7 3 million service hours to communities    More than 70 grantee programs of AmeriCorps State and National  representing 2 300 AmeriCorps members  have provided relief and recovery assistance in the Gulf region  The Republican House of Representatives proposed funding this program at  218 million   40 million below the Presidents budget proposal and the Senate amount    Katrina One Year Later Federal Air and Reconstruction Efforts   Its now one year later and the suffering continues for families  with their homes and communities still in disarray  Congress has approved  110 billion in federal aid  but less than have of it has been used  Instead of devoting these resources to rebuilding the region and helping people rebuild their lives  the dollars are stuck in a maze of bureaucracy   Federal Aid   A total of  110 billion in Federal funding has been made available to the five Gulf Coast states impacted by Hurricanes Katrina  Rita  and Wilma  with an additional  8 billion in tax relief   Source  Brookings Institution  August 2006    To date  less than half of this amount has been spent and mostly on short term disaster relief and the National Flood Insurance Program   o In total   44 billion has been spent  and  70 billion obligated across all agencies and programs   o FEMA has spent over  21 billion and obligated  35 billion for the three Hurricanes combined and spent  17 billion and obligated  29 billion only for Katrina     Katrina One Year Later Levee Fact Sheet  It is one year later  and the New Orleans levees are no safer today than they were the day before Katrina hit   Senator Edward M  Kennedy    On June 1st  the US Army Corps of Engineers released its own study of what went wrong at the New Orleans Canals and admitted the devastation that the city suffered was due to the inadequate protection provided by the levees   Source  US Army Corps of Engineers Performance Evaluation of the New Orleans and Southeast Louisiana Hurricane Protection System    The Army Corps estimates that two thirds of flooding and losses in the city were the result of the failed levees   Source  US Army Corps of Engineers Performance Evaluation of the New Orleans and Southeast Louisiana Hurricane Protection System    Another National Science Foundation  UC Berkeley study found that while Hurricane Katrina was the root cause of the disaster  it became a full blown catastrophe primarily as a result of the massive and repeated failure of the regional flood protection system   Source  NSF UC Berkeley Study  July 31  2006    Experts are concerned that in addition to the inadequate protection of the levees in their current state  the disappearing coastal wetlands and rising sea levels necessitate greater protection   Source  Fortune  August 21  2006     Of the  110 billion dollars that Congress has made available for the response to Hurricane Katrina  only  300 million has been made available for coastal wetlands restoration     The Administration and the Republican Leadership in Congress only authorized the levees to be reconstructed to a Category 3 level as it was prior to Hurricane Katrina  Congress approved  5 billion for levee reconstruction    The U S Army Corps of Engineers is conducting a study to determine if it should be strengthened  It is not scheduled to be complete before June 2007        Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
