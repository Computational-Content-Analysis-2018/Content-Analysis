         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  As our nation begins its fifth year of the war in Iraq  its abundantly clear to  the American people that our current policy has failed  and that we need a new  policy that will better serve both our national security and our servicemen and  women President Bush continues to look for good news with a microscope    Despite his repeated claims that success is just around the corner  Iraq is  falling deeper and deeper into the chaos of civil war   Our troops are in the  untenable position of policing a nation at war with itself More than  3 200 American soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice  and more than 24 000  have been wounded during the four years of his failed policy Tens of  thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed  and nearly four million have been  displaced inside Iraq and across the region The insurgency is growing in  strength  and its lethal explosives are growing in  sophistication Attacks on American soldiers continue to  increase Militias are increasing their power  and their ability to  brutalize the Iraqi people is increasing as well No amount of American  military might can end Iraqs civil war  Only a political settlement by Iraqi  leaders and the Iraqi people can end the bloodshed and suffering  Rather  than fanning the flames of chaos by sending more U S  troops into Iraqs civil  war  its time for the President to begin to redeploy our troops out of harms  way      The war in Iraq has been a disastrous and deeply dangerous  debacle in American foreign policy  It has made America more hated in the world  than at any other time in our history    It has emboldened terrorists across the  globe   It has stretched our military to the breaking point   As a result  our  national security is increasingly at risk The Presidents policy of  escalating the war will not make success any more likely    It will only result  in more death and more tragedy for American soldiers  and it will undermine our  national security even further The American people have been patient    But America has now been in Iraq longer than it took us to win World War II    Instead of progress  we continue to see unacceptably high levels of violence   death  and destruction  The American military and the American people  deserve far better  The President seeks more funding for the war without strings  and without delay     Because the President stubbornly insists on  escalating the same failed strategy  Congress must stand up to the President and  stand up for our troops by requiring him to redeploy our combat forces out of  Iraq as soon as possible   We have an opportunity to do so on the Supplemental  Appropriations Bill that will soon be before us  and it is an opportunity we  cannot afford to miss                                                                   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202 224 2633
