         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Last night  the House of Representatives passed the Reconciliation bill that slashed funding in vital education and health care programs  The bill was full of misplaced Republican priorities  but one bill  the Family Opportunity Act  remained in tact and will now become law  One victory was secured for the American people  and countless families across the country will be able to stay together and out of poverty because the Family Opportunity Act will become law Kennedy and Senator Chuck Grassley are sponsors of the landmark legislation that addresses a critical need in allowing the parents of severely disabled children to go to work and earn above poverty wages without losing coverage for their children  Currently  parents of severely disabled children who work lose Medicaid eligibility for their disabled children if they have income and resources above the poverty level  So instead most are forced to turn down jobs  turn down raises  turn down overtime  and are unable to save money for the future of their children and family in order to keep their child from losing coverage  This measure would expand the options for states to offer Medicaid This action is a major step forward for the hundreds of thousands of families who have been denied opportunities so that their disabled children can get the care they need  Senator Kennedy said  The Family Opportunity Act will remove some of the barriers that prevent families from staying together and staying employed    while giving hope and freedom to those who deserve it most This measure builds on the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives legislation that helped disabled adults go to work without losing health coverage  It expands Medicaid options for States  allowing them to be able to offer Medicaid coverage to children with severe disabilities living in middle income families through a Medicaid buy in program  phased in over four years SUMMARY OF THE MAJOR PROVISIONS OFTHE FAMILY OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2005  also known as the Dylan Lee James Act PROBLEMThe National Health Interview Survey  NHIS  and current census data shows that 8  of children in this country have significant disabilities  many of whom do not have access to critical health care services they need  In order for these families to get needed health services for their children  many are forced to stay impoverished  become impoverished  put their children in out of home placements  or simply give up custody of their children      so that their child can maintain eligibility for health coverage through Medicaid  Many employer health plans and a number of CHIP SCHIP programs do not cover essential services that these children need to maintain and prevent deterioration of their health status  Medicaid can provide these comprehensive services In a 2003 survey of 20 states  families with special needs children report they are turning down jobs  turning down raises  turning down overtime  and are unable to save money for the future of their children and family      so that they can stay in the income bracket that qualifies their child for SSI and or Medicaid Currently  less than 4  of the 850 000 children receiving social security benefits leave the Social Security rolls due to increased family income  however many would if access to needed health services was available  More than half the States in this country are reporting increasing rates of families giving up custody of their children in order to secure needed health care services and supports The Family Opportunity Act of 2005 is intended to address the two greatest barriers preventing families from staying together and staying employed   1  lack of access to appropriate services  and  2  lack of access to the advocacy and assistance services they need to help cut the red tape to meeting their children s health care needs THE FAMILY OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2005Access to Health Care CoverageExpanding Medicaid Coverage Options  A new optional eligibility category will allow states to expand Medicaid coverage to children with disabilities up to age 18  who would be eligible for SSI disability benefits but for their income or resources  This option builds on previous reforms including the provision enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997  BBA  and the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 These provisions permit states to offer a Medicaid buy in for disabled children who would be eligible for SSI disability benefits but for their income  who are in families earning up to 300  of poverty   58 500  for a family of four  In order for a family to participate in the medicaid buy in for their disabled child or children  a state must require a parent to take employer offered insurance within the following guidelines   1  the employer offers family coverage under a group health plan  and  2  the employer contributes at least 50  of the total cost of the annual premium for the coverage  If such coverage is attained by the family  the state is required to reduce the premium charged for the buy in  in an amount that reasonably reflects the parent s premium contribution for private coverage for their child with a disability  Participating states may charge premiums up to the full cost of the premium as long as that premium does not exceed 5  of family incomes up to 200  of the poverty level and 71 2  of family incomes between 200 300  of the poverty  The state may waive payment of a premium in any case where the state determines that requiring a payment would create an undue hardship Alternatives to Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities for Children The bill provides funds for demonstration projects in ten States to examine the effectiveness of home  and community based alternatives to psychiatric residential treatment facilities for medicaid enrolled children Restoration of Medicaid Eligibility Restores only the Medicaid eligibility for children meeting the presumptive eligibility requirements under SSI without having to wait until the first day of the month following the establishment of eligibility Access to Health Information and ResourcesEstablishing Family to Family Health Information Centers  The bill provides funds for establishing health information centers to assist and support families of children with disabilities and special health care needs  These centers  staffed by both parents of children with special needs and professionals  would provide technical assistance and accurate information to other families on various health care programs and services available and appropriate for children with special needs  including identifying successful health delivery models  In addition  these centers would act as a resource to healthcare insurers  providers  and purchasers in developing ombudsman models for collaboration between families of children with special needs and health care professionals Program Phase InEligible children will be phased in over a four year period 0 6 year olds  2008 7 13 year olds  2009 14 18 year olds  2010The CBO cost estimate for the program is  872 million  5 yearsSENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY STATEMENT ON THE PASSAGE OF THE FAMILY OPPORTUNITY ACT of 2005Mr  President  as we all know  the Budget Reconciliation Act contains an appalling number of devastating cuts that will hurt millions of Americans  But I do commend the conferees for including the Family Opportunity Act  which will remove the barriers in current law that penalize families struggling to stay together and make ends meet when their children have high health costs because of disabilities For the past 6 years  Senator Grassley and I have worked with many parents and leaders in communities across the country to reach this milestone  Countless parents  family members  citizens  friends  neighbors  and colleagues face this problem today  As they make very clear  the nation is failing families with severely disabled children by not giving them access to the health care they need to stay home and live in their communities  Many of them have been on the front lines in raising the nation s awareness of their plight  and they ve been fearless and tireless warriors for justice  and this legislation could not have happened without them  Today  their long wait is nearly over The Family Opportunity Act is for them  It allows families of children with severe disabilities to purchase health care coverage under Medicaid  without first having to impoverish themselves or give up custody of their disabled children Almost one in ten children in America has significant disabilities  But many do not have access to even the most basic health care they need  because their private health insurance won t cover them  Often  their needs are treated as exclusions in their policies    no coverage for hearing aids  for services related to mental retardation  for physical therapy  for services at school  and on and on That is why this legislation is so important    these children will now have access to these needed services and have a genuine opportunity at least to achieve full potential When we think of disabled children  we tend to think of them as disabled from birth  But fewer than 10  of such children are born with their disabilities  A bicycle accident or a serious fall or illness can suddenly disable even the healthiest of children  Many of them with significant disabilities do not have access to even the most basic health services  because their families can t afford them No longer will these families be forced to become poor  stay poor  or even do the unthinkable by putting their children in institutions or giving up custody of them  so that their children can qualify for Medicaid Families of special needs children often have to turn down jobs  turn down raises  or turn down overtime pay to keep a child eligible for benefits under Medicaid No longer will parents be forced to give up their children or give up being part of our nation s economy This bill will change the life of 13 year old Alice in Oklahoma  who was disabled because of multiple dystrophy  Under this bill  she will be able to have a personal assistant living at home with her family  She ll be able to go to her neighborhood school This bill will change the life of Johnny in Indiana  who has a severe mental illness and needs numerous mental health therapies and drugs  His mother will no longer be forced to give up custody of him in order to obtain the treatment he needs  Her goal of being a productive citizen and keeping her son at home will no longer be denied    because her son will now have the health care and support he needs This bill will transform the life of Abby in Massachusetts  who is six years old and has multiple disabilities  Her parents are deeply concerned about her future if the existing buy in state program for Medicaid is weakened  Without the buy in  her parents would be bankrupted by her current medical bills  Now Abby and her family will have real opportunity to grow and work and prosper The legislation also gives states greater flexibility to enable children with mental health disabilities to obtain the health care they need in order to live at home and in their communities  instead of being placed in institutions It establishes Family to Family Information Centers in each state  to help parents find the resources they need to meet the unique health care requests of their disabled children Six years ago this week  President Clinton signed The Ticket to Work Act into law  That legislation demonstrates our commitment to give adults with disabilities the right to lead independent and productive lives  without giving up their health care Today we make the same commitment to children with disabilities and their families These provisions will undoubtedly be among the most important bills passed by this Senate  It closes the health care gap for the nation s most vulnerable population  and enables families of disabled children to be equal participants in the American dream  It will truly change lives  and I commend my colleagues in both the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle for their dedicated and their leadership that have made this day possible at long last   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
