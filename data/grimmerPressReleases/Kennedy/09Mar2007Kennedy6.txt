         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The report documents the FBIs grossly improper use of these sweeping  surveillance powers to comb apartment leases  credit reports  telephone records   and credit card records  Its up to Congress to end these abuses as soon as  possible  The PATRIOT Act was never intended to allow the Bush Administration  to violate fundamental constitutional rights  The new Democratic Congress will  make sure that this administration does not run roughshod over the provisions of  the law that protect all of us from intrusion We all agree that federal  law enforcement and intelligence officers should have the tools they need to  investigate terrorism and prevent future attacks  They also need authority to  share information with state and local law enforcement But the American  people deserve to know whether such authority is being used properly   When Congress re authorized the PATRIOT Act last year  we included a  provision to achieve greater transparency in the use of these powers by  requiring the Inspector General of the Justice Department to submit reports on  the use of two of the Acts most controversial provisions   Section 215  which  allows searches for business records  and Section 505  which authorizes National  Security Letters used to collect information in national security  investigations Its now clear from the Inspector Generals report that  our concerns were well founded    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
