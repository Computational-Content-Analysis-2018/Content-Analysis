         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent the below letter to  sixteen student loan lenders  It has come to the attention of Chairman Kennedy  that several large private lenders offering federally insured student loans may  be providing inappropriate compensation  favors or benefits to schools or school  administrators in exchange for preferential treatment  including placement on  so called preferred lender lists   Senator Kennedy issued the following  statement  When students take out loans to pay for college  they should  be assured that the relationship between their school and their lender is free  of bias or conflict of interest  A number of disturbing lender tactics have been  reported to us that raise serious questions about whether students best  interests are being served when lenders and schools establish relationships to  offer student loans   These include lenders who have offered school  administrators educational conferences at luxury hotels  free entertainment  and tickets to sporting events  free staff and printing services  and e mail  services to students on behalf of the financial aid office   These practices are  inappropriate  and they need to stop    My investigation aims to uncover the  facts concerning such inappropriate arrangements    March 21   2007 Dear XX  I am writing about information that has come to my  attention which raises concerns about the conduct of private lenders involved in  the federally guaranteed student loan program   Specifically  I am concerned  that several
