in 1969  and the large Irish American community was galvanized  Concern grew as British policy became more repressive  Senator Kennedy expressed his strong support for the goals of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association In 1970  Senator Kennedy delivered the bicentennial address at Trinity College in Dublin  condemning oppression in Northern Ireland  As the violence escalated  Senator Kennedy condemned the British policy of internment without trial in Northern Ireland  Senator Kennedy  Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut  and Representative Hugh Carey of New York introduced Senate and House resolutions calling for the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Northern Ireland  The January 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre of Catholic protesters by British troops in Derry  Northern Ireland generated strong reaction by Irish Americans against British policy in Northern Ireland Senator Kennedy called John Hume to find out what was going on  He told him he would like to talk to him about Northern Ireland and said he would be in Bonn in November for the NATO Assembly meeting  Hume flew to Bonn to meet him  They met for dinner on November 21st at the Irish Ambassadors residence in Bonn  In 1977  influenced by John Humes view that Americans should not send money for IRA guns  Senator Kennedy  Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  Speaker Tip ONeill  and Governor Hugh Carey of New York joined in a strong St Patricks Day message urging Irish Americans supporting moderation  dialogue and an end to the violence  The four were dubbed the Four Horseman   A photo montage of the four was created in 1981  using the legendary backfield of the 1924 Notre Dame football team   The St  Patricks Day statement became a way for Irish American leaders in Congress to annually urge action on Irish issues In August  acting on the initiative of Senator Kennedy and Speaker Tip ONeill  President Carter issued a strong statement on Northern Ireland  Kennedy called it the most important and constructive initiative ever taken by an American President on the Irish issue  The U S  statement appealed to all sides  including Irish Americans  not to support violence  It also promised additional U S  investment in Northern Ireland when a political solution is found In 1981  Kennedy  Moynihan and Speaker ONeill founded the Friends of Ireland in Congress to support initiatives for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland  Responding to the Anglo Irish Agreement of 1985  the Reagan Administration and Congress  led by Senator Kennedy and the Friends of Ireland  created the International Fund for Ireland  in fulfillment of President Carters 1977 pledge  The Fund continues to be used for job creation and encouraging peace and reconciliation  Working closely with Senator Alan Simpson  Senator Kennedy secured passage of the Immigration Act of 1990  a comprehensive overhaul of the law relating to legal immigrants  This Act  among other things  created the diversity visa program  which leveled the playing field by permitting the admission of immigrants from countries  such as Ireland  that had been short changed by existing lawsIn 1993  Irish Americans  led by Niall ODowd  the publisher of the Irish Voice newspaper  contacted Senator Kennedy  Mr  ODowd believed an end could be brought to IRA violence with the direct involvement of the United States  Senator Kennedy visited his sister Jean Kennedy Smith  American Ambassador  in Dublin over New Year s Eve 1993 94  During that trip  he met with many individuals critical to a potential peace process  including Taoiseach Albert Reynolds  who told him of his support for a visa for Gerry Adams  the leader of Sinn Fein  to visit the US  When he returned to the States  Senator Kennedy saw John Hume at the funeral of Speaker Tip O Neill in January  They arranged to meet for dinner that evening  Over dinner  Hume told Kennedy of his belief that Adams was committed to non violence  and persuasively expressed his support for a visa for Mr  Adams Senator Kennedy decided that a visa for Adams could help bring about an IRA cease fire and jump start the peace process  Shortly after he returned to the United States  he urged President Clinton to approve the visa  The U S  State Department  Justice Department  and the British government all opposed a visa for Mr  Adams On January 15 1994  Senator Kennedy initiated a bipartisan letter toPresident Clinton  signed by 42 members of Congress  urging the granting of a visa for Gerry Adams  calling it a rare opportunity for our country to contribute to peace in Northern Ireland  Before the visa was granted about two weeks later  more than 50 Members had signed on to express their support for the letter Senator Kennedy continued to work with the White House and the Presidents National Security Council on the issue  President Clinton granted Mr  Adams the visa and  in August 1994  the IRA called an historic cease fire  an event that Mr  Adams has said would not have transpired had he not been granted the visa  Six weeks later  Protestant paramilitaries announced their own cease fire When the IRA cease fire was broken early in 1996  Senator Kennedy worked to re instate it  He made efforts to reach out to the leaders of both the Unionist and Nationalist communities and maintain the hope for peace Decisive changes of leadership occurred in May 1997  when Tony Blair led his Labour Party to victory in the United Kingdom  and in June 1997  when Bertie Ahern returned Fianna Fail to power in Ireland  Both leaders were committed to moving the peace process forward  and peace talks resumed in June  In July  the IRA restored its cease fire  and Sinn Fein was invited to the talks in August  Senator Kennedy visited Northern Ireland for the first time in January 1998  meeting with both Unionists and Nationalists in Belfast and Derry  The inclusive peace talks  chaired by former Senator George Mitchell  led to the Good Friday Peace Agreement in April  the most promising opportunity for lasting peace in the three decade old conflict in Northern Ireland Senator Kennedy has encouraged the decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons  demilitarization in Northern Ireland  and advances in the equality agenda guaranteed by the Good Friday Agreement  Since the Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended  Senator Kennedy has worked with the leaders in Northern Ireland for it to be reinstated In response to legislation passed by the House of Commons on theImplementation of the Patten Commission recommendations  Senator Kennedy introduced a resolution in the Senate on police reform  calling for the full and speedy implementation of the recommendations of the Patten Commission  In an October 2000 editorial for the Washington Post  Senator Kennedy expressed his concerns that the most significant reforms recommended by Patten were not adequately included in the implementing legislation Senator Kennedy has been a steady voice calling for all paramilitaries in Northern Ireland to get rid of their weapons and to abandon crime On St  Patricks Day 2005  Senator Kennedy met with the sisters of Robert McCartney  who was murdered in Belfast by members of the IRA  Kennedy has urged cooperation with and support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland As the only significant elected party with a paramilitary wing in Northern Ireland  Kennedy consistently argued that Sinn Fein had a unique responsibility to take the gun and criminality out of politics once and for all  His consistently tough message  coupled with a decision not to see Gerry Adams on St  Patricks Day in 2005  contributed to the decision of the IRA to disarm in September of 2005 Senator Kennedy annually leads support in the Senate for an appropriation for the George J  Mitchell Scholarship program  which annually sends future American leaders to study in Ireland and Northern Ireland for a year of post graduate study Senator Kennedy will continue to meet with the political leaders of the Northern Ireland to ensure that progress will continue      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
