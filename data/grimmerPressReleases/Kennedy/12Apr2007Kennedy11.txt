         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   As prepared for delivery     When the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act was first considered by the Committee  I opposed it  I continue to oppose it  because I feel it actually undermines the safety of our communities  endangers our police officers  and interferes with the essential role of police departments across the nation   Unfortunately  this years bill fails to correct the serious problems of the original law   It makes matters worse  by haphazardly putting more guns on the streets        The officers who put their lives on the line for us deserve respect and protection themselves in our communities   I have yet to hear a detailed explanation of why this bill is necessary   The original Act took away the ability of state and local police departments to enforce rules and policies on when and how their own officers can carry weapons   If there is going to be a change in the Act  we should be giving back to local police the power to run their own departments   Every community in this country is different   Yet the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act treats them as if they were all the same   Under this law  a local police department no longer has the ability to deny a concealed carry permit   In fact  this bill further undermines local law enforcement by reducing the number of years a person must spend as a law enforcement officer before they can obtain a permit   Local law enforcement agencies need the right to control who can carry a concealed weapon in their jurisdiction   Yet  this bill lowers the standard so that individuals with only 10 years of duty  rather than 15  can carry a concealed weapon  By reducing the standard to 10 years  the measure drastically expands the number of retired law enforcement officers who can carry a concealed weapon   No one  however  seems to be able to answer the basic question of how many officers that will include   Such rash changes     without any empirical demonstration of a need to change the law    coupled with the lack of hearings on the bill  is dangerous and irresponsible   This change makes absolutely no sense and there is no explanation for it   Police departments train their officers to respond as a team   Such teamwork takes time and understanding to develop   Injecting an armed  unknown officer who is working on different assumptions can turn a dangerous situation into a deadly one   The idea that this law would prevent more crimes because more concealed weapons are being carried by less trained and less regulated out of state  off duty  and retired officers is ridiculous   There is no justification for making it easier for retired law enforcement officers to override gun safety laws   This bill does not require a showing of need for a concealed weapon   It does not even draw a distinction between officers who served ably and those who did not   Officers who retired while under investigation for domestic violence  racial profiling  use of excessive force  or alcohol or substance abuse could still qualify for the broad concealed carry authority under the Act   There is no evidence that this law is necessary to protect retired law enforcement officers There are many sensible things Congress can do to protect citizens from gun violence   In 2004  we moved in the wrong direction by enacting the original concealed carry bill and taking away the ability of States to decide the needs of its communities in terms of who should carry a concealed weapon   Each State should be able to make its own judgment about whether private citizens can carry concealed weapons and the standards for when active or former law enforcement officers should be able to carry such weapons   There is no reason for Congress to override gun safety measures in any State   Rather than putting even more guns in the streets  we should be making the current law safer   One way to do so would be a requirement that all police departments report who can carry a concealed weapon   How can a local police officer verify when an out of state officer has a license under the Act   There is currently no way of knowing  because there is no uniform way of identifying who can lawfully carry a concealed weapon under the Act   In addition to undermining the discretion of state and local law enforcement departments  this legislation is an insult to our public safety   Under the law  there is already dangerous ambiguity and uncertainty when a police officer stops someone carrying a concealed weapon   If the person claims permission to carry a concealed gun under the law  our police on the street have no way to verify the claim   Asking GAO to submit a report on how the law has been implemented is another simple step we could take to help make this law safer instead of more dangerous     It is understandable that members of the Senate want to take steps to protect Americas law enforcement officers   We all do   But by increasing the number of concealed weapons in our communities  well see more tragic incidents   Instead of Congress recklessly enacting a bill to put even more guns on the street  we should find acceptable ways for state and local governments to do the job  consistent with their own needs and circumstances   This one size fits all  Congress knows best attitude  is a tragic mistake for countless communities across America        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
