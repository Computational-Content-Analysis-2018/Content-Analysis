         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senate and House Democrats denounced Congressional Republicans  commitment to a voter identification requirement bill that would disproportionately impact the ability of minorities to vote  Senators Edward Kennedy  Christopher Dodd  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  House Democratic Caucus Chairman James Clyburn  and Congresswoman Linda Snchez spoke about the negative effects of the voter I D  requirement on American democracy and voters in their communities    Last week  House Republicans approved legislation that would place an undue burden on the voting rights of every American  The so called Federal Election Integrity Act  H R  4844  would require any individual who desires to register and vote in a federal election to purchase government issued identification  Such a requirement could create a hardship on minority communities  the elderly  students  persons with disabilities  and members of various religious faiths  The burdensome and costly requirements of obtaining government documents not only could prevent many eligible voters from participating  but they also suggest to the American people that supporters of this legislation are trying to gain political advantage in future elections  Worst of all  this bill recalls a dark era in our nation when individuals were required to pay a poll tax to cast their ballot and has been termed a 21st Century poll tax   Instead of fixing the election problems that thousands of Americans have experienced first hand  House Republicans have forced through a partisan bill that undercuts the integrity of our election process  We need real election reform like the Count Every Vote Act to take practical steps to build a stronger democracy that is better defended against abuse  fraud and politics  said Senator Clinton   When I came to Congress I took an oath to defend and uphold the Constitution which protects every American citizens fundamental right to vote  Clyburn said  That right was fortified over 40 years ago with the Voting Rights Act  Yet on the heels of renewal of the VRA Republicans in the House jammed through a divisive and destructive bill last week which would disenfranchise many of the very citizens that the VRA is designed to protect  I stand with my colleagues in the Senate to denounce HR 4844 and defend the principles of this great nation   This 21st Century Poll Tax is a Republican campaign stunt  designed to distract attention from their long record of inaction and incompetence on issues like the unending violence in Iraq  the economic strain on the middle class  and the lack of affordable health care  Snchez said  They prefer to block the voting booth for U S  citizens than address the problems that really affect families in our communities   Our nation should be moving forward to help all Americans participate in our democracy  And forcing people to pay what amounts to a poll tax is not only outrageous and wrong but a giant leap backwards  said Dodd  All of us want to ensure that elections are free from voter irregularities  But enacting laws that effectively allow some people to vote while throwing roadblocks in front of others is absolutely unacceptable  I intend to forcefully fight any effort to reverse years of progress made to ensure that all eligible Americans have an equal opportunity to case a vote and have that vote counted   Poll taxes are unfair  undemocratic  and unconstitutional  Senator Kennedy said  I fought hard when we tried to end poll taxes in 1965  and I m not going to see the Senate enact them in 2006  I say we leave poll taxes in the last century where they belong      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
