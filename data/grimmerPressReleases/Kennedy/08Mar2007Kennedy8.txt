         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I welcome the members of our committee and our distinguished witnesses to  todays hearing on the important question of whether Congress should give FDA  the authority to approve follow on versions of biologic  medicines We are in a remarkable period of discovery in the  life sciences  Unprecedented advances are taking place  and patients have  already begun to see the benefits of this new era through new wonder drugs that  can make the difference between life and death for patients afflicted with  serious illnesses Patients with leukemia who once faced a  bleak future now have new hope  thanks to an extraordinary new medicine that can  slow or even halt the progression of the disease Until  recently  a diagnosis of Gauchers  go SHAYS  Disease meant a shorter life   full of disability and pain for the people it afflicted  Now  a remarkable  breakthrough has produced drugs to treat this grave illness and extend life and  reduce disability Similarly  a drug to stimulate the  production of new blood cells is helping patients counteract the severe anemia  caused by chemotherapy or renal disease  These miracle  medicines  called biologics  are complex molecules whose healing power has been  brought to patients by dynamic biotechnology companies  Such drugs were once a  rarity in the medical arsenal  but each day seems to bring new hope from new  breakthrough biologics With this extraordinary progress  comes a challenge to public policy  Due to the cost of developing and  manufacturing new biologics  their price is often steep  They can cost patients  tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year  putting an extraordinary  strain on the budgets of those who must pay the bills patients  insurers and  companies  or government programs Congress has faced  similar challenges before  In the early 1980 s  the cost of prescription drugs  was spiraling upward  In response  Congress enacted legislation that balanced  the need to reduce costs for consumers through increased competition with the  requirement to promote innovation  That legislation is known universally by the  names of its sponsors  Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Henry Waxman  Our  committee is honored that Senator Hatch is helping guide our deliberations   Congress and the American people are indebted to his leadership on these  important issues When the Hatch Waxman law was enacted   Congress did not include biologics  because at the time such drugs were not  providing the major innovations that advances in the biological sciences have  brought over the past 20 years  Now Congress must consider  whether to authorize FDA to accept applications for follow on versions of these  path breaking medicines  The stakes riding on  the answer to this question are enormous  both for patients and for our economy   and the interest among our committee colleagues in this question is intense   One of our colleagues  Senator Clinton  has a proposal to allow FDA to approve  follow on biologics  I look forward to hearing her views on this question  and  to receiving the testimony of the legislations co sponsor  Senator  Schumer Many have recommended that the committees  legislation on drug safety and user fees should include a proposal to allow for  follow on biologics  Todays hearing will help to provide the information the  committee needs to make the right decision on that important question   Our committee should be guided by three basic  principles First  we must be led by science  Acceptable  legislation on follow on biologics must not pre judge science  but should enable  the FDA to make the best decisions based on the most complete science reasonably  available Second  protecting patient safety is essential   Congress must make certain that any drug given to patients  whether a  conventional drug  an innovative biologic  or a follow on product  is safe and  effective Third  innovation must be valued and promoted   Just as it is essential to help patients afford the medicines of today  so too  it is vital to provide incentives for the innovations that will bring the  medical miracles of tomorrow  I look forward to the  recommendations and insights of our distinguished witnesses to provide guidance  to our committee as we undertake these important deliberations   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
