         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on North Korea    With North Korea s provocative test last night  the world became a far more dangerous place  The Security Council should respond quickly and decisively to this act  And it is abundantly clear that the administration must go into diplomatic overdrive  working 24 7 with our allies in the region and the world to advance an effective response and prevent further North Korean tests    Our overarching interests are to diffuse the crisis  prevent additional tests and a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula  and ensure that North Korea does not provide nuclear weapons or technology to terrorists who seek to harm America    The last thing the world needs is for this nuclear crisis to spiral further out of control    Laura Capps Melissa   202  224 2633
