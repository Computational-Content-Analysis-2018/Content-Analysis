         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  these have not been easy times for vast numbers of Americans  In many ways  the American dream is in peril for millions of our fellow citizens as global forces have caused the economy to shift against them  Complacency is not the answer  Few things more affect the way we live than our shrinking and rapidly changing world  Unless we begin to address this immense challenge more effectively  the Nation will pay a high price for years and years to come  Now is the right time to reinvest in Americas future  which is why I am today introducing the Right TRACK Act  American families across the Nation know the problem  It is measured in jobs moving overseas  stagnant or even falling wages and benefits  our schools losing ground compared to other nations  and fewer opportunities to attain the American dream  Indeed  the course we are on today is a course that will make the American dream the impossible dream  America cannot move forward if we cut back on investments in education  invention  and innovation  as the administration has proposed  We cannot compete in the world if our companies and our workers are saddled with soaring costs for health care  We cannot advance if we fail to invest in our own employees by paying them a decent wage  by taking steps to enable companies to keep jobs here at home  and by investing wisely in our own economic growth  The 20th century was widely hailed as the American century  but the 21st century is up for grabs  No nation is guaranteed a future of lasting prosperity  We have to work for it  We have to sacrifice for it  We have a choice  We can continue to be buffeted by the harsh winds of the global economy or we can think anew and guide the currents of globalization with a new progressive vision that strengthens America and equips our citizens to move confidently to the future  Competing better in a race to the bottom is not the answer  Equality of opportunitya bedrock principle of our democracyis suffering already  Today  children born of parents in the bottom 20 percent of income have only a 1 in 15 chance of reaching the top 20 percent in their lifetimes  Also disturbing is the fact that those born in the middle are more likely to sink to the bottom than to rise to the top  And those born at the top are likely to stay at the top  We cannot and should not compete by lowering wages  Instead  we must open new doors and new avenues for all Americans to make the most of their God given talents and rekindle the fires of innovation in our society  By doing so  we can turn this era of globalization into a new era of opportunity for America  As Thomas Jefferson said  Every generation needs a new revolution  And I believe the revolution for this generation is to master our own destiny in the new global economy  What is most required is a new vision for Americas future in the global community  Our goal is to rekindle the American Dream  so that if people work hard and play by the rules  they can succeed in life  be better off than their parents  live in good neighborhoods  raise strong families in safe surroundings  work in decent jobs with decent pay and decent benefits and a decent retirement  To do all that  we must make a commitment to lifelong education  to prepare every man  woman  and child for the new world of intensifying competition and increasingly sophisticated technologies  We must create high quality jobs for the years ahead by investing in research and development  encouraging innovation  and modernizing all aspects of our infrastructure  We must level the playing field for American businesses and employees  to ensure fair worldwide competition and preserve good jobs in the United States     And we must make a fair commitment to assist and care for workers and communities harmed by the forces of globalization     We can do all that  but only if we make the right choices  and the time to start is now  I strongly believe that our highest priority must be a world class education for every American  We must seek a future where America competes with other nations  not by reducing our employees pay and outsourcing their jobs but by raising their skills  As a Nation  we must invest in Americans by ensuring access to the highest quality educational opportunities  We must make the American worker and manager the best educated  best trained  and most capable in the world  We need to nourish the capacities of every person in the nation  To do that  we must begin in the earliest years  Research proves conclusively that what we do for childrens early education and development does more to ensure their later success in school than any other investment we can make  It is far less costly to society to spend millions to put young children on the right track from the start  instead of spending billions to rescue them from the wrong track later  In fact  one study concludes that in the long run  we save  13 for every dollar invested in the early education of our youngest citizens  Prevention works in health care  and it can work in education too  For generations  we have treated education as a three legged stoolelementary and middle school  high school  and college  To create a solid foundation for the future  we have to add a fourth legearly childhood education  In elementary and secondary education  the No Child Left Behind Act was a pioneering reform that held great promise when it was signed into law by President Bush 4 years ago  Page S1649  No Child Left Behind was not just an abstract goal  It was a moral commitment to every parent and every child and every school in America  and I was proud to stand with President Bush when he signed it  It soon became clear  however  that to the administration  it was more a slogan than a promise  Too many parents  too many children  too many schools are still waiting for the help we pledged  We cant reform education without the resources needed to pay for the reforms  Promises alone wont provide the qualified teachers  high standards in every classroom  good afterschool activities  and the range of supplemental services that every good school needs if it is to provide the right help for students who need it  No Child Left Behind was also a promise that every child countsBlack or White or Brown  rich or poor  It was a promise that disabled children too will have the qualified teachers and individual support they need to succeed in school and in life  We must also do more to help students prepare for college  afford college  be admitted to college and complete college  In 1950  when I graduated from school  only 15 percent of jobs required some postsecondary training  Today  the number is over 60 percent and rising rapidly  However  we are witnessing a growing gulf in college attendance between the rich and poor  The gap is shameful  Each year  400 000 college ready students dont attend a 4 year college because they cant afford it  Never before has the financial challenge of attending college been greater for young students  It is time for America to agree that cost must never be a barrier to college education  Every child in America should be offered a contract  when they reach eighth grade  making clear that if they work hard  finish high school  and are accepted for college  we will guarantee them the cost of earning a degree  The Right TRACK Act authorizes Federal grants to States to support the creation of Contract for Educational Opportunity grants to cover students unmet need up to the cost of attendance at 2 year and 4 year public colleges in that State  Perhaps nowhere is it more obvious that we are falling behind than in math and science  For a nation that prides itself on innovation and discovery  the downward slide is shocking  In recent years  we have dropped to 28th in the industrial world in math education  Each year  China graduates three times as many engineers as we do  Other nations are gaining on us because they give higher priority to education  The last time America was shocked into realizing we were unacceptably behind in math and science was in 1958  when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik  Republican President Eisenhower and a Democratic Congress responded by passing the National Defense Education Act  and almost overnight we doubled the Federal investment in education  In fact  throughout our history  we have remade American education to conquer the challenges of each time  In the mid 1800s  with the Industrial Revolution in full swing  we created free and mandatory public schools before most other nations did  And to stay ahead  we rapidly established public high schools at the start of the last century to keep pace with a growing economy  Once again  we did something comparable at the end of World War II  We passed the GI Bill of Rights and gave every returning veteran the chance for a college education  The Nation reaped a  7 return for every dollar it invested in their education  The result was the greatest generation  and it would never have happened without the GI bill  That is the kind of initiative we need today  because the need is just as great  We need a new Education Bill of Rights  a new National Defense Education Act  for our own day and generation in science and math     Lets make college free for students training to become math or science teachers     Lets make college and graduate school free for low  and middle income math and science students  Lets see that our standards are internationally competitive  so that our high school graduates can succeed in this new economy  Lets offer incentives and other support for schools to develop and implement rigorous standards and courses in math and science  The Right TRACK Act responds to each of these challenges  The legislation provides grants to low  and middle income students studying in science  technology  engineering  and math fields  as well as critical need foreign languages  The bill provides larger grants to students studying to become teachers in these fields who agree to work in a high poverty school for at least 4 years  It also provides teachers with tax credits  increased loan forgiveness as additional incentives to continue to teach where they are needed the most and invests in teacher training programs supporting their continuing education  The Right TRACK Act also provides resources to states to create P 16 Preparedness Councils to help States with their efforts to improve State standards and ensure that they are aligned with the expectations of colleges  employers  and the armed services  The bill also provides funding to States working in collaboration to establish common standards and assessments  The bill also directs resources to high need schools so they can invest in math  science  engineering  and technology textbooks and laboratories to ensure their students have equal access to a curriculum that will provide them with the skills they need to be successful in the 21st century global economy  It is becoming increasingly important for students to become exposed to and immersed in other languages and cultures  In recent years  foreign language needs have significantly increased throughout the public and private sector due to the presence of a wider range of security threats  the emergence of new nation states  and the globalization of the U S  economy  American businesses increasingly need employees experienced in foreign languages and international cultures to manage a culturally diverse workforce  Foreign language proficiency is a consideration in 44 percent of hiring decisions and 66 percent of retention decisions  Currently  the U S  Government requires 34 000 employees with foreign language skills in 100 languages across more than 80 Federal agencies  The Right TRACK Act responds to these needs by providing grants for elementary and secondary critical need language programs  summer institutes to improve teachers knowledge and instruction of foreign languages and international content  and study abroad and foreign language study opportunities for high school students  undergraduate  and graduate students  We must also continue to invest in our current workforce  The Right TRACK Act builds on existing formula funds for job training with competitive grants to support innovative strategies to meet emerging labor market needs  From our earliest days as a nation  education has been the engine of the American dream  Our country is home to the greatest universities in the world  and our education system has produced the worlds leading scientists  writers  musicians  and inventors  We cannot let these achievements stall now  Slogans arent strong enough  We have to put first things first and give children  parents  schools  communities and States the support they need to refuel the amazing engine of education and keep our country great in the years ahead  Beyond education  we must recognize that the foundation of our prosperity in this global world is to remain on the cutting edge of technology and medical and scientific breakthroughs in the years ahead and translate those advances into reliable products and services  A strong and fully developed infrastructure will provide the backbone for that success  America has always been a world leader in research and development  but we can no longer take our success for granted  Even in highly skilled industries  where our technology and infrastructure have preserved our competitive advantage we are increasingly at risk today  Rapidly growing economies in Asia  Eastern Europe  and South America are now formidable competitors  developing their economies into engines of growth based not just on low wages but on well educated citizens  advanced infrastructure  and well run businesses  In Bangalore  India  a G E  center employs more than 2 200 Ph D s  These workers are not sewing buttons on shirts  they are carrying out advanced research on jet engines and developing mathematical models for investment  An Intel research and development center in the same city employs 3 000 engineers designing the next generation of computer chips  Page S1650  However  despite increasing international competition  the Federal commitment to research outside the defense arena has declined under the Bush administration  Of particular concern is the drop in funding for basic research  Much of the research conducted by private companies is focused on getting a product quickly to market  That is not the basic research that lays new foundations for new discoveries  Funding for basic research has declined in the past few years at the National Institutes of Health  the National Science Foundation  the Department of Energy  and other key scientific agencies  And overall the Federal investment in research which once exceeded one percent of our GDP is now less than half a percent  We cannot allow this trend to continue  The Right TRACK Act will help America maintain its position as the leader in innovation  The Right TRACK Act will not only make the RD credit permanent but expand it to encourage small businesses  universities  and Federal laboratories to collaborate on research  And it will increase RD funding for major Federal research agencies by 10 percent that we double it in 7 years  Innovation is important for its own sake  but it is also what creates jobs  We are currently seeing our investment in RD paying dividends in high growth  high technology industries such as nanotechnology  We need to help usher these new technologies out of the laboratory and into the marketplace  The Right TRACK Act would encourage investment in nanotechnology businesses and increase support for critical programs at the Department of Commerce that help manufacturers adopt and commercialize new technologies  We also must invest in innovation and infrastructurehighways  mass transit  new sources of clean energy  health I T   and more  The Right TRACK Act will authorize funds for capital improvements to Amtrak and expands and increases tax credits for school renovation and construction that will equip schools with 21st century technology  These investments not only improve the quality of our lives  but they also create the quality jobs that drive our economy forward  Broadband infrastructure is a perfect example  Two years ago  President Bush declared that every American should have access to affordable broadband technology by the year 2007  But the administration still has no plan to get us there  In the meantime  we have fallen to 16th in the world in broadband access behind countries such as Japan and the Netherlands that have broadband speeds four and five times faster than ours  Widespread use of basic broadband would add  500 billion to our economy and create 1 2 million jobs  Clearly  this is the kind of infrastructure we should invest in to produce good jobs and economic growth in the future  The Right TRACK Act also puts us on the right track to take full advantage of that economic opportunity  We also live in an age exploding with medical miracles  A generation ago  few could possibly have imagined the advances in science and biology that have revolutionized the practice of medicine  No one today can predict how new discoveries in the life sciences will improve our lives and change the world  but we can be certain the effects will be profound  Thanks to the genius and dedication of scientists  doctors  and business leaders  the potential of medical research is virtually limitless  Diagnosing a faulty heart valve or blocked artery once meant risky and traumatic exploratory surgery  Today  doctors make the diagnosis with a miniature camera and fiber optic cable  and the patient can walk out of the office moments later  A few years ago  it seemed inconceivable that anyone could decipher the entire genetic codethe very blueprint of life  But today  doctors across the globe can read that sequence on their computer screens and use the information to search for new ways to treat cancer  diabetes  Alzheimers  Parkinsons and other major illnesses  Continuing at the forefront of the life sciences may well be the most important way for America to retain its leadership in the world economy in the coming years  Another of the fundamental challenges of the global economy is that our companies are losing business and our people are losing jobs because they are not competing on a level playing field  Foreign governments manipulate their currencies to give their products an unfair advantage  They refuse to enforce basic labor protections like a minimum wage  They use abhorrent practices like child labor and forced labor  As a result  these countries can produce goods much more cheaply and dominate the global marketplace  Our own trade deficit is skyrocketing because we are producing less at home and buying more from other nations  Last year  we imported a record  726 billion more than we exportedan alltime high  We cant continue down this reckless path  It is too damaging to our economy  Over  2 2 trillion of our national debt today is owed to foreign investors and foreign governments  America has always controlled its own destiny but when foreigners are bankrolling our Government  our destiny is no longer in our hands  It is not just our companies that sufferour workers are also struggling because the playing field is so uneven  More and more of our companies are shipping U S  jobs overseas  Fifty four percent of Americas top companies have already done so  Even governments are part of the offshoring bandwagon  In my home State of Massachusetts  the State government has hired contractors that used workers from India to process Medicaid data and answer questions about food stamps  The Nation as a whole has lost nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs since 2001  The pain is widespread48 States have lost manufacturing jobs under President Bush  These are not just blue collar jobs  Millions of high paying  white collar jobs are also at risk of being shipped overseas  especially in the fields of medicine and computers  The disappearance of these good jobs is reducing our standard of living and threatening the very existence of the American middle class  President Bushs so called economic recovery has the worst job creation record of any recovery since World War II  Those fortunate enough to have jobs are finding that their wages are stagnant even though other costs are soaring  College tuition is up 46 percent since 2001  Housing costs are up 49 percent  Health insurance is up 58 percent  Gasoline is  2 33 a gallon40 percent higher than it was 5 years ago  The foundation of the America dream is weakening  That is because more of what our economy produces in this recovery now goes to business profits and executive suite salaries  and less to employees  than at any time since such records began in 1929  Wages are down  but profits are up by more than 60 percent     There is a better way  We need policies that reject the Walmart ization of the American workforce  We must level the playing field in the competition for good jobs and demonstrate leadership in promoting fair wages for workers around the world  This is not just an economic issueit is a moral issue  The Right TRACK Act will help raise living standards worldwide by prioritizing the elimination of forced labor and child labor in U S  trade agreements and providing incentives for multinational corporations to treat their foreign workers with respect  It will also level the playing field for American businesses by ensuring that countries cannot manipulate their currencies to give their goods an unfair advantage in the global market  Rejecting the race to the bottom also means reaffirming our commitment to workers here at home  We must stop rewarding companies by giving them favorable tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas  The Right TRACK Act corrects this nonsensical policy by eliminating the tax loophole that allows companies to avoid paying taxes on money they have earned overseas  The act also addresses the offshoring epidemic by requiring companies to give workers better notice when their jobs could be offshored to other countries and ensuring that the Government does not use hard earned tax dollars to ship jobs overseas  Page S1651  Our commitment to workers at home also demands that we give them their fair share of the economic growth that globalization brings  In this century  just as in the last  we must ensure that workers can organize and have a voice at work  The Right TRACK Act preserves the basic rights of American workers by protecting employees who try to organize from employer intimidation  supporting the democratic right of a majority of workers to choose a representative through fair and neutral card check procedures  and requiring employers to come to the table and negotiate a first contract  We owe a particular duty to those Americans who lose their jobs due to the effects of trade or economic downturns  When workers lose their jobs in the global economy  we should help in the difficult and painful transition to new employment with top notch job training and income assistance for their families until they get another paycheck  The Right TRACK Act gives workers and communities harmed by trade the support they deserve  It expands the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program to include service workers and workers who lose their jobs due to increased trade with countries like China and India  It also improves funding levels for training programs  provides wage insurance for older workers who lose their jobs  and helps workers to retain their health care coverage during times of transition  And it is a scandal that the minimum wage has been stuck at  5 15 an hour for the past 9 years  below the poverty line for a family of three  It is the lowest the minimum wage has been in real value in more than 50 years  How can so many Republicans in Congress keep voting against any increase  Why cant we all at least agree that no one who works for a living in America should have to live in poverty  The Right TRACK Act gives these hardworking Americans a long overdue raise by increasing the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps  America has to rise to each and every dimension of this challenge  We can do it by creating a new culture of innovation and creativity that keeps our Nation in the lead in the global market placeby equipping every American to compete and win in the new global economy  Only then will our economy continue to grow and prosper  Only then will the good jobs of the future be made in the U S A  The same can do spirit of innovation  invention  and progress that brought us the automobile  the airplane  and the computer can do it again  Those advances brought the American dream closer for all  and we cant afford to let it slip away now  The essence of the American dream is the ability to provide a better life for yourself and your family  At its very heart are a good job  first class education  good health care  and a secure retirement  Some say the dream is out of reach in todays global economy  But I am here today to tell you it doesnt have to be that way  We can revitalize the American dream  I have full confidence in our ability to meet these challenges and reach new heights of discovery prosperity  and progress  Passing the Right TRACK Act that Ive introduced today is an important step towards ensuring that the American dream remains attainable for generations to come  and I urge my colleagues to support it
