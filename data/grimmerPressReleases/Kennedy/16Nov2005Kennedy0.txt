         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy honored Stephen Bradberry  an advocate for the poor from Louisiana  with the Robert F  Kennedy Human Rights Award  The event will celebrate the life and legacy of his brother  Robert F  Kennedy on what would be his 80th birthday  The ceremony featured Mrs  Robert F  Kennedy and historian Douglas Brinkley and speeches by Senator Edward Kennedy and Senator Barack Obama     For the first time ever the RFK Human Rights award was given to an American for his work fighting poverty in the South  Stephen Bradberry  the Lead Organizer of the New Orleans chapter of ACORN was given this honor for his work advocating on behalf of New Orleans  working poor community  Today s award ceremony marks the beginning of a long term partnership between Mr  Bradberry and the RFK Center for Human Rights that will put the rights of low income families on the national agenda     The violent winds and flood tore away the mask that has long concealed the silent slavery of poverty in so much of our society  Katrina showed how long a journey we still have to make to live up to America s promise  For a new generation of Americans who did not live through the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War or Watergate    Katrina was their American apocalypse  But new young leaders like Stephen Bradberry understand that the darkest time often comes just before a dawn  Senator Kennedy said  Bobby would be very proud of the work Stephen is doing to carry on his unfinished work  and to help all those living in even the deepest shadows  about whom he cared so much    Bradberry has been pushing for years for the structural improvements that would have protected the city from the catastrophic results that have followed in the wake of Hurricane Katrina  He spoke about how the tragic outcome was as much a human made as natural disaster  the lack of government investment in levees and wetlands that could protect the city  inadequate evacuation of residents reliant on public transit  tension between law enforcement and low income communities and communities of color because of complex historical issues  and extremely high poverty rates that prevented tens of thousands of people from being able to protect themselves    these are just some of the social  political and economic conditions that led to the current crisis we are facing     According to Bradberry  unless low income people demand and win a real voice in the city s rebuilding  these same issues will continue to make our communities vulnerable to the same type of devastation  He warns that healthcare  quality education and other vital issues that low income families struggled with before will continue to be issues as the city rebuilds    Following are Senator Kennedy s remarks at today s ceremony     REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY  PRESENTATION OF THE 2005 RFK HUMAN RIGHTS AWARD TO STEPHEN BRADBERRY OF NEW ORLEANS  As Prepared for Delivery    Thank you so much  Doug Brinkley  for that warm introduction  We re honored you could be here today to share in this special moment    It s a privilege to be here with all of you today  and I thank you all for coming  We re very proud of Ethel  Kerry  and everyone else at the Memorial for their extraordinary leadership and commitment in carrying on Bobby s ideals  and we re grateful to the judges as well  who have given their time so generously in selecting this year s honoree    This Sunday  November 20th  would have been Bobby s 80th birthday  I know my brother would be very grateful to all of you for advancing his work so well  and he d be especially pleased with this year s recipient of the human rights award in his name    Bobby dedicated much of his life to social justice in all nations and for all peoples  and this award was created to honor courageous individuals fighting for that ideal     Often  the award has recognized human rights heroes from abroad  But this year  with the devastation of Hurricane Katrina so much in mind  we turn our sights homeward  No event in modern America has destroyed so much and uprooted so many in so short a time as that violent storm  with much of the magnificent City of New Orleans and the beloved Gulf Coast reduced to ruin    I visited the area soon after the storm and was deeply shocked to see the devastation  For many of our fellow citizens in New Orleans and the Gulf Region  there is literally nothing to return to  Entire communities are completely gone  All that s left of endless blocks are the concrete slabs where family homes once stood     The violent winds and flood tore away the mask that has long concealed the silent slavery of poverty in so much of our society  Katrina showed how long a journey we still have to make to live up to America s promise  For a new generation of Americans who did not live through the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War or Watergate    Katrina was their American apocalypse  More than any event in their lifetimes  it revealed the consequences of our nation s neglect    But new young leaders like our honoree understand that the darkest time often comes just before a dawn  On my visit to the Gulf Coast  I was moved by the caring and courage of ordinary people stepping up in extraordinary ways to rebuild lives and communities  Churches  police officers  firefighters  National Guard members  families  friends  neighbors  strangers    they came together and became heroes in the wake of the storm  They saw the face of poverty and homelessness  and responded instantly by joining the fight against despair    To their credit  some courageous and very dedicated people had joined that fight long before  even when the storms weren t arriving and the cameras weren t rolling  Among the best of those who have been fighting the good fight with great courage is this year s honoree  Stephen Bradberry of New Orleans  Stephen s parents  Gerald and Patricia  are joining us today as well  and I know they re very proud of him too    Stephen is the lead organizer for the New Orleans chapter of ACORN  the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now  He s lived in New Orleans for 18 years  He s originally from Chicago  but stayed on in the Crescent City after graduating from Dillard University in 1992  At Dillard  his eyes were opened to new depths of poverty  He came face to face with the plight of people in poverty in the state with the largest proportion of men and women in the nation living on the minimum wage or less    Ever since  he s been a relentless crusader for social and economic justice  He battles every day  and with great humility  to empower the poor of New Orleans and mobilize them to fight more effectively for themselves  Gladys Washington  who approves grants for New Orleans ACORN  calls Stephen very humble and very much a behind the scenes person  She says he epitomizes RFK s vision for social justice  fairness  and equality    After Hurricane Katrina  he temporarily moved to Baton Rouge  where he fought all the harder and he became an even more dedicated warrior in the battle for justice  It s been an uphill battle for Stephen and his team  Organizing in shelters  and locating and supporting ACORN members displaced by the storm have been difficult  even in this era of the Internet  cell phones and text messages  But Stephen kept the faith  and is leading a new movement to give the low income community of New Orleans a genuine voice in the redevelopment of their city  Survivors I met told me they don t want veto power over every proposal to rebuild their region    they just need a voice in the rebuilding of their own communities  and ACORN is their voice    The name is especially appropriate    Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now  That says it all  Typically  it plants seeds in communities across America that can grow into mighty oaks with strong roots and far reaching branches in the ongoing struggle for progress  opportunity  and justice  It s the nation s largest community organization of low  and moderate income families  with 175 000 member families and 850 neighborhood chapters in 75 cities in our country  Canada  the Dominican Republic  and Peru    Robert Kennedy understood the critical importance of local activists like Stephen in these struggles  In the fight for social justice  Bobby said  national power can create and encourage  but local power is determinative  Stephen has been that kind of determined leader for ACORN  organizing the poverty community through marches  demonstrations  media campaigns  leadership training  door to door visits  e mail  and the Internet  He s led New Orleans ACORN into battle for a living wage and for voting rights    and against lead poisoning and predatory lending  Now he s waging a new battle in support of fair rebuilding after the hurricane    In the aftermath of Katrina  affordable housing and living wage jobs are even more critical  ACORN activists are locating and organizing their 9 000 New Orleans member families to provide housing assistance and a strong community voice for the displaced  and to fulfill hope for all the victims of the nation s cruelest natural disaster    Chapters in Washington and across the country have appealed to Congress in person  over the telephone  and by fax to provide faster relief and a genuine long term rebuilding plan  They know  and they re teaching the rest of us  that if we rebuild New Orleans without the voice of the low income community  we ll face the same desperate issues again in the future  and these communities will always remain vulnerable    Stephen has had other missions as well  In New Orleans  Eighth Ward  he s worked with the local carpenters union to reduce exposure to lead poisoning in old homes  It s characteristic of ACORN that the local union is offering apprenticeships to young men and women ages 18 to 24    giving them a priceless opportunity to learn how to find their way out of poverty  As the Chinese saying goes  give people a fish  and you ll feed them for a day  But teach them to fish  and you ll feed them for a lifetime    Stephen s also led the most effective voting rights campaign in New Orleans  A lot of other organizations have been doing big  flashy events  he says  but we ve been out there in the neighborhoods where people are  signing them up door to door  at bus stops  wherever people congregate  Slow and steady wins the race  Of the 460 000 residents of Orleans Parish  over 302 000 are registered to vote in this historic treasure of an American city  including almost 200 000 African Americans    Stephen works especially hard to teach people their voting rights  We re an issue based organization  he says  For instance  we ve been fighting for the living wage for the past few years  We want to engage people in the electoral process now  As we get them engagedwe ll have a number of registered voters interested in passing a living wage bill in Louisiana    In fact  that s ACORN s defining cause    and it s effective  In November 2004  because of ACORN  71 percent of voters in Florida and 68 percent in Nevada approved ballot initiatives to raise their state s minimum wage  Similar initiatives are now underway for next year s elections in Ohio  Michigan  Arizona  and Colorado  These campaigns are strong and successful tributes to the power of the grassroots  They draw people to the polls because the people know it makes a difference in their daily lives    In New Orleans  Stephen won a major recent success  working with labor  religious leaders  and community groups to heed the call for economic justice  In 2002  63 percent of New Orleans voters demanded a raise in the city s minimum wage from the federal level of  5 15 an hour to the more livable wage of  6 15 an hour for 75 000 city workers  Sadly  seven months later  the Louisiana Supreme Court struck down the increase  so the battle goes on    In the wake of Katrina  that struggle in New Orleans is especially important  Before the hurricane  one of every 20 workers in Louisiana earned the minimum wage or less    almost twice the national average  A quarter of the population lived in poverty    77 percent higher than the national average     The challenge facing these low wage workers was aggravated by the Administration s harsh decision to suspend the protection of prevailing wage laws for reconstruction workers in the Gulf Coast    a needless and appalling insult to suffering workers and their families  ACORN made its outrage known  Thanks to its efforts  the Administration admitted the error of its ways and reinstated the long standing federal wage protections for these hard working Americans     But there is much more to do  Stephen sees the living wage as indispensable in attracting residents back to New Orleans  As he says  people have moved away from this city and have seen that they can make more money in other places  The simple fact of the matter  he says  is you can t pay a minimum wage in New Orleans right now  because there is nobody in the city  So you have to pay people in order to have them come to work    In 1968  Bobby spoke about this need  in words that ring even more true after Katrina  As he said  We need jobs  dignified employment at decent pay  the kind of employment that lets a person say to his community  to his family  to his country  and most important  to himself   I helped to build this country  I am a participant in its great public ventures  I am somebody     Perhaps the most invisible of all among the invisible poor are those in the immigrant neighborhoods and communities of New Orleans  A century and a half ago  thousands of Irish immigrants gave their lives digging the New Basin Canal  which linked the city with Lake Ponchartrain at the time  Lost from public view today are thousands of contemporary immigrants  especially from Mexico  Honduras  and Vietnam  who had been living in the areas hit hardest along the Gulf Coast  Few have sought help from relief agencies or gone to shelters  for fear they ll be deported  Whatever violations of the immigration laws they may have committed  we can t wash our hands of their plight and let their suffering continue    As this disaster reminds us  we re all part of a family    and we have a responsibility to help members of our family in need  More than ever  as we have learned so painfully in recent weeks  the war on poverty has casualties like any other war    and so far  we are losing this war    Government must respond in ways that are as good and as compassionate as the American people  We know what must be done  We re a stronger country when we re a fairer country  Inequality and injustice undermine our economy  our security  our standing in the world  our future  We need to wage a wiser war on poverty  That means a broader effort and a new spirit of cooperation to reduce poverty  a genuine new dedication carried out by leaders in government at every level  in religion  in industry  and in the academic community    This is our opportunity and our calling    and it s our duty    to get it right  We can rebuild the Gulf Coast in a manner that lifts people up and gives them a voice  We can reduce and even eradicate poverty in the nation  and reclaim our moral standing in the world  Other nations still desperately want to look to us for moral guidance and leadership  and we cannot fail again    Brenda Marie Osbey  the Poet Laureate of Louisiana  is Artist in Residence at Dillard University  Two weeks after the storm  she paid homage to her great city  its people  and their hope for rebuilding it  in these eloquent words    Believe on those hands  And they will see you through seasons  of drought and flood  Believe on these hands  And you will cross the grandy water  Journey with me  and see what I see     Stephen Bradberry does that   What he sees so clearly is a bright future for his New Orleans    As Bobby said  The future does not belong to those who are content with today  apathetic toward common problems and their fellow man alike  Rather  it will belong to those who can blend vision  reason  and courage in a personal commitment to the ideals and great enterprises of American society     He believed that we must learn to find our own advancement in the search for the advancement of others    All of us  he said  from the wealthiest and most powerful of men to the weakest and hungriest of children  share one precious possession  the name  American     In April 1968  he ended his remarks about the Bedford Stuyvesant community in New York City with words that ring especially true today about Stephen  We live in a time when the nation is deeply divided  But you have proven that we need not remain so  Together we can attack the problems that seem so overwhelming  and master them  Your example should give courage to all Americans in the difficult days before us    Stephen  you honor my brother immensely in your mission to make this a more just and peaceful land  Bobby would be very  very proud of all you re doing to carry on his unfinished work  and to help all those living in even the deepest shadows  about whom he cared so much    It s an honor for me now to join Ethel in commending you for your inspiring  good works  and in presenting you with this Robert F  Kennedy Human Rights Award   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
