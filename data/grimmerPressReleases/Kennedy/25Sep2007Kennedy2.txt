         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I commend Senator Durbin and Chairman Conyers for their work on this important legislation  Theyre demonstrating again their continuing leadership in protecting Americas working families     In 2005  Congress passed misguided bankruptcy legislation that made workers and their families more vulnerable  and ignored the serious failings of the Corporate Bankruptcy Code      Bankruptcy Court has become a place where corporate executives go to get permission to break promises to their workers and retirees  while lining their own pockets  Executives give themselves lavish gifts  workers lose their paychecks  In many cases  workers cant even collect pay or benefits theyve already earnedor are denied the severance pay promised them when they were laid off      Companies have underfunded their pension plans for years  then dump them on the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and taxpayerswhich can mean retirees see large cuts to the pensions they had worked long and hard to earn  Companies also use bankruptcy to cut health benefits  based on contracts in which workers and retirees had given up raises in exchange for health care     Our current corporate bankruptcy laws are clearly inadequate to address these problems  Often  the very insiders whose misconduct brings a company down do very well in bankruptcy  The people who get hurt are the employees and retirees      An example of these abominable practices can be seen in the 2001 bankruptcy of Polaroid  a major corporation in Massachusetts  In the months leading up to the companys filing  corporate executives and senior management walked away with millions of dollars in payments  But over 6 000 retirees lost their health and life insurance  Workers on long term disability lost their health insurance  and laid off workers lost their severance pay     Countless other workers and retirees have met a similar fate  Current law leaves workers at the bottom of the priority list  They have little recourse and almost no voice    Its time to put a stop to corporate looting  Its time to stop companies from using bankruptcy as an excuse to avoid contract obligations to their workers     This legislation makes much needed reformsgiving workers a voice and putting the burden on companies to justify their actions  It allows workers to collect the pay they are owed  It makes it harder for a company to cut jobs  pensions  and health benefits in bankruptcy  And it stops insiders from rewarding themselves with excessive bonuses and incentive payments on the backs of vulnerable workers     This bill is about fairness  Executives dont deserve incentives to push their company into bankruptcy or cut workers benefits  They should be bound by promises they have made to employees  Any sacrifice should be a shared one  Those who run a company into the ground should not be rewarded with golden parachutes  while workers and retirees are left impoverished      I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us on this important legislation          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
