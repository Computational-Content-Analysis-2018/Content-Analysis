         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           CONTACT  Melissa Wagoner   Brent Carney                         617  565 4472 Madame Chief Justice  members of the judiciary  colleagues in government  honored guests  fellow citizens   It is an honor and a privilege for me to join with all of you today to dedicate this magnificent building to the founding architect of our judicial system  John Adams  and to celebrate his visionary belief in the essential nature of an independent judiciary to protect the rights and liberties of all  This building has been newly renovated to meet the 21st Century needs of the people of Massachusetts  but the extraordinary and unparalleled system of justice that governs the work that goes on here has protected our people since the very founding of our Commonwealth   John Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780  which is    as David McCullough has written    the oldest functioning constitution in the world and one of the great  enduring documents of the American Revolution  That extraordinary  revolutionary document expressly stated that  It is essential to the preservation of the rights of every individual  his life  liberty  property  and character  that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws  and administration of justice  It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as free  impartial  and independent as the lot of humanity will admit   Our Constitution of 1780  the DNA of which is evident in the later adopted Constitution for the whole of the United States  also provided for a system of checks and balances through the creation of three co equal branches of government  As Adams said  By balancing each of these powers against the other two       the efforts in human nature towards tyranny can alone be checked and restrained  and any degree of freedom preserved   Our system of government is the envy of the world  Yet  as we have seen again in recent days  there are forces that are seeking to undermine it  They are seeking to take away the independence of the judiciary    the crown jewel in our system of government    so that they can advance their own ideological agenda of the day  That is exactly the kind of tyranny that our ancestors fought to prevent  and  I pledge to you  that as long as I have a voice  I will continue to fight it as well  I was encouraged yesterday by the remarks of federal court of appeals Judge Stanley Birch  a Republican appointee and consistently conservative voice on the 11th Circuit  as that court ruled yet again on the tragic case of Terri Schiavo  Referring to the decision by Congress to insert itself into this private matter that had already been fully litigated by the state courts  Judge Birch said  When the fervor of political passions moves the executive and legislative branches to act in ways inimical to basic constitutional principles  it is the duty of the judiciary to intervene  If sacrifices to the independence of the judiciary are permitted today  precedent is established for the constitutional transgressions of tomorrow  John Adams couldn t have said it better himself  We unfortunately see this assault on the independent judiciary being played out again in the President s repeated nomination to the federal bench of a few radical  ideological individuals whose views are outside the mainstream of judicial thought    and in the Senate majority s threatened use of the so called nuclear option to railroad these nominations through the Senate by cutting off our right to debate   Because of the genius of our Founding Fathers in creating our system of checks and balances  our democracy does not allow one party to impose its extreme views on the nation  That s why the President has the veto power    as a check against Congress  And that s why the Senate has rules for extended debate as a check on the President s judicial nominations    In John Adams  farewell address to the Senate in 1797  as he prepared to become our second President  he said  No council more permanent than  the Senate  will be necessary to defend the rights  liberties  and properties of the people  and to protect the Constitution of the United States  I couldn t agree more  Even though we are in the minority today  we will continue the fight to ensure that we have an independent judiciary  because  as Judge Birch of the 11th Circuit said just yesterday said   i f sacrifices to the independence of the judiciary are permitted today  precedent is established for the constitutional transgressions of tomorrow  So today  I join you as we honor the name of a giant in Massachusetts history  and rededicate ourselves to the propositions for which he stood  May all who enter this building be reminded of the great promise of truth  fairness and justice that Adams and his colleagues made to each other and to future generations  and may we all work harder to keep that promise and Adams  legacy alive     Madame Chief Justice  members of the judiciary  colleagues in government  honored guests  fellow citizens     It is an honor and a privilege for me to join with all
