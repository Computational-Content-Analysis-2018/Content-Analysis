         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  made the following remarks at a rally held by the SEIU in support of the Childrens Health Insurance Program        As Prepared for Delivery      Will you stand up for children      Will you stand up for parents      Will you stand up for working families      Then youre in the right place   Because were here to speak up for the 10 million children helped by the bill thats on the Presidents desk      Id like to thank Dennis Rivera for leading the fight for Americas working men and women   I also want to thank my very good friend  John Dingell  who has spent more than 50 years in Congress working for Americas families      And thank you all for being here today to send a very loud and clear message to the President  Do not turn your back on Americas children       We all know what this is about      Its about peace of mind for parents  so they dont have to worry how to pay if their children get sick      Its about proud working families  struggling to provide for their families      But most of all  its about fairness   And in America  we understand fairness      Congress just passed a bill that would invest  35 billion to strengthen the Childrens Health Insurance Program and bring good  quality health care coverage to over 10 million children      Expanding CHIP will make a real difference so that no parents will ever have to ask again whether they can afford to take their sick children to the doctor      Its supported by thousands of religious and community leaders across the nation      It passed overwhelmingly with the support of Democrats and Republicans in Congress      And now its future hinges on the decision of just one man      President Bush has the power to help 10 million children receive health insurance   Or he can turn his back on Americas children by vetoing this legislation      After watching hundreds of thousands of children lose their coverage on his watch  its incomprehensible that the President would threaten to veto legislation that fixes the problem      Its a question of priorities   For the price of one day in Iraq we could cover 256 000 children      One week in Iraq would cover 1 8 million children      And just over a month of the Iraq war would cover 10 million children for a whole year      President Bush is willing to spend billions and billions on a war in Iraq   Mr  President  how about a little attention to our children here at home      Were here to tell him that were not going to stand for it   Were not going to allow the most vulnerable members of our society be turned away because their parents cant afford the doctor      So I ask President Bush and those in Congress who support his veto      You have health care paid for by the government   So why would you deny the same right to the children of working families      Those who oppose this bipartisan bill like to talk about fiscal responsibility   Ill tell you something about responsibility      When a child without insurance gets sick  their parents have to take them to the emergency room     Thats a cost of 423 dollars they have to pay out of pocket  and its money they dont have for rent or food or clothes      None of us in Congress have to make that choice   We can all sign up for coverage that the government subsidizes   When our children get sick  we can take them to a family doctor   We dont have to wait in a crowded emergency room for a medical intern with too little time and too many patients      And we have the option of taking our kids to our own private medical staff in the Capitol   The President has his health care paid for by the taxpayer too      But when it comes to children of working families  now the tune changes   The President and the opponents of this bill say  Let them go to the emergency room and wait their turn   Let their parents have to worry whether they can afford the cost   It may be good enough for us to have the best health care in the world for us and for our kids  but not for you      Lets end the double standard       Lets end the hypocrisy      Lets give the children of working families the health care they deserve      We all know that the Presidents veto has real consequences   In a moment youre going to meet Keith Taylor and his mother Carolyn   If the President follows through with this veto  millions of children just like Keith would be denied health care simply because their parents cant afford it      Were here today with one simple message to the President   Lets make sure he hears it      Put our children first      Let me hear you say it      Put our children first      Say it again      Put our children first      And were going to keep saying it louder and louder      Let them hear you in the Senate      Let them hear you in the House of Representatives      And let them hear you in that big White House across the street      Let them hear you across America until all of our children receive the health care they deserve      Are you ready to say its time to put children first      Are you ready to fight and fight and fight until we get the job done      I cant hear you      Then lets get to work           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
