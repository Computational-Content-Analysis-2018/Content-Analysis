         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today  the Senate is taking the first step toward passage of legislation that should have been enacted years ago  authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products  the most lethal of all consumer products  Used as intended by the companies that manufacture and market them  cigarettes will kill one out of every three smokers  Yet  the federal agency most responsible for protecting the public health is currently powerless to deal with the enormous risks of tobacco use  Public health experts overwhelmingly believe that passage of S  625 is the most important action Congress can take to protect children from this deadly addiction  If Congress fails to act and smoking continues at its current rate  more than six million of todays children will ultimately die from tobacco induced disease  Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America  Nationally  cigarettes kill well over four hundred thousand people each year  That is more lives lost than from automobile accidents  alcohol abuse  illegal drugs  AIDS  murder  and suicide combined  Congress cannot continue to ignore a public health problem of this magnitude And Congress will not ignore it  This legislation has broad bipartisan support  Fifty two Senators have co sponsored it  including 12 Republicans  They recognize that giving FDA authority over tobacco products is essential to effectively addressing the tobacco health crisis The American Cancer Society  the American Heart Association  the American Lung Association  the American Medical Association  the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids and dozens of other major public health organizations speak with one voice on this issue  They are all supporting S  625 because they know it will give FDA the tools it needs to reduce youth smoking and help addicted smokers quit A landmark report by the Institute of Medicine  released less than two months ago  strongly urged Congress to confer upon the FDA broad regulatory authority over the manufacture  distribution  marketing and use of tobacco products Opponents of this legislation argue that FDA should not be regulating such a dangerous product  I could not disagree more  It is precisely because tobacco products are so deadly that we must empower Americas premier public health protector  the FDA  to combat tobacco use  For decades the federal government has stayed on the sidelines and done next to nothing to deal with this enormous health problem  The tobacco industry has been allowed to mislead consumers  to make false health claims  to conceal the lethal contents of their products  to make their products even more addictive  and worst of all  to seduce generations of children into a lifetime of addiction and early death  The alternative to FDA regulation is more of the same  Allowing this abusive conduct by the tobacco industry to go unchecked would be terribly wrong Under this legislation  FDA will for the first time have the needed power and resources to take on this challenge  The cost will be funded entirely by a new user fee paid by the tobacco companies in proportion to their market share  Not a single dollar will be diverted from FDAs existing responsibilities Giving FDA authority over tobacco products will not make the tragic toll of tobacco use disappear overnight  More than forty million people are hooked on this highly addictive product and many of them have been unable to quit despite repeated attempts  However  FDA action can play a major role in breaking the gruesome cycle that seduces millions of teenagers into a lifetime of addiction and premature death   What can FDA regulation accomplish   It can reduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which targets children   It can help prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors   It can stop the tobacco industry from continuing to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking   It can help smokers overcome their addiction   It can make tobacco products less toxic and less addictive for those who continue to use them   And it can prohibit unsubstantiated health claims about supposedly reduced risk products  and encourage the development of genuinely less harmful alternative products  Regulating the conduct of the tobacco companies is as necessary today as it has been in years past  The facts presented in the federal governments landmark lawsuit against the tobacco industry conclusively demonstrate that the misconduct is substantial and ongoing  The decision of the Court states  The evidence in this case clearly establishes that Defendants have not ceased engaging in unlawful activityDefendants continue to engage in conduct that is materially indistinguishable from their previous actions  activity that continues to this day  Only strong FDA regulation can force the necessary change in their corporate behavior   We must deal firmly with tobacco company marketing practices that target children and mislead the public  The Food and Drug Administration needs broad authority to regulate the sale  distribution  and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco   The tobacco industry currently spends over thirteen billion dollars each year to promote its products  Much of that money is spent in ways designed to tempt children to start smoking  before they are mature enough to appreciate the enormity of the health risk  Four thousand children have their first cigarette every day  and one thousand of them become daily smokers  The industry knows that nearly 90  of smokers begin as children and are addicted by the time they reach adulthood   Documents obtained from tobacco companies prove  in the companies  own words  the magnitude of the industry s efforts to trap children into dependency on their deadly product  Studies by the Institute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control show the substantial role of industry advertising in decisions by young people to use tobacco products If we are serious about reducing youth smoking  FDA must have the power to prevent industry advertising designed to appeal to children wherever it will be seen by children  This legislation will give FDA the authority to stop tobacco advertising that glamorizes smoking to kids  It grants FDA full authority to regulate tobacco advertising consistent with and to the full extent permitted by the First Amendment  FDA authority must also extend to the sale of tobacco products  Nearly every state makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to children under 18  but surveys show that those laws are rarely enforced and frequently violated  FDA must have the power to limit the sale of cigarettes to face to face transactions in which the age of the purchaser can be verified by identification  This means an end to self service displays and vending machine sales  There must also be serious enforcement efforts with real penalties for those caught selling tobacco products to children  This is the only way to ensure that children under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes  The FDA conducted the longest rulemaking proceeding in its history  studying which regulations would most effectively reduce the number of children who smoke  Seven hundred thousand public comments were received in the course of that rulemaking  At the conclusion of its proceeding  the Agency promulgated rules on the manner in which cigarettes are advertised and sold  Due to litigation  most of those regulations were never implemented  If we are serious about curbing youth smoking as much as possible  as soon as possible  it makes no sense to require FDA to reinvent the wheel by conducting a new multi year rulemaking process on the same issues  This legislation will give the youth access and advertising restrictions already developed by FDA the force of law  as if they had been issued under the new statute  Once they are in place  FDA will have the authority to modify these rules as changing circumstances warrant   The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette and smokeless tobacco packages  and in all print advertisements  These warnings will be more explicit in their description of the medical problems which can result from tobacco use  The FDA is given the authority to change the text of these warning labels periodically  to keep their impact strong   The nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive  Medical experts say that it is as addictive as heroin or cocaine  Yet for decades  tobacco companies vehemently denied the addictiveness of their products  No one can forget the parade of tobacco executives who testified under oath before Congress that smoking cigarettes is not addictive  Overwhelming evidence in industry documents obtained through the discovery process proves that the companies not only knew of this addictiveness for decades  but actually relied on it as the basis for their marketing strategy  As we now know  cigarette manufacturers chemically manipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even more addictive  A newly released analysis by the Harvard School of Public Health demonstrates that cigarette manufacturers are still manipulating nicotine levels  Between 1998 and 2005  they significantly increased the nicotine yield from major brand name cigarettes  The average increase in nicotine yield over the period was 11    The tobacco industry has a long  dishonorable history of providing misleading information about the health consequences of smoking  These companies have repeatedly sought to characterize their products as far less hazardous than they are  They made minor innovations in product design seem far more significant for the health of the user than they actually were  It is essential that FDA have clear and unambiguous authority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future  The largest disinformation campaign in the history of the corporate world must end  Given the addictiveness of tobacco products  it is essential that the FDA regulate them for the protection of the public  Over forty million Americans are currently addicted to cigarettes  No responsible public health official believes that cigarettes should be banned  A ban would leave forty million people without a way to satisfy their drug dependency  FDA should be able to take the necessary steps to help addicted smokers overcome their addiction  and to make the product less toxic for smokers who are unable or unwilling to stop  To do so  FDA must have the authority to reduce or remove hazardous ingredients from cigarettes  to the extent that it becomes scientifically feasible  The inherent risk in smoking should not be unnecessarily compounded  Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they planto develop what they characterize as reduced risk cigarettes  Some are already on the market making unsubstantiated claims  This legislation will require manufacturers to submit such reduced risk products to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed  No health related claims will be permitted until they have been verified to the FDA s satisfaction  These safeguards are essential to prevent deceptive industry marketing campaigns  which could lull the public into a false sense of health safety  This legislation will vest FDA not only with the responsibility for regulating tobacco products  but with full authority to do the job effectively  It is long overdue  Enacting this bill this year is the right thing to do for Americas children  They are depending on us  By passing this legislation  we can help them live longer  healthier lives   May 11  2007 LEGISLATION EMPOWERING FDA TOREGULATE TOBACCO PRODUCTSBy Senator Edward M  Kennedy  This bipartisan legislation will give the FDA the legal authority it needs    to reduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which targets children     to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors     to help smokers overcome their addiction     to make tobacco products less toxic for those who continue to use them     and to prevent the tobacco industry from misleading the public about the dangers of smoking  1  Establishes A New Chapter on Tobacco Regulation  It creates a new section in FDA jurisdiction for the regulation of tobacco products  with standards that allow for consideration of the unique issues raised by tobacco use  The legislation gives FDA the authority it needs in order to prevent youth smoking and to reduce addiction to this highly lethal product 2  Authority to Restrict Tobacco Advertising  The Food and Drug Administration will have the necessary authority to regulate the sale  distribution  and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in order to stop tobacco company marketing practices that target children and mislead the public  It grants FDA full authority to regulate tobacco advertising consistent with and to the full extent permitted by the First Amendment  The tobacco industry currently spends more than fifteen billion dollars a year to promote its products  Much of that money is spent in ways designed to tempt children to start smoking  before they are mature enough to appreciate the enormity of the health risk  Nearly 90  of smokers begin as children and are addicted by the time they reach adulthood  This legislation will empower FDA to prevent industry advertising designed to appeal to children wherever it will be seen by children  3  Authority to Prevent Sale to Youth  FDA authority will extend to the sale of tobacco products  Nearly every state makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to children under 18  but surveys show that those laws are rarely enforced and frequently violated  FDA will have the power to limit the sale of cigarettes to face to face transactions in which the age of the purchaser can be verified by identification  This means an end to self service displays and vending machine sales  There must also be serious enforcement efforts with real penalties for those caught selling tobacco products to children  This is the only way to ensure that children under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes 4  Preserves FDA Rule to Curb Tobacco Use by Youth  The FDA conducted one of the longest rulemaking proceedings in its history to determine what regulations would most effectively reduce the number of children who smoke  Seven hundred thousand public comments were received in the course of that rulemaking  At the conclusion of its proceeding  the Agency promulgated rules on the manner in which cigarettes are advertised and sold  Due to litigation  most of those regulations were never implemented  It makes no sense to require FDA to reinvent the wheel by conducting a new multi year rulemaking process on the same issues  In order to curb youth smoking as much as possible  as soon as possible  this legislation will give the youth access and advertising restrictions already developed by FDA the force of law  as if they had been issued under the new statute 5  Stronger Warning Labels  The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette and smokeless tobacco packages  and in all print advertisements  These warnings will be more explicit in their description of the medical problems which can result from tobacco use  The FDA is given the authority to change the text of these warning labels periodically  to keep their impact strong  6  Preventing Tobacco Industry Misrepresentations  For decades  tobacco companies have vehemently denied the addictiveness of nicotine in their products  Overwhelming evidence in industry documents obtained through the discovery process proves that the companies not only knew of this addictiveness  but actually relied on it as the basis for their marketing strategy  As we now know  cigarette manufacturers chemically manipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even more addictive  These companies have repeatedly sought to characterize their products as far less hazardous than they are  FDA will have clear and unambiguous authority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future 7  Authority to Order Removal of Hazardous Ingredients  Over forty million Americans are currently addicted to cigarettes  No responsible public health official believes that cigarettes should be banned  A ban would leave forty million people without a legal way to satisfy their drug dependency  FDA must be able to take the necessary steps to help addicted smokers overcome their addiction  and to make the product less toxic for smokers who are unable or unwilling to stop  To do so  FDA will have the authority to reduce or remove hazardous ingredients from cigarettes  to the extent that it becomes scientifically feasible  The inherent risk in smoking should not be unnecessarily compounded 8  Setting Standards for Reduced Risk Products  Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they plan to develop what they characterize as reduced risk cigarettes  This legislation will require manufacturers to submit such reduced risk products to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed  No health related claims will be permitted until they have been verified to the FDA s satisfaction  These safeguards are essential to prevent deceptive industry marketing campaigns  which could lull the public into a false sense of health safety Cancer Action NetworkAmerican Heart AssociationPartners for Effective Tobacco PolicyAmerican Lung AssociationCampaign for Tobacco Free Kids July 17  2007The Honorable  FULL NAME United States  SIDE OF CONGRESS Washington  DC 20515 20510Fax Dear Senator Representative  LAST NAME   Congress has an historic opportunity to embrace responsible legislation that will help to reduce the suffering and death caused by tobacco  Bipartisan legislation has been introduced by Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Senator John Cornyn  R TX   S  625  in the U S  Senate and by Representatives Henry Waxman  D CA  and Tom Davis  R VA   H R  1108  in the U S  House of Representatives  to give the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  the authority to regulate the tobacco industry for the first time  ending the exceptional protection granted only to tobacco companies and to no other industry In 2004  the U S  Senate voted overwhelmingly  78 15  to grant the FDA effective authority to regulate tobacco products  but the legislation ultimately died in a conference committee  Forty three years have passed since the U S  Surgeon General reported on the unquestionable dangers of smoking  Since that time  tobacco products have become the largest single preventable cause of death in America while Congress has yet to take meaningful action  Tobacco use kills more than 400 000 Americans each year and costs our nation more than  96 billion in health care bills  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  tobacco use by pregnant women alone costs between  400 500 million per year due to complications such as low birth weight  premature births and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome  SIDS   And every day Congress fails to act  another 1 000 kids become regular smokers  one third of whom will die prematurely as a result  Yet tobacco products are virtually unregulated to protect consumers health and safety  For decades  the tobacco companies have marketed their deadly products to our children  deceived consumers about the harm their products cause  and failed to take any meaningful action to make their products less harmful or less addictive  The Kennedy Cornyn and Waxman Davis bills would finally end the exceptional protection enjoyed by the tobacco industry and protect our children and the nations health instead  This legislation meets the standards long established by the public health community for a strong FDA tobacco regulation bill that protects the public health  It would give the FDA the necessary tools and resources to effectively regulate the manufacturing  marketing  labeling  distribution and sale of tobacco products  The FDA would have the authority to  Stop illegal sales of tobacco products to children and adolescents  Require changes in tobacco products  such as the reduction or elimination of harmful chemicals  to make them less harmful and less addictive  Restrict advertising and promotions that appeal to children and adolescents  Prohibit unsubstantiated health claims about so called reduced risk tobacco products that discourage current tobacco users from quitting or encourage new users to start  Require the disclosure of tobacco product content and tobacco industry research about the health effects of their products  Require larger and more informative health warnings on tobacco products  This much needed bipartisan FDA legislation protects the publics health and should be enacted in this session of Congress  We remain concerned that opponents of effective FDA tobacco regulation will seek to weaken the bills  Our organizations will work vigorously to protect the bills as they currently exist and will oppose efforts to eliminate or weaken the FDA authority they provide  Please support the Kennedy Cornyn  S 625  and Waxman Davis  HR 1108  FDA bills and oppose any and all weakening changes  Below is the list of 414 national  state and local
