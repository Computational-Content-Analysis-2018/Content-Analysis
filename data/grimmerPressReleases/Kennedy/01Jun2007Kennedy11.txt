         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  BOSTON  MA  Senator Edward M  Kennedy today discussed the significance of public service at the Prize Day Awards Ceremony for Hillside School where 29 students will graduate on Saturday  You dont have to be a public official or make a headline to make things change  said Senator Kennedy   The world awaits your contribution in whatever field you choose  and nothing you decide to do will ever limit the opportunities you will constantly have to improve the world around you  The Hillside School is a private  independent boarding school located in Marlborough  Massachusetts  The Prize Day Awards Ceremony recognizes academic and extra curricular achievements by graduating Hillside students  David Beecher  Headmaster of the Hillside School  hosts the event  Remarks of Senator Edward M  KennedyHillside School Prize Day Award CeremonyMarlborough  MAFriday  June 1  2007 As Prepared for Delivery I congratulate the graduating class  29 students from seven different states and Bermuda  Korea  and Haiti   I know all of you have worked hard to reach this special milestone in your lives  and its impressive to see your great affection and appreciation for the School   Your 100 percent pledge to donate your allowances to future graduating classes shows your real love for this community  and your hope that others will be able to share in the same special opportunity youve had because of Hillside Today is a fitting tribute to your own hard work and also to the love and the many sacrifices of your family has made to bring you to this auspicious threshold for your future   I know theyre very proud of your accomplishments and the new horizons and opportunities awaiting you     The strong tradition of learning at Hillside goes far beyond the courses themselves and includes the way the faculty  staff  house parents and advisors give you the chance to grow  to learn from your mistakes  to find out who you are and choose the direction youll follow in life in the years ahead   As Buckminster Fuller once said If I ran a school  Id give the average grade to the ones who gave me all the right answers  for being good parrots  Id give the top grades to those who made a lot of mistakes and told me about them  and then told me what they learned from them Youve been challenged here at Hillside  but inspired as well  and the benefits will be immense  Youll be getting lots of advice in the months and years ahead about how to decide what direction to take   One of the best pieces of advice comes from Mark Twain   He said  Why not go out on a limb  Thats where all the fruit is I hope your dreams will include things to improve the world around you  because the world needs your talents  your energy  and your generosity of spirit       Its true that each person can make a difference   Mahatma Gandhi said  You must be the change you wish to see in the world  Winston Churchill put it this way  This is the age of youth   Youre part of the generation that has yet to divide the world E B  White put the choices you will face beautifully   Its hard to know when to respond to the seductiveness of the world  and when to respond to its challenge  If the world were merely seductive  that would be easy   If it were merely challenging  that would be no problem   But I arise every morning torn between the desire to improve the world and the desire to enjoy it   This makes it hard to plan the day     You didnt make the world you live in  but you have the chance to change it and leave it better than you found it       Our nation and society have many challenges to meet   Theres the great challenge of the war in Iraq and protecting our national security      Theres also the ongoing work of removing bigotry  prejudice and discrimination permanently  completely  and absolutely from our society       We have a moral obligation to help each of our fellow citizens achieve all theyre capable of  and to remove the stubborn obstacles that still prevent so many Americans from obtaining the American dream      Theres still poverty in America  especially among children   Its not in the news every day  but its our hidden shame and we need all the talent we can bring to end it     More fundamentally  our democracy needs an active and engaged citizenry it if the nation is to continue strong   We need committed individuals to be constantly asking how we solve some of our greatest problems     Active citizens ask those questions every day   They dont tolerate bigotry in any shape or form  not in race  or gender  or religion  or disability  or sexual orientation  They dont accept gun violence   They care about nuclear arms control  about ending terrorism and the conditions that breed it   They care about Iraq and why were there   They care about AIDS in Africa and genocide in Darfur  about human rights violations anywhere on earth   They care about justice   And by taking action  they inspire others to be active too   Together you have the power to build a better and fairer nation  and a better and fairer world as well   You can be like the embattled farmers at Concord Bridge  and fire a shot heard round the world Change is never easy   What you propose may be unpopular at first   But as Andrew Jackson said one person with courage makes a majority      Often  it is young men and women like you lead the way   In some of the most difficult periods in our recent history  it was Americas youth who were the keepers of the conscience of our country  who inspired the rest of us and led the nation forward The soldiers on the beaches of Normandy 52 years ago next Wednesday were little older than you  and they changed the course of history   Ruby Bridges was six years old when she walked  undaunted by hostile crowds  to integrate a school in Little Rock  Arkansas   Countless others joined Martin Luther King on the freedom marches and sit ins at lunch counters  and they transformed America       Young men and women like you first saw the truth about the war in Vietnam and persuaded America to change course   As my brother  Robert Kennedy  told the students at the University of Capetown in South Africa in 1966  Each time a person stands up for an ideal  or acts to improve the lot of others  or strikes out against injustice  he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope  and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring  those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance   Those words are truer today than ever You dont have to be a public official or make a headline to make things change   In our country today and in nations throughout the world  young Americans are doing many worthwhile things   Young physicians are bringing health care to people and places that never had a doctor   Young teachers are bringing knowledge  opportunity  and hope to children who never had a chance   Young men and women are taking on the challenges of saving the environment  and ending the age old evils of poverty  injustice  and discrimination   Theyre answering the call to service in the Peace Corps  planting crops where there was only dust before and bringing hope where there was only despair I chose government as my way to work for change   Your teachers chose education as their way to improve the world   But the world awaits your contribution in whatever field you choose  and nothing you decide to do will ever limit the opportunities you will constantly have to improve the world around you     Let me close with a story   An old man walking along a beach at dawn saw a young woman picking up starfish and throwing them out to sea   Why are you doing that  the old man asked   The young woman explained that the starfish had been stranded on the beach by the tide  and would soon die in the morning sun         But the beach goes on for miles  the old man said  and there are so many starfish   How can your action make any difference     The young woman looked at the starfish in her hand  and then threw it to safety in the sea   It makes a difference to this one  she said     In that spirit  I congratulate each you on your achievements  and I commend each of you for the differences I know you will make for many years to come      Thank you all very much
