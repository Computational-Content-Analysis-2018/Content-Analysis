         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I THANK THE CHAIR  MR  PRESIDENT  JUST TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS OF THE SENATE S TIME  AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE WATCHING THIS DEBATE TO TRY AND PUT THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE AN ARROGANT GRAB FOR POWER INTO SOME PERSPECTIVE  I WOULD URGE MY COLLEAGUES PERHAPS OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND  TAKE TWO OR THREE HOURS AND REREAD THE DEBATES ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION ABOUT HOW OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WANTED THE SELECTION OF JUDGES FOR THE COURTS OF THIS COUNTRY     AND THERE WERE THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS DURING THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WHEN OUR FOUNDING FATHERS CONSIDERED ABOUT WHO SHOULD APPOINT THE JUDGES THAT WERE GOING TO SERVE ON THE COURTS OF THIS COUNTRY  THE FIRST TWO TIMES THE FOUNDING FATHERS DEBATED THIS AND DISCUSSED THIS  THEY MADE A UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATION THAT IT WOULD BE SOLELY THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE THE SOLE JUDGE FOR NOMINATING AND APPROVING JUDGES THAT WERE GOING TO SERVE ON THE COURTS  THEN AS THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION CAME TO AN END  EIGHT DAYS BEFORE THE END OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION  THEY CAME BACK AND THEY WERE REVIEWING THE TOTALITY OF THEIR WORK  AND AT THAT TIME  THEY MADE A JUDGMENT AND DECISION THAT WAS VIRTUALLY UNANIMOUS THAT THEY WOULD PROVIDE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES     NO ONE CAN READ THE DEBATES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AND NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES IS EFFECTIVELY  IN THE EYES OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS  A CO EQUAL PARTNER IN THE NAMING OF JUDGES  NOW  I KNOW IT S BEEN FASHIONABLE AROUND HERE FOR MANY YEARS  PARTICULARLY THOSE OF THE MAJORITY PARTY  AND I VE SEEN IT DONE EVEN ON OUR SIDE WHEN WE WERE THE MAJORITY PARTY AND WE HAD A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT SAY  LOOK  IF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES NOMINATES IT  THERE HAS TO BE A HEAVY BURDEN ON ANY INDIVIDUAL TO VOTE AGAINST IT  IT OUGHT TO BE AN AUTOMATIC  IT OUGHT TO BE EFFECTIVELY A RUBBER STAMP     THAT HAS NEVER BEEN MY POSITION  MR  PRESIDENT  I HAVE ALWAYS FELT AND UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT AND DECISION CHARGED BY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS TO EXERCISE OUR OWN GOOD JUDGMENT  THAT IS REALLY BEEN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE     WE VE LISTENED  I HAVE  TO A LOT OF DEBATES SAY  OH  WELL  WHAT WE RE REALLY DOING IS GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS  THAT JUST DOES NOT HAPPEN TO BE FACTUALLY TRUE     I REVIEWED YESTERDAY JUST ABOUT THOSE THAT HAVE HELD THE SEAT THAT I HOLD IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE GOING BACK FROM JOHN QUINCY ADAMS GOING BACK TO CHARLES SUMNER  GOING BACK TO DANIEL WEBSTER  EVEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE  THE SERIES OF SUPREME COURT NOMINEES THAT THEY CONSIDERED AND THOSE THAT THEY VOTED FOR AND THOSE THEY VOTED AGAINST     THERE NEVER WAS A SINGLE TIME WHEN ANY SENATOR MASSACHUSETTS WAS EFFECTIVELY MUZZLED  SILENCED  GAGGED WHEN THEY WERE EXPRESSING THEIR CONSCIENCE  THEIR VIEW ABOUT THE MEMBERS GOING TO THE SUPREME COURT OR THE CIRCUIT COURTS  NOT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS BODY  NEVER     BUT UNDER THE PROPOSAL OF THE MAJORITY LEADER  THAT WILL NO LONGER BE THE CASE  IT ISN T ONLY THE SILENCING  THE MUZZLING AND THE GAGGING OF ANY OF THE MEMBERS IN HERE  IT IS BREAKING THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME  NOW  WE HAVE PARLIAMENTARY RULES  LIKE ANY OTHER LEGISLATIVE BODY  AND WE HAVE WAYS OF CHANGING AND ALTERING THOSE RULES  THEY RE ALL LAID OUT  I LL MENTION THEM JUST BRIEFLY     THERE IS A WAY TO CHANGE THE RULES IF WE DON T LIKE THEM  AND WE CAN FOLLOW AND CONFORM OUR VIEWS BY THE SENATE RULES WE CAN ALTER AND CHANGE    IS THAT WHAT IS GOING TO BE BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE NUCLEAR OPTION  ABSOLUTELY NOT    ABSOLUTELY NOT  THERE IS A WAY TO CHANGE THEM  BUT NOT THE WAY THAT THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP AND THIS ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO DO IT     THEY RE EFFECTIVELY TEARING UP THE RULES  THEY RE BASICALLY RUNNING ROUGHSHOD OVER THE SENATE RULES  THE INSTITUTION THAT HAS SERVED THIS NATION WELL FOR 224 YEARS  THAT S WHAT S BEING PROPOSED  WHEN IT S ALL SAID AND DONE  WHEN WE MENTION ALL OF THESE OTHER PAST HISTORIES OF  THIS IS EFFECTIVELY WHAT S BEING DONE  NOW  I THINK MOST AMERICANS MAY TAKE ISSUE WITH WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE  MAY AGREE WITH THE ACTIVITIES OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE  MAY DIFFER WITH THEM  BUT ONE THING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SOME DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE IN IS THEIR BASIC INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT  AND WITH THE PROPOSAL BY THE MAJORITY LEADER  WE ARE RENDERING ASUNDER THE POWER AND THE AUTHORITY THAT WAS DESCRIBED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AND DESCRIBED IN THE CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE    AND THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE FEELING SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS  MANY OF US THAT SPEAK FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS BECAUSE BASICALLY WE RE UNDERMINING WHAT OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WANT  YOU KNOW  THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN OVERHANGING THE SENATE NOW FOR SOME WEEKS  FOR SOME MONTHS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE APPROVED 208 OF THE PRESIDENT S JUDGES  95   THAT S A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT BUSH WON  WHAT IS SUDDENLY THE DIFFERENCE    THIS PRESIDENT HAS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF APPROVAL THAN THE FIRST BUSH WON  THE DIFFERENCE IS A DIFFERENT POLITICAL CLIMATE  THERE IS A RADICAL RIGHT OUT THERE THAT IS LOOSE IN THE COUNTRY  THEY FEEL THEY WON THE PRESIDENCY  THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND BY GOD THEY RE GOING TO TAKE OVER THE INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY  I MEAN  THAT S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT  MR  PRESIDENT  AND MEANWHILE  WHILE THE SO CALLED NUCLEAR OPTION HAS BEEN HANGING OUT OVER THE UNITED STATES SENATE  WHAT IN THE WORLD HAVE WE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS    JANUARY  FEBRUARY  MARCH  APRIL AND NOW THE THIRD WEEK IF MAY  WHEN I GO BACK TO MASSACHUSETTS  THE PEOPLE BACK THERE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE JOB SECURITY AND THE UNEARNTY  THEY RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THEY RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE  THEY RE TALKING ABOUT THE ESCALATING PRICES OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS  THEY RE TALKING ABOUT THE INCREASED COSTS OF TUITION  WHETHER THEIR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO THERE  THEY RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT S HAPPENING IN THE SCHOOLS AND THE SCHOOL DROP OUT PROBLEMS AND THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF THE CLASSROOMS IN OUR NATION DO NOT HAVE WELL TRAINED TEACHERS  THEY RE TALKING ABOUT THE NEEDS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS  THEY RE TALKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTARY SERVICE FOR THEIR CHILDREN GOING TO HIGH SCHOOLS THAT WAS GUARANTEED IN THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND  AND TOO MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AREIN  DOING  THAT S WHAT THEY RE DOING  WHAT   HAVE WE BEEN DOING  WE VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE NUCLEAR OPTION WHICH MEANS WHAT  CHANGE THE RULES  TEAR UP THE EXISTING RULES  AND WE PASS CLASS ACTION BILLS THAT BENEFIT CORPORATE AMERICA  THEY PASS BANKRUPTCY BILLS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY  WE DID TAKE TWO WEEKS AND WELL DESERVEDLY SO ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL  AND WE DID ADD AN AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE SOME ARMOR FOR OUR TROOPS OVER THERE  I HIGHLY APPROVE OF THAT  THAT S IT  THAT S THE RECORD  THAT S THE RECORD  MY FRIENDS  NOTHING THAT REALLY CARES BECAUSE WHY  BECAUSE WE VE BEEN ABSORBED WITH THE NUCLEAR OPTION  CHANGING AND ALTERING THE RULES  95  APPROVAL OF THIS PRESIDENT S NOMINEES HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED     MR  PRESIDENT  I FRANKLY FEEL THAT A GREAT DEAL OF THIS RESPONSIBILITY THE WAKE OF THE CONCLUSION OF THE ELECTION  WHEN ALL OF US SAID  LOOK  THIS PRESIDENT WON  WE CONGRATULATE HIM  WE HAVE TO BRING THE COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER  I CERTAINLY VOICED THAT  MY COLLEAGUE  SENATOR KERRY  CERTAINLY VOICED THAT  WHAT HAPPENED    THE BALLOTS WERE HARDLY IN AND THE VOTES HARDLY COUNTED AND THIS PRESIDENT SENDS UP THE NOMINEES THAT HAVE BEEN DEBATED  DISCUSSED  HEARINGS  AND VOTED ON HERE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND SAID  YOU VE GOT TO PASS THESE UNITED STATES SENATE OR WE RE GOING TO CHANGE THE RULES  WE RE GOING TO CHANGE THE RULES  NOW  I VE TAKEN THE TIME OF THE SENATE IN GOING OVER THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THESE  THESE AREN T JUST ORDINARY NOMINEES    I VE GONE OVER THOSE IN SOME DETAIL  THESE ARE RADICAL  I WOULD SAY RADICAL  OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM  IF YOU EVER    IF A NOMINEE LIKE MR  PRYOR  WHO THINKS WE OUGHT TO REPEAL THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT  I THINK HE S OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM  BUT HE SAYS AND DRAFTS OPINIONS THAT ARE IN COMPLETE CONFLICT AND THAT ARE OVERTURNED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE SUPREME COURT  HE DOESN T UNDERSTAND THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT  HE DOESN T UNDERSTAND THAT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE VOTED FOR AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT TO BRING THOSE THAT ARE CHALLENGED  MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY  INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF AMERICAN SOCIETY  WE SPENT WEEKS AND MONTHS AND YEARS TO PASS THAT LEGISLATION  AND THIS IS NOT ONE SENATOR THAT S GOING TO VOTE FOR SOMEONE THAT ABSOLUTELY WANTS TO UNDERMINE AND EVISCERATE IT  DESTROY IT AND END IT  THAT IS WHAT MR  PRYOR S OPINIONS LEAD TO     NO  THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE MAINSTREAM AND WE VE EXPRESSED THAT AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE DO IT  BUT THAT ISN T SATISFACTORY  THAT S NOT SATISFACTORY TO THIS ADMINISTRATION  NO  NO  THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE RULES  THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE RULES AND THAT S WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT  THEY RE EFFECTIVELY SAYING  LOOK  WE VE NOMINATED AND YOU RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND APPROVE THEM  224 YEARS WHERE THEY HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO SILENCE US  AND NOW THEY RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SILENCE US     WELL  NOT WITH THIS SENATOR S SUPPORT    SO THESE ARE THE RULES  MR  PRESIDENT  AND I WELCOME    THERE ARE GOING TO BE THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT LL DISPUTE THEM  LET THEM PUT THAT IN THE RECORD  FIRST OF ALL  THEY LL HAVE TO SEE    HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE REMAINING               THE PRESIDING OFFICER  FOUR MINUTES               MR  KENNEDY  WOULD THE CHAIR LET ME KNOW WHEN I HAVE TWO     FIRST OF ALL  THEY RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN THAT CHAIR BECAUSE THERE WON T BE ANOTHER SENATOR IN THAT CHAIR TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE RULING BECAUSE IT ISN T GOING TO BE THE RULES OF THE PARLIAMENTARIAN  DOWNED THAT  IT S LIKE GOING TO THE     DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT  IT S LIKE GOING TO THE FOOTBALL GAME AND THE REFEREE AND THE UMPIRE CALLED PENALTY AND SOMEONE ELSE FROM THE CROWD SAYS  OH  NO  THAT DOESN T COUNT  AND FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE S SOMEONE ELSE IN THE CROWD  THAT S WHAT THEY RE DOING  THEY RE GOING TO REPLACE A MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE  WE HAVE  AS WE DO NOW  THE DISTINGUISHED SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE SITTING IN THERE  AND AS THEY DO  PRESIDE OVER THE SENATE     BUT THAT WON T BE TRUE THAT PARTICULAR DAY  AND THEN NEXT THEY RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE    BREAK RULE PARAGRAPH 1 OF RULE V WHICH REQUIRES ONE DAY S SPECIFIC NOTICE IF A SENATOR TRIES SUSPEND OR CHANGE A RULE  THEN THEY LL HAVE TO BREAK PART 2 OF RULE V WHICH PROVIDES THAT SENATE RULES REMAIN IN FORCE FROM CONGRESSTO CONGRESS  THEN THEY LL HAVE TO BREAK PARAGRAPH 2 OF RULE XXII WHICH REQUIRES A MOTION SIGNED BY 16 SENATORS  A TWO DAY WAIT AND A THREE FIFTHS VOTE TO CLOSE DEBATE ON THE NOMINATION THEMSELVES  THEN THEY WILL HE HAVE TO BREAK RULE XXI  THEY RE GOING TO HAVE SCORES OF THESE RULES  THAT S WHAT THEY RE GOING TO HAVE TO DOVMENT IT IS GOING TO MAKE A SHAM    A SHAM    OF THE RULES AND PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES OF THIS BODY  AND IT S WRONG  MR  PRESIDENT  WHAT WE RE WITNESSING IN THIS DEBATE IS AN ARROGANT POWER GRAB BY THE REPUBLICAN RIGHT     THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE RIGHT WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CALLS THE TUNE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AS WHOLE  WE RE NOT SPENDING FIVE MINUTES ON WHAT COUNTS IN MOST PEOPLE S LIVES  SECURE JOBS  HEALTHY FAMILIES  EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY  THOSE AREN T VALUES AND PRIORITIES WE SEE TODAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND THIS REPUBLICAN CONGRESS  TO THEM  HISTORY DOESN T MATTER  MAINSTREAM VALUES DON T MATTER  OUR COMMITMENT ASK TO WORKING FAMILIES     OUR COMMITMENT IS TO WORKING FAMILIES    WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CARES ABOUT TODAY IS PUTTING A RIGHT WING AGENDA AHEAD OF MAINSTREAM VALUES  CORPORATE INTERESTS AHEAD OF THE PUBLIC INTERESTS  AND THE AGENDA OF THE PRIVILEGED FEW AHEAD OF THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR ALL     WE AS SENATORS HAVE A CHOICE AS WELL  WE CAN BREAK THE RULES AND RUN ROUGHSHOD OVER OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES OR WE CAN SEEK ACCOMMODATION AND COMPROMISE FOR THE GOOD OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR NATION  THE ONE THING STANDING BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND TOTAL CONTROL OF THE CONGRESS AND COURTS IS THE SENATE S RIGHT TO FULL AND FAIR DEBATE  LET S NOT GIVE IT UP    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
