EDWARD M  KENNEDYNATIONAL SCHOOL BOARDS LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCEThank you so much  Jane  for that generous introduction   Its a privilege to join you today   NSBA is well known for its leadership in guiding and mobilizing efforts at the federal  state and local levels  and I commend you for all you do so well The governance of our nations schools is among the highest callings of public service   In 1966  during a visit to South Africa  my brother Bobby spoke of public service and of the ability of one individual to create change   He said   Each time a person stands up for an ideal  or acts to improve the lot of others  or strikes out against injustice  he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope  and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring  those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance NSBA has always used its power to send forth such ripples of hope   As you organize your neighbors  form coalitions  stand up for parents and children  and dedicate your energy to improving the schools in your communities  each of you reflects in your work the mission that my brother gave voice to over 40 years ago     Today  more than ever before  we need your leadership and your service to help strengthen Americas future   That future depends on many things  but certainly one of the most important aspects of the strength of our democracy is the excellence of our public schools   As leaders and advocates of that excellence  each of you is at the forefront of the ongoing movement to improve our public schools   In Massachusetts  that movement began in 1837  when the father of public education  Horace Mann  campaigned relentlessly for the support and improvement of public schools   He reminded us that a free and public education was vital to our future   He brought intense public attention to inferior conditions in our schools   He fought to double the wages of teachers  improve textbooks  and build fifty new secondary schools across the state   And Im told that he did it without measuring adequate yearly progress We can learn a great deal from that pioneering spirit as we confront todays challenge   No one disagrees that strengthening education is a key part of advancing the American dream We must improve and strengthen early learning opportunities for each of the nations children  We must support and strengthen our elementary and secondary schools as indispensable fountains of learning capable of giving each student the opportunities to succeed   We must see that schools have the resources to educate students with disabilities and English language learners  so they can be given the opportunity to meet the same high standards as other students     We must remove the economic barriers to higher education   Our security is at stake  and we cant permit the high cost of college to be an obstacle to education any longer      The federal government took a giant step toward these goals when President Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act into law as part of the War on Poverty in 1965  It provided major new federal assistance to the nations schools to help offset the harmful effects of poverty  and make the door to the schoolhouse a true door to opportunity for even the most vulnerable students   Nearly four decades later  in 2002  members of Congress in both parties came together with President Bush to pass the historic No Child Left Behind Act   As you know so well  the law was enacted at a defining moment in public education   New and dynamic challenges had emerged in the economic expansion of the 1990s  demanding major changes in Americas workforce and industry   Education quickly emerged as the indispensable means to meet these new challenges and maintain our progress in the world   At the same time  rampant inequality continued to pose an obstacle to opportunity and progress in many of our schools   The great hope of Brown vs  Board of Education  to provide quality education for all children  was still far from realized  African American and Latino students were not receiving the support they needed to succeed in school   By the centurys end  the reading and math skills of young graduates of color were equal to those of 13 year old white students  Only 52 percent of African American students and 56 percent of Latino students graduated from high school on time compared to 76  of white students  Clearly  we needed a new  national mandate to end these inequities  catalyze reform  and create a level playing field   The answer was the No Child Left Behind Act   Since the laws enactment  schools have faced many challenges in implementation  the most serious of which has been a lack of funding   Problems were so severe in some places local leaders called for the laws suspension or repeal   But  turning back the clock on the law is no solution  especially for the neediest students who gain the most from its reforms  The laws commitment that every child counts  black or white  native born or immigrant  disabled or non disabled  is the right commitment for shaping accountability plans to hold schools responsible for progress   At the time  many state accountability requirements lacked the commitment to quality  equity  and adequacy necessary to ensure an excellent education for every child   Only four states accounted for and reported the achievement of every group of students in their schools   Today  all 50 states have standards  assessment  and accountability systems that enable us to track the achievement of every group of students  Every school now measures its performance   based not on the performance of its overall student population  but by its progress in closing achievement gaps and getting all students to meet high standards   Schools across the country are using data from assessments under the Act to identify weaknesses in instruction and areas of need for their students  In Baltimore  achievement of students in the third grade at Barrister Elementary School has increased 34 points   The school has virtually eliminated the achievement gap between poor and non poor students  thanks to a curriculum better suited to their students needs  weekly meetings with teachers to review student work  and targeted help to children who need it most   In Mobile  Alabama  Austin Elementary School has made progress in closing the achievement gap  and the schools leaders attribute the gain to No Child Left Behinds focus on individual students   That success has encouraged the development of solutions to remove the specific barriers for each student   Additional time and particular intervention strategies are critical to ensuring students  progress  The law also recognized that although standards and assessments are critical building blocks of reform  more is needed to level the playing field in our schools   The law provided for targeted resources for our most vulnerable populations   As a result  over 1 3 million children now have the opportunity to participate in after school programs and 430 000 children in struggling schools receive extra tutoring and academic support for students in struggling schools   The law has expanded support for early reading and literacy skills   It reaches out to give 1 5 million children of migrant workers  and children of immigrants the support and opportunities they need in order to master high standards and succeed in school   Since passage of the law  more than 900 000 homeless students have been identified and are now receiving needed supports   These resources have made a difference   At Granger High School in Granger  Washington  84 percent of the students are low income  82 percent are Latino and about a third are children of migrant agricultural workers   In 2001  only 20 percent of the students met state reading standards  11 percent met state writing standards  and just 4 percent met state math standards The schools guarantee of extra help to any student whose grades fall below a C has made a difference   In 2005  61 percent of students met state reading standards  51 percent met state writing standards  and 31 percent met state math standards  Granger High School has made impressive achievements  but still has far to go   Richard Esparza  the principal  recognizes the challenges ahead   His license plate reads Se Puede  it can be done  The No Child Left Behind Act also recognized the importance of teachers to student progress and required increased availability of professional development and a new focus on teacher qualifications   As a result  fewer teachers are teaching outside their area of expertise   In California  for example  the number of teachers who are not certified in the subject they are teaching was cut in half between 2001 and 2005    These are important advances in our nations schools and we should not dismiss them lightly   But more  much more  remains to be done    As we move to reauthorize the law this spring  our Committee on Education will hold a series of hearings and roundtable discussions to hear from experts like you and others on the front line living with the laws challenges on a daily basis   Well move quickly on a bill that helps our schools advance  not retreat  to respond to the challenge of providing a good education to all students and closing the achievement gap   Our goal will be to work on a bipartisan basis to develop a strong bill that builds on the positive aspects of the law  meets the concerns about its implementation  and encourages reforms that will be effective in helping students succeed   Our strategy is to provide the solutions schools need to ensure that every student succeeds  and to consider new and creative ideas to help the law work for all students  First  well do more to see that resources are available to bring needed reforms to schools   Reform and resources is still the right recipe for our schools   Each year yields greater success when educators commit in the long term to higher standards  better teacher training  stronger accountability  and extra help for students in need  As experience has shown  these good results are not possible without new investments   This effort will require a broad partnership with parents  school leaders  local communities  states  and the federal government  and well insist that Uncle Sam do more to fulfill his commitment to that partnership   In preparing the law in 2002  we recognized that a continuous infusion of federal resources would be critical to achieve its goals  At the time the law passed  Congress delivered  22 billion to support public education  an increase of 20 percent over the previous year  an unprecedented federal investment The law also promised increased funding levels over the life of its provisions  in step with the increase in targets for student performance   But that commitment was not met     Today  half of all public school districts face funding cuts   at a time when the No Child law is asking them to do even more   Last year  every state was required to implement reading and math tests in every grade and new standards in science   Proficiency goals increased in 35 states and over 9 000 low income schools have been identified as needing improvement under the law  The federal government has also failed to fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act adequately   We are already over  6 billion short of the commitment made just two years ago when we renewed that law   We cannot reform our schools and move forward in this new century to master the nations challenges on a tin cup education budget   When we say no child left behind  we mean no child   We have to be willing to make the tough choices and the hard sacrifices to improve education in America   More than ever before in our history  its the key to future opportunity and success for children  and we dont intend to fall short       Second  well find more effective ways to measure progress  see that all students are reaching high standards  and focus on the lowest performing schools instead of labeling so many schools as failures   Its essential to improve our system of accountability   We need more effective ways to measure student progress towards grade level standards   We also need to create incentives for states to see that their standards are not just nationally but internationally competitive  so that graduates can be successful in this new global economy   We must focus as well on interventions in schools with the greatest challenges   Some problems can be addressed with targeted strategies   Others need a more aggressive response   Greater emphasis is needed to help struggling schools turn around   Our goal for schools needing improvement is new investments  not punitive policies   This means building an infrastructure at the state and local level to respond to the over 9 000 low income schools identified for improvement under No Child Left Behinds accountability standards   Well explore new partnerships to provide the expert attention and assistance essential for progress by these schools   Teachers and principals need innovative ways to understand the available data and use it to improve teaching in the classroom   Well explore ways to encourage individualized instruction for students  and additional time for planning and support for teachers   If schools that miss the mark are truly on their way toward improving  well give them ample time under the law to demonstrate and document their progress     Third  well look for creative ideas to meet our common goal to turn around struggling schools  including extended school days  parent and community initiatives  and high school reform   Accountability for progress must not result in narrowing curriculums   Expanding the school day can help here   At Roxbury Prep Charter School in Massachusetts  an expanded day has meant increased time for instruction in math and English  but it has also brought time for new enrichment activities  including athletics and the arts   Test scores have risen  and so have graduation rates   On the 2006 8th grade math test  Roxbury Prep outperformed every school district in the entire state      We also need to do more to respond to the non academic needs of students  which make such a difference in how well children learn in school   That means support for community programs to meet childrens social  emotional  and physical needs   It means making parent involvement a top priority  and offering support to schools to involve parents and families more effectively in their childs education Last year  a Massachusetts pilot initiative placed 15 full time Family and Community Outreach Coordinators in Boston Public Schools   The Coordinators were responsible for supporting families  teachers  and the community in a common effort to help students excel academically and socially   We know that integrated support services increase graduation rates and student achievement   In one national study  82 percent of students improved their attendance in school  89 percent of students had fewer suspensions  98 percent of students stayed in school and 85 percent of eligible seniors graduated       As we help schools meet high goals for student proficiency  we must be careful to see that students are not dropping out   We need all students to reach high standards  not just the ones left standing as more and more students drop out   According to the Department of Education  3 7 million students age 16 to 24 had dropped out of school   Numbers like that are clearly unacceptable   Individualized help is needed for students struggling in math and reading at the secondary school level   Dropout recovery programs are essential as well  and so are smaller learning communities in large schools   And all students  of course  deserve a challenging college prep curriculum         These strategies have been shown to work   In the late 1990s  Strawberry Mansion High School in Philadelphia was seen as one of the worst high schools in the city   In 2001  only 2 percent of its eleventh grade students were proficient in mathematics  and none were proficient in reading   Less than a third of its students graduated   Today  after implementation of a range of whole school reforms  including smaller learning communities within the school and intensive professional development  Strawberry Mansion is an example of a high school that has completely turned around   Over the past six years  the number of students proficient in mathematics has increased by 51 percentage points and the number proficient in reading by 35 percentage points   The graduation rate has doubled       Fourth  we must renew our commitment to teacher quality and help the neediest schools to attract and keep good teachers   We know that teachers are the most important resource in any school   We will never close the achievement gap unless students have well qualified teachers and the other support they need We also recognize that the best teachers are not just well qualified by professional development standards   There is also an intangible quality  a dedication  a chemistry  that enables the best teachers to reach the heart as well as the mind of a young student  and plant a seed of learning that will long endure   I was struck by a survey I saw recently showing that student rankings of their best teachers often tended to single out persons who had little advanced training or degrees  but who nevertheless had a special talent in the classroom We need to do all we can to see that this kind of talent is nurtured in modern professional development  so that when we speak of well qualified teachers  this special quality will also be part of the equation We must make attracting and keeping good teachers in the neediest schools a top priority   Students in the highest poverty schools are assigned novice teachers almost twice as often as students in low poverty schools  and the same is true in schools with a high minority population  We need incentives to attract the best teachers to the schools that need them most  and increased salaries for those with a track record of success who can help their peers improve their teaching ability and succeed in the profession   Many districts are implementing these reforms with dramatic results   Bell Street Middle School in Clinton  South Carolina offered teachers career advancement opportunities  ongoing professional development  opportunities for collaboration  and higher pay based on effectiveness and the willingness to take on leadership roles   Before these changes were implemented  teacher turnover was a serious problem  40  of teachers left in 1999 and 32  left in 2000   In the last three years  the turnover rate has been consistently below 10         In Chattanooga  the Benwood Initiative focused on the nine lowest performing elementary schools in the city  The initiative expanded professional development  mentoring and other support for teachers  It established a principal leadership academy and offered incentives such as bonuses and low interest mortgages for high performing teachers and principals to teach in the highest need schools  In just two years  from 2003 to 2005  the number of fifth graders who were proficient in reading increased 18 percentage points  and fifth graders proficient in math increased 19 percent percentage points These are just a few of the reforms we have learned about in the past five years  and I look forward to working with each of you as we seek needed improvements in the law For over two centuries  educational opportunity has been an enduring American truth  John Adams  of Massachusetts  emphasized this commitment in 1780  when he said  education of the people was necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberty Whats needed now is a recommitment to that spirit  and to the principles of excellence and equality of opportunity that have shaped federal legislation like the No Child Left Behind Act   We must build on these principles and ensure theyre fulfilled   As Reverend Martin Luther King  Jr  said  There is no easy way to create a world       where all children receive as much education as their minds can absorb   But if such a world can be created in our lifetime  it will be done in the United States       by people of good will   Well be a large step closer to that goal  with your help  when we successfully reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act this year   Thank you very much BackgroundNCLB Reauthorization ProposalsSENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDYSupporting High Quality Teaching   Senator Kennedys proposal would identify high performing teachers and provides them career advancement opportunities  additional pay with additional responsibilities  so that our best teachers can earn more money  move ahead  and serve as instructional leaders and mentors to new teachers   He would shift professional development under his plan toward a model thats more relevant to teachers needs to help teachers take charge of their own growth   Senator Kennedy would explore ways to expand the laws requirements to promote teacher effectiveness  in addition to the subject matter competencies already required under the law   and he strongly supports closing the teacher distribution gap so that all students  regardless of race and income  have access to an excellent teacher   Better Solutions for Low Performing Schools   Senator Kennedy believes that its important to re affirm that NCLB is not designed as a tool to criticize public schools  but instead to identify challenges and address them   He supports funding to ensure that states have the resources needed to deliver expert technical assistance and help to schools needing improvement or corrective action   Senator Kennedys proposal would help train teachers in low performing schools on how to use data to improve instruction  better align curriculum and instruction to standards  provide educational advisors and coaches with specific expertise in turning around low performing schools  and pair low performing with similar higher performing schools Strengthening Parent Community Involvement   Active parent and community involvement is critical to the academic success of students   Senator Kennedys proposal would encourage parent  family  and community involvement in schools  by providing parent family outreach coordinators in low income schools  Under his plan  this coordinator would serve as a liaison with the community  oversee parent engagement and activities  and help access outside services and supports for children   High School and Middle School Modernization   A critical part of ensuring our students are prepared to meet the 21st century demands of college and the workplace is the modernization of our middle and high schools   Senator Kennedy supports individualized help for students struggling in math and reading at the secondary school level   He also believes we need to bring greater alignment between middle and high schools standards and curriculum and the expectations of college and the workplace through the standards initiative described above  but also through promotion of models that allow students to pursue college level work as soon as possible  such as dual enrollment  early college  International Baccalaureate  and Advanced Placement programs   He supports greater investments in dropout prevention and recovery programs  and the creation of small schools and smaller learning communities within large schools Rigorous State Standards   As todays economy re defines the knowledge and skills needed to compete in the global marketplace  its crucial now more than ever for our schools to challenge all students to learn to high standards    Senator Kennedys proposal would modernize public education by disseminating national benchmarks and providing assistance to states to upgrade and improve academic standards and curriculum  to better match what students need to know and be able to do as they enter college or the workforce   His proposal would also establish State Councils  comprised of the education community  business  and other state and local stakeholders  to facilitate this process   Improving Student Assessment   Not only is assessment an important tool in teaching and learning  but the accountability decisions under NCLB are only as good as the instruments used to measure student achievement   Senator Kennedy supports enhancing the quality of assessments under the law so that theyre more useful and appropriate for teachers and students   His proposal would create a new fund for states to develop better assessment and data systems that track the progress and growth of students from year to year  and to review and improve assessments and policies for limited English proficient and special needs children  two populations for which NCLBs current assessments are less than adequate        Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
