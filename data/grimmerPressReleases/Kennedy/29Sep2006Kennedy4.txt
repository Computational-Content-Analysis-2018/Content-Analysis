prepared for delivery     Forty years ago  when Robert Kennedy and Harvard President Nathan Pusey signed the charter to create the IOP  their goal was not just to create a living memorial to President Kennedy  They wanted to fulfill one of Jacks highest goals  to bring the world of ideas and the students who live in it closer to the world of politics    As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said a century ago  explaining his lifelong passion for the law  Through our great good fortune  in our youth our hearts were touched with fire    Bobby and I knew that when Jack was a student here at Harvard  something had sparked that flame within him  and we hoped that the IOP would do the same for succeeding generations of undergraduates  We wanted this Institute to inspire young men and women not just to public service  but to real and active involvement in the life of our communities  our nation and our time    We hoped that by engaging students in major policy issues and exposing you to the world of politics  the Institute would motivate you to see politics as it should be  and to work to make it that way    President Kennedy loved to tell the story of the famous Gallup Poll of his day  which found that parents wanted their children to be President  as long as they didnt have to be involved in politics    It was a line that always got a laugh  but to Jack it was hardly a laughing matter  He loved and lived by the famous words of John Buchan in Pilgrims Progress  that  Public life is the crown of a career  and to young persons it is the worthiest ambition  Politics is still the greatest and most honorable adventure   Tonight  as we celebrate the work of this Institute and reflect on Jacks legacy  Im here to tell you that those words are still true today  Theyre true despite the partisan wrangling that taints political discourse  especially during this election season  Theyre true despite the pronouncements of media pundits who all too often reduce our debates to opposing sound bites  Theyre true despite the demagoguery of some in Washington and on the campaign trail  who are quick to adopt the rhetoric of us versus them  when the realities of the issues were dealing with are far more complex   Yes  politics is still the greatest and most honorable adventure  And as long as you carry within you the faith that those words are true  theyll remain true  no matter how that faith is challenged by day  to day events   Today  our faith in Americas political institutions is being seriously challenged  In fact  were witnessing the one of the greatest erosions of political institutions in our nations history   At its best  politics is about community and the kind of society and nation and world we want to live in  In our history  that principle of community is as old as the Mayflower that brought the pilgrims from England to our shores nearly 400 years ago  Even before they landed at Plymouth that winter day in December of 1620  they drew up an extraordinary agreement  the Mayflower Compact  to provide for governing the colony by the will of the majority   A century and a half later  after our independence was won  delegates from all the quarrelling colonies were able to come together  and in their incredible wisdom  they were able to establish a new American community for the ages   The Constitution they created to guide that community was politics at its all time best  and it made possible the immense achievements of our history ever since   They understood that power corrupts  and that absolute power corrupts absolutely  To restrain it and protect America from tyranny  they established separate executive  legislative  and judicial branches  But that creation is under threat today  The administration in power has increasingly asserted a right to act in secrecy and ignore laws passed by Congress  The Republican leadership in Congress willingly acts as a rubber stamp  disciplining party members to vote its way  reject contrary views  and even limit open discussion  All too often  Congress is willing to capitulate to the demands of the president  even if it means violating long standing congressional rules  traditions  and basic constitutional responsibilities   With the exception of the recent Hamdan decision  in which the Supreme Court struck down the military commissions established by President Bush for trials of suspected members of al Qaeda  our courts have not yet stepped up to the challenges posed by these excessive claims of presidential power  The Administration is bent on keeping it that way  constantly pressuring the Senate to stack the courts with judges who will look the other way  The result is a federal system that is dangerously unbalanced  If we care about the future of our country  we must revitalize the Framers vision of three co equal branches of government that respect and check one another   Some argue that these are new and dangerous times  that the end justifies the means  and that the shift in the balance of power among our political institutions is necessary for a commander in chief to keep the nation safe from the threat of global terrorism    But the nation has faced dangerous times before  and often it was the system of checks and balances that enabled us to get through those times   Consider the challenges our nation faced 40 years ago  when the Institute of Politics was founded  The challenges were enormous  and at times seemed insurmountable  The Cold War raged  The Vietnam War was escalating  Millions took to the streets in protest  Leaders were murdered  Cities burned  Young men and women gave their lives daring to call for civil rights   But through it all  our institutions did their jobs  and because of that  our country was able to find the way forward  even in the midst of immense policy challenges abroad and dramatic social upheavals at home   We did not have leaders then who insisted on usurping authority and governing in secret in order to achieve their objectives  Instead  we had leaders  in both the White House and Congress  who were able to govern from a position of power with the authority they had  and who challenged us to be a better and fairer nation  even in the midst of troubling times   Their politics were the politics of hope  not the politics of fear  and the result was a better and fairer America for all    It was the politics of hope that enabled us to transform the strife that gripped our nation over race and enabled us to enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965  two cornerstones of President Kennedys agenda that were realized under President Johnson     It was the politics of hope that enabled us to achieve another of President Kennedys goals  the landmark immigration legislation in 1965 that reinstated the heritage of the United States as a nation of immigrants made stronger by their presence  That single law eliminated the notorious Asian Pacific Triangle and the ugly quotas that allowed only a handful of Asians to enter the country each year  The enormous contribution of Asian immigrants since then has proved again that the United States is stronger  not weaker  because of our diversity   The politics of hope enabled us to lower the voting age to 18 in 1970  so that young men and women like yourselves could be more active in the political life of our community  We realized that if they were old enough to fight in the Vietnam War  they were old enough to vote on issues of war and peace and other major challenges  and help to change our country for the better   The politics of hope enabled us to enact Medicare and Medicaid  guaranteeing good health care for all our senior citizens and for those in poverty  Throughout history  respect for the elderly and those in need has been the hallmark of every great nation  By enacting Medicare and Medicaid  we were saying that the care of the elderly and the needy reflected our basic values   To be sure  many of these battles were brutal and hard fought  But through it all  we followed basic guidelines  respect for our community and its institutions and our founding principles  respect for each other  and a vision of politics and public service as a way to bring out the very best in our people  not the very worst  As a result  we continued the drumbeat for equality and opportunity  and we made unprecedented progress toward an America where government is  in fact  of the people  by the people  and for the people  where politics is about our common community and our shared humanity  and where every citizen has a fair opportunity to achieve the American dream  By contrast  the politics of fear so prevalent today is exactly the opposite  It thumbs its nose at our institutions and their place in our constitutional structure  It caters to the worst instincts of our people and seeks to tear others down  Most troublingly  it undermines respect for our ideals and way of life  the most powerful source of our influence as a nation    Compare  for example  the current debate over immigration to the debate 40 years ago  Instead of starting from a vision that views immigrants as an overwhelmingly positive for our country  indeed  as the people who literally built our nation and made it great  the politics of fear today has allowed the bigoted and xenophobic attitudes of some to occupy an unworthy place in our discourse    This year  many of us have worked hard to develop a compromise that would secure our borders  open the door of America to adequate numbers of those who wish to enter  and create a strict but fair pathway to citizenship for the many who are now here illegally  but who play by the rules in every other way   Despite our best efforts  there are many in Congress who believe that the only solution is to build an 850 mile long fence along our nations southwestern border  The Senate already voted to approve a 370 mile fence  exactly what Secretary Chertoff said he needed for targeted urban areas  Yet  there are those who want to build even higher and longer fences and they want to round up and deport all those who are here illegally  without regard for their contributions to our society and our economy   By and large  those who put forward these ideas in Congress are practitioners of the politics of fear  They are less concerned with border security than with the security of their own seats in the House and Senate    Consider how the politics of fear has shaped the priorities of the Republican Congress  This year  we spent precious time debating proposals to amend the Constitution to ban flag burning and gay marriage  two proposals that Republicans knew would never pass  But their goal was not to enact them  Their aim was simply to stoke the fear and anger of those who oppose these ideas  and use that fear and anger to score cheap political points   Or consider the actions of the administration in the war against terrorism  The government has indefinitely detained hundreds of individuals thought to be linked to al Qaeda  Many are people against whom the government has brought no charges and presented no evidence  and who have no recourse to justice in any form     Others have been detained overseas in secret CIA prisons which only recently have come to light  Theyve been subjected to interrogation techniques that all of us would describe as torture  Some of our leaders even argue that the Geneva Conventions  which have guided the rules of war for many years  are irrelevant in this new age and no longer need to be followed    Just yesterday  Congress passed and sent to the President new legislation that will strip detainees in the war on terror of their rights to challenge their detention in court  That legislation will also subject detainees to trials before military commissions that simply do not comport with our long held notions of fundamental fairness   Such policies are a far cry from the values our leaders embraced when the IOP was founded in 1966  That year  the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision that those accused of a crime must at least be informed of their basic due process rights  a fundamental principle of the American legal system  But under the politics of fear  even fundamental principles are called into question for political advantage    And when the politics of fear are combined with the erosion of our political institutions so central to our system of checks and balances  the result is what we are now enduring with the war in Iraq   For more than three years  we were told that the war is making America safer  Despite the fact that no weapons of mass destruction were discovered  despite the lack of any serious link between Iraq and the attack on our country on September 11th  despite the fact that Osama bin Laden was still at large  we were constantly told the war in Iraq was somehow achieving progress in the battle against global terrorism   Now we know from the recently disclosed National Intelligence Estimate of last April that all 16 agencies in our intelligence community had concluded just the opposite  Instead of lessening the threat of terrorism  our actions in Iraq have made the war on terror even more difficult to win   Perhaps  if the Republican Congress had not acquiesced in the Presidents demand for unprobing acceptance of his agenda  we would not find ourselves in this place  Perhaps  if our institutions had done their jobs  as they did in prior times of strife  we could have avoided going down this path of greater peril    Given all that Ive just said  you may wonder why I believe that politics is still the greatest and most honorable adventure  and the worthiest ambition of the young  Despite all these examples  I still believe in the politics of hope  Throughout our history  when leaders have provided hope and have unified the country in a common vision  Americans have risen to the challenge  That is still part of the American spirit today  Even as we struggle with these constant challenges to our constitutional system and our ideals  there are still times when we in the political arena are able to step up to the plate  try our best  and get something right      For example  weve managed to renew and even improve some of the landmark civil rights laws passed during those halcyon days four decades ago  This year  Congress renewed the Voting Rights Act  and managed to ensure that it remains as strong as ever  despite the arguments of some that the protections necessary to guarantee the right to vote a generation ago are no longer needed today   1966 was the first full year under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act  which marked the federal governments first major initiative in that aspect of education  and the first major effort by Congress to correct the vast injustices in public schools  especially those that serve low income and minority children    We expanded those efforts recently in a rare act of bipartisanship  The No Child Left Behind Act uses ideas developed here in Massachusetts and other states to create a way for all schools to be held accountable for educating all students  The Act has been under funded since its passage  but its principles are right and just  And when it comes up for renewal next year  Ill continue to fight for adequate funding so that its noble goals can be realized for all students   1966 also saw the establishment of the National Organization for Women  Few would argue that our goal of equality for women in our society has been achieved  but fewer still would argue that we havent come a long way forward in the 40 years that have passed   So its evident that despite the setbacks of recent years  the idea of politics as a noble and honorable calling remains strong  And its stronger because of those challenges  One thing Ive learned in public service is that the toughest issues of our day are seldom resolved in weeks  months  or even years  You have to work at them  You have to persist  You have to build and maintain relationships  not only with those with whom you agree  but with those who come from opposite sides of the political spectrum    And you have to be unafraid to fail  You must have the resolve to continue for as long as necessary    Thats where all of you come in  This anniversary is not only a time to honor this magnificent institute and celebrate its accomplishments    Its also a call to the IOP and to each of you to make the commitment that will carry our nation forward in the future  whatever the troubles of the times  Youll be amazed at the difference you can make  the mountains you can move     As Archimedes said in ancient Greece  Give me a lever and a place to stand  and I can move the world  The Institute of Politics has given you the lever  and the rest is up to you    As Robert Kennedy said in addressing the students at the University of Capetown in 1966  each time a person stands up for an ideal  or acts to improve the lot of others  or strikes out against injustice  he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope  and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring  those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance   I look forward to the ripples of hope that all of you will send out in the future  As the IOP marks 40 Years of Inspiration in the events tonight and this weekend  let us also renew its mission for the coming years    At a time when our nation faces the complex challenges of the war in Iraq and the global war on terrorism  and seeks a greater understanding of other cultures  let us celebrate the IOPs great service as a forum for world leaders to speak their views  and as a space for students and citizens to respond    At a time when the United States finds its economic position challenged by the rapidly evolving forces of globalization  let us reaffirm the Institutes commitment to performing the sound research and solid work on which good policy is founded     As bitter debates and narrow partisanship mar our political discourse  let us re emphasize the IOPs extraordinary role of engaging students in debate for the purpose of coming together for the common good    Let us never forget President Kennedys words  that leadership and learning are indispensable to each other  Make that your guiding star  In doing so  you will continue to ensure that this Institute continues to be a remarkable living tribute to his legacy and to John Buchans famous words    I commend these principles and this mission to each of you and I welcome the great work you will do in times ahead as you put the valuable experiences youve gained at this Institute of Politics into practice in the service of our nation  In doing so  may you make the next forty years of the IOP even greater than the first
