         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today  on the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee and the author of the Children s Health Insurance Program  urged the President to support Congresss efforts to cover more children  Yesterday the Census Report revealed that number of uninsured has skyrocketed from 44 8 million in 2005 to 47 million in 2006  Over 600 000 more children are now uninsured than were in 2005  with an increase from 8 million to 8 7 million in just one year  The poverty rate declined by  3  in 2006 and little changed in the total number of Americans living in poverty  Senator Kennedy issued the following statement  The violent winds and flood of Katrina tore away the mask that has long concealed the silent slavery of poverty in so much of our society  Katrina showed how long a journey we still have to make to live up to America s promise  Sadly  just yesterday we learned from the latest census statistics that more and more families are not moving forward on that journey  but staying behind in poverty and struggling with the health care that they need but cant afford  Health care costs are skyrocketing  yet the number of Americans who can t count on having a family doctor continues to grow  As President tours the Gulf Coast today  I hope he comes to the right conclusion that more of our nations children need a healthy start in life  not fewer The disaster of reminds us  we re all part of a family    and we have a responsibility to help members of our family in need  Government must respond in ways that are as good and as compassionate as the American people  We know what must be done  We re a stronger country when we re a fairer country  Inequality and injustice undermine our economy  our security  our standing in the world  our future      Laura Burton Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
