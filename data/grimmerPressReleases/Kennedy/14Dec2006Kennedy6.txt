         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement It s hardly surprising that Sallie Mae would take a proposal intended to protect students and spin it as an attack on college financial aid professionals  In reality  financial aid administrators and students are the ones being attacked by money lenders aggressively marketing private loans that may not offer the lowest interest rates for students This onslaught of pressure is exactly why I ve proposed the Student Loan Sunshine Act  Far from being ill conceived or unwarranted  the Act responds to the growing number of documented cases in which private lenders pull out all the stops to pitch their wares to woo colleges and gouge students The vast majority of financial aid administrators are doing all they can to make sure that students obtain the funds they need to pay for college  The problem is the big lenders who put profits ahead of students  not the college administrators   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
