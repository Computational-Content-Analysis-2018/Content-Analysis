         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C     Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy and former Senator John Edwards celebrated the success of their month long online initiative to recruit Citizen Co Sponsors for the Senator Kennedy s Fair Minimum Wage Act  Over 100 000 Citizen Co Sponsors signed a statement supporting Kennedy s Fair Minimum Wage Act and demanding a vote on the minimum wage as soon as possible  Over the past ten years  members of Congress have raised their own pay by  31 000  but the minimum wage hasn t gone up a cent and remains more than  6 000 below the poverty line for a family of three   The issue resonates strongly with the people  because it s fundamentally about fairness  Americans understand fairness  They know the difference between right and wrong  Senator Kennedy said  It s wrong that hard working men and women can t afford to put food on the table or heat their homes  It s wrong to give billions upon billions of dollars in tax relief to the wealthy  and then but turn your back on the hard working families who live in poverty each day  It is wrong that in our prosperous nation  14 million children go to bed hungry each night  Kennedy and Edwards were joined by hundreds of grassroots activists that have been inspired to join the minimum wage fight  and have witnessed firsthand the popular outcry for a raise in the minimum wage  Building on this groundswell of public activism  Senator Kennedy and Senator Edwards called on the Republican leadership for an immediate vote on Kennedy s bill to raise the minimum wage  Attached is a fact sheet on Kennedy s plan and his remarks as prepared for delivery    Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy Minimum Wage Rally    AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY    In 1776  the founders of our country set forth a bold vision of what our country should be  They declared our independence  because they wanted a nation that was ruled not by a king  but by the people  Today  however  we have an Administration in power that all too often ignores the will of the people and favors special interests  not the millions of hardworking families who are the backbone of America  Nothing illustrates that better than the refusal of the Administration and its rubber stamp Congress to raise the minimum wage  It s been nine long years since the minimum wage was last increased  It s been stuck at  5 15 an hour since 1997  The bill I favor would raise it to  5 65 right away   6 75 a year from now  and  7 25 two years from now  Again and again  however  our Republican colleagues have refused to give minimum wage workers any raise at all  let alone the raise they deserve  Shamefully  Congress has raised its own pay by  31 000 in the past nine years  without providing a penny for minimum wage workers  Congress and the White House are ignoring the issue  but the American people are not  They see their friends and neighbors struggling to get by  and they want to help  Across the nation  citizens are raising their voices to demand an increase  They agree that no one who works for a living should have to live in poverty  In a moment we ll hear from some of the citizens who have joined the battle in their own states  Nearly half the states have enacted increases for their own populations  and we re honored to be here with some of these activists this afternoon  It s their dedication that inspired Senator John Edwards and me to launch the citizen s campaign that we re here to celebrate today  We asked people to sign their names as citizen co sponsors of the Fair Minimum Wage Act  In the past month  the response has been overwhelming  Over 100 000 people have signed on to say that a fair increase in the minimum wage is long overdue  The issue resonates strongly with the people  because it s fundamentally about fairness  Americans understand fairness  They know the difference between right and wrong   It s wrong that hard working men and women can t afford to put food on the table or heat their homes   It s wrong to give billions upon billions of dollars in tax relief to the wealthy  and then but turn your back on the hard working families who live in poverty each day   It is wrong that in our prosperous nation  14 million children go to bed hungry each night  I hope that each of you here today has signed on to show your support  If not  I invite you to do so now  And I ask you to sign your name as big as you can  When the founders issued the Declaration of Independence  John Hancock signed it in very large letters  He said he did it so King George could read it without his glasses on  So put your John Hancock on this petition in big letters  so King George in the White House can t miss it  They know November is coming at them  and they ll have to answer to the American people  I promise each and every one of you I won t rest  I won t give up this fight until Congress finally raises the minimum wage    RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS    The Fair Minimum Wage Act would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps       5 85 60 days after enactment    6 55 one year later    7 25 one year after that    The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 3 million since President Bush took office  37 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Among full time  year round workers  poverty has doubled since the late 1970s  An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem      Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  earn  10 700 a year   4 500 below the poverty line for a family of three  Since Congress last acted to raise the minimum wage in 1996  the value has eroded by 18 percent     Every day the minimum wage is not increased it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind  Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase      Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  3 00 below what it was in 1968  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  8 50 an hour today  not  5 15      Seven and a half million workers will directly benefit from the minimum wage increase       Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 370 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families  It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy     More than one year of groceries   Over 9 months of rent   A year and a half of heat and electricity  or  full tuition for a community college degree     This year  the Senate raised its pay  3 100  It is shameful that Members of Congress receive our seventh pay increase in nine years  yet in those same nine years  we have not provided a single pay increase to the lowest paid workers      Salaries of lawmakers will have gone up by  31 600 since 1997 while minimum wage workers continue to earn just  10 700 a year     History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation  In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades  Nearly 11 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 232 000 per month  In contrast  since President Bush took office the minimum wage has held steady  but only 1 8 new million jobs have been created     A fair increase is long overdue  Congress should act as quickly as possible to pass a minimum wage increase that reflects the losses suffered as the result of our shameful inaction in the past  No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
