         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  these are very difficult days in our history   The war in Iraq  continues to impose an unacceptably heavy toll on our military  their families   our national security  and our ability to lead the world   I intend to vote for  the Levin Reed amendment  and I urge the Senate to approve it   America  is paying an enormous cost for a war we never should have fought  and its time  to bring it to an end   The war has divided us here at home  and it has  made us more isolated in the world   Never before  even in the Vietnam War  has  America taken such massive military action with so little international support    As the intelligence community confirmed yet again today  the war has  become a significant recruitment tool for Al Qaeda   It said  we assess that Al  Qaedas association with Al Qaeda Iraq helps Al Qaeda to energize the broader  Sunni extremist community  raise resources  and to recruit and indoctrinate  operatives  including for Homeland attacks   This has obviously made the war on  terrorism harder  not easier  to win  Nevertheless  the Administration  still continues to turn a deaf ear to all the voices calling for change   It  continues to plead for more and more time to pursue its failed course in Iraq    Republicans in the Senate continue to filibuster any effort to outline  a clear timetable for the withdrawal of American troops   The disastrous  consequences of our policy could have been avoided if the President and his  advisors had asked the right questions before rushing headlong into an  unnecessary and unjust war  In my church  there are six principles which  guide the determination of just war   They were first developed by St   Augustine in the Fifth Century and expanded by St  Thomas Aquinas in the  Thirteenth Century    To be just  a war must have a just cause   confronting a danger that is beyond question  It must be declared by legitimate  authority acting on behalf of the people  It must be driven by the right  intention  not ulterior  self interested motives  It must be a last resort   It  must be proportional  so that the harm inflicted does not outweigh the good  achieved  And it must have a reasonable chance of success   These are  the sound criteria by which the President should have judged our war in Iraq    But he failed our men and women in uniform by refusing to seek honest answers  to these important questions before recklessly plunging the nation into war    We now know  with crystal clarity  that the war in Iraq did not meet  these criteria    Saddam did not pose the kind of threat that justified  this war  But we went to war anyway  without legitimate support from the  international community   The Administration was wrong to allow the  anti Iraq zealots in its ranks to exploit the 9 11 tragedy to make war against  Iraq a higher priority than the war against terrorism in  Afghanistan  War with Iraq was most certainly not the last resort   All  options were not pursued   We should have given inspectors more time to reveal  that there were  in fact  no weapons of mass destruction   The human  cost of this war has been unacceptable   More than 3 600 Americans have been  killed and nearly 27 000 have wounded   Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been  killed  and Iraq has descended into civil war  The Administrations  incompetence in waging this misguided war has left no reasonable chance of  success  Americans have spoken clearly and urgently about the need to  end the war  and its time for the President to listen to their  pleas  We should end this war with the scaled back mission for our  troops and the clear timetable for withdrawal specified in the Levin Reed  amendment  America has been sadly diminished in the world because of  this colossal blunder  Anti Americanism is on the rise  We seem to have lost our  way  our vision  and our confidence in the future    In his farewell  address to the nation in January 1989  Ronald Reagan described one of the  singular triumphs of his presidency   the recovery of American standing and  morale   I believe he was right when he said America is respected again in the  world and looked to for leadership   Other nations understood that the  best guarantee of peace and stability was for the United States to live up to  its ideals as a beacon of hope for the rest of the planet   We were admired for  our democracy and respected for our economic strength  Today  others  have stopped listening to us the way they once did  At the end of June  the Pew  Global Attitudes Project reported that since 2002  the image of the United  States has plummeted throughout the world   Our image is abysmal in most Muslim  countries and it continues to decline among the people of many of Americas  oldest allies     We have strained the extraordinary alliances that  advanced our ideals as well as our interests  At the root of much of the  anti Americanism that has surfaced in recent years is the perception of American  unilateralism in international affairs    Im astonished when some say  it does not matter that so many in the world no longer respect the United  States   Of course it matters   It matters to our security  and it has mattered  since the first days of our Republic  The opening paragraph of the Declaration  of Independence acknowledges the importance of a decent respect for the  opinions of mankind   That respect is as important today as it was when our  founders signed the declaration affirming it on that first Fourth of July       To restore Americas standing and strength  we must end the war in  Iraq and recapture that combination of realism and idealism that have inspired  Americans for generations  Ending this unacceptable war is essential to our  security and to regaining our respect in the world  The great challenges  facing our fragile planet require an abundance of hope that only a united and  determined America can provide   America has to lead   America has to inspire    But we cannot do so if we remain bogged down in Iraqs civil war    Might alone cannot make America right   By prescribing our own rules  for the modern world  we have deprived our great nation of the moral claim that  is the basis of our being and the purpose of our power  and we are paying an  exorbitant price   We can and sometimes must defend democracy by force   but we cannot impose it by force   Democratic principles are universal  but  democracy must find its champions within each countrys culture and  traditions  We need to end the war and regain a time when America is  able to seek common ground with our friends  We need to renew the alliances that  kept the world safe for human rights and human survival when the threat of  nuclear war was a clear and present danger  We will always defend our interests   but we put them at grave risk when we act unilaterally in an interdependent  world     We live in a time of enormous possibility and enormous risk   No nation is guaranteed a limitless future of prosperity or security   We have  to work for it   We have to sacrifice for it   The sacrifices we are making in  Iraq are no longer worth the immense cost in human lives or the immense cost to  our national prestige and interest  President Bush has squandered every  opportunity to stabilize Iraq   Any honest assessment can realistically lead to  only one conclusion   Americas interests will be best served when our military  disengages from Iraq  Certainly  there will be violence when our combat  troops leave   But there will be far more violence if we continue to police  Iraqs civil war indefinitely  as the President proposes       Last  week  President Bush said There is war fatigue in America  Its affecting our  psychology    For once  the President is right     There is fatigue in  America     Americans are tired of an Administration whose ill conceived  notion of preventive war plunged this nation into Iraqs bloody civil war    Americas are tired of an administration that told us the mission was  accomplished  when the tally of American dead was only beginning to mount      Americans are tired of an administration that continues to promise  that hope is just around the corner  and begs for time for a policy that stands  no chance of succeeding now  in September  or ever  Years ago  one of  the giants of the Senate said that partisanship should stop at the waters edge    Arthur Vandenberg  the Republican from Michigan  who was chairman of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee  worked closely with President Truman to lay the  foundation for a foreign policy of the United States that could guide us through  the Cold War   Senator Vandenberg set the bar high for us in the Senate   We can  aspire to that ideal  but it is hard to achieve it in this Congress  as it has  been in other Congresses    Over the past few weeks  a shift has begun  to take place    Not as quickly as many of us feel is necessary  but a change  nonetheless     Two weeks ago in a speech on this floor  one of the  successors of Arthur Vandenberg as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee   our distinguished colleague from Indiana  who was himself Chairman of the  Foreign Relations Committee  reminded us that we do not owe the President our  unquestioning agreement  but we do owe him and the American people our  constructive engagement   Last Friday  Senator Lugar was joined by the  senior senator from Virginia  Senator Warner  in offering an amendment that  would require the administration to review our Iraq strategy and outline plans  for an orderly redeployment of our troops     Two weeks ago  in his  statement on this floor  Senator Lugar said the United States has violated some  basic national security precepts during our military engagement in Iraq   We  have overestimated what the military can achieve  we have set goals that are  unrealistic  and we have inadequately factored in the broader regional  consequences of our actions  Perhaps most critically  our focus on Iraq has  diverted us from opportunities to change the world in directions that strengthen  our national security  I agree with that judgment  although I believe  the Warner Lugar amendment does not go far enough in bringing this war to an  end   It is undeniable that the American people have turned against this  war  and it is imperative for the President to understand and accept that basic  fact  We call for the President to end the war not as Democrats or Republicans   but as Americans who are deeply concerned about the perilous path on which the  nation is moving  The American people understand that there are no easy  options   But they also understand that the Presidents strategy simply does not  protect U S  interests   They understand that it is wrong to buy time  to hand  off the mess he created in Iraq off to the next President  and to keep our  troops in harms way with a policy that is not worthy of their sacrifice      The overarching question is not whether we leave Iraq  but how we  leave Iraq   Disastrous choices and disastrous leadership have brought us to  this dangerous point   We need to redefine our strategic goal in Iraq and the  region  and have a realistic policy that supports that objective  Whatever we  do  its going to be difficult   But we need to be move forward and begin the  process  and soon   We need work with Iraqs neighbors to mitigate the  damage the Presidents policy has created and minimize outside intervention  but  we cannot allow the fear of instability to put the brakes on the process of  military disengagement   Majorities in three countries bordering Iraq   Turkey  Jordan  and Kuwait  say our troops should be removed   In Turkey  one  of our most important allies in the region bordering Iraq  only 9  support our  position  Even in Iraq itself  just a few months ago  tens of thousands marched  demanding an end to what they called the American occupation    Each  country in the region has an interest in Iraqs stability  and we need to work  with them  diplomatically  to find common ground and mitigate the damage  caused by the Presidents failed policy   They need to come forward  work with  our nation  and play a constructive role   Part of that effort needs to  address the growing needs of the millions who have fled the violence in Iraq     More than two million Iraqis who have fled to neighboring Jordan and  Syria  and they are a destabilizing force in the region   The toll of suffering  is immense   The danger these tragic circumstances pose for our national  security and for the countries in the region hosting these vulnerable people is  real   The anger  desperation  and hopelessness that envelope these refugees is  a breeding ground for terrorists and will undoubtedly be exploited by our  enemies  America has a fundamental moral obligation to help  especially  those who have supported America in Iraq   There is no doubt that Iraqis who  have worked in positions in direct support of the United States have been killed  or injured in reprisals for that support    Many more Iraqis associated with the  United States have fled in fear and lost all they had  We must keep faith with  those who now have a bulls eye on their backs because of their ties with our  country   At a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this  year  Iraqis offered chilling testimony about the dangers they face because of  their association with America   A translator for U S  and Coalition forces told  of seeing his name posted on death lists  and said his friends turned on him  because they believed he was a traitor    An Iraqi truck driver who delivered  water to American forces said that terrorist groups had targeted him  his wife  and their six children because of his support for our soldiers  Not only  do we have an obligation to help those who have helped us  we have a precedent  for action   As the war in Vietnam drew to a close  President Ford emphasized  Americas duty to rescue those who had assisted us   He called our response to  that refugee crisis a reaffirmation of American awareness of the roots and  ideals of our society  and he personally greeted Vietnamese refugees on their  arrival here  But  sadly  there are many Iraqis working with our armed  forces  our diplomatic mission  and our reconstruction teams in Iraq who have  performed valiantly  but have been abandoned by our government in their hour of  need  Because of this support  insurgents have threatened and attacked their  family members   Many have lost their lives  and many more have lost their  houses  property  and livelihood   For some  it will be too dangerous to ever  return home   America cannot resettle all of Iraqs refugees  but we  must show leadership by accepting far greater numbers of refugees closely  associated with our military operation   Keeping our troops in Iraq  indefinitely as the President proposes is simply not the solution to the  humanitarian and refugee crisis    Mr  President  the consequences of  the decisions we make here in Congress profoundly affect our military  their  families  and the communities they have left   We have an obligation to our  soldiers to make sensible decisions that will not place them needlessly in  harms way   In February  I spoke about the 65 soldiers from  Massachusetts who had died in Iraq  Since then  Massachusetts has lost ten more    We in Massachusetts feel especially deeply the loss of these sons and daughters  killed in Iraq   Private John LandrySergeant Adam Kennedy  Captain Anthony PalermoStaff Sergeant William

their families   We  honor their sacrifice today and every day   We must insist on a policy worthy of  their sacrifice   The choice is clear   We can continue on the same  failed course as those who are leading this filibuster in the Senate are  proposing   Or we can adopt the Levin Reed amendment and begin to bring our  troops home to the heros welcome they have earned and so obviously  deserve  For the sake of our men and women in uniform and our national  security  I hope we will change course and approve the Levin Reed amendment     Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
