         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     As it always is  the Administration s budget is the President s blueprint for the future  It shows a President s true priorities far more clearly than all the rhetoric that accompanies it  That is why the budget just submitted by the Bush Administration is so disturbing  It is a budget in which long standing national commitments to the education and health of our people would not be kept  The needs of the vulnerable would be neglected  And all this would be done so that those who already have the most can have even more     If the Bush budget is enacted  the number of children left behind would be millions  not zero  The promise of a quality education for every child would be broken     His budget proposes  9 5 billion less in financial support for schools in 2004 than the  President pledged when he signed the school reform bill last year      It would sharply cut support for after school programs by four hundred million dollars  leaving 570 000 more children with no safe place to go at the end of the school day     It would reduce funds for improving teacher quality  which means 15 000 fewer teachers would be trained next year     It would drastically cut support for vocational education and career training for youth     It would provide no increase in Pell Grants for college aid  even though the average cost of tuition has increased by 10  in the last year    If the Bush Budget is enacted  it would take away the existing guarantee of health care through Medicaid for many low income families and children  States would be left to deal with soaring eligibility rolls on their own  and many more in need of medical care would not receive it    If the Bush Budget is enacted  senior citizens will have to choose between the family doctors they trust and the prescription drugs they need  The promise of Medicare will be broken if millions of seniors are forced into HMOs as the only way to obtain the prescription drug coverage they need  Does anyone doubt that in health care today  HMOs are part of the problem  not the solution    If the Bush budget is enacted  future Social Security benefits and Medicare benefits will be put at risk  His budget will take  1 6 trillion out of Social Security and Medicare by 2008  in order to help finance an ever growing list of massive tax cuts  The reason the budget stops in 2008 is that the Administration hopes to conceal the fact that it will take trillions more out of Social Security and Medicare after that date    The problems in this budget go on and on  It would take Head Start away from children who desperately need the support that the current program offers  It would take thousands of police off the street  It would break the bipartisan commitment to expand NIH medical research  It would sharply reduce environmental protections    The only guarantee in this budget is that the already rich will become even richer  Those with annual incomes over a million dollars would receive a tax break averaging  89 000 a year  That s more than most American families ever earn in a year  The elimination of the tax on dividends alone will cost the Treasury nearly  390 billion over 10 years  and fully half of that enormous amount   195 billion  will go directly into the pockets of the richest 1  of taxpayers     No Congress in its right mind would pass such a budget  But  there s no telling what this Republican Congress in its right wing mind will do   Jim Manley   Stephanie Cutter  202  224 2633
