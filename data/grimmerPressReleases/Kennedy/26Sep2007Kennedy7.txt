         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Its a pleasure to welcome to the Committee today two fellow Bay Staters  my good friend and colleague Senator John Kerry and Mr  Michael Sullivan  whom President Bush has nominated to serve as the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives  Id also like to welcome Mr  Sullivans wife Theresa  daughter Alyson  and his father Thomas Sullivan  Your family is surely proud  Mr  Sullivan  that youve served the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for over a decade and I look forward to hearing your views on issues that are so important to our country today      A fellow native Bostonian  Mr  Sullivan has been a lifelong resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  A graduate of Boston College and Suffolk University  Law School  hes had a distinguished career dedicated to public service  Beginning in 1990  Mr  Sullivan served as a Representative in the state legislature for three terms  Then in 1995  he went onto become the District Attorney for Plymouth  County where he began to develop a strong relationship between himself  the Boston Police Department and the ATF      In 2001  Mr  Sullivan was appointed to serve as the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts  a position that he still holds today  Since August 2006  Mr  Sullivan has also held the position of Acting Director of ATF      As you know  the ATF is a key law enforcement agency within the Justice Department    with the dual responsibility of enforcing Federal criminal laws and regulating the firearms and explosives industries  With a new law enacted last year  this is the first confirmation hearing for the position of Director and I hope that it will provide us with a good foundation for future collaboration between ATF and this Committee     Im particularly interested in the role that ATF can play to help stem the tide of gun violence in our country  Nearly 30 000 Americans lives are lost to gun violence each year    more than 80 people a day  In his book  Private Guns  Public Health  David Hemenway from the Harvard Injury  Control Research  Center observed that  Each day guns were used in the commission of about three thousand crimes  The U S  rates of death an injury due to firearms and the rate of crimes committed with firearms are far higher than those of any other industrialized country      Just last week  the International Association of Chiefs of Police  IACP  took a dramatic stand against the escalating gun violence in our communities  releasing a comprehensive report with 39 key recommendations to reduce gun violence  The Chiefs compelling report and specific recommendations are a clear call to action  Without further delay  Congress and the Administration need to do our part by enacting concrete reforms that will reduce crime and protect the safety of police officers and all Americans  We all know what needs to be done and its a scandal that we have done so little for so long                  The IACPs impressive work in producing this ground breaking report should not go ignored  Im hopeful that we can work together  across party lines  to reduce gun violence  solve gun crimes  protect our police officers and do all that we can to make our communities safer  Perhaps our dialogue today will be one positive step forward in that direction           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
