         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     It s a privilege to join Senator Reid  Senator Obama  Senator Bayh and other Democratic colleagues on this legislation to improve the nation s preparedness to deal with the danger of avian flu     I look forward to working with the chairman of our health committee  Senator Enzi and our subcommittee chairman  Senator Burr  to report legislation that includes the best proposals on preparedness  and improves research on new medications and vaccines    We need to act  because the Administration has failed to prepare adequately for a flu pandemic  The danger of a major hurricane hitting New Orleans was ignored until it was too late  We can t make the same mistake with pandemic flu  We can t afford to leave preparations to chance  or wait until disaster strikes to take action     An effective plan is fundamental  I wrote to HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson in January 2004  urging him to release a plan  A year and a half later  there is still no final plan  We should be implementing a flu plan now    not waiting to read it for the first time     Other nations have recognized the urgency of proper planning  Japan issued its pandemic preparedness plan in 1997  Brazil in 1999  Canada  Britain and Australia each came out with their plan over a year ago  They re putting their plans into action right now    but we re still waiting for ours to be released    Around the world  nations have taken steps to stockpile enough medication to treat the victims of flu  Britain has ordered enough to treat 25 percent of the population  France has the same coverage  Australia  New Zealand  Japan  and many other nations have all taken the prudent step of stockpiling these medications  but the US lags behind  We have only enough flu medicine to treat less than 2 percent of the American public    This bill addresses many of the weaknesses we suffer in preparedness  It requires the Secretary of HHS to take immediate action to finalize the national preparedness plan  to stockpile enough antiviral medications for 50  of the population  and to expand capacity for vaccine production  The bill also expands global surveillance and international cooperation  so that we can rapidly detect and rapidly contain the spread of a deadly virus  It also addresses the issue of surge capacity     Since pandemic flu is an issue of urgent national importance  our bill also creates a Director of Pandemic Preparedness and Response in the Executive Office of the President  The Director will be responsible for coordinating the nation s efforts across the federal government and with the states  The Director will also be in charge of making sure the American public receives accurate  up to date information before  during and after a pandemic     I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this critical issue  and I commend Senator Reid for his leadership on this important proposal           Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act of 2005 Senators Reid  Obama  Bayh  Kennedy   Public health experts have warned that an avian influenza outbreak could ignite a worldwide pandemic that would threaten the lives of millions of Americans  The consequences of a pandemic could be far reaching    impacting virtually every sector of our society and our economy  Top Administration officials have admitted that our nation is dangerously unprepared for the serious threat of avian influenza  Action is urgently needed to protect the nation from the threat of pandemic flu  That is why Senate Democrats are introducing the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act of 2005  The bill will      Prepare for a pandemic by finalizing  implementing  and funding pandemic preparedness and response plans  We need a detailed plan outlining a coordinated national strategy to address a flu pandemic  The Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness Plan  which the World Health Organization deems essential to proper readiness  has yet to be finalized  despite having been released in draft form over a year ago  As a result  federal and state preparations for avian flu pandemic have been needlessly delayed  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Creates a Director of Pandemic Preparedness and Response within the Executive Office of the President who will be responsible for finalizing and making operational the National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan  The Director will coordinate the federal interagency preparation for and response to a pandemic   Ensures that  among other things  the National Pandemic Plan includes a specific focus on traditionally underserved populations  including low income  racial and ethnic minority  immigrant and uninsured populations   Establishes accountability for the national preparation for and response to a pandemic   Expands and coordinates State Pandemic Preparedness Activities  with emphasis on surveillance  preventive and medical care  workforce development  distribution plans for vaccines  antivirals and other treatments  communication and information networks  maintenance of core public health functions  security  and integration with national activities and existing bioterrorism preparedness activities      Improve surveillance and international partnerships so we may monitor the spread of avian influenza and detect the emergence of a flu strain with pandemic potential immediately  It will take several months to develop an effective vaccine against the avian flu once we have been able to identify the particular flu strain with pandemic potential  One of our best opportunities to limit the scope and consequences of any outbreak is to rapidly detect and contain the spread of a new strain that is capable of sustained human to human transmission  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Provides assistance for international pre pandemic surveillance and medical care   Establishes and implements a comprehensive diplomatic strategy targeted at nations in Southeast and East Asia most at risk for an epidemic of the avian influenza in order to strengthen our ability to detect  prevent and effectively respond to an outbreak of the avian flu   Creates an International Fund to support pre pandemic influenza control and relief activities in countries affected by avian influenza   Expands domestic and international efforts by the Department of Agriculture to prevent pandemic avian influenza   Improves state surveillance efforts      Protect Americans though the development  production  and distribution of an effective vaccine  Our existing stockpile of vaccines    assuming they are effective against a future  unidentified flu strain    may protect less than one percent of all Americans  We have only one domestic flu vaccine manufacturer located in the United States  If our capacity to produce vaccines is not improved  it could take 15 months just to vaccinate our first responders  medical personnel and other high risk groups  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Expands Research at the NIH on influenza vaccines and treatment   Establishes a mass tracking and distribution system for antiviral medications and vaccines   Enhances vaccine production capacity by creating a guaranteed market for seasonal flu vaccine through a federal buyback program for a portion of unsold doses   Improves access to vaccinations during a pandemic by enhancing annual flu vaccination coverage for uninsured and underinsured adults and children     Plan ahead for a pandemic by stockpiling antivirals  vaccines  and other essential medications and supplies  Antiviral medication will be a crucial stopgap defense against a pandemic because it will take several months to develop  produce and distribute a vaccine  Other nations have ordered enough Tamiflu  an antiviral pill  to cover between twenty and forty percent of their populations  The United States only has enough antiviral pills in its stockpile to cover 2 percent of its population  We also need to ensure that we have an adequate supply of other medications and medical supplies  such as masks and gloves  in our national stockpile  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Requires procurement of antivirals to cover a minimum of 50 percent of the population for the Strategic National Stockpile   Requires procurement of a minimum level of vaccines  medications and other supplies for the Strategic National Stockpile   Protects Americans from price gouging of medications during a pandemic      Strengthen our public health infrastructure  The nation s public health infrastructure is weak  and our hospitals and health care providers lack adequate surge capacity to respond to a pandemic  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Improves surge capacity to ensure an adequate supply of health care providers and institutions to care for affected Americans in the event of a pandemic       Inform Americans by increasing awareness and education about pandemic flu  A pandemic could impact virtually every sector of our society and our economy  The medical community must be trained to distinguish between the annual flu and the avian flu so that an outbreak could be reported immediately  Businesses and the American public need to be educated about the steps they can take to prepare for and respond to an avian flu outbreak  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Expands research at the CDC for communication and behavioral strategies for the general public   Ensures that public education and awareness campaigns targeted to businesses  health care providers and the American public related to pandemic preparedness are conducted      Commit to protecting Americans by devoting adequate resources to pandemic preparedness  Many programs that will dramatically reduce the consequences of a future avian flu outbreak are unfunded or massively underfunded  The Senate approved a Democratic amendment to the Department of Defense appropriations bill to begin providing the resources needed to address this threat  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act will ensure that adequate resources are available to address this looming threat   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
