Free Choice Act  Working families have done so much for our country  Surely we can pass fair labor laws for them  So my friends  This is our moment  This is our fight  This is our destiny  Its time to call the roll  Lets call the roll from Boston to L A  From Chicago to Houston  From Seattle to Atlanta  From the Capitol to the White House Lets call the roll And when they call the name of Kennedy  Ill raise my hand with pride and cast my vote for the working families of America SUMMARY OF THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACTThe Employee Free Choice Act will allow workers to choose a union free from employer coercion  Majority Sign UpEmployees Choose A Union When A Majority of Workers Sign Cards Endorsing the UnionProblem  Union elections are often the focus of employer intimidation and coercionemployers illegally fire employees for union activity in more than one quarter of all organizing efforts  In 2005  over 30 000 workers were discriminated againstlosing wages or even their jobsfor exercising their freedom to associate  Solution  The bill provides that workers can choose a union when a majority of them sign valid cards stating they want a union as their bargaining representative  Existing law allows for majority sign up  but only at the employers discretion  The National Labor Relations Board  NLRB  will determine the validity of the cards  Reaching First Contract Through Mediation and ArbitrationProblem  34 percent of union victoriesmore than one third of hard won electionsdid not result in a contract for workers  This renders employee choice meaningless Solution  The bill provides that if the parties dont reach a contract within 90 days  either one can seek mediation from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service  FMCS   If there is no agreement after 30 days of mediation  the dispute will go to arbitration  the result of which will be binding on the parties for two years  Strengthens Remedies for Employer Coercion When Employees are Trying to Organize or get a First ContractProblem  Employers fire pro union workers in 25  of organizing drives  But remedies for this coercion are inadequate  An employee must often spend years to prove her caseand then she is only eligible to receive back pay and reinstatement to her job  Solution   Injunctions  The NLRB must go to court to get an order stopping an employer that is firing or discriminating against workers based on their union activity during an organizing or first contract drive   Treble Backpay  An employer that discriminates against a worker during an organizing campaign or first contract drive must pay three times back pay  Civil Penalties  Imposes civil fines up to  20 000 per violation if an employer willfully or repeatedly violates workers rights during an organizing campaign or first contract drive THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT RESTORES MIDDLE CLASS SECURITYThe Bush economy is not working for working Americans   Americans are working harder than ever in the Bush economy  Productivity has been rising and companies are making huge profits on the backs of their workers  Corporate profits are up by more than 83  since 2001    Inequality has also reached alarming levels  Today  more than 40  of total income is going to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans  the biggest gap in more than 65 years    Six million Americans have lost their health insurance  and their retirement security is fading as well  We have created an economy that works for Wall Street  but not Main Street  and working families are being left behind    Its little wonder that most Americans want a voice at work in these insecure times  In a recent survey  58 percent of Americans indicated they would join a union if they could  a record number  The freedom to choose a union is vital to restoring the American Dream  especially for the most vulnerable Americans    Unions help American workers get their fair share  union wages are almost 30  higher than non union wages  Unions are also a cure for rising inequality because they raise wages more for low  and middle wage workers than for higher wage workers   Union cashiers earn 46  more than non union cashiers   Union food preparation workers earn nearly 50  more than non union workers   Union maids and housekeepers earn 31  more than their non union counterparts    The freedom to join a union is a womens issue and a civil rights issue  Union women earn 31 percent more than women workers who dont have a union  African American union members earn 36 percent more  and Latino workers earn 46 percent more    Union workers are almost twice as likely to have employer sponsored health benefits and a pension at work  They are more than four times more likely to have a secure  defined benefit pension plan than non union workers    Protecting the freedom to choose a union benefits all Americans  whether or not they have a union at work  In industries and occupations where many workplaces are unionized  non union employers will frequently meet union standards or otherwise improve compensation  A high school graduate in a non union workplace whose industry is 25 percent unionized gets paid 5 percent more than similar workers in less unionized industries       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
