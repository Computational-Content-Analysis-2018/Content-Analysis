         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I applaud my friends Rep  Flake and Gutierrez for moving forward on immigration  reform and introducing their bill on Thursday   They are our valued partners in  this effort to forge a tough but fair bill that strikes the right balance  between protecting our security  strengthening our economy  and enacting laws  that uphold our humanity    While were still negotiating in the Senate  Im  optimistic that soon we will have legislation and Im determined to make 2007  the year that we fix our broken system   The American people have waited long  enough     Laura Capps Melissa  202  224 2633
