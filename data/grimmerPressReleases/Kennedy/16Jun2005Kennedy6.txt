         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  This morning s reports on the Justice Department s tobacco case are deeply disturbing for all Americans concerned about the health of their children The Justice Department memos obtained by reporters show that high level Bush Administration political appointees over ruled professional lawyers in the case in slashing the damages that tobacco companies would be required to pay There is no clearer example of this Administration s view that government and the courts should protect big corporations first and real people last Whether it s global warming or Iraq or tobacco  their view is that the facts should never be allowed to get in the way of their right wing politics There are few initiatives that would have a greater impact on the health of our children than smoking prevention  No parent in America ever says  I hope my child grows up to be a smoker  Parents know that every child that we prevent from smoking will have a healthier  fuller  happier life That s what this lawsuit was all about    requiring big tobacco companies to pay for anti smoking programs I urge President Bush to intervene with his Justice Department  They made a political decision to back Big Tobacco  Now the President should make the responsible decision to back America s families If the tobacco companies don t pay for their misdeeds  then our families will pay with more cancer  more illness  and shortened lives What is happening with this case is political interference at its worst because literally millions of lives are at stake  The worst thing would be for the Justice Department to settle with the tobacco companies based upon the weak and inadequate demand that DOJ made to the Court last week  At this point  we have far more confidence that the Court will do the right thing than that the Justice Department will do the right thing  The Court has the authority to look beyond the DOJ recommendations and to order strong remedies based on the evidence presented at trial  We should let the Court decide   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
