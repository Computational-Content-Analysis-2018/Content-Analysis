         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I welcome our witnesses to the Armed Services Committee today  By our own government s count  the strength of the insurgency has quadrupled since the transfer of sovereignty    from 5 000 in mid 2004  to 16 000 last October  to more than 20 000 now   Vice Admiral Jacoby  the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency  told the Intelligence Committee on February 17 that the Iraqi insurgency has grown in size and complexity over the past year  Insurgents are launching 60 attacks per day  he said    more than twice as many as a year ago  He also said the U S  must still be concerned about the Shiite militants loyal to Moqtada al Sadr  They may be silent now  but Admiral Jacoby said they are quietly rearming  re organizing and training  He said al Sadr is keeping his options open   CIA Director Porter Goss said at the same hearing that the insurgency achieved at least some of its election day goals and remains a serious threat to creating a stable representative government in Iraq   However  when asked about conflicting assessments of the insurgency from the CIA and DIA  Secretary Rumsfeld told the House Armed Services Committee that same day  I see these reports  Frankly I don t have a lot of confidence in any of them   General Meyers told the House Armed Services Committee  We essentially know what their capability is  And I would characterize it    and this is in terms of insurgencies that we ve seen in history    it s limited   So there clearly seems to be a difference of opinion between Secretary Rumsfeld and General Meyers on the one hand  who downplay the insurgency  and the intelligence agencies on the other hand   I look forward to hearing from General Abizaid about who is right  and to obtain his assessment about how big and how strong the insurgency really is  We cannot effectively fight a war if we don t fully understand the size of the enemy   The elections in January were certainly a step in the right direction and obviously American troops are still needed to deal with the insurgency  But there seems to be wide agreement that the presence of American troops is also fueling the insurgency and making it worse   In the February 28 edition of US News and World Report  General Abizaid talked about our future in Iraq  He said An overbearing presence  or a larger than acceptable footprint in the region  works against you The first thing you say to yourself is that you have to have the local people help themselves   Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz said in a committee hearing on February 3  I have talked to some of our commanders in the area  They believe that over the course of the next six months you will see whole areas of Iraq successfully handed over to the Iraqi army and Iraqi police  Before the election  the Administration repeatedly stated that 14 of the 18 provinces in Iraq are safe  We heard a similar view in a briefing from Ambassador Negroponte   I look forward to hearing from General Abizaid how many American soldiers are based in these 14 provinces  I d like to know what our commanders are saying and how many areas can be turned over to the Iraqis in the next six months  as Secretary Wolfowitz indicated  If some could be turned over right now  it would be a powerful signal we could send that we re not planning a permanent occupation  Most importantly  Americans want to know how many American soldiers will be able to come home as a result   If entire areas are being turned over to the Iraqis  it seems to me that we should be able to bring at least some American troops home to help take the American face off the occupation and send as strong a signal as possible to the Iraqi people that America has no long term designs on their country   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
