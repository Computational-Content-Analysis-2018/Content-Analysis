         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact  Laura Capps  Kennedy  202 224 2633Wendy Morigi  Rockefeller  202 224 6101Jake Ward  Snowe  202 224 8667Washington  DC  Yesterday  Senators Edward Kennedy  D MA   Senator John D   Jay  Rockefeller IV  D WV   Olympia Snow  R ME  introduced a bill to address the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP  funding shortfalls that at least 14 states will experience this year  Without additional and immediate federal dollars  thousands of children currently enrolled in CHIP could lose their health insurance coverage Children are our future  and making sure they have health care ought to be our top priority  The CHIP program has made a difference in the lives of millions of children  but it faces a growing budget shortfall that puts health coverage for hundreds of thousands of children in jeopardy  including more than 160 000 in Massachusetts  Without additional funding  Massachusetts will fall  90 million short of the funds needed to cover currently enrolled children  This bill will make sure that working families across the nation wont be left wondering if they can afford to take their child to the doctor when theyre sick  said Kennedy  Since its creation in 1997  CHIP has been successful in providing millions of children with health care they would have otherwise been denied  said Rockefeller  More than 38 000 children in West Virginia are covered by this vital program each year  Unfortunately  the health and well being of thousands of children will be in jeopardy if Congress does not act quickly to fill in these shortfalls  At the end of last year  we took a small step toward addressing this problem  Now  we must finish the job  The health of our children depends on sufficiently funding this vital program  and our children should not have to wait The success of SCHIP is indisputable  The number of uninsured low income children in the United States has decreased by more than 25 percent since the programs creation in 1997  said Snowe  More than 14 000 children now receive health insurance through the State Children Health Insurance Program in Maine alone  and more than 6 million nationally  The effectiveness and continued growth of this program has increased both its importance and its need  The budget shortfall for this Fiscal Year could leave hundreds of thousands of children without coverage  and that is simply unacceptable  We cannot afford to lose ground on the progress that has been made and must take action to ensure states have the funding they need to not only maintain coverage  but continue to increase the number of eligible people enrolled The Rockefeller Snowe Kennedy Keep Children Covered Act  S  401  would provide the resources necessary to fill the federal CHIP funding shortfalls remaining in at least 14 states  Alaska  Georgia  Illinois  Iowa  Maine  Maryland  Massachusetts  Minnesota  Mississippi  Missouri  Nebraska  New Jersey  Rhode Island  and Wisconsin  The National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006  P L  109 482  redistributed portions of unspent fiscal year 2004 and 2005 CHIP funds in order to address  124 million of the projected fiscal year 2007 shortfalls  However  the Congressional Research Service estimates that an additional  745 million is necessary to eliminate the shortfalls entirely and protect coverage for children In 1997  Rockefeller authored the CHIP program with the late Senator John Chaffee  R RI   To date  CHIP has provided health insurance to more than 6 million American children  The program is up for reauthorization this year
