         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        FACT SHEETS AND CHART ATTACHED         With yesterdays veto  the President stripped away the mask of compassionate conservatism and revealed the ugly truth beneath  an Administration so far out of touch with our needs here at home that it cast aside the health care of 10 million children in working families                  The President and his allies have called CHIP socialized medicine and government run health care   Weve heard those phrases before                  We heard it when we created Medicare for our seniors                  We heard it when we passed Medicaid for the poor                  We heard it when we created health care for our veterans                  And now were hearing on health care for needy children                  Yesterday  the President said our bipartisan childrens health bill sends our health care system in the wrong direction   He said it undermines private health insurance                  Well  Mr  President  ask our working families what they think of private insurance with their premiums going up and up and up while their wages are going down and down and down                  We said no to the Presidents plan to privatize Medicare   And well say no to privatizing childrens health care  too                  If they succeed in rolling back CHIP  surely Medicare and veterans health care are next                   Its ironic that many of those who would deny health coverage to children of working families have no hesitation in letting Uncle Sam pick up the tab for their own health care through the Federal employees health care program                  But the hypocrisy doesnt stop there                  The President had the gall to veto CHIP two days after his very own proclamation declaring a Child Health Day                    The President declared October 1st to be Child Health Day   Then on October 3rd  he vetoed a bill to bring quality health care to children across the nation                  On Monday  he solemnly declared that Our Nation is committed to the health and well being of our youth   Then  on Wednesday  his veto denied that commitment to 10 million American children                    And that wasnt the first time Mr  Bush made a promise to our children       When he was Governor  Bushs website stated that Governor Bush and the Texas Legislature worked together to implement the CHIP program for more than 423 000 children     When running for office in 2004 he said that       America s children must also have a healthy start in life  In a new term  we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government s health insurance programs  We will not allow a lack of attention  or information  to stand between these children and the health care they need      Well  I agree with Governor Bush and Candidate Bush  but not President Bush                  Our opponents failed to stop Medicare by calling it socialized medicine  and those tactics wont stop CHIP now   Medicare didnt pass on the first attempt  but its supporters came back again and again and again with the force of the American people behind them to ask  to demand  that Congress act                  And thats just what well do with CHIP                   Well keep at it until the children of this nation get the health care they deserve and that the American people demand                  Republicans and Democrats alike worked together to write this bipartisan compromise legislation  and Republicans and Democrats alike will decide to stand with children to override this cruel and unjustified veto                  At its core  the job of Congress is to make judgments on priorities   The president has made his judgment  and its to pour our national treasure into the sands of Iraq and to burden our children with the costs of the war for generations to come                    A bipartisan majority in Congress has made a judgment too   Our judgment is that children must come first   With every month of war  we spend whats needed to cover 10 million children for a year   With every day  we spend whats needed to cover a quarter million children                    Those arent the priorities of the American people                  Lets listen to the values of America                    Lets stay true to our national tradition of fairness                  Lets put children first  and give them the health care they deserve      MYTHS AND FACTS ON CHIP     CLAIM   The CHIP bill is the first step toward socialized medicine      FACT  CHIP is a public private partnership that leaves significant discretion in the hands of governors  Republicans and Democrats alike  to design a program that best suits their states needs   CHIP is no more socialized medicine than the coverage that every Member of Congress and the Administration enjoys   If CHIP is socialized medicine  then the Administration should support its elimination  and the elimination of Medicare and the VA system for veterans too   The choice before the country on CHIP is simple   is it more important to side with our children or to force them off quality affordable coverage  all in the name of opposing socialized medicine      CLAIM  The President vetoed the CHIP bill because it moves our health care system in the wrong direction      FACT  By vetoing this bill at this critical juncture when Congress is poised to reauthorize CHIP  the Bush Administration is putting ideology over childrens health care  irresponsibly placing the well being of millions of children at risk   The 69 senators  43 governors  hundreds of organizations  and the vast majority of the American people who support the bipartisan CHIP reauthorization agreement will continue to oppose President Bushs misguided approach  and strive to give our nations uninsured children the promise of a healthy start in life      CLAIM  The President supports expanding CHIP by  5 billion over five years  a 20  increase      FACT  The presidents proposal is woefully inadequate  and its no expansion  Under the presidents proposal 1 4 million children would lose the health care they have right now and no additional low income children would gain coverage  The CHIP bill would allow 10 million uninsured children to have good  quality health care      CLAIM  CHIP was designed to cover children from families who do not qualify for Medicaid but have annual incomes at or below 200  of the Federal poverty level  FPL  or 50  above a State s Medicaid eligibility level in 1997      FACT  One of the hallmarks of the CHIP program is that it gives states the flexibility to do what is right for the children in their state  The Administration has agreed to allow certain states that are doing well in covering their children go above 200  FPL to cover more children whose families cant afford insurance      CLAIM  Congress  bill would enable CHIP to cover children in some households with incomes of up to 400  of the Federal poverty level  about  83 000 per year       FACT  Current law already allows states to cover children up to or even beyond 400  of FPL  if the Administration grants a waiver  All changes in income level must be approved by the Administration and no state has been approved to cover children at 400  of poverty  The great majority of the uninsured children covered under the CHIP reauthorization agreement would have family incomes below the current eligibility limits that states have set  According to CBO  about 3 2 of the 3 8 million uninsured children  approximately 84 percent  who stand to gain coverage under the CHIP reauthorization agreement would have family incomes below the current eligibility levels       CLAIM  Of the 5 8 million enrollees Congress  legislation would attract by 2012  the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  projects that 2 0 million would drop private insurance to enroll      FACT  Under approaches promoted by the Bush Administration  the large majority of benefits would generally go to people who already have insurance    A recent analysis by Professor Jonathan Gruber of MIT of the health insurance tax proposals included in the Bush Administrations budget last year found that 77 percent of the benefits would go to people who were already insured  thus making the issue of crowd out worse not better under the Presidents proposal     CLAIM  States have not enrolled in CHIP or Medicaid an estimated 750 000 children whose families are below 200  of the Federal poverty level      FACT  70  80  of the children covered by CHIP come from families at 200  of poverty or below  The bill invests in out reach to get to the hardest to reach children that are eligible but unenrolled      CLAIM  By 2012  Congress  proposal would cost  4 000 per year for every newly insured child added to government coverage   1 700 more than the  2 300 annual cost to add a child in a typical family of four to a private insurance plan that same year      FACT  When employer sponsored coverage is offered  it is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many families  The average premium for a family of four topped  12 000 in 2007  with the average family contribution of over  3 200   Over the past six years  the amount families pay out of pocket for their share of premiums has increased by approximately  1 500 dollars  Again  there is a very real need to invest more resources in CHIP  as more and more families are unable to afford coverage on their own      CLAIM  The Democrats would fund their CHIP proposal with a 61 cent per pack tax increase on cigarettes  an unsustainable source of funding      FACT  The Bush administration is trying to distract the public from the truth about a tobacco tax increase   An increase would result in  9 44 billion dollars in revenues AND  396 million dollars in health care savings over five years from smoking related medical problems   In addition  1 873 million children will NOT become smokers as a result of this tax      The Real CHIP Numbers     600 000           Number of children that have become uninsured in the past year     1 4 million         Number of children that would be lose healthcare coverage under President Bushs proposal     10 million          Number of children that would be covered with CHIP bill     246 000           Number of children that could be covered for what it costs for one day in Iraq     1 8 million         Number of children that could be covered for what it costs for one week in Iraq     41 days            Days in Iraq spending that it would take to cover 10 million children      12 000           Average cost of a family health insurance plan     1 8 million         Number of children that would NOT begin smoking due to tobacco tax in CHIP bill     80                  Percent of children in CHIP program that are 200  of poverty or less     72                  Percent of Americans supporting CHIP     13                    Number of states that would have to drop children from coverage if CHIP bill is vetoed     69                    Number of Senators supporting CHIP bill     265                  Number of Representatives supporting CHIP bill     43                                        Number of Governors supporting CHIP bill
