         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633    In the past five years  over five million more citizens have fallen into poverty  Thirty seven million Americans live below the poverty line  Three million more working Americans live in hunger or on the verge of hunger today than in the year 2000    It s shameful that in the richest and most powerful nation on earth  nearly 20 percent of all children go to bed hungry at night because their parents  even working full time  still can t make ends meet    The needs of the poor in America have been constantly ignored by the Bush Administrationbut Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have shown a bright new light on the unacceptable poverty that continues to plague America today  We all watched the heartbreaking scenes of countless low income residents with no cars  struggling to escape the path of the Hurricane  and then struggling again to escape the flood waters  The poor were left largely on their own  fending for themselves    American people expect their leaders to stand for fairness  freedom and opportunity  Those values are the cornerstone of the American dream  We believe that if you live right and work hard  you should be able to care for your family  afford rent in a safe neighborhood  and to send your children to college     We also believe that when life deals you a severe shock  you can count on your neighbors to pitch in  If you lose your job or become seriously ill  we all want to help out  If you lose your home  your belongings  and your security from a natural disaster  it s some comfort to know at least that you haven t been deserted and that help is on the way  You deserve a chance to pick yourself up  dust yourself off  and start all over again  to reclaim the American dream for yourself and your family  That s the American way  the American spirit    The state agencies and the community action agencies funded by the Community Service Block Grant program know that spirit well  They fight poverty and encourage self sufficiency in low income communities everyday    Their services include literacy  child health care  after school activities  low income housing development  food stamps  and emergency shelter assistance     Unfortunately  the Administration and the House of Representatives have closed their eyes to the needs of the poor and to the important work of these community service agencies across the nation  The Continuing Resolution that was sent to us by the House cuts funds for the Community Service Block Grant program in half    At a time when poverty is increasing  and in the wake of the devastation of the hurricane  the House has decided to limit funds to the very agencies that came forward to help people least able to help themselves     As Hurricane Katrina hit  Assistant Secretary for Children and Families Wade Horn acknowledged the unique role of the agencies in disaster relief and called them to action in a memorandum of September 2nd  He said that community action grantees particularly those in Alabama  Louisiana  Mississippi  Arkansas  Texas  Florida  Georgia and Tennessee  should  open  their  doors to those displaced families who have sought refuge in  their  community and seek new ways to support individuals  families and children impacted by this disaster     The agencies had already begun providing support and other help to those in need  According to the National Association of State Community Service Programs  community action agencies have assisted over 171 000 evacuees  Much of their time was volunteered     But the services and facilities they are using will draw from the funds allocated by the government  The services for new residents  even temporary ones will change the community priorities already set for dwindling block grant resources  How can the Administration encourage these agencies to do more while simultaneously cutting their funds    Over the past three years  Community Service Block Grant funds have been eroding  and lack of funds has impaired the ability of these agencies to reach out to the poor  If the Community Service Block Grant is cut in half  their services will be compromised even more  and the agencies will face a crisis of their own that will strain their reserves     Programs that depend on grant resources for support such as fuel assistance  the earned income tax credit  Medicare outreach  and food pantries will be seriously hurt  and in some cases will be eliminated    With rising home energy costs  a 50 percent cut in funding will jeopardize the LIHEAP program  October and November are especially busy months for the community action agencies that administer it  The program year begins October 1st  and many agencies sign up the vast majority of LIHEAP participants right away  Most states get almost 90  of their annual allotment in the first quarter    In three months the loss to Massachusetts will be  2 million  Half of the state s 4000 staff will be affected  either through temporary or permanent layoffs  Yet our state serves over 400 000 persons including many from the Gulf states    According to Action Inc   a community action agency in Gloucester  Massachusetts  a temporary 50 percent cut in funds will result in the elimination of its housing and family legal services  350 very low income local families who suffer housing problems will be at risk of homelessness  40 families with active legal cases will not have access to their attorney    The family law program will also be eliminated  Yet it helps 75 very low income residents a year by providing legal assistance on issues such as divorce  custody  visitation and child support  425 families will not have the legal assistance that helps prevent evictions and solve critical family issues    Action Inc  is only one example of the numerous agencies in Massachusetts and across the nation facing lay offs and program cuts or even elimination because of the harsh cuts in the Continuing Resolution    It s wrong for the Administration and the House of Representatives to ask for cuts in America s safety net  when so many Americans are already falling through it  We know how to mend it  All we lack is the will and the leadership to do it    The Community Services Block Grant agencies have been fighting to alleviate poverty with great skill  It s time the government stopped forcing them to do so against such heavy odds  The challenge is too critical for Americans to ignore any longer  The soothing promises of those in powerful places have been unmasked for what they arepromises they never meant to keep    Personal responsibility  community responsibility  government responsibilitythey go hand in hand  When one of them breaks down  as it has now  we have to fix it  I m saddened by Congress s harsh treatment of those most in need  We should be fully funding the Community Service Block Grant  not cutting it in half  I will vote for Senator Harkin s amendment to increase funding for the Community Service Block Grant program and I urge my colleagues to do the same   Laura Capps Melissa
