         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY Thank you  John Seigenthaler  for that wonderful introduction  John is a dear friend and a long standing icon in the world of journalism  and he continues to do an outstanding job as Chairman of the Profile in Courage Award Committee This year s ceremony is very special to all of us in the Kennedy family  because it marks the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy s book  Profiles in Courage  My brother was a Senator at the time  and he won the Pulitzer Prize for the book  It s been a classic ever since  and I m sure he d be especially proud of this year s honorees Five years ago  as we all know  America was shocked and our complacency was shattered by the worst terrorist attack in our history  But we emerged united together  and we rallied around our leaders  ready to fight back That unity has receded drastically since then  because of the war in Iraq  Our country has become deeply divided    with most of our people deeply concerned that our policies have not been adequate to the challenge and in fact have made the danger even more serious Our honorees today are two courageous officials on that issue    one appointed and one elected    who prove that dissent  even in wartime  may well be the ultimate act of patriotism Both are true profiles in courage  Our first honoree  Alberto Mora  was a well respected attorney specializing in international law at a prominent firm when he was appointed General Counsel of the Navy at the beginning of the Bush Administration  and in the months after 9 11  he was a strong supporter of the war on terrorism But by the end of 2002  he realized that the Administration was going wrong in approving harsh and extreme interrogation techniques used on the detainees at Guantanamo Bay  He assumed that the abuses would stop when he called attention to them  but he was wrong  And so he began a quiet  behind the scenes battle to challenge these techniques and the misguided legal analysis that supported them He was determined to fight for the rule of law  even against powerful opponents and the chief champions of the torture policy at the highest levels of government  He took on William Haynes  the General Counsel of the Department of Defense  calling his legal analysis wholly inadequate  He challenged David Addington  the Counsel to Vice President Cheney  He took his concerns directly to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld He had learned the importance of living up to his principles in his own early years  Both of his parents had fled from repressive regimes  His mother grew up in Hungary and came to the United States  His father had come from Cuba to study medicine at Harvard  Alberto was born here in Boston in 1952 and a year later  the family moved back to Cuba  When Castro came to power in 1959  they narrowly escaped to the United States and settled in Mississippi Alberto later graduated from the University of Miami Law School and began his impressive career in the law  He retired from the Navy at the end of last year  and is now back in private law practice as counsel for Wal Mart s international operations In standing up for his beliefs against torture as Counsel for the Navy  Alberto Mora embodied Edmund Burke s famous words  The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing Faced with irrefutable evidence that by condoning torture  the government was acting  he said  in a way clearly contrary to everything we were ever taught about American values  and he felt compelled speak truth to power He said  The Constitution recognizes that man has an inherent right  not bestowed by the state or laws  to personal dignity  including the right to be free of cruelty  It applies to all human beings  not just in Americaeven those designated as  unlawful enemy combatants   If you make this exception  the whole Constitution crumbles It s an honor to have Alberto Mora here today  His courage is an example to us all  and in a moment  Caroline will present him with the lantern symbolizing the award Our second honoree is a highly respected conservative Democrat in the House of Representatives from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  whose decision to speak out on Iraq electrified the country John Murtha is a vivid example of the words of President Kennedy in Profiles in Courage  A man does what he must    in spite of personal consequences  in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures    and that is the basis of all human morality His family has a long tradition of military service  One of his mother s ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War  Another served in the Union Army in the Civil War and actually guarded the Capitol Building where John Murtha serves today  The widow of that Union soldier lived to be 96  and John remembers her telling him as a child  One person can make a difference We may even be distantly related  John s father s ancestors emigrated from Ireland  as did mine  during the Great Potato Famine of the mid 19th century John himself has a long history of patriotism and courage  despite the personal consequences or dangers When he graduated from high school in 1950  the Korean War had just begun  and he wanted to join the Army  His family insisted he go to college  but he felt so uncomfortable on campus sitting out the war that he left after freshman year and enlisted in the Marines  He became a drill instructor at Parris Island  and went on to Officer Training School at Quantico When he graduated  he volunteered to serve in Korea and received orders to do so  But the truce ending the war was declared  and he went to Camp Lejeune instead to complete his service A decade later  he volunteered to serve in Vietnam and again showed his extraordinary dedication  He was wounded twice  received two Purple Hearts  and earned the Bronze Star and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry for his bravery At boot camp  he had done so well that he was given the American Spirit Medal whose citation reads for the display of outstanding qualities of leadership best expressing the American Honor  Initiative  Loyalty  and High Example to Comrades in Arms  He says today that of the sixteen military awards he s received  he s proudest of all of that one His patriotism and commitment to the armed forces continued strong after he left the military  When he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1974  he became the first Vietnam veteran to serve in Congress  Five years later  he was honored with an appointment to the House Appropriations Subcommittee with oversight of the Pentagon  and since 1989  he has served as Chairman of that Subcommittee or as its senior Democrat All of us involved in national security issues know that John Murtha has worked brilliantly for over thirty years in Congress to defend and strengthen our armed forces and protect our national security  He s the voice of our troops in Congress  He knows what they re going through  and he cares deeply about them  As he s said so eloquently  Anybody that s been in combat knows it sears your soul He consistently avoids partisanship  He s earned the respect of the military  and become a confidant of generals and senior defense officials in both Republican and Democratic Administrations  Without doubt  he s one of most respected leaders on military issues in Congress After 9 11  he initially became a strong supporter of the war in Iraq  and the White House cheered him on But he soon began to feel he could not stay silent after what he began hearing from our troops and senior military officials  He criticized the inadequate armor and other supplies for our troops  In September 2003  he said he d been misled into voting for the war the year before  Finally  last November  he decided as a matter of conscience to speak the unvarnished truth  He stated publicly that our troops in Iraq had done all they could  and it was time for them to come home You could feel the earth move in Washington  and the White House knew it  Their political operation went into overdrive  the attack dogs were sent out  and the Swift Boat tactics were dusted off  His military record was wrongly and irresponsibly called into question  He was accused of surrendering to the terrorists and endorsing the policy positions of Michael Moore and the extreme liberal wing of the Democratic party It was a familiar response from an Administration with a pathological aversion to thoughtful criticism    or any criticism    of its policy on Iraq They couldn t fire or demote him  as they did with critics of their policy  They couldn t ignore him or marginalize him  as they did with Alberto Mora Through all the attacks on his patriotism  he never wavered or backed down from his strong view  His courage in speaking out touched the entire nation  and he continues to do so Last week  he called on the Marine Corps to disclose the full truth about a shocking incident involving the death of a Marine followed by the death of numerous civilians supposedly in a bus in Haditha last November  The casualties were initially attributed to an I E D  explosion and shrapnel and firefight  but Murtha said he kept hearing reports from Marines in the field that something much worse had happened As he stated  There was no firefight  There was no explosion that killed civilians in a bus  There was no bus  There was no shrapnel  There were only bullet holes inside the homes where the Marines had gone in Our troops over reacted because of the pressure on them  and they killed innocent civilians in cold blood  he said  That s John Murtha  telling the war like it is As Andrew Jackson said  One man with courage makes a majority  and John Murtha has proved the truth of those words in our own time More than a century ago  a biographer of Andrew Jackson wrote that Jackson was the most American of Americans    an embodiment of the Declaration of Independence    the Fourth of July incarnate  You could say the same thing about Congressman John Murtha The nation owes him a huge debt for refusing to stay silent  It took immense courage for him to do what he did  and he eminently deserves this year s Profile in Courage Award Now it s my privilege to introduce another person who  like our honorees this year  is a great patriot  She s a woman of special grace and courage in her own right  I know President Kennedy would be prouder than ever of her today  and so are all of us in our family   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202
