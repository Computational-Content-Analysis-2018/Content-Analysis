         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  This week  the Senate has the opportunity to set a new and better direction for the safety of the prescription drugs and medical devices that make such a profound difference in the lives of our people Every day  families across America rely on the Food and Drug Administration in ways they barely realize  When they put dinner on the table  they are counting on the FDA to see that food is free from contamination  They trust the FDA to make sure that the drugs they take are safe and effective  From prescription drugs to pacemakers to chemotherapy to the food we eat  the FDA protects the health of hundreds of millions of Americans  and monitors products that account for a quarter of the nations economy The FDA should be the gold standard for safety but its luster has been tarnished in recent years by failure to protect the American people from unsafe drugs  The public was shocked that the arthritis drug Vioxx was able to stay on the market for 5 years  even though it nearly doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke  Antidepressants used by millions were found to increase the risk of suicide in adolescents  Millions of Americans have needlessly been put at risk  and they want action by Congress to reform and strengthen the agency Were responding now with bipartisan legislation that is the product of months of work in our committee  I commend my colleague in this effort  Senator Enzi  for his work on this proposal that will improve the way FDA oversees the safety of the drugs  Almost half of all Americans take at least one pill a day  so this legislation will make a difference in the life of every American family  Our proposals were also strengthened by our colleague from New Hampshire  Senator Gregg Safety is at its core  Our legislation was guided by the recommendations of the impressive report by the Institute of Medicine on the future of drug safety  Its major recommendations for reform are included in this legislation The Institute recommended improving surveillance so that signals of problems in drug safety can be caught early  and lives can be saved  In the case of Vioxx and similar drugs like Celebrex and Bextra  more widespread use of such databases would have saved lives in the past Thats not conjecture  its actual experience  A small number of health systems in America already use electronic records effectively and link them to safety databases  These systems Kaiser Permanente  the Mayo Clinic  and the Veterans Administration all had the means to examine whether Vioxx and other drugs were being use effectively  They found that these drugs were being prescribed inappropriately  and took steps to curb this overuse  As a result  they approved the use of these medications only for patients who had no other options  Overuse went down  and safety improved The use of these databases should not be limited to the few health systems that currently use them  FDA should make use of every aspect of modern health care technology to safeguard the publics health  Mark McClellan  the former FDA Commissioner  calls these kinds of systems Ahealth IT for drug safety  and our proposal includes his recommendations  Surveillance is essential  but effective action is needed when a safety problem is detected  Each drug has unique risks and benefits  There can be no one size fits all approach to drug safety  That is why our legislation includes a flexible but effective program for safety  We call it a Risk Evaluation and Management System  It can be tailored to the unique characteristics of each drug  It gives FDA the authority to act when action is needed to protect public health  but it also contains safeguards to prevent such action from being imposed when there is no reason to do so For some drugs  it is essential to require post market studies  Yet FDA today lacks the basic authority to require such trials to be conducted  FDA can request them but it cant require them  and has few ways to see that they are completed  As a result  companies routinely promise to conduct studies that are never even started much less completed According to the New England Journal of Medicine  three quarters of post market studies requested by the FDA have never been started  and only 11 percent have been completed and have filed their results with the FDA  It is absurd that the FDA can identify a public health need and request a study but can take no action when its request is ignored  Its only alternative is to enforce its request with the empty threat to withdraw the drug from the market a severe measure that FDA rightly only uses when there is a direct threat to patients  With no ability to take intermediate enforcement measures  FDA must stay on the sidelines while companies ignore their responsibilities In its recent report on drug safety  GAO pointed out the failure of the current system  Its report states  In the absence of specific authority  FDA often relies on drug sponsors voluntarily agreeing to conduct such post market studies  But the post market studies that drug sponsors agree to conduct have not consistently been completed  FDA has little leverage to ensure that these studies are carried out  for example  by imposing administrative penalties Our legislation solves this major problem  It gives FDA clear authority to require the conduct of post market studies when there is a public health need to do so  and it gives FDA the ability to assess fines on those who ignore their responsibilities Databases and post market studies help detect problems  but FDA needs the ability to take other action to protect public health  Here too  current law is inadequate  FDA lacks clear authority to require measures to protect public health  When lives are on the line  doctors are making the critical decisions  But because FDAs authority is so unclear  it must first call the lawyers for their opinion as to whether the agency can act  The Institute of Medicine identified this major weakness of current law and called on Congress to give FDA the authority to require risk management programs when needed to protect health  These programs can be as simple as new information on a drug label  or an advisory notice to doctors  or as sophisticated as special monitoring programs for patients who use a particular drug  The legislation does not make the decision about which measures should be taken for which drugs but it does give FDA the authority to make the right choice for public health This authority has been lacking in the past  For Vioxx  it took 14 months to change the drugs label to warn doctors and patients of the danger  Because FDA had weak authority  it had to ask the manufacturer to change the label  voluntarily and the manufacturer stalled and stalled When patients are in danger  FDA should not have to wait to get legal opinions to decide how to protect health  It should be able to act immediately  and our bill gives them that authority In many cases  companies have hidden evidence of safety problems  Our bill addresses this abuse by including a public database of all clinical trials and their results  A company will no longer be able to conduct a trial  and then hide the results if they dont show what the company wanted Some would say that any increase in drug safety will inevitably decrease access to needed drugs  But thats a false argument  Consider the situation now when FDA is confronted by a new drug that may pose safety risks or where additional study may be required  With little expectation that those risks will be mitigated by voluntary approaches and with no ability to ensure that the studies are conducted  FDA might reasonably conclude that the risks of approving the drug are too great  Under our legislation  the calculation is reversed  With this bill in place  FDA could allow patients to have access to the drug  secure in the knowledge that effective safety measures were in place Thats not just my judgment its the judgment of a coalition of advocacy organizations representing over 30 million patients  This coalition  the Alliance for Drug Safety and Access  wrote Congress a letter saying  This legislation gives the FDA the ability to continue to study the safety of drugs after approval  flexible enforcement tools necessary to ensure compliance with these new safety protections  and additional funding to support these new activities  Allowing the agency to act on clear safety signals could actually allow the FDA to approve drugs more quickly  knowing it will have the ability to respond on behalf of patients if safety concerns appear post market Thats the balance our legislation strikes  greater safety  hand in hand with better access As our debate continues  Ill discuss additional aspects of the legislation especially its new ideas for accelerating drug development  its renewal of our commitment to safe and effective drugs for children  and its provisions to improve drug science and increase the transparency of the FDA  Im also working with my colleagues from Iowa and Kansas  Senator Harkin and Senator Roberts  on ways to refine our provisions on direct to consumer advertising  to make certain they are consistent with the Constitution Im also working with Senator Durbin and other colleagues on the committee on proposals on food safety and on pet food  These bipartisan proposals are being readied for floor action shortly  and I look forward to further discussion of them  Our committee will continue to work to improve the ways that FDA can monitor and improve food safety In this new era of the life sciences  medical advances will continue to bring immense benefits for our citizens  To fulfill the potential of that bright future  we need not only brilliant researchers to develop the drugs of tomorrow  but also strong and vigilant watchdogs for public health to guarantee that new drugs and medical devices are safe and beneficial  and that they actually reach the patients who urgently need them  Congress has ample power to restore the luster that FDA has lost in recent years  The legislation we are now considering represents a bipartisan consensus on the best way to get the job done   Below is a summary of the bill  THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REVITALIZATION ACTTitle IPrescription Drug User FeesTitle I codifies the user fee agreement reached by drug and biotech industries with the FDA  It establishes an overall amount for user fees of nearly  393 million for 2008  which will be adjusted upward based on 2007 workload   It includes the expansion of use of drug user fees by nearly  30 million for post approval drug safety programs Title I also includes a user fee program under which drug companies can submit direct to consumer television advertisements to FDA for review before they are distributed Title IIDrug SafetySubtitle ARisk Evaluation and Mitigation StrategiesA system of routine active surveillance for post market drug safety will be established  The partnership will aggregate data from Federal and private health databases  Active surveillance will occur for every newly approved drug  Using a risk based approach  drugs and biologics may be approved with risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  REMS   Personnel from offices for drug safety are integrated into the drug review process Minimal Elements of a REMS  FDA approved professional labeling  A timetable for periodic assessment of the REMS Additional Elements of a REMS For drugs with out of the ordinary risks  the REMS may include additional elements to protect patient safety  such as  Special training for doctors who prescribe the drug  Additional studies conducted after approval Compliance  Civil money penalties for violation of any component of a REMS Resources  Increased drug user fees would be used to review REMS and for FDAs general drug safety surveillance  This subtitle steps up user fee revenue annually  including  25 million authorized for the routine surveillance of drugs once marketed to reach the  100 million called for by the IOM Direct to Consumer Ads  DTC   The bill as reported allows FDA to impose a moratorium on DTC in rare circumstances  We are evaluating whether requiring expanded safety information in DTC ads  coupled with fines for misleading ads may be an alternate way of achieving the goal of accurate information to consumers  IMPROVING THE SCIENTIFIC ENVIRONMENT AT FDATransparency The bill includes important measures to promote transparency  such as posting of the action package for approval for drugs  including scientific commentaries   as well as requiring notice of the actions of the Drug Safety Oversight Board  and a report on the involvement of safety staff in drug review activities at FDA  Improving Science The bill includes additional measures to improve science at FDA  including the establishment of an Office of the Chief Scientist  and putting in statute a required consultation with the Drug Safety and Risk Management committee on priority drug safety questions and on the effectiveness of aspects of the REMS process Subtitle BReagan Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug AdministrationSubtitle B establishes a foundation to lead collaborations amongst the FDA  academic research institutions  and industry directed to improving the process of drug development and evaluation  Collaborative research projects will be selected that are designed to bolster R  D productivity  provide new tools for improving safety in drug evaluation  and in the long term make drug development more predictable and manageable  This institute will be financially supported by both industry and the government Subtitle CClinical TrialsClinical Trials Registry  To enhance patient enrollment and provide a mechanism to track subsequent progress of trials  clinical trials of late Phase II  Phase III and Phase IV would be required to register in a publicly available database  Certain basic pieces of information would be placed in fields in the database entry  while the bulk of the information would be in summary documents Clinical Trials Results  To ensure that results of trials are made public  and that patients and providers have the most up to date information  publicly available information  including the FDAs action package on a drug  will be deposited in a publicly available database  Device clinical trials to support FDA approval or clearance are also included  as well as pediatric postmarket surveillance  HHS will be given regulatory authority to require inclusion of results for trials not covered by publicly available information  Civil monetary penalties will enforce these requirements Subtitle DConflicts of Interest Subtitle D requires pre disclosure of conflicts of interest of advisory committee members  and greater efforts by FDA to identify non conflicted members Title IIIMedical Device User FeesThe legislation implements the agreement between the FDA and the medical device industry groups  It reauthorizes the medical device user fee program  streamlines the third part review program  and provides for electronic registration of device manufacturing plants Title IV  Pediatric Medical ProductsSubtitle A  Best Pharmaceuticals for ChildrenSubtitle A would reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and improve its provisions in order to make it more effective at ensuring that drugs are safe and effective for pediatric populations  BPCA provides increased market exclusivity to drug manufacturers to encourage the determination of safety and efficacy of drugs in pediatric populations  The bill contains a three month adjustment on exclusivity if the annual U S  sales of the drug exceed  1 billion  Products earning less than  1 billion continue to receive six months of exclusivity Subtitle B  Pediatric Research ImprovementSubtitle B reauthorizes the Pediatric Research Equity Act to make it more effective at ensuring that drugs for children are safe and effective  If a company chooses not to pursue pediatric exclusivity for an already marketed drug under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act  the Secretary can require the submission of pediatric data for such drug  This authority has never been utilized for drugs that are already approved  in part due to the lengthy administrative process required to invoke such authority  PRIA would streamline this administrative process and help get essential pediatric data for important drugs  It would also expand the ability of the Secretary to use this authority in cases where such data would represent a benefit to a large number of children  or help us to learn more about risks with certain drugs Subtitle C Pediatric Medical DevicesSubtitle C modifies the existing humanitarian device exemption  HDE  for medical devices to allow profit for HDE approved devices specifically designed to meet a pediatric need  It maintains existing requirement that a humanitarian use device is limited to one that treats and diagnoses diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 4 000 individuals in the U S  per year  No profit will be allowed for a device used in more than 4 000 individuals  Miscellaneous Provisions The bill contains two amendments adopted in committee  one on medical marijuana and the other on drug labeling  It also makes a technical correction to two bills enacted last year  the BARDA legislation and the NIH reauthorization  Supporters of the Chairmans Mark Jim Guest  President
