         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Its a privilege to place before the committee for consideration today the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act  Its an honor to join Senator Snowe  Senator Enzi  Senator Dodd  Senator Harkin  Senator Gregg  and other members of our committee in support of this needed legislation I especially commend Senator Snowe for her leadership in this effort to establish protections for the public against genetic discrimination  Its now over a decade since Senator Snowe first introduced legislation on the issue  It passed the Senate 98 0 in the last Congress  and Im very hopeful we can work with our colleagues in the House and enact it into law  so that our people will finally have the protections they need against the misuse of genetic information In this century of the life sciences  much of what we learn through biomedical research is being translated into new treatments and cures  and nowhere is the explosion of scientific progress more apparent than in the field of genetics  Four years after the remarkable achievement of discovering the sequence of the human genome  clinical testing is now possible for over a thousand genetic diseases  Its led to rapid growth in the field of personalized medicine  in which patients treatment and care is individualized according to their genetic make up In the absence of federal protections  however  patients fear that undergoing genetic tests may lead to disqualification from future insurance coverage  or that an employer will fire them or deny a promotion based on the results of a genetic test  The consequence is that many Americans are choosing not to be tested  and are declining to participate in clinical trials so important for the development of new treatments Discrimination based on genetics is just as wrong as discrimination based on race or gender  Our bill provides specific protections for citizens against genetic discrimination  It prohibits health insurers from picking and choosing their customers based on genetics  Employers cannot fire or refuse to hire persons because of their genetic characteristics  It enables Americans to benefit from better health care through the use of genetic information  without the fear that it will be misused against them   It is difficult to imagine information more personal or more private than a persons genetic makeup  It should not be shared by insurers or employers  or be used in making decisions about health coverage or a job  It should only be used by patients and their doctors to make the best diagnostic and treatment decisions they can  In the near future  genetic tests will become even cheaper and more widely available  If we dont ban discrimination now  it may soon be routine for employers to use genetic tests to deny jobs to employees  based on their risk for disease If Congress enacts clear protections against genetic discrimination in employment and health insurance  all Americans will be able to enjoy the benefits of genetic research  free from the fear that their personal genetic information will be misused  If Congress fails to make sure that genetic information is used only for legitimate purposes  we may well squander the vast potential of genetic research to improve the nations health The bill that we are considering today has been unanimously approved by the full Senate in the past two Congresses  We passed it 95 0 in the 108th Congress  and 98 0 in the 109th Congress  It had over 240 co sponsors in the House in both Congresses  but the leadership refused to bring it to a vote As President Bush himself has said  Genetic information should be an opportunity to prevent and treat disease  not an excuse for discrimination  Just as our nation addressed discrimination based on race  we must now prevent discrimination based on genetic information    Were closer than ever to enactment  I urge the Committee to approve the bill  and this time  I think well finally see it become law   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
