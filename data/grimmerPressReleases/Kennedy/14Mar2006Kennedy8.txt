         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Amendment seeks increase investment in critical programs that open the doors of opportunity for students  workers and families Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  joined by Senators Susan Collins and Robert Menendez  introduced an amendment to the Budget Resolution that seeks to increase spending on education programs that are slashed in the Bush Administration s budget proposal  Kennedy s amendment  which he succeeded in passing in the Senate last year but was stripped in conference  would secure funding for the Pell grant increasing it from  4 050 to  4 500 as well as securing resources to restore Bush eliminations of TRIO  GEAR UP  LEAP  and Perkins loans  The amendment would provide a further increase for funding for all student aid programs  including SEOG  work study  and graduate education  Senator Kennedy said  Today  more than ever  meeting the new and dynamic challenges of our own time demands that we rely heavily on education as a major strategy to advance America in the years ahead  With this budget  we have a choice  We can invest in the education programs that will help nourish the talents of every individual in the country and equip them to compete in the 21st century  Or we can pay lip service to the need to keep America competitive  while allowing this budget to slash the very programs that will get us there  To combat the pressures of a global economy  Kennedy s amendment also seeks to restore funding for job training and for the Perkins Vocational Education program  which is eliminated under President Bush s proposed budget The amendment will increase discretionary spending by  6 3 billion for education  paid for by closing  6 3 billion in corporate tax loopholes and tax shelters already voted to be closed by the United States Senate but not enacted into law  Last month  Kennedy introduce his plan to to reinvest in America s competitiveness and turn around the damaging impact of the global economy  He believes that we cannot advance forward by continuing down the same path of the last five years that put special interests over America s interests by cutting back on investments in education  invention  and innovation  as the Administration has done STATEMENT BY SENATOR KENNEDY ON STUDENT AID AND JOB TRAINING AMENDMENT  AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY ON SENATE FLOOR  America s founders recognized educational opportunity as an enduring truth  John Adams emphasized this commitment when he drafted the Massachusetts constitution in 1780  and included a specific statement that education of the people was necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties  When John Adams enshrined those wise words into our state s founding document  he understood what we know is still true today    that education is the key to our future success    not only as individuals  but as a Commonwealth and as a nation  A strong education encourages good citizenship  It strengthens our economy and our national defense  and enables new generations of Americans to fulfill their dreams  It is the true path to opportunity  Guided by these principles  Massachusetts has embraced education as essential to our democracy  Our state is proud to have the oldest public high school in the nation  Boston Latin   the oldest college  Harvard  in the nation and one of the first career and technical schools  Worcester Boys Trade School   Horace Mann  as secretary of the Board of Education in Massachusetts  led the effort to create the first public school system    through common schools focusing on the elementary years  Massachusetts was the first state to pass a compulsory education law As a nation  we also have embraced these principles  Indeed  we have risen to new challenges  time and time again  and education has been a large part of the answer In the industrial revolution  we made a national commitment to expand access to high schools and America prospered  At the end of World War II  we passed the GI Bill  We opened the doors of college to a great new generation  revitalized our own economy  and reached out to revive the devastated nations we had fought against  For every dollar invested  the nation received  7 in economic returns After Sputnik s launch  we passed the National Defense Education Act to strengthen our global competitiveness and our national security alike  by providing low interest college loans and grants  investing in vocational education programs and equipment to improve math  science and foreign language learning  We doubled our education budget to meet the new challenge Today  more than ever  meeting the new and dynamic challenges of our own time demands that we rely heavily on education as a major strategy to advance America in the years ahead  We must compete in our shrinking world economy not by lowering our wages  but by raising our skills  We want our workers and our businesses to win the good jobs of the future  This is our new arms race  And to win it  we must transform American education With this budget  we have a choice  We can invest in the education programs that will help nourish the talents of every individual in the country and equip them to compete in the 21st century  Or we can pay lip service to the need to keep America competitive  while allowing this budget to slash the very programs that will get us there  Last year  the Council on Competitiveness urged a focus on lifelong skill development    through elementary  secondary and higher education  training and workforce support  as key to keeping America on the cutting edge of innovation  The recent National Academy of Sciences Report echoed these recommendations  with two of the report s four major recommendations pointing to education as the solution to meeting the global challenge  The National Association of Manufacturers issued a report urging a renewed focus on education and training to keep American businesses competitive  Report after report has echoed the call to invest in education in order to shore up our ability to compete in the global market  yet this budget resolution cuts education funding  The amendment I am offering today puts our priorities back in order and puts America back on the right track to a prosperous future  It helps make college more available and affordable  It restores misguided cuts to career and technical programs that keep education relevant for high school students and that help high school and community college graduates qualify for good jobs  Finally  it restores cuts to job training programs that assist worker improve their skills and advance their careers Access to College Now more than ever  we must do more to see that students graduate from high school and go on to get a college degree  In 1950  when I graduated from school  only 15 percent of jobs required some post secondary training  Today  the number is over 60 percent and rising rapidly However  we are witnessing a growing gulf in college attendance between the rich and poor  The gap is shameful  Each year  400 000 college ready students don t attend a four year college because they can t afford it  Never before has the financial challenge of attending college been greater for young students It s time for America to agree that cost must never be a barrier to college education  We simply cannot afford to do otherwise  But Federal aid has not kept pace with the rising cost of college This has resulted in an increasing gap between grant aid and college costs  The average cost of attending a public 4 year college this school year is  12 127    triple the maximum Pell Grant  The gap between the Pell Grant and the cost of college is now almost  8 100 Twice last year the Senate voted to start to close this gap with an immediate increase in the maximum Pell grant to  4 500  Last spring  the Senate voted for an amendment similar to the one we are offering today  It restored cuts to key education programs and immediately increased the Pell grant  The amendment won with bipartisan support  but the funding was stripped by conferees  Again  in the fall  as part of the Budget Reconciliation process  the Senate approved  6 billion in mandatory funding to immediately increase aid for Pell recipients by raising the maximum award to  4 500  But again  the proposal was rejected by conferees  Instead  in a back room deal  they dramatically reduced the funding for student aid and adopted a program that allowed only 10  of needy students to benefit In both of his campaigns  President Bush pledged to increase the maximum Pell grant to  5 100  but his budget  and the Resolution before us  would leave it frozen at  4 050 for the fifth year in a row  It s time to make reality match the rhetoric  America will not succeed in the global challenge if we help only 10  of the students who need our help  We have to open the doors of opportunity to all  That means an immediate increase in grant aid for all Pell recipients  This amendment also restores capital funding for the Perkins loan program to ensure that the hundreds of thousands of Perkins recipients continue to have access to up to  4 000 in subsidized loans  This program is particularly important for low income students attending some of the best private colleges in the world  These students have often reached the maximum limits under the Stafford loan program and need the Perkins money to make ends meet GEAR UP TRIO We must also do more to ensure that our students complete high school and prepare for and aspire to go to college  This amendment supports the TRIO and GEAR UP programs  which help disadvantaged students graduate from high school and become the first in their families to complete college  Simply put  students who have access to the TRIO and GEAR UP programs will have more opportunities in life because the programs open the doors of educational opportunity for them  The pending Budget Resolution assumes these programs will be eliminated  Chairman Gregg pointed out during the Committee consideration of the Resolution that these were programs with proven track records that would have a good chance of survival during the appropriations process  But his budget adopts the Administration s overall funding levels  making it impossible to retain funding for these programs without causing even deeper cuts to other critical programs CAREER  TECHNICAL EDUCATION  JOB TRAINING Today s workers also need help acquiring the skills they need to succeed  Programs like the Perkins Career and Technical Education Program and federal job training programs provide them with that assistance  Yet  this budget does not provide the necessary funding for these programs  At the end of last year in my home state of Massachusetts  there were over 72 800 job vacancies  This was up from 71 900 in the last quarter of 2004  At the same time  we have 156 000 unemployed people in the state  We must do more to help workers build the skills they need to fill the jobs of the future    and the jobs of today  This amendment addresses these needs by ensuring the continuation of the Perkins career and technical education program  This program helps many students stay in school by making school more relevant to them through programs that connect academics with technical skills  It helps ensure that these students stay on a track to getting good jobs when they graduate  Last year in Massachusetts  91  of secondary school students in these programs completed them  and 96  had positive placements in postsecondary education or the workforce  We must also commit to helping raise the skills of the American workforce to help our workers get the training they need to maintain their competitiveness in the job market  My amendment ensures that proposed cuts to the job training programs under the Workforce Investment Act are rejected CONCLUSION The Budget Resolution before us signals our priorities and our values to the nation and the world  And it sets the course for the future of this country The budget Resolution before us sets the wrong priorities for American families and the wrong priorities for America s future  Instead of restoring access to educational opportunity  it adopts funding levels that will dictate deep cuts to education and to job training  It includes no increase in the maximum Pell Grant  It puts the American dream farther out of reach  Today  we must choose to put America back on the right track  We must choose to help millions more Americans to meet the challenge of paying for college and help American workers attain the skills they need to compete for good jobs in the rapidly changing economy  We must choose to restore access to the American dream This amendment commits us to do more  not less  in making good education and good training a reality for all Americans  and I urge my colleagues to support it      Kennedy Collins Menendez Student Aid Job Training Budget Amendment Preserving the American Dream in the 21st Century  The Kennedy Collins Menendez amendment increases investment in critical programs that help open the doors of opportunity for students  workers and families   Making College Attainable and Affordable  Gives Americans the opportunity to attain a college degree and better compete in the global economy by   o Securing resources for a  4 500 maximum Pell Grant immediately   1 8 billion   Twice last year the Senate voted in favor of an immediate  4 500 Pell Grant o Securing resources to restore Bush eliminations of TRIO  GEAR UP  LEAP  and Perkins loans  and further increase funding for all student aid programs  including SEOG  work study  and graduate education   2 4 billion   Securing good jobs  Ensures that all Americans have the opportunity to build their skills and get good jobs by   o Restoring Bush budget cuts to job training   750 million  o Restoring Bush budget elimination of the Perkins Vocational Education program   1 3 billion  Total Cost  Approximately  6 3 billion in increased discretionary spending for education  paid for by closing  6 3 billion in corporate tax loopholes and abusive tax shelters already voted to be closed by the United States Senate but not enacted into law Message  It s more important to help families pay for college and help all Americans be equipped for the jobs in the global economy than it is to maintain corporate tax loopholes BUSH EDUCATION BUDGET JEOPARDIZES AMERICA S FUTURE Proposes Largest Cut to Education in the
