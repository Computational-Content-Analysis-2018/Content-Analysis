         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    In 1978  President Carter signed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act into law  successfully ending years of debate on the power of the President to conduct surveillance on U S  soil    The enactment of FISA was a recognition of Congresss role in national security and a demonstration of what can be achieved through bipartisan and inter branch cooperation  There was only one vote against the bill  In his signing statement  President Carter said  the act helps to solidify the trust between the American people and their Government  It provides a basis of trust of the American people in the fact that the activities of their intelligence agencies are both effective and lawful  We also had a signing statement that affirmed the Presidents intent to comply with the law    Now  however  the situation is very different  Public trust in government is eroding  and serious constitutional doubts abound    It doesnt have to be this way  Were far stronger on national security when all of us stand together  We all agree on the need for law enforcement and intelligence officers to have strong powers to investigate terrorism  prevent future attacks  and improve information sharing between federal  state and local law enforcement  Cooperation between the Administration and Congress is vital for our national security  We need to come together to protect the security of our country    Modern electronic surveillance can be a useful tool for the Government to gather intelligence  But if its abused  it can be a particularly indiscriminate and penetrating invasion of the privacy of our citizens  Technologies may change  but our objective should stay the same  to reach a fair balance  capable of protecting our citizens without infringing on their basic rights and liberties    When we passed FISA  the country was facing the same kind of fundamental questions were facing now  The technologies were more limited  but the threats facing our country were great  The Cold War was underway and we faced a nuclear superpower  yet Congress did not enact laws that ignore the fundamental principles enshrined in our Constitution  and we should not do so now   Our guiding principle must be is our constitutional role as a check on the Presidents power in the area of national security  The entire basis for FISA  as Attorney General Edward Levi agreed at the time  is that even if the President has an inherent constitutional power to authorize warrantless surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes  Congress has the power to regulate the exercise of that power  For that reason  FISA placed internal and external checks on the power of the executive   We must fulfill our role responsibly  We should proceed deliberately and not act before weve carefully studied all of the issues  With unnecessary haste  were heading down a path that could lead to many unintended consequences  We need to explore all of the proposals thoroughly  Our staff has received numerous versions of the Chairmans proposal since it was first circulated  and several provisions in the latest proposal are new and complex  Before rushing ahead  we should have an opportunity to discuss the scope of these proposed changes    In addition  were still waiting for written responses to the questions that members of the committee submitted to witnesses after the July 26th hearing  Because of the gravity and complexity of the issues  we need to consider them matters in detail before acting    More hearings are clearly needed  and the Chairman indicated to Ranking Member Leahy that he would be willing to schedule more hearings to discuss the complex changes in his most recent proposal    My concerns certainly are not limited to the process  I have serious substantive concerns as well about the Chairmans proposal  It creates a shadow regime for domestic surveillance  free of judicial or congressional oversight  and skirting FISA  even though there has been no demonstration that FISA is not adequate to the task or cannot be modified to remove existing obstacles to effective intelligence gathering  The Chairmans proposal abdicates Congresss role in national security  deferring to an Administration that has proved untrustworthy time and again    The Chairmans deal with the White House has echoes of blanket authority  It would give the Executive an electronic blank check to spy on our citizens  Under the guise of new technologies  this Administration and the Chairman would grant powers to the Executive that the nations founders rejected  The reaction to the improper searches of the 1700s was embodied in the words in the Fourth Amendment  which rejected the use of such blanket searches without any basis for individual suspicion  and which provided protection from unchecked intrusions    A provision in FISA allows the Attorney General to conduct surveillance without a court order for one year  but only if the surveillance was solely directed at the contents of communications transmitted by a means of communications used exclusively between or among foreign powers  This exception was narrowly tailored to give the intelligence agencies greater flexibility    There is also a 15 day exception to FISAs requirements during times of war  but we did not make a decision to punt the hard questions  as some have suggested  Our intent was clear and unambiguous  and the result of many long hours of negotiation    By contrast  the Chairmans proposal would set no limits  Instead  it allows the President to pick and choose when to consult with Congress and the courts  Unfettered discretion would result in the very abuses that FISA was intended to prevent   After September 11th  the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress did not authorize domestic electronic surveillance  and certainly not domestic electronic surveillance of American citizens  without a judicial warrant  The Administration obviously wants unchecked and unlimited authority to be able to monitor communications without any Congressional or court oversight    The Chairmans major selling point for his bill has been that it provides the only avenue for obtaining judicial review of the lawfulness of the NSA surveillance program  The President would remain free  however  under the Chairmans bill to refuse to allow judicial review    Even if the President did submit the program for review  it would apparently be reviewed in a secret proceeding at which only the government would appear  Thats a long way from the open  adversarial manner in which we traditionally resolve significant constitutional issues in our country    The bill would also consolidate all of the existing challenges to the NSA surveillance program in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review  There are currently dozens of challenges around the country  one of which has already resulted in a holding that the program is unconstitutional  Others are headed toward final adjudication  We should not truncate that process by herding all of the cases into a forum that is not suited to their adjudication   If the President believes that winning the war on terror requires new surveillance capabilities  he should work with Congress to expand current law  not just pledge to follow legislation that destroys our surveillance laws  We shouldnt throw out the playbook  The President and his team ignored well established laws  and they should not be rewarded with new legislation that immunizes such reckless decisions  and gives them far greater unchecked powers     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
