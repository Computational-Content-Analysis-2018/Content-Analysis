         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      America is a stronger  better  more hopeful nation than this budget represents  It shortchanges our future instead of equipping our citizens to compete and win in the 21st century economy   and it falls short of reflecting the values that strengthen and unite us as Americans     The misplaced priorities in this budget have frightening implications for America s future  We re now seeing that the price of the Administration s trillion dollar tax breaks for the wealthy is a weaker America  After four years of mismanaging our economy and our budget  the White House has left nothing for what really counts most to most Americans   opportunity  fairness  and a strong future  How can Americans succeed in today s global economy with less education  less health care  and less pay     Americans always have been willing to sacrifice in times of war  But there s nothing equal about our wartime sacrifice in this budget when millionaires get more tax breaks while our children are in crowded classrooms      Budgets are not neutral documents  they are moral blueprints for the nation  When we cut Medicaid  housing  food assistance  education and other basic programs  we certainly do wrong to the poor  our seniors and our nation s children      Congress should reject this budget and start over with a new budget that really reflects the values and priorities of American families   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
