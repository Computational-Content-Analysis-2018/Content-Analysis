         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I support free trade  and I have long voted for trade agreements that truly level the playing field for our country  for our workers  and for our businesses  Free trade removes unfair barriers to American goods in world markets  It creates a fair playing field for competition between American workers and workers abroad  Free and fair trade creates jobs and strengthens our economy But this Central American agreement is not free trade  and I urge the Senate to reject this unfair agreement Especially at this time when American workers are deeply concerned about their jobs being outsourced overseas  the Bush Administration is wrong to negotiate an agreement that refuses to protect them  It allows participating countries to use labor practices that fail to meet international standards  It means that American workers    the best in the world    will be forced to compete with countries whose workers are abused and exploited  That is not fair trade I am also for progress and economic development in Central America  dating back to President Kennedy s Alliance for Progress But this agreement does nothing to improve labor rights for workers in CAFTA nations  All it asks is that they enforce their existing laws  It does nothing to create a community of nations that respect basic rights and dignities Most CAFTA nations give their workers no real rights such as an eight hour work day  overtime pay or protection against discrimination Laws in some CAFTA nations are even hostile to organized labor   workers in El Salvador  Nicaragua and Honduras can be fired for joining a union or even intending to organize a union  In Nicaragua strikes are prohibited without government permission  Even where laws do exist  violations often cannot lead to fines or sanctions This study written by the International Labor Rights Fund and commissioned by the U S  Department of Labor cites these injustices  However  the Administration ordered this independent contractor to pull the report from its website and demanded that it not discuss its results  This is a blatant abuse of power that hurts both Central American and American workers It doesn t have to be this way  We know how to negotiate free trade agreements with allies to improve conditions for their workers and level the playing field for American workers  An obvious example is the free trade agreement with Jordan that was negotiated by President Clinton The CAFTA agreement doesn t just ignore international standards for Central American workers  It also fails to include aid for the many American workers likely to be displaced if this agreement goes into effect When the Senate Finance Committee debated this agreement  it recommended that CAFTA include aid for displaced American workers  But the White House ignored that bipartisan recommendation The President abused his power and presented Congress and the American people with this take it or leave it plan We know we can do better  We should reject this defective agreement and send the White House back to the drawing board Although CAFTA is the Administration s top trade priority  it actually does very little to reduce the nation s growing overall trade deficit  Trade in the region accounts for less than 1 5  of total U S  trade  The Administration s own International Trade Commission says the agreement will barely lead to any improvement in GDP    an increase of only one tenth of one percent  Instead of a policy to reduce our trade imbalance with China and deal with its currency manipulations and WTO violations  the Administration has spent more than a year on this trade agreement that will do embarrassingly little to improve jobs and the economy  It s out of touch with sensible trade priorities of this country  and it ignores the real needs of America s families Meanwhile  other priorities are left to fester  Not a single health care bill has been debated on the floor of the Senate this year  The ranks of the uninsured continue to rise  Employers continue to drop employee coverage or raise their premiums It s a national disgrace that we have done nothing to address the worsening crisis in health care Communities across the country struggle to deal with the inadequate funding of the No Child Left Behind Act  while students continue to suffer The dream of a college education moves farther out of reach for millions of qualified students as tuition continues to rise  We have the resources to provide new federal aid by closing loopholes that benefit banks at the expense of students but  the Senate fails to act On these and many other issues where action is necessary  the Administration has taken a head in the sand approach  They can t wish away these problems  We need real action and strong leadership on these pressing issues  not defective trade agreements that only make the very real problems of millions of hard working American families even worse   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
