         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  I always enjoy listening to my friend from Alabama  He has been very much involved and engaged in the discussion and debate on this issue in our Judiciary Committee  But I caution those watching this debate to examine his comments  where he said  Any individuals that came here illegally  this bill puts them automatically on a path for citizenship  That statement is categorically wrong  It does not  I will explain about the provisions of the legislation  I would not support that proposal  The members of the Judiciary Committee that supported the underlying legislation  the McCain Kennedy legislation  dont support that proposal     We gather here today to begin debate on our effort to correct a great historic wrong     For decades  this country has turned a blind eye to the plight of the stranger in our midst  and looked away in indifference as undocumented immigrants have been exploited at the workplace and have been forced with their families to live in constant fear of detection and deportation     We have ignored the tough conditions endured by the undocumented  and the harmful ripple effects undocumented employment has on some U S  workers  For decades Congress has failed to take sensible steps to end undocumented immigration  and some of our policy choices have even contributed to the current crisis     We first confronted this problem directly in 1952  passing a law known in the parlance of the time as the Wetback bill  which made it a crime to harbor or abet undocumented immigrants  But at the same time  over the vigorous objections of President Truman  Congress carved out the Texas Provisoso called because it was drafted by agricultural producers from that Statewhich made it legal to employ undocumented immigrants  This decision protected the economic pull factors which have sustained illegal migration since that time     In 1961 the Edward R  Murrow documentary Harvest of Shame directed the Nations attention to the miserable conditions under which migrant farm workers toiled to bring cheap fruit and vegetables to our table  Congress responded by terminating the deeply flawed Bracero guest worker program  and strict limits were imposed for the first time on labor migration from Mexico  I was part of that effort in the Senate to end that unacceptable and outrageously exploitive program  These changes to our immigration policy were well intentioned  but with hindsight their result was predictable  by ending legal migration  but allowing employers to bid for immigrant labor  Congress all but guaranteed a generation of undocumented immigrants would emerge     Since that time  economic disparity between the U S  and its neighbors increased  globalization made travel in and out of the U S  easier  and two whole generations of foreign workers and U S  employers came of age in an economic system organized around illegal migration     In truth  Congress has done little since then to confront this problem  In 1986 we passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act  but IRCAs employer sanctions provisions have never been enforced  Rather than confront the structural causes of undocumented immigration  Congress has repeatedly attacked the symptoms of this disease  building more fences and placing more agents at the U S  Mexican border  and imposing more restrictions on immigrants legal rights  These blunt enforcement tools have not quenched employers thirst for immigrant workers  and they have not given families the tools to be reunited with their loved ones  Instead  enforcement only approaches have driven immigrants farther into the desert and deeper underground     For decades  we tolerated undocumented immigration because it seemed like a win win exchange  employers and consumers were given access to cheap labor and low cost goods and services  but Congress was not required to make politically difficult decisions about expanding legal low skilled immigration  Page S2487     But  of course  undocumented immigration has not been cost freefar from it  And recent changes make continued indifference to this crisis impossible  Undocumented immigrants now live in every State in the Nation  and whole sectors of the economyfrom construction  to food services  to health care  to agriculturedepend on undocumented workers to stay in business     Labor and business alike now demand a system in which workers rights are respected and in which workers are no longer vulnerable to deportation     Millions of U S  citizens now demand a system in which their husbands  wives  parents  children  and neighbors can plan for the future  And the continued health of the American economy demands a system in which all of these workers join the formal labor force  pay their taxes  and play by the rules     United States relations with Mexico and other countries of origin have also changed  and changed dramatically  In 1965  when the foundation for our current system was put in place  Mexico was an authoritarian state and barely a top 10 United States trade partner  Now Mexico is a flourishing democracy  a partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement  and our No  2 trade partner in the world  Over 300 million legal border crossings occur between the United States and Mexico each year  and trade across the border totals  650 million a day  Yet this relationship and our broader regional interests are jeopardized by this humanitarian crisis at the border and by the exploitation of immigrants within the United States     President Bush is traveling to Mexico this week  and the crisis of undocumented immigration  including the enormous strain it places on our partnership with Mexico  will be at the top of the agenda     And  of course  the 9 11 attacks remind us that undocumented immigration creates a crisis of insecurity  America spends billions of dollars tracking entries and exits at our ports of entry  but we have no idea about the identity of millions of immigrants already living among us  The vast majority of these undocumented immigrants are honest and hard working  but our national security requires that we identify and monitor those who are not     We all agree that the time has come for Congress to act  but how shall we do so  Fundamentally  we must choose between two alternatives     Some would have us build higher and longer walls at the border  They would have us further restrict migrants legal rights and make these hard working men and women not just subject to deportation but also do time in U S  prisons for the crime of living and working in this country  They would go much further  actually making felons of people such as Cardinal Mahoney and tens of thousands of other clergy and social workers who are offering counseling or humanitarian support to undocumented immigrants     Yet the United States lacks the resources or the political will to actually remove all of the 11 million undocumented immigrants among us  Doing so would cost  240 billion  it would wreak havoc with our economy  and it would destroy millions of American families  Nor in a global economy do we truly have the desire or the capacity to build an impenetrable wall around ourselves     The idea that blunt enforcement will disrupt this deeply entrenched system of undocumented immigration flies in the face of history and economics  Rather  this enforcement only approach would simply replicate the policy failures of the past  Down this road lie further undocumented immigration  further insecurity  further economic polarization  and further exploitation of the poorest and most vulnerable among us     I must say  on the issue of the wall  all we have to do is look at our recent history  We have spent  20 billion over the last 10 years  We have a wall now that is 66 miles long  There are 1 800 more miles along the Mexican border  if we are talking about building walls  We have tripled the number of border guards  built the wall along the border  and we find the present system is not functioning or working  How many times do we have to learn that lesson  and how much more would it cost us if we go that particular route  It is a route that is unacceptable  expensive  and unworkable     We propose an alternative approach  We propose to end this system of exploitation and to right this historical injustice     The PRESIDING OFFICER  The Senator has used 12 minutes     Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  I yield myself 4 more minutes     We believe that immigrants  like women and African Americans before them  have rights in this country  and the time is ripe for a new civil rights moment  We believe that a nation of immigrants rejects its history and its heritage when millions of immigrants are confined forever to second class status and that all Americans are debased by such a two tier system  The time has come for comprehensive immigration reform     Our opponents believe that blunt enforcement can solve our current crisis  We believe that the culture and infrastructure of illegality can only be disrupted and our security and prosperity can only be assured through a three pronged approach     First  we favor smarter and tougher enforcement through greater reliance on technology  better screening at our consulates abroad  more international cooperation on migration enforcement  working with Mexico and the other countries in Central Americawhich our opponents never think about or have asked to or have a program to try to doand also tracking terrorist mobility and more efficient screening at U S  work sites     Our national security and our immigration control efforts are both weakened when we fail to distinguish the millions of undocumented immigrants making vital contributions to our economy and the handful of extremists who would enter the United States to do us harm     How can we seriously consider diverting our scarce resources to building a fence along the border  This is a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem  A fencemuro de muerte is the alternative  and we are saying that is the kind of wall we are going to build  with all the technology we have  It is a bankrupt policy     The focus on the border will not prevent undocumented immigration  Almost half of all undocumented immigrants enter through legal channels  and others will always find ways to go over  under  or around the wall  More importantly  a United States Mexico border fence does nothing to help us identify and track terrorists who would almost certainly choose other strategies for entry  including the use of fraudulent or legitimate documents  or entry anywhere along an unguarded northern border or coastline     Second  in an economy which depends on immigrant labor  we favor the creation of legal opportunities so that all American workers have the right to labor with dignity and the protection of our laws  More opportunities must be created for workers and families to obtain green cards through our permanent visa system  And the 400 000 or so undocumented immigrants now joining our workforce each year must be offered access to temporary visas and to a spot in the formal economy when employers cannot find U S  workers to take these jobs     Our temporary worker program differs in fundamental ways from the failed approaches of the past  We include robust wage guarantees to ensure that temporary workers will not depress the wages and working conditions of American workers  which is happening at the present time  and we back up these guarantees with strong complaint procedures and protections for whistleblowers  We believe guest workers must not be tied to a single employer but  rather  must have the right to vote with their feet by changing jobs when employers would exploit them  And we believe workers must have the right to adjust to permanent status if their situation changes and they choose to remain in the United States     Third  immigration reform will be fundamentally incomplete without a plan for bringing the undocumented immigrants already among us out of the shadows and into legal status  Our national security requires the United States to know who resides in our country  Our economic prosperity requires that undocumented immigrants5 percent of all workers in the United Statesjoin the legal economy  Page S2488     The PRESIDING OFFICER  The Senator has used his additional 4 minutes  There is 13 minutes remaining     Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  I see my friend from Illinois here  I am going to take 1 1 2 more minutes  and then I will yield the floor     The PRESIDING OFFICER  Without objection  it is so ordered     Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  countless American families want their undocumented relatives to have the opportunity to become residents  One million immigrants rallied in communities across the country last week  and the crowds included thousands of families waving American flags and celebrating America as their adopted homeland     No one believes in amnesty for these immigrant workers and families  but we do believe in giving them a chance to earnearnlegal status  That is the difference  Amnesty is a pardon  We are not pardoning any undocumented immigrants  What we are basically saying is  Come out of the shadows  pay a fine  pay your taxes  learn English  and after all those who are in line to come to the United States at the present time and have come to the United States  go to the back of the line and work your way to citizenship by playing by the rules  There are 70 000 permanent resident aliens who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  If you dont play by the rules  then you are subject to deportation  That is earning legal status  and that is the process we follow     All undocumented immigrants deserve this chance  but only those who pay the stiff fines  work for 6 years  pay their taxes  learn English and pass a civics test will be permitted to remain in the United States     Today  we embark on a historic debate  We have an opportunity to correct these historic wrongs  I look forward to the coming debate  Together  let us move forward  not backward  on genuine immigration reform     Mr  President  I have been here when Republicans and Democrats have come together to accept the challenge of an issue that is not going away  This issue is not going away  We now have Republicans and Democrats working together  The President has talked about this issue as well  Surely we ought to be challenged to find a way where this Nation can make progress with Republicans and Democrats and hopefully even the administration working together to help do something that is sensible  responsible  workable  humane  and consistent with our national traditions     I yield back whatever time is remaining
