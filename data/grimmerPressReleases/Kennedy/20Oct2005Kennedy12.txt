         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Yesterday  Senate Democrats led by Senators Edward M  Kennedy  Jack Reed  Harry Reid and John Kerry  offered an amendment to the Transportation  Treasury  Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill to provide 3 1 billion dollars in emergency federal assistance to low income and elderly residents  The vote is expected this afternoon     LIHEAP  the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  grants aid to low income families who can t afford the steep cost of energy  The number of households receiving this assistance has increased from 4 million in 2002 to 5 million this year  the highest level in ten years     The Democratic Governor s Association has praised the Reed Collins Amendment to provide energy assistance  In the letter  sent by Chairman Bill Richardson of New Mexico  the Governors state that It is unacceptable to force Americans to choose between basic needs  The Governors urge Senators to support the amendment and to enable America s poorest families to receive needed aid     Providing energy assistance to the poorest citizens of this country during the harsh winter months should be America s top priority  but sadly the Administration continues to focus on misplaced priorities  Senator Kennedy said  In spite of Katrina  the Administration and the House of Representatives continue to close their eyes to the long term needs of the poor    Families throughout the nation are likely to face higher heating bills this winter  On average  households heating primarily with natural gas will pay about  350  48 percent  more this winter for heat  and those relying primarily on oil will pay about  378  32 percent  more  Forecasts of a cold winter and high fuel costs mean that the elderly  the disabled  and many others will be forced to make painful choices between heating their homes and paying for food  health care  and rent    unless we act now    The Bush Administration has closed their eyes to the long term needs of the poor  freezing LIHEAP funds and cutting the Community Services Block Grant  According to ABCD  a community action agency in Massachusetts whose neighborhood network handles the outreach and application process for LIHEAP  the cut in Community Services Block Grant funding through the Continuing Resolution means that access to this critical survival resource will shrink by more than 70   Up to 10 500 householdsout of a current total of 15 000 recipients  may not get their benefits    Rising energy costs are a huge part of the problem  Significant numbers of citizens live with the constant threat of power shut offs  because they can t pay their energy bills  and there s no relief in sight  According to a recent report by the Energy Information Administration  the outlook for the coming winter is bleak  Home heating bills are likely to soar  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have strained already tight oil and natural gas production  According to the American Petroleum Institute  20 percent of the nation s refinery capacity is down or is restarting as a result of damage by both hurricanes     Senator Kennedy Floor remarks in support of the amendment follow  as well as statistics on how LIHEAP assistance affects Massachusetts residents    30    MASSACHUSETTS LIHEAP STATISTICS    In Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves approximately 130 000 householdsbetween 14 000 and 15 000 in Boston       LIHEAP awareness and need is increasing  Agencies in Massachusetts have already received 8 000 of the 12 000 fuel assistance applications they sent outthat s 1 500 more than this time last year     The current average price per gallon of home heating oil is  2 51  This is an increase of 30 percent  69 cents  over the average price per gallon last October   1 82      This winter  800 gallons of heating oilthe typical need for winter heatingwill cost approximately  2000  about  500 more than they would have paid last year      Households in the Northeast heating with propane will pay 20 percent more than last winter     Many families will start the winter already behind in heating bills  As of May  80 percent of ABCD clients  ABCD is a community action agency in Boston  owed the gas company an average of  900  In some cases the heat has been turned off and can t be turned back on until the families pay off their debt     30    Statement by Senator Edward M  Kennedy on the Reed Collins Amendment to Increase Emergency LIHEAP Funding   With temperatures dropping  there are few more important duties than keeping our citizens safe and warm for the winter  Rising fuel prices give added urgency to our efforts to lend a hand to those who can t afford their heating bills     Sadly  the gap between rich and poor has been widening in our society  especially in recent years  The number of persons living in poverty in the nation has risen from 31 million in 2000 to 37 million today  a 19 percent increase during the Bush Administration  13 million children now live in poverty  Wages remain stagnant  while inflation inexorably sinks more and more families below the poverty line  The long term unemployment rate is at historic highs  There is no excuse for America to continue to look the other way  Hurricane Katrina demonstrated the plight minorities for all of us to seefor all the world to see  The silent slavery of poverty is not so silent any more     For those in poverty  the American dream is a nightmare  Families stay awake at night worrying how to make ends meet  Parents wonder how they will feed their children and pay their bills     Rising energy costs are a huge part of the problem  Significant numbers of citizens live with the constant threat of power shut offs  because they can t pay their energy bills  and there s no relief in sight     According to a recent report by the Energy Information Administration  the outlook for the coming winter is bleak  Home heating bills are likely to soar  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have strained already tight oil and natural gas production  According to the American Petroleum Institute  20 percent of the nation s refinery capacity is down or is restarting as a result of damage by both hurricanes     On average  households heating primarily with natural gas will pay  350 more this winter for heatan increase of an incredible 48 percent over last year  Those relying primarily on oil will pay  378 morean increase of 32 percent  These are not just abstract numbers  They represent huge burdens on real people  Just last week  Mayor Menino and I met with low income seniors at the Curtis Hall Community Center in Massachusetts  They are scared that they won t be able to make ends meet this winter  They are worried about how they ll pay their high home heating bills  Predictions of a cold winter and sky high fuel costs mean that the elderly  the disabled  and many others will be forced to make impossible choices between heating their homes and paying for food  or health care  or rent     A federal program is supposed to be available to help the poorest of the poor to avoid these unacceptable tradeoffs  LIHEAP  the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  grants aid to low income families who can t afford the steep cost of energy  The number of households receiving this assistance has increased from 4 million in 2002 to 5 million this year  the highest level in ten years     94 percent of LIHEAP households have at least one family member who is elderly  disabled  a child under the age of 18  or a single parent with a young child  77 percent of LIHEAP recipients report an annual income at or below  20 000 and 61 percent of recipients have annual incomes at or below the poverty line  Shameful  however  LIHEAP is not being given the funds needed to meet today s responsibilities  In fact  the President s budget funds the program at  2 billion which is almost the same today as when the program was created in 1981  the first year of the Administration of President Ronald Reagan  Since then  heating oil prices have gone up 265 percent  Meanwhile  demand for LIHEAP funding has increased  In Massachusetts  it serves 130 000 householdsincluding 15 000 in Boston  8 000 of the 12 000 fuel assistance applications sent out for this winter have already been returned1 500 more than this time last year  With current funding  even those receiving LIHEAP assistance won t receive enough to last the entire winter    In Massachusetts  one 71 year old woman lives alone and keeps her thermostat set at 60 degrees to save money  She hopes the federal government will come through with more LIHEAP money before she runs out of ways to pay her heating bill  She says  I turn down the thermostat as low as I can and sometimes I turn it off and put on extra sweaters  I don t know how much longer I can keep doing this  Many families will struggle just to get their heat turned back on for the winter because they still owe money from last winter s bills     Another example is a single mother who lives with her baby daughter  She s a nurse  but she lost her job in August 2004 and has been relying on temporary jobs since then  Her pay doesn t cover her bills  and her electricity has been cut off  She worries about how she can pay off her bills this winter    It s wrong for us to let people like this suffer  So how does the Republican leadership in Congress respond  By cutting funds for essential low income programs  In spite of Katrina  the Administration and the House of Representatives continue to close their eyes to the long term needs of the poor  Emergency aid was impossible for even the most hard hearted members of Congress to refuse  But as the spotlight fades it s back to poverty as usual  The House sent the Senate a Continuing Resolution which freezes funding for the LIHEAP program  But that funding obviously isn t enough  19 percent of current LIHEAP recipients say they keep their home at a temperature they feel is unsafe or unhealthy  8 percent report that their electricity or gas was shut off in the past year for nonpayment    The Continuing Resolution also cut the Community Services Block Grant by 50 percent  These funds are used by many community action agencies to administer the LIHEAP assistance     According to ABCD  a community action agency in Massachusetts whose neighborhood network handles the outreach and application process for LIHEAP  the cut in funding means that access to this critical survival resource will shrink by more than 70   Up to 10 500 householdsout of a current total of 15 000 recipients  may not get their benefits    Those of us in Congress who care about this issue sent an urgent request to the President to increase the funds  but our request has gone unanswered  We re here today to say that LIHEAP may not be on the Administration s agenda  but it s on our agenda  That s why we re fighting so hard to increase LIHEAP funding  Senator Kerry and I offered an amendment on the DOD Appropriations bill to increase LIHEAP funding by  3 1 billion     Almost every Democratic Senator voted for it  but the Republican Senators overwhelmingly opposed it and it was defeated  We ll continue to raise this issue again and again and again  until our nation s neediest families are fully protected this winter  So I strongly support Senator Reed s and Senator Collins  amendment to this appropriations bill  and I hope the Republican leadership will allow us to have an up or down vote on this amendment at some point during this debate     Congress needs to stand up for the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet  We need to tell low income families across the country that we heard them  we care about them  and we don t intend to leave them shivering in the cold this winter    LIHEAP is indispensable in filling that need  It s wrong for Congress to shortchange LIHEAP and the millions of families who need our help the most  Until every parent has a warm place to come home to every day  and every child has a warm bed to sleep in every night  our job is not done   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
