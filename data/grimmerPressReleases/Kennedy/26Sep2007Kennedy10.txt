         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     A measure of a great society is how it treats its children  The actions of Congress and the President over the coming days will determine whether we meet that test     Today  there are still 9 million children without health insurance  Thats not just wrong  its outrageous  it is immoral     We have a chance  even a duty  this week to make a difference for these children by expanding the Childrens Health Insurance Program     In Saint Lukes Gospel  we are told that Jesus instructed his disciples to let the little children come unto me  and do not hinder them  We urge Congress and the President to support our bipartisan legislation and let little children have health care     That is what these religious leaders and people of faith across America are saying today  They know these children  Theyve ministered to them  Theyve prayed for them  Theyve blessed them      All children deserve a healthy start in life  and all parents deserve the peace of mind that they can take their children to the doctor if theyre sick    When children get the care they need  they do better academically  emotionally  physically and sociallythis is an investment in their futures     Quality heath care for children isnt just a nice idea  Its not something we wish we could do  Its something we have to do and something we can do      The President and Members of Congress have health insurance  Our children receive the best health care in the world  If its good enough for the President and for Senators  surely its good enough for poor children across our land     The children of America need our care  They need our compassion  They need us to not shortchange their dreams but instead to give them the chance in life they deserve      I urge President Bush to drop his veto threat and sign this bipartisan CHIP bill into law           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
