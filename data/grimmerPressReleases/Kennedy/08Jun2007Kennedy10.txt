         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy was joined by Senators Jon Kyl  Dianne Feinstein  Arlen Specter  and Lindsey Graham to discuss the immigration reform bill  Below are Senator Kennedys remarks  As delivered This morning I m reminded of the 1967 Boston Red Sox team  the impossible dream team  that was behind for a good part of the season  but came roaring back and grabbed victory out of the jaws of defeat  And that is what we intend to do with the immigration bill  We are not giving up  We are not giving in  I m encouraged by what the leaders said last evening  that they have every intention of continuing the immigration bill on the front order of business for the agenda of the United States Senate  The American people expect us to legislate  I think all of us here look at the Senate the old fashioned way  and that is that we are here to get something done  to achieve the people s business  And the people s business demand action on immigration  As has been mentioned many times  the borders are broken  the immigration system are broken  People are living in fear and terror  There needs to be enforcement of the law  And there needs to be fairness and a humane policy to treat people  The United States Senate  I believe  is a chemical place  There s a flow to activity here  The tide comes in and goes out  And once in a while  the stars get lined up correctly  and we move ahead  That moment can t be manufactured  And it always takes more time than you think  It isn t an open ended commitment  but it takes a lot of patience to get things done here in the United States Senate  And it s those that are determined and committed that are able to be successful in moving the process and moving it forward  I thought the statements on the floor of the Senate last night were extremely encouraging  in the sense that so many of our colleagues and friends from both sides of the aisle spoke about a future where a successful passage of the legislation was something that s on their agenda and which they would support  And that is what today is really about  our strong commitment to follow the challenge of our leaders in the Republican and Democratic side and to continue our march toward progress in terms of achieving something that is clearly in the national interest    our national security interest    and is true to the great humane sense of decency and fairness that this nation is so proud of      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
