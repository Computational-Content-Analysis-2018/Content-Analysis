         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Thank you for inviting me to the Commission s first public hearing  and I m honored to be here with Senator Sessions  Congressman Wolf and Congressman Scott  It was an honor to work to pass The Prison Rape Elimination Act In that legislation  Congress expressed its unanimous commitment to end the epidemic of rape and sexual abuse in the nation s prisons  We ve all heard the shocking estimate that one in every ten prisoners in the country is raped  We still don t know how many more are victims of sexual abuse and exploitation  Until this law was passed  the federal government had never conducted a reliable study on the issue    even though more than 2 million men and women are now behind bars in the nation and 200 000 more are held in immigration detention centers each year  Every day  countless juvenile and mentally ill offenders are incarcerated in conditions extremely vulnerable to abuse and exploitation Prison rape has devastating physical and psychological effects on its victims  It also has serious consequences for communities  Six hundred thousand inmates are released from prison or detention each year  and these shameful assaults clearly increase the likelihood that they ll commit new crimes after they re released Infection rates for HIV  other sexually transmitted diseases  tuberculosis  and hepatitis are far greater for prisoners than for the population as a whole  Prison rape undermines the public health by contributing to the spread of these diseases  and often becomes a death sentence for its victims because of AIDS The scope of the problem is staggering  I support the Commission s spotlight on it  Sexual violence and exploitation are unacceptable to all  whenever they occur  The Commission has a mandate to demand accountability and give the victims a voice and a new hope I especially commend the courage of the survivors and their families  Their testimony is a compelling basis for the Commission s recommendations Some of the experts who worked with us on the legislation  including Michael Horowitz  Bob Dumond and Lara Stemple  are on the panel  and I commend their leadership The Inspector General of the Department of Justice s recent report made important contributions as well  His conclusion highlights the need for a strong national response and provides important guidance for the future  As just one example  the Commission should hold a hearing on abuse in contract facilities  where prisoners are not protected by this Act  The Commission should also work with the Inspector General and the National Institute of Corrections to establish standards for the investigation and punishment of prison staff involved in such misconduct  The Bureau of Justice Statistics  the National Institute of Justice  and the Bureau of Justice Assistance have all made significant progress to implement the new law  As mandated by the Act  these studies will contain needed new data on the prevalence of sexual assault in federal correctional facilities  A major aspect of our concern is the victimization of juveniles  Those incarcerated with adults are five times more likely to report being victims of sexual assault than youth in juvenile facilities  Yet the so called Gang Bill recently passed by the House will dramatically increase the number of juvenile offenders in adult facilities  In light of the enormous risks that such a change in policy will create  I urge the Commission to hold hearings on juvenile victims and to make specific recommendations on the treatment of juveniles in your report  I understand that there is a practical problem  since many forthcoming studies authorized by the new law  are still in the initial stages and the final data may not be available until next year  The Commission needs additional time to analyze the data before completing the report  and I support an extension  Since your findings and recommendations will be so important  I urge the Commissioners to issue interim reports based on its public hearings Today s hearing is an important precedent  It s disappointing  though  that the Commission s initial progress has faced so many obstacles  As you know our bill requires the Commission to conduct hearings on the economic  physical and social issues relating to prison rape before issuing its final report and recommendations  Without further delay  the Commission needs to announce a public schedule for future hearings across the country At these hearings  I urge the Commission to include a wide range of perspectives  in order to involve more researchers  academic experts  corrections professionals  advocates and  most important  survivors  In doing so  the Commission will raise public awareness about these issues and improve the likelihood of needed changes  It will also enable the Commission to develop a record of best practices for reducing the abuse of prisoners  Thank you for your leadership  and I look forward very much to your report and this unique opportunity for the nation to end this serious abuse   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
