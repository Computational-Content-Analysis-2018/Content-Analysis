         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today following the successful cloture vote  Senators Edward M  Kennedy  Richard Durbin  Tom Harkin  Sherrod Brown joined leaders in the religious community for a press conference on the urgency and moral obligation of paying Americas workers a fair wage  While poverty rates continued to skyrocket  Congress left working class families behind by failing to raise the minimum wage yet continuing to raise their own congressional salaries  The religious leaders from different faiths spoke about the ways in which our stagnant minimum wage has affected their communities  We are a nation of diverse faiths  but one tenet that underlies every religion is that the exploitation of the poor to profit the rich is wrong  Senator Kennedy said  Raising the minimum wage is not just an economic issue  Its a fairness issue  and its a moral issue  Its not just about a paycheck  Its about a just paycheck The Senators were joined by Jim Wallis  President of Sojourners  Dr  Bob Edgar head of the National Council of Churches  Rabbi David Saperstein  Director and Counsel of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism  and Reverend Romal J  Tune  Director of the Clergy Strategic Alliance  Below are Senator Kennedys full remarks  as prepared for delivery    STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDYMINIMUM WAGE EVENT WITH RELIGIOUS LEADERS     as Prepared for Delivery Raising the minimum wage is not just an economic issue  Its a fairness issue  and its a moral issue  Its not just about a paycheck  Its about a just paycheck Whats going on today with low wage workers is plain wrong  They are hard working people trying to raise their families in dignity  But they are being exploited to boost corporate profits  We are a nation of diverse faiths  but one tenet that underlies every religion is that the exploitation of the poor to profit the rich is wrong It is wrong that our productivity and profits soar while hardworking people struggle to put food on the table and heat their homes  It is wrong to give billions upon billions of dollars in tax relief to the wealthy  but turn your backs on the hard working families who live in poverty each day  and the 14 million children who go to bed hungry each night  In my own faith  nothing is more clearly written in the scriptures  I was raised on the words of St  Matthews Gospel  that whatever you have done unto the least of my brethren  you have done unto me  Its time for Congress and the White House to heed those words  Theyve done a lot for the wealthy and powerful  Now its time to do something for the poor and for average citizens  Its time to stop filibustering an increase in the minimum wage Thats why so many religious groups have joined the fight for a higher minimum wage  More than 1 000 religious leaders signed a letter to Congress expressing their support for the Fair Minimum Wage Act  These leaders are morally outraged by the number of people living in poverty in the United States  and believe that now is the time to give hard working low wage workers a raise and take the first step toward a true living wage for America s workers The Republican leadership likes to talk about values  But values arent worth much if we dont act on them  We cant wait a minute longer to do whats right for Americas working families  Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of Gods Children  Now is the time to raise the minimum wage for millions of Americans  Rev  Dr  Martin Luther King once said  Human progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability  it comes through the tireless efforts of  people  willing to be co workers with God  Today  we are joined by four great leaders who have been co workers with God in the fight for fair wages  and I thank them for being here             Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
