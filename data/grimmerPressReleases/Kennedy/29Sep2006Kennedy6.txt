         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   New Report Requested by Senator Kennedy Unveils Repeated Abuses in 9 5  Loans  Second Report Details Mismanagement in Federal Student Aid Office    Washington  D C   Today  the Inspector General of the Department of Education released two reports detailing abuse and mismanagement of in the federal student loan programs   The first report outlines the results of an investigation requested by Senator Edward M  Kennedy related to abuses in the student loan programs by the Nelnet Corporation  The Inspector General found that Nelnet was claiming an indefensible 9 5  subsidy rate on a large volume of loans  in violation of the Higher Education Act and guidance provided by the Department of Education   The IG estimates that Nelnet received  278 million in improper payments through June 2005  and could be paid  882 million in additional overpayments if the billings are not corrected   The second report is an audit of Financial Partners    a division of the Federal Student Aid office at the U S  Department of Education  that is responsible for monitoring the activities of the 3 400 lenders  35 guaranty agencies  72 third party loan servicers  secondary markets  and other entities involved in the Federal Family Education Loan  FFEL  program   The audit finds that Financial Partners had a weak control environment for monitoring and oversight of the FFEL program  failed to report significant instances of non compliance in its reviews of lenders  guarantors  and servicers  and did not have an effective communications process for dealing with problems   Today the Inspector General released not one  but two reports that call the operation of the loan programs into serious question  said Senator Kennedy  The first report  concerning Nelnet  uncovers egregious and repeated abuses in the student loan programs   Nelnet should be required to pay back the ill gotten proceeds from these loans  and that money should be used to benefit students   We should invest scarce education dollars in students instead of bigger profits for banks  At a time when students and families are pinching pennies to afford college  it s deeply troubling that the Department of Education let hundreds of millions of dollars go to waste    The IGs audit of the Federal Student Aid office is just as troubling  he added   The Inspector General essentially found that the division responsible for monitoring the  70 billion FFEL program is severely deficient in core aspects of its work   This report makes the strongest case yet for swift and dramatic reforms to the FFEL program  and a new effort to put the simpler  less expensive Direct Loan Program on a level playing field   With respect to the Nelnet report  last year Senator Kennedy and his colleagues were able to make progress in closing a loophole in the law that allowed many lenders to grow their portfolio of student loans with the outrageous 9 5  subsidy paid by taxpayers   He has introduced legislation with Senator Patty Murray  the Student Loan Abuse Prevention Act  SLAP Act      that would limit taxpayer exposure associated with existing 9 5  loans that otherwise may continue to get this subsidy for the next 15 to 20 years  This bill would give borrowers an incentive to consolidate these loans at a better interest rate for the students  but with a more reasonable government subsidy rate for the lender   Kennedy said  These reports should spur action in Congress to promote broader reforms in the student loan programs   The current system squanders billions of scarce education dollars each year to guarantee that private lenders bear virtually no risk when they make loans  rewards guarantors more for collecting on defaulted loans than keeping borrowers in good standing  and favors the Federal Family Education Loan Program  which subsidizes private lenders  over the governments far less expensive Direct Loan program   No conversation about the future of higher education can move forward effectively without addressing this urgent problem   Senator Kennedy has proposed legislation to provide sorely needed reform to the dysfunctional student loan system and make it work better for students  The Student Aid Reward  STAR  Act would generate  13 billion in new Pell Grants over the next 10 years    at no cost to the taxpayer    by promoting competition between the FFEL program and the less expensive Direct Loan program   Senator Kennedy has also offered a plan to expand the income contingent repayment program for student loans  so no borrowers have to put more than 15 percent of their monthly income toward loan payments and provide loan forgiveness after ten years to those in public service professions such as teaching  public health  and law enforcement           Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
