         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      Washington  DC   Today Senators Kennedy  Reid  Biden  Rockefeller  Levin  and Reed sent a letter to the Director of National Intelligence  John Negroponte  requesting that the intelligence community prepare an updated National Intelligence Estimate  NIE  on Iraq    The last time the NIE was updated was in 2004  yet much has changed in the security  economy and political stability of Iraq  Reports from the Departments of Defense and State and statements from Administration officials on security and stability in Iraq have been troublingly inadequate in assisting Congress with measuring the success of our efforts in Iraq and the safety of our troops  and it is essential to have an objective assessment of data on Iraq from the intelligence community   President Bush  Vice President Cheney  Secretary Rumsfeld  and Secretary Rice deny that Iraq is in a civil war   But the growing sectarian violence  the ruthless death squads  the increasingly powerful role of the privately armed militias  and the Administrations decision to send thousands more U S  troops to Baghdad  tell a very different story  Senator Kennedy said   We cannot ignore this major danger   President Bush needs to weigh these facts more realistically and prepare a strategy to protect our troops who are at risk of getting caught in the middle of a sectarian civil war   Ignoring the wisdom of the intelligence community got us into trouble before in Iraq  and we cannot ignore it again   Clearly  those who forget the mistakes of the past are condemned to repeat them   Virtually every prediction made by Administration officials about Iraq has turned out to be wrong  and it is time to get some straight answers and sound analysis  said Senator Reid  This Administration can start by having intelligence community professionals update the National Intelligence Assessment on Iraq  something that has not been done since 2004   Congress is entitled to this information  and Director Negroponte should do the right thing and see that this NIE is provided in a professional and timely manner   Below is the text of the letter  as well as a list of quotations from the Administration demonstrating their inadequate assessment of the rise in sectarian violence in Iraq   PDF of the letter with signatures available upon request      July 26  2006  Ambassador John D  Negroponte Director of National Intelligence Office of the Director of National Intelligence Washington  DC 20511  Dear Director Negroponte             We are writing to ask that you prepare an updated National Intelligence Estimate  NIE  on Iraq               We understand that the last NIE was prepared in the summer of 2004  two years ago   It is essential that we have an updated assessment from the intelligence community on critical political  economic and security trends   Consistent with the protection of sources and methods  we would request that an unclassified summary of the key judgments be made available to inform the Congressional and public debate  in addition to the usual classified assessment               Reports from the Departments of Defense and State and statements from Administration officials on security and stability in Iraq have been troublingly inadequate in assisting Congress with measuring the success of our efforts in Iraq and the safety of our troops  and it is essential to have an objective assessment of data on Iraq from the intelligence community   Among other key questions  we would appreciate the intelligence community s assessment of the following issues               Sectarianism  Is Iraq in or descending into a civil war   What factors will prevent or reverse deterioration of the sectarian situation               Security  Is Iraq succeeding in standing up effective security forces   What factors will increase the chances of that occurring   To what extent are militias providing security in Iraq   To what extent has the Government of Iraq developed and implemented a credible plan to disarm and demobilize and reintegrate militias into government security forces   To what extent is the Government of Iraq working to obtain a political commitment from political parties to ban militias     Terrorism  What is the threat from violent extremist related terrorism  including Al Qaeda  in and from Iraq   What factors will address the terrorist threat   Political Development  Is Iraq succeeding in creating a stable and effective unity government   What is the likelihood that changes to the constitution will be made to address concerns of the Sunni community   What factors will increase the chances of that occurring   Economic Reconstruction  Is Iraq succeeding in rebuilding its economy and creating economic prosperity for Iraqis   What factors will increase the chances of that occurring               Iraqs Future  According to press accounts  the 2004 NIE contained analysis on three possible scenarios for Iraqs stability through the end of 2005   What are the scenarios through 2007   US Force Posture  In what ways is the large scale presence of multi national forces helping or hindering Iraqis  chances of success               The stakes are enormously high in Iraq  and we appreciate  in advance  the work of the intelligence community on this updated NIE   Sincerely   Senators Kennedy  Reid  Biden  Rockefeller  and Reed      Policymakers on Civil War in Iraq       I know some fear the possibility that Iraq could break apart and fall into a civil war  I don t believe these fears are justified  President Bush  December 12  2005       I don t think there is a brewing civil war in Iraq   Secretary Rice  February 22  2006       I don t buy your premise that there s going to be a civil war  President Bush  February 28  2006        I do not believe they are in a civil war today  Secretary of Donald Rumsfeld  March 7  2006       They know that they lack the military strength to challenge Iraqi and coalition forces directly    so their only hope is to try and provoke a civil war By their response over the past two weeks  Iraqis have shown the world they want a future of freedom and peace    and they will oppose a violent minority that seeks to take that future away from them by tearing their country apart  President Bush  March 13  2006       While civil war is a possibility  we do not believe that it is likely at this point  and we believe that this likelihood has further decreased in the past several weeks  We are cognizant of the risks to Iraqs future in increased sectarian violence  Ambassador James Jeffery  Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State and Coordinator for Iraq  March 13  2006       What we ve seen is a serious effort by them to foment civil war  but I don t think they ve been successful Vice President Cheney  March 19  2006       The terrorists are determined to stoke sectarian tension and are attempting to spark a civil war  But despite the many acts of violence and provocation  the vast majority of Iraqis have shown that they want their country to remain whole and free of ethnic conflict   Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld  March 19  2006       And now the terrorists and former regime elements are doing the same    they re trying to set off a civil war through acts of sectarian violence   President Bush  March 28  2006        I m not going to get into the debate as to semantics as to what is or is not a civil war   People can call whatever they want what s going on there       I don t think a full fledged civil war will take hold of the country myself   Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld  April 13  2006       Response to question on whether civil war will occur and whether the U S has contingences for soldiers if civil war occurs  I don t think the scenario that you have described is going to happen  but life s filled with things you don t think are going to happen  Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld   May 4  2006       There certainly has been an upsurge in sectarian violence  there s no question but that they re trying to incite a civil war   And they have been for a long time  and they have failed so far    the enemy   Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld  July 12  2006         I do not believe that what s happening could be described       as a civil war  But there is significant sectarian violence  there s no question about that   Ambassador Khalilzad  U S  Ambassador to Iraq  July 12  2006        Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
