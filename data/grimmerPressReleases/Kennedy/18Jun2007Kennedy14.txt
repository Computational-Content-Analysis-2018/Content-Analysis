GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS LUNCHEONMONDAY  JUNE 18  2007 As Prepared for Delivery  Its a different world since the last time I addressed you  After so many years in the political wilderness in Washington DC  Democrats have been entrusted by the people to lead Congress again  The message of the election was clear  People want real solutions to the many real challenges we face here at home and abroad  Its an opportunity for us to come together and provide genuine leadership on the issues that matter most to our people  First and foremost  weve got to end this War in Iraq  Its the overarching issue of our time  We have to bring our fighting men and women home with the dignity and honor theyve earned so well  Without question my best vote as a United States Senator was to oppose this tragic war  and its the most pressing concern before Congress today  In the weeks and months ahead  it will be front and center of our national debate  and Ill do all I can to bring it to an end Theres also the great challenge of immigration and what were going to do about the unmanageable situation we find ourselves in today  Its a problem crying out for responsible leadership  not bumper sticker solutions  and Ill speak more about it later  Id like to focus today on another huge challenge  the one brought about by intensifying global competition and the fact that other countries are working hard to replace us as the dominant economic power in the world No nation is guaranteed lasting prosperity in this new century  We have to fight for it  We have to earn it  and the stakes for our country  and for our Commonwealth  are very high In Massachusetts right now  things are looking up  Weve done a lot in recent years to regain our footing as an economic leader among the states and to expand the reach of our economy in the new global marketplace Weve got our fastball back  as it appears the Red Sox do as well  and were not looking back  Without question  the biggest recent accomplishment for the Commonwealth is the enactment of comprehensive health coverage for our people  and I commend the Chamber for your constructive role  You showed the nation that the state that had the vision to write public education into its constitution so many years ago  can still tackle great challenges and is prepared to lead in this new century  To date  the law has helped insure over 135 000 Massachusetts residents who were previously without coverage  and in the years ahead we expect that number to grow considerably Just last month  we hosted the International BIO Conference in Boston  More than 22 000 people from throughout the world came here to see first hand the magnificent talent and energy of our life sciences industry  Theres also the remarkable transformation of our waterfront On Friday  I had the privilege of joining Governor Patrick  Senator Kerry  Massport executives  and Captain Wei Jiafu of COSCO shipping to sign a four year extension of COSCOs contract for direct shipping from China to Boston Twenty years ago  Boston Harbor was dying both commercially and environmentally  Few in those days could have imagined the extent  and the speed  of the rebirth of our waterfront and harbor  The artery has come down  and the city has been rejoined with its waterfront  The Harbor Islands are an extraordinary success  and the Port is thriving once again  Were working with the Army Corps to deepen the shipping channels  after so many years in which there was no need for greater depth  Since COSCO came in 2002  the number of containers coming in and out of our Port has more than doubled  Its been an amazing boost for the 9 000 jobs tied directly to the Port of Boston and the 26 000 jobs across Massachusetts tied directly to international trade Its also a sign of good things to come  At least partly because of the success of our shipping ties  Hainan Airlines  one of Chinas biggest airlines  has selected Boston as its first destination in America  and Boston Beijing Shanghai service will begin next summer  Our high tech economy won a major victory with the decision of the Department of Defense to preserve and expand research jobs at Hanscom  We had a target on our back in the recent BRAC round  But all of us came together in the Massachusetts Defense Technology Initiative with Governor Romney  and devised a  410 million state incentive package to convince the Defense Department were committed to a strong future for Hanscom  the 33 000 jobs it supports in our region  and the  3 billion it generates for our economy each year Were also very impressed with Governor Patricks bold billion dollar life science initiative  In recent years  weve seen a disturbing trend in which young companies  once they mature  leave our state for various reasons  including the high cost of housing and the large investments that states like California and New Jersey have been making in the life sciences We grew complacent and didnt recognize that others were hungry for the incredible assets we relied on  The Governors proposal is proof that were not taking dynamic industries for granted anymore  Were serious about making certain that in this new world of the life sciences  Massachusetts will lead That attitude is already paying dividends  When Organogenesis of Canton  developer of the first bio engineered cell therapy to achieve FDA approval  began planning an expansion  it was heavily courted by other states  But after the Governors announcement  it decided to keep its headquarters right here and double its employee base  creating 300 new professional jobs Another sign that Massachusetts is reemerging from the difficulties of recent years is the 2007 State New Economy Index  It calls us the state most prepared to meet the challenges of the New Economy  where success is based on innovation and information technology  entrepreneurship  and the ability to take advantage of opportunities in global markets Nevertheless  the challenge presented to our economic strength continues to be real  and we cant afford to become complacent  At a Senate hearing earlier this year  Bill Gates testified eloquently about the crossroads we find ourselves at  He said   When I reflect on the state of American competitiveness today  my immediate  feeling is one not only of pride but also of deep anxiety      Too often  we lack the  political will to take the steps necessary to ensure that America remains a  technology and innovation leader       We are content to live off the investments  that previous generations made for us  in education  in health care  in basic  scientific research  but are unwilling to invest equal energy and resources to  ensure that Americas future is as bright and prosperous as its present Thats got to change  and with our new majority in Congress  were doing our best to see that it does  In the Senate  we recently passed the America Competes Act to guarantee increased federal investment in research and development  It doubles funding for scientific research at the Department of Energy  potentially increasing Massachusetts share of those research funds to  200 million a year  The America Competes Act also establishes an advanced research authority at the Department of Energy  modeled after the Pentagons DARPA office  This new office will accelerate innovation  particularly in clean energy technologies to support the kind of work being done by impressive Massachusetts companies such as Ballard Power Systems of Lowell  which is partnering with automobile manufacturers to make the cars of the future emissions free  Lilliputian Systems of Cambridge  which is developing a fuel cell small enough to replace the batteries we rely so heavily on for cell phones and other consumer electronics  and Nuvera of Billerica  which recently won a  4 8 million grant to develop a fuel cell bus and refueling station at Logan Airport  The legislation also doubles the research budget at the National Science Foundation  which currently awards  350 million a year to Massachusetts universities  and has created two nanotechnology research centers in the Commonwealth in the past three years  with  17 million for a UMASS Amherst partnership with TIAX of Cambridge to focus on nano technology manufacturing  and  12 million for the Northeastern UMASS Lowell partnership Jack Wilson  President of UMASS  had it right when he said of the UMASS Amherst announcement  Massachusetts is rapidly becoming the nano capital of the world  We currently rank third among all 50 states in NSF funds  and the increased NSF investment from the America Competes Act will bring significant dividends to our colleges and businesses  Overall  Massachusetts ranks fourth in total federal research funding  behind California  which is six times our size  and Maryland and Virginia  which each have major federal agencies because of their proximity to the nations capital We also do very well in the job creating small business innovative research grants that serve as venture capital for creative small enterprises  Since the grants began 25 years ago  Massachusetts has consistently ranked 2nd  behind only California  and we have by far the highest amount of SBIR investment per capita of any state in the country  Nearly 1 300 small businesses in the Commonwealth have received SBIR funds over the years  totaling more than  2 6 billion in federal investment  Each SBIR dollar produces  7 in economic impact  which means that our success in SBIR grants has generated more than  18 billion for our people  Another of our top priorities in federal research is revitalizing the NIH budget  In the 1990s  Congress recognized the immense potential of NIH research to bring about the cures of tomorrow  and we doubled the NIH budget  In recent years  however  the increases have stopped and there have even been some reductions  which makes no sense Were at the dawn of a new age of medicine that holds great promise for the prevention  treatment  and even cure of major diseases  Yet President Bushs budget for the coming year proposed a cut  a cut    of  1 billion for NIH research  Thats unacceptable  If it ever became law  4 out of 5 new grant proposals would have to be rejected  not for lack of merit  but simply for lack of funds Thats why Im fighting hard to increase the NIH budget and ensure that our countrys position as the leader in biotechnology innovation remains strong  Earlier this year  I was joined by 47 Senators from both parties in calling for significant new investment in NIH  and Im working now with my colleague Tom Harkin of Iowa to produce an NIH budget that meets the needs of the American people  For Massachusetts  the stakes are particularly high  Our research institutions now receive  2 2 billion a year in health research funding from the federal government  and we can do even better in the years ahead With our new majority in Congress  were also reaffirming our commitment to making American education competitive again Were moving forward this year with renewing the No Child Left Behind Act  Well renew its goals of improving public education and ensuring that every child receives a good education and a chance to succeed  Its clear that the nations schools have made important progress in improving student learning and closing achievement gaps since the enactment of this landmark legislation five years ago  But weve also learned a great deal from parents  teachers  students  and local leaders who live with the law on a daily basis  We know improvements and changes are needed to make the reforms in the Act work more effectively  and our priority this year will be to see that those improvements are made  We have much to be proud of in education here in Massachusetts  The nations report card  the National Assessment of Educational Progress  shows that students in our schools rank higher than any other state in reading  and were tied for first in math  Those high ratings are the result of the commitment we made over a decade ago to improve our own public schools  raise standards  expand training for teachers  provide good after school programs  and give extra help to students who need it most  The progress we made became a model for the nation A report released last week shows that our state standards for learning in the classroom are among the highest in the nation  at the head of the pack in fourth grade  and among the top 3 states in eighth grade  Our students arent just doing well on the MCAS  Theyre learning material that will help them succeed later in college  in the workplace  and in life In Boston  the results have been particularly impressive  because of the active role of business and civic leaders  Our city won a Broad Prize for its accomplishments in raising math scores at the fourth  and eighth grade levels faster than any other large American city  Still  theres much more left to be done  Nationally  states vary widely in what they expect of their students and how they measure their progress  In the upcoming legislation  were considering ways to help other states follow Massachusetts lead by setting high standards for students  Its one of many steps we must take to make sure that the nation as a whole lives up to our promise of helping every student do well in school Were also reforming the Food and Drug Administration  Every day  families across our country rely on the FDA  often in ways they may not realize  When they put dinner on the table  they count on FDA to see that it is free of contamination  When they care for a sick child  they trust FDA to make sure the drugs they take are safe and effective  From pacemakers to anti cancer pills to the food we eat  FDA protects the health of hundreds of millions of Americans every day  It oversees products that account for an amazing 25  of the American economy Few other agencies are so critical to the health of our people  and our economy  and we cant afford to let the agency lag behind in meeting its huge responsibility Finally  a few words about immigration  As you know  it has consumed much of the Senate over the past month  The question is whether this Congress can pull together to address one of our greatest domestic challenges  I was disappointed that progress stalled recently  but Im not giving up  because theres too much at stake  I dont agree with much of President Bushs agenda  but he deserves great credit for having the courage to see this issue as one of fundamental justice and to insist on reform The current deeply flawed system is dangerous to our nation and our ideals  Its unacceptable to do nothing while an illegal  underground economy continues to welcome and exploit undocumented workers  It undermines respect for the rule of law  It breeds cynicism and contempt for our institutions of government Legal immigration strengthens and renews our nation  and we will pay dearly if we fail to create a workable system that provides for our security  that treats people fairly  and that enables us to continue to attract the talents and the ideals and the work ethic of ambitious peoples throughout the world  I could go on to discuss a number of additional challenges we face  Needless to say  I have great respect for the Chamber and your central role in keeping our Commonwealth strong  I look forward very much to working with you in the weeks and months ahead  and Im grateful for the opportunity to be here today Thank you so much      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
