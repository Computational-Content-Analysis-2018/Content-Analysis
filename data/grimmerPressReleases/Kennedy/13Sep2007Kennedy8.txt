         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C   This week  U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Dick Durbin  D IL   Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Patty Murray  D WA  introduced The Independent Contractor Proper Classification Act of 2007  This legislation will protect workers and taxpayers against the misclassification of employees  a problem that costs the government billions of dollars and denies thousands of Americans basic employee protections such as workers compensation and overtime pay The Section 530 Safe Harbor in federal tax law is a tax loophole that allows employers to classify a worker as an independent contractor instead of an employee  Employers who use this loophole avoid paying employment taxes and workers compensation for their workers  As a result  misclassified workers must pay higher taxes as though they are self employed  In contrast  employers who follow the rules are forced to pay higher federal and state payroll taxes  putting them at a competitive disadvantage against employers misclassifying their workers  The Independent Contractor Proper Classification Act of 2007 will close the Section 530 loophole  It will allow the government to collect the taxes employers owe and will address the need for more enforcement of federal tax and employment laws to identify those employers in major industries who wrongly classify their workers as independent contactors and require greater cooperation between the IRS and the Department of Labor in enforcing the law Every day  millions of Americans go to work and play by the rules  teaching our children the values of hard work and responsibility  Senator Obama said  And most employers treat their workers fairly  paying them a decent wage and providing the benefits they deserve  But we must fix the system to stop those few employers from breaking the rules and exploiting this tax loophole at the expense of taxpayers and our workers safety and security  I want to thank Senators Durbin  Kennedy  Murray and the labor community and trade associations for their support of this bill When you walk down the streets of Chicago  and in the suburbs and towns throughout Illinois  you can see constructions workers hard at work   building new homes  office buildings  and roads  said Senator Durbin  These workers deserve their fair share from employers who are not trying to cheat the system  This bill will make important changes at the federal level that will complement the actions the State is taking to make sure employers properly classify their workers  I commend Senators Obama  Kennedy and Murray for their work on introducing this important legislation Improperly labeling workers as independent contractors is cheating of the worst kind  Senator Kennedy said  Companies resorting to this dishonest practice avoid paying the taxes they owe and deny their employees their legal rights  including the right to a safe workplace  the right to the minimum wage  and the right to overtime pay  Im proud to be a sponsor of this legislation to crack down on these unscrupulous employers Good faith employers and hard working Americans should be served by the law  not harmed by it  said Senator Murray  Im pleased that this bill will level the playing field for employers and give working families access to the benefits and protections they deserve The legislation is supported by the AFL CIO  Change to Win  the International Brotherhood of Teamsters  business associations representing the interests of more than 200 000 construction employers  and the National Employment Law Project      Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
