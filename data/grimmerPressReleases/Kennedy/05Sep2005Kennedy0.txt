         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      I will vote against the confirmation of Justice Priscilla Owen to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  While Justice Owen is an intelligent jurist  her record gives me no confidence that she will set aside her personal beliefs and be fair in her approach to a range of issues of concern to all Americans  I am particularly concerned about what seems to be Justice Owen s consistent bias against workers and consumers and in favor of businesses and corporations  Justice Owen s record also casts serious doubt on her willingness to safeguard the constitutional right to privacy and reproductive freedom  Justice Owen s dissents in a series of cases regarding the rights of young women to obtain an abortion reveal a disturbing willingness to misread or distort the law to support her view      Justice Owen s consistent record of rulings against consumers  workers  and injured plaintiffs  stands out even among the conservative Texas Supreme Court  Certainly  the Justices on the Texas Court are frequently in agreement in ruling against plaintiffs  and  as Justice Owen stated at her hearing  she is not always in dissent from the Court s rulings  What remains striking  however  is the frequency with which Justice Owen is in dissent in cases concerning the rights of workers  plaintiffs and consumersin several instances standing as the lone dissenter  Moreover  I could find no case in which Justice Owen dissented to stand up for an injured plaintiff  worker  or consumer      In several of her dissents  Justice Owen appears to substitute her views for the plain meaning of statutory language  or ignores evidence that fails to support her position  prompting criticism from her colleagues for doing so  For instance  in FM Properties Operating Co  v  City of Austin  Justice Owen dissented from the majority s ruling that a state law that had been designed to allow a developer to bypass the City of Austin s municipal water quality laws was unconstitutional  Justice Owen s dissent  in which she faulted the majority for restricting property rights  was so harsh that it was criticized by the majority as nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric  which  merits no response      In Quantum Chemical Corporation v  Toennies  Justice Owen joined a dissent that would have greatly increased an employee s burden in discrimination cases  Justice Owen appeared to ignore the plain meaning of a Texas Human Rights Statute  which allowed a plaintiff to prevail upon showing that discrimination was a motivating factor in the employment practice  requiring instead that a plaintiff show that discrimination was the sole motivating factor     Even where Justice Owen has joined the majority in favor of a plaintiff  she has distinguished herself by announcing views hostile to plaintiffs  For instance  in GTE Southwest v  Bruce  Justice Owen  concurring from an otherwise unanimous Court decision in favor of three women employees  went out of her way to make clear her view that a supervisor s behavior did not amount to intentional infliction of emotional distress  This supervisor s behavior  included yelling and cursing frequently at employees  repeatedly verbally threatening employees  assaulting employees by physically charging and lunging towards them  and ordering a female employee to scrub a carpet with her hands and knees  Yet  disturbingly  to Justice Owen  this conduct standing alone would not constitute outrageous behavior as a matter of law     I also remain troubled by Justice Owen s answers to concerns raised about her handling of the Ford v  Miles case  This was the case involving an African American teenager  Willie Searce  who won damages from Ford Motor Company for injuries he suffered from a car crash that left him a quadriplegic  breathing only through the assistance of a respirator  The jury found that the seatbelt Searce was wearing was defective  because it created slack in the shoulder harness which then caused the seatbelt to catch his head and neck  severing his head from his spinal cord  The jury awarded Searce  30 million for his lifetime medical care and  10 million in punitive damages  On appeal  the appellate court substantially affirmed the trial court  remanding only the punitive damages award     When the case reached the Texas Supreme Court  Searce filed a motion to expedite the case  attaching the affidavit of a doctor stating that without the funds to pay for a back up respirator  a generator  and other critical medical and support services  Searce s condition would worsen  and that he could die  After oral argument  Justice Owen was assigned the task of writing the decision  but it took about a year and a half after oral arguments for a decision to be issued in the case  In the end  a majority of the Texas Supreme Court voted to reverse the case on grounds that it was brought in the wrong venue  While the case was awaiting trial on remand  Willie Searce died      At the hearing  Justice Owen was asked about why she took so long to issue the opinion  and specifically why the Court failed to grant the Plaintiff s motion to expedite  Justice Owen suggested that the Plaintiffs had forum shopped by bringing the case in the wrong venue  stated that delay was caused by other courts  but never answered why  given the probable consequences to the life of this child  it took so long for the Court to issue the opinion  I asked again in writing  after the hearing  for a specific answer on the cause for the delay and the failure to grant the motion to expedite  Again here  while Justice Owen provides a substantial amount of information she fails to answer the central question of why the Court failed to expedite the case  In the context of Justice Owen s near unwavering support for the positions of business and corporations over that of injured individuals  and her consistent pattern of opinions that eviscerate protections for workers  consumers and individuals injured by unsafe products  the delay in the case and the eventual opinion reversing the case on venue grounds are troubling     I am equally troubled by Justice Owen s opinions on the important question of a woman s right to choose  Justice Owen is not only frequently in dissent from rulings of the Texas Court majority sustaining a young woman s right to have an abortion  but she has grafted barriers to reproductive choice that are irreconcilable with the plain language of Texas law      The Texas judicial bypass statute provides that if a minor woman can prove that  a  she is mature and sufficiently well informed to make her own decision  or  b  that parental notification would not be in her best interest  or  c  notification may lead to physical  sexual  or emotional abuse  the court must allow her to have an abortion without notifying her parents  Despite the language of the statute and the views of the majority of the Court  Justice Owen s record indicates that she would require a minor to consider religious issues  that she would create a high standard for a showing of abuse  that she would create a new requirement that the minor show that the abortion is in her best interest  and that she would require a consideration of the fetus  interests      In her opinions  and again at the hearing  Justice Owen defends these additional requirements  by stating that she was merely following the Supreme Court s decisions in Casey and H L  v  Matheson  But nothing in the Supreme Court s decisions in these cases requires that minors must obtain this information or follow these requirements before being allowed an abortion  At most  those cases define what state statutes may impose  that is  they establish a ceiling  These cases  thus  provide no support for importing additional requirements into a statute  such as Texas   that is otherwise silent      Given these concerns  I cannot support Justice Owen s nomination  I do not vote against Justice Owen s nomination lightly  I have voted against only a handful of lower court nominees in my forty years on the Senate  However  the President has sent over a nominee whose record shows hostility to core protections for workers  consumers  women  and to the right to privacy and reproductive freedom  The Constitution requires the Senate s advice and consent on judicial nominations  and both our constitution and historical practice make clear that our duty is more than to rubber stamp  I therefore oppose Justice Owen s nomination   Stephanie Cutter  202  224 2633
