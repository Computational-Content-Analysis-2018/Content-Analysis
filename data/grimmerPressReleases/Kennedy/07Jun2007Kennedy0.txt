         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  At the heart of the issue of immigration is work and hope  People risk their lives to come to this country to work hard  They come to this country to make a better life for themselves and their families  And they come to our county with their hearts filled with hope  Even though we didnt cross this important hurdle today  hope is a powerful thing and it will not be deterred  The issue will not go away and we will not give up the fight  Immigration is about the future of America  The vote was obviously a big disappointment  but it makes no sense to fold our tent  and I certainly dont intend to  Doing nothing is totally unacceptable  I believe were well within reach of a realistic solution  and I believe we have the will to find it  We cant afford not to No one can realistically pretend that no bill is better than this bill  But that is exactly what our colleagues who voted no are saying Our immigration system is badly broken  and its creating an immense problem for our country  We cant continue to look the other way  while our country continues to be a magnet for tens of thousands of people in other lands  They come to communities across America  because they know they can find jobs here  even if they have to live in the shadows without the fundamental rights that all Americans have We cant continue to look the other way  when countless American businesses are willing to ignore the law and hire these workers  because those firms have no other way to obtain the workers they need to enable their firms to stay in business We cant continue to look the other way and pretend to respect the rule of law  when every day we fail to act is another day in which the rule of law in America is massively subverted by out shameful and dysfunctional immigration system Above all  we cant continue to look the other way when our own national security is increasingly at risk because we cant control our borders Weve made a great deal of progress toward a realistic solution that will restore the rule of law and is fair for business  fair for labor and fair for the millions of undocumented immigrants living here in desperate conditions today  working hard among us and contributing positively to our economy  our communities and our country Failure is not an option  Lets keep working together and get this job done right  We know we can do it      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
