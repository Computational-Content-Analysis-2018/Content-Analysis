         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Massachusetts continues to lead on marriage equality for our citizens  and I look forward to a day when every state accepts that basic principle of fairness  It s long past time for all states to end the existing bigotry and abolish discriminatory laws that deny same sex couples the benefits and protections available to married couples  In the Commonwealth  we have properly recognized that being part of a family is a basic right  It means having loved ones to build a future with  to share life s joys and ease its tears  Nearly 7 000 same sex couples have married in Massachusetts in the past two years and  as the struggle for equality goes on  I m proud of the example our Commonwealth is setting  I m optimistic that the full civil rights of all couples and their families will soon be recognized   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
