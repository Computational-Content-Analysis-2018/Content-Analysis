         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            Washington  D C     Todays report by the Government Accountability Office highlights the flawed implementation of the provisions in the No Child Left Behind Act to assist students with limited proficiency in English   Over half of the states studied were unable to make reliable assessments of such students   Many states have not yet taken the steps needed to produce dependable test results for their students  despite the laws requirement that their educational progress be measured in a reliable manner   The report also found serious challenges in closing the achievement gap for these students in at least two thirds of the states surveyed         The No Child Left Behind Act  enacted in 2002  guarantees these students a fair and equal opportunity to learn  said Senator Edward M  Kennedy   The GAO report proves that even after more than four years  the promise of the Act is still being denied for too many students  especially those taking tests that they cannot read or understand  or that fail to reflect what they truly know and can do in the classroom      According to GAO  a third of the states were uncertain of the laws testing requirements for these students  and little written guidance has been provided by the Department of Education to clarify the requirements and expedite the development of proper assessments   States also expressed difficulty in aligning their English language tests with the other standards and assessments required by the Act     The No Child Left Behind Act also requires language support programs for students in every state with limited proficiency in English   Yet the Department of Education has conducted visits in only 15 states to monitor such programs and ensure their enforcement     In 2004  the Department announced new flexibility for states in meeting the laws requirements  including an option to waive reading tests for such students during their first year in school  and changes in the classification of these students for school accountability under the Act for up to two years   Neither of the Departments policies addressed the need for reliable assessments of these students        Flexibility is no substitute for meaningful reform  and flexibility alone wont improve outcomes for children  Senator Kennedy said   Instead of focusing on whether to include these students in accountability decisions  the Department should have been developing a plan to improve instruction and assessment for English language learners   Its time for the Administration to send a clearer message to states about whats expected of their testing programs and polices for these students   Senator Kennedy has introduced legislation to encourage better implementation of the Acts current testing requirements   He proposes  50 million in state grants to assist in the development and improvement of alternate or native language tests for such students  in order to measure their progress in reading and math   The bill also provides for improvement in state testing polices  so that assessments will be adequate for these students        Its clear from todays report that the states need and deserve additional resources to enable these students to obtain the educational benefits of major school reforms  said Senator Kennedy   Im committed to addressing these issues in the coming reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act   The Act is scheduled for reauthorization in 2007        Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
