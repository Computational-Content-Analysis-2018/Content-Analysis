         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      As Prepared for Delivery   I call to order our hearing on the reauthorization of the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief  or PEPFAR  I thank our witnesses and colleagues on the committee for joining us in this busy time      There are many issues before us that have wide ranging effects on vast numbers of people  But few are as consequential as our response to the global HIV AIDS epidemic where entire societies are at risk     Sometimes history is changed by great leaders  by wars  or by scientific breakthroughs      And sometimes history is transformed by something as tiny as a virus      We have seen the devastating effects of HIV AIDS on our own shores with our own citizens  The fight against HIV AIDS here at home continues as we are reminded that our responsibilities here at home are far from over      But we also know that in recent years the HIV virus has affected the lives of millions of people across the globe  It has destroyed families  even whole villages  and threatens the well being of entire nations      At times  this disease has brought out the worst in mankind  Children orphaned by AIDS have been deprived of their rights  Women and girls have been shamefully exploited  And millions of people living with HIV AIDS have faced stigma  fear  and discrimination      But weve also seen the best in mankind      Nation after nation has pledged to help  Scientists have devoted their lives to finding better ways to prevent and treat AIDS  Doctors  nurses  and other health professionals have worked tirelessly in cities and towns and villages across the world to give hope and help to persons living with AIDS     But the true heroes of this global challenge are those who struggle with the epidemic every day  The parents who fight to provide a better life for their children  The grandparents who take on the unexpected responsibility of caring for children whose parents have been lost  The millions of people who face their extraordinary challenges with quiet dignity and unshakeable determination     We are here to help these heroes win their battle for a better  healthier life for themselves and for their children       We must set ourselves the goal that within our lifetimes  we will be able to say  No child was left an orphan by AIDS today  No life was cut short by this dread disease      Our nation has stepped forward and applied our resources and expertise not only to combat HIV in our country  but for people around the world  I commend President Bush for launching the PEPFAR global AIDS initiative to help meet this challenge  and for joining Democrats and Republicans in calling for its renewal      PEPFAR and our contributions to the Global Fund have made a real difference in the lives of millions of people      PEPFAR currently supports treatment with lifesaving anti retroviral drugs for nearly one and a half million people  The program has supported services to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV for over 10 million pregnancies  And it has provided help for 2 7 million orphans and vulnerable children     We must build on these successes  and examine where the program needs improvement     With our colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee  we have a special responsibility in this task  since so many of the key elements of PEPFAR are within our scope      We are honored that Dr  Julie Gerberding  the leader of the CDC  is here with us today to provide her insight and recommendations      We are also honored to be joined by the US Global AIDS Coordinator  Dr  Mark Dybul      We are joined too by an extraordinary panel of witnesses who bring important perspectives to inform our discussions      Our work in evaluating this program has been assisted by the thoughtful analysis of expert bodies  such as the Institute of Medicine  that have examined the PEPFAR program and made recommendations for improvement      One major conclusion from all these reviews is that the rigid funding allocations included in the original legislation hamper the flexibility that is essential in a program that spans the globe     We must also examine how generic medicines become eligible for funding under PEPFAR  At the time of the original legislation  Senator McCain and I offered an amendment to require PEPFAR to adopt the same standards that other major donors use  Our amendment was rejected  but the PEPFAR program has since acted to improve the use of generic drugs  and our committee must determine whether this process is working effectively to bring safe and low cost medicines to the people who need them      Finally  the challenge in renewing PEPFAR is to make the transition from a short term emergency response to a long term sustainable initiative  This means many things  including investing in effective prevention efforts and finding ways to assist other nations in strengthening their health systems  The President has called for  30 billion for PEPFAR in the years to come  but many experts believe that this is insufficient to meet the need      Nations around the world are calling on us to act  and act quickly    to renew the promise of PEPFAR  We are answering that call  Our hearing is part of an extensive process of consultation that our committee has undertaken to prepare for the reauthorization  Our colleagues on the Foreign Relations committee have been just as diligent  It is our intention to take action on this important responsibility as soon as possible in the new year      Reauthorization will be a bipartisan and inclusive process  Senator Enzi has a strong commitment to renewing and improving PEPFAR  and the same commitment is shared by members of the committee on both sides of the aisle  We also look forward to working with Senator Biden  Senator Lugar  and all our colleagues on the Foreign Relations committee      Most of all  we look forward to learning from the real experts    those who work every day to improve the lives of persons with HIV AIDS      To facilitate our discussion  we are convening in a roundtable format  After Senator Enzi makes his comments  we will hear the testimony of our two Administration witnesses  Dr  Julie Gerberding and Dr  Mark Dybul  We will then have a period of questions for these witnesses  On conclusion of that question period  I would like to invite our extraordinary panel of outside witnesses to join our roundtable  and make brief comments to introduce themselves to the committee  I hope that our Administration witnesses will not stand on ceremony  but will join us for this discussion  which would be more informative with their comments     I will close with my thanks to all our witnesses    many of whom have changed plans or traveled great distances to be with us today  Their commitment is the most eloquent testimony to the importance of the task before us  Thank you all for joining us today  and I look forward to your recommendations      I now turn to Senator Enzi for his comments           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
