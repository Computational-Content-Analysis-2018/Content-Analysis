         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to the decision made by the Supreme Court on crack cocaine sentencing      Its obvious from todays Supreme Court decision in the Kimbrough case that Federal Courts at every level face an impossible challenge in attempting to deal with the unfair and unwarranted disparity in the current sentencing guidelines  under which trafficking in crack cocaine is 100 times harsher than trafficking in the same amount of powder cocaine  The crack powder disparity has a disproportionate impact on African American defendants  their families and communities  This gross disparity undermines public confidence in the criminal justice system and is completely contrary to the Sentencing Reform Acts goal of fairness in sentencing      Ive joined with Senator Hatch on legislation  S  1685  that takes two important steps to reducing this disparity  It reduces the disparity by 80 percent  and it eliminates the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years for first time possession of crack cocaine      Our harshest punishments for drug traffickers should go to the high level traffickers who truly deserve them          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
