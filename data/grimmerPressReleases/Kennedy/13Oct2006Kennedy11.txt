         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Senator Edward Kennedy and Representative Henry Waxman have requested that the Government Accountability Office investigate the Administration s trade negotiations and their negative effects on developing countries  access to medicines  According to the Trade Act of 2002  the Administration is obligated to promote access to healthcare for all countries in their trade practices  and Sen  Kennedy and Rep  Waxman want to ensure those obligations are fulfilled   Senator Kennedy said  We ve requested this investigation to help understand how the Administration has balanced commercial drug interests with the health needs of poor people living in developing countries  In this era of HIV epidemics  avian flu outbreaks  and other public health threats  it is essential that we promote good health and access to medicines in every nation   Rep  Waxman said Administration trade agreements have numerous provisions that threaten access to affordable medicine  We have to recognize that the Bush Administration s single minded pursuit of intellectual property protections for drug companies can have potentially devastating consequences for the public health in developing countries   Senator Kennedy and Representative Waxman have also requested the Administration retract its demand that the World Health Organization withdraw a report on trade and health  The report criticizes the trade practices of some developed countries   including the U S    as interfering with developing countries  rights to promote public health   In response to the Administration s letter  Kennedy said  The World Health Organization s study  and others like it  suggests that our trade policies have hampered access to life saving medicines  such as HIV therapies and treatments for avian flu  If this is the case  we need to know   and we need to change our policies   Rep  Waxman said  Most of our trade policy takes shape far from the public spotlight  We need more analysis of the implications of our policies   not less  The Bush Administration should assess its own obligations to public health rather than seeking to quash any criticism   The letters sent from Senator Kennedy and Representative Waxman to Comptroller General Walker on September 27  2006  and to Sec  Leavitt on October 13  2006  are below   PDF available upon request    October 13  2006  The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt Secretary of Health and Human Services U S  Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Avenue  SW Washington  D C  20201  Dear Secretary Leavitt    We are writing with regard to an August 18  2006  letter from William R  Steiger  HHS Special Assistant for International Affairs  to the Acting Director General of the World Health Organization  In this letter  Mr  Steiger insisted that the World Health Organization withdraw a study critical of the impact of U S  trade policy on international health     The report Mr  Steiger found objectionable is titled The Use of Flexibilities in TRIPS by Developing Countries  Can They Promote Access to Medicines  Commissioned by WHO  it identified barriers to public health resulting from the trade policies and free trade negotiations of several developed nations  including the United States     In his letter  Mr  Steiger demanded that WHO withdraw the report and remove its emblem from the publication  Mr  Steiger stated that he has raised similar concerns with the WHO Secretariat in the past about trade agreements  and he requested that  the Executive Board of the WHO conduct a full review of WHOs publication policy    As a signatory to the Doha Declaration  a trade agreement recognizing the right of member countries to protect public health  the United States is obligated to respect the public health initiatives of other countries  Yet in the past  we have expressed concerns  that the Administration has sought intellectual property provisions in bilateral trade agreements that contradict our obligations under the Doha Declaration  These concerns have never received a satisfactory response from the Administration  and it seems  that the problems raised by the WHO report are being similarly dismissed rather than addressed     In this era of AIDS epidemics  pandemic flu threats  and drug resistant tuberculosis outbreaks  we need morenot lessanalysis of the factors affecting global public health  Attempting to suppress a report because it is critical of U S  trade policy is  unacceptable  Instead  the United States should seriously assess the impact of our trade policies on access to medicines and public health    We request that you forward to our offices any additional letters or communications sent by Mr  Steiger or other members of the Administration requesting that a World Health Organization publication  official  or representative be recalled for criticizing U S  policies  Specifically  we request that these include copies of the past correspondence described by Mr  Steiger and the further correspondence mentioned by Mr  Steiger when he wrote  I intend to address these specific issues in a subsequent letter to you     We also ask that you cooperate fully with the Government Accountability Office as it responds to our request last week for an investigation into the effect of the U S  Trade Representatives activities on public health  Specifically  we have asked GAO to  assess whether the formal and informal mechanisms of U S  trade policy conform to the Congressional directive to respect the Doha commitment to public health     We would appreciate receiving these documents by October 28  2006  If you have any questions  please let us know  or contact David Bowen at  202  224 7675     With respect and appreciation    Sincerely     _______________________________  ______________________________ Senator Edward M  Kennedy    Representative Henry A  Waxman Ranking Member     Ranking Member Committee on Health  Education    Committee on Government Reform  Labor and Pensions U S  Senate      U S  House of Representatives     September 27  2006    The Honorable David M  Walker Comptroller General United States Government Accountability Office 441 G Street  NW Washington  DC 20548   Dear Mr  Walker   We are writing to request a study of the U S  Trade Representatives interpretation and implementation of the principle trade objectives relating to intellectual property  as established by Congress in the Trade Act of 2002    The Act elaborated three objectives relating to intellectual property  to further promote adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights  to secure fair  equitable  and nondiscriminatory market access opportunities for United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection  and to respect the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health  adopted by the World Trade Organization at the Fourth Ministerial Conference at Doha  Qatar on November 14  2001    Taken together  these three objectives identify priorities and articulate a clear vision for trade negotiations related to intellectual property  By Congressional mandate  the Administration has an obligation to advance this vision through its formal and informal trade promotion activities  We are interested in how these objectives have been interpreted  pursued  and implemented by the Administration since Trade Promotion Authority was granted by Congress in 2002    In particular  we would like to learn to what extent the third objective  to respect the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health  has been pursued  In relevant part  the Doha Declaration states that no country should be prevented from exercising its rights to protect public health and promote access to medicines for all  Subsequent elaborations  in 2003 and 2006  have specified mechanisms intended to facilitate such access to medicines  We are interested in understanding how the rights and priorities identified by the Doha objective have been incorporated into trade related policies  agreements  and practices of the Administration  In your study  please consider the following questions    Has the U S T R   through trade agreement provisions  negotiations  preference programs  trade capacity building  and other efforts  pursued objectives and principles established under the Doha Declaration and TRIPS Agreement  Have these efforts been successful    How has the U S T R  balanced efforts to pursue the Doha objective with the two other intellectual property negotiating objectives outlined by Congress in 2002  How many  if any  provisions negotiated since 2002 expand the Doha protections for access to medicines  How many  if any  provisions of such agreements narrow these protections  What has been the relative impact of each set of provisions    If any instruction included in the Trade Act of 2002 has been found to be in conflict with the Doha objective in practice  how has the Administration acted    How has the U S T R  promoted the obligations of developed countries as articulated in the Doha Declaration  For example  the Doha Declaration reaffirms the commitment of developed country members to provide incentives to their enterprises and institutions to promote and encourage technology transfer to least developed country members  Has the U S T R  facilitated such transfer through or in connection with bilateral trade agreements or other mechanisms    Have demands of the U S T R   through bilateral trade agreements and other mechanisms  expanded or limited the rights of developing countries as articulated in the Doha Declaration  For example   o Has the U S T R  expanded or constrained developing countries freedom to independently interpret the TRIPS Agreement according to the Agreements objectives and principles under Articles 7 and 8   o Have the U S T R s activities affected developing nations use of compulsory licensing  Bolar provisions  and other provisions endorsed by the World Trade Organization for the protection of public health and the promotion of access to life saving medicines     Which government agencies and private sector groups provide input into and exert influence over the U S T R s policies and activities related to intellectual property rights  How does the U S T R  balance and incorporate the concerns of these agencies and private sector groups in its policies and activities  and how have such concerns  once incorporated  affected pursuit of the Doha objective     As GAO found in 2002  the U S T R s Industry Trade Advisory Committee system has consistently failed to incorporate adequate input from global public health interests  To what extent has this failure been addressed  and has the failure affected implementation of the Doha objective  Does the U S T R  use other mechanisms to assure that input is incorporated from groups advocating the rights and obligations established under the Doha Declaration     Has the U S T R  used mechanisms outside formal trade agreements to pursue  implement  and monitor the negotiating objectives related to intellectual property rights  and the Doha objective in particular  Please consider the General System of Preferences  the Special 301 process  trade capacity building activities  the Industry Trade Advisory Committee system  side letters  accessions  and diplomacy  For example   o Have provisions in public health side letters achieved or failed to achieve the Doha policy goal of facilitating access to affordable medicines  including the Doha right to implement compulsory licensing  In practice  have the authorities articulated in these side letters been invoked  If so  to what effect  o How has advice offered through trade capacity building balanced protection of intellectual property rights with preservation of developing countries rights under the Doha Declaration    We look forward to your response to this request  If you have any questions  please contact David Bowen of Senator Kennedys staff at  202  224 7675 or Naomi Seiler of Representative Waxmans staff at  202  225 5420   With great respect and appreciation  and we look forward to the study    Sincerely       Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Representative Henry A  Waxman Ranking Member Ranking Member
