         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  It s regrettable that the Administration has resubmitted these highly controversial nominees instead of choosing persons more likely to gain a consensus  The President knows how to get judges confirmed   the Senate approved over 200 of them in his first term  But re nominating activist extremists that the Senate has already refused to confirm is not the way  The President looks like he is still more interested in picking fights than picking judges  The last thing the federal courts need is reactionary judges bent on rolling back basic constitutional rights   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
