         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      REMARKS AND BILL SUMMARY BELOW  BOSTON  MA  Senator Edward M  Kennedy today addressed the 2007 BIO International Conference held at the South Boston Convention and Exhibition Center  Due to scheduled votes on his FDA revitalization bill  Kennedy delivered his remarks from Washington  Senator Kennedy discussed the critical importance of investment in life science research  including life saving stem cell research to unlock the doors of discovery to Parkinsons  Alzheimers  heart disease and cancer  Kennedy also discussed his efforts in Congress to revitalize the FDA and to increase consumer and patient safety  The challenge of this new century must be to see that the benefits of the biotechnology revolution are shared by all citizens of the world  not just those fortunate enough to live in America and other developed nations  said Senator Kennedy  The legislation I am fighting for today will improve patient access to new therapies  Some have argued that any increase in safety will inevitably decrease access  but thats a false comparison  At the heart of our proposal is a modern system for improving patient safety  not through additional layers of bureaucracy  but through a flexible structure that emphasizes post market surveillance  Senator Kennedys legislation  the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act faces a final vote in the United States Senate this week  Kennedys legislation would improve surveillance to catch problems in drug safety early  implement safety management strategies and increase patient access to new and innovative therapies  Biotechnology industry leaders from around the world gathered in Boston from May 6 9 for their annual conference  The Biotechnology Industry Organization  BIO  represents more than 1 100 biotech companies and research institutes from the United States and 31 other countries  Along with Senator Kennedy  the keynote speakers who addressed the convention were Her Majesty Queen Noor of Jordan and actor Michael J  Fox  REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDYBIO CONFERENCEMAY 7  2007 As Prepared for Delivery   Its a deep honor to be invited to be with all of you today  but I hope that you will grant me an excused absence  The fate of our FDA legislation rests with the Senates actions today  so I hope you will join me in urging the Senate to move forward on this vital legislation   Im a strong believer that innovation is the spark of human progress  Ive appreciated the chance to work closely with my friends in the biotechnology sector in Massachusetts because you are at the forefront of that innovation  Im reminded of the inspiring words of the poet Robert Browning that our reach should exceed our grasp  And that should be our calling today  We must overcome the limits to our vision and work each day to make progress a reality in the lives of our citizens  Innovation is essential to our economic progress  improving our environment  the ability to care for our families  and even our national security   During a recent visit to NIH  I heard where the life sciences can take us  Scientists have unlocked the secrets of the genetic code and can use the techniques of recombinant DNA technology in ways that were unimaginable in years past  Science is doing the same in agriculture as we use recombinant DNA to help derive bio fuels from corn and other crops  so that we can one day be free of the need for foreign oil  Science is bringing that same progress to energy as researchers are trying to find ways to make engines work as efficiently as enzymes  Science is transforming environmental protection as we investigate whether DNA techniques can make trees grow more quickly and with more leaves to alleviate global warming by capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere more efficiently   The technologies of the last century  steel  oil  and chemicals  improved standards of living  but too often left environmental devastation in their wake  The technology of this new century can help repair the damage  Recombinant DNA technology can improve the ability of plants to absorb harmful greenhouse gasses and to let bacteria disable environmental toxins  to help clean lakes and oceans of dangerous pollutants  In health care  the prospects for advances are limitless  We are witnessing the dawn of personalized medicine  where treatments can be tailored to an individual patient s genetic code  The complement to these breakthroughs in DNA research is the extraordinary new field of stem cell science  Together  these two branches of discovery offer new hope for spinal injury  Parkinson s Disease  diabetes  and many other illnesses   But this bright future is in jeopardy if our laws fail to keep pace with our technology  All the benefits of genetic medicine depend on one step  the willingness of patients to undergo genetic tests that can improve their health  That willingness should be straightforward  but too often  patients fear that their genetic information may be misused to deny them health insurance or a job   If Congress enacts clear protections against genetic discrimination  all Americans will be able to enjoy the benefits of genetic research  The House of Representatives has acted and we have passed the bill out of the health committee that I chair  We now must get it to the finish line   We all had to fight hard to create the extraordinary medical innovations we enjoy today  and we have to fight just as hard now to maintain that progress  A culture of innovation and discovery does not just happen  It must be nurtured or it will wither  The United States has a long tradition of being a global innovative leader  but we cant take our leadership for granted  Today  its at risk  Thirty years ago  U S  researchers published 90 percent of all scientific literature on information technology  Today  its less than half  Unless we invest in the life sciences  the story will soon be the same for biotechnology  While Asian countries continue to increase investment in basic science  our percentage of the GDP spent on basic research continues to fall  Today  only 52 percent of all U S  industrial patents are requested by Americans   We must take action to respond to the challenge of globalization  The wrong way is through a race to the bottom where nations compete to see who can provide the lowest protections for workers and the cheapest wages  The right way is to invest in the education and training needed to help American workers compete   Weve seen the benefits of wise government investments in innovation  In the 1990 s  Congress doubled the budget of the NIH  And we reaped the results of that investment with new breakthroughs  The benefits of this funding were not confined to labs at hospitals and universities  but were multiplied by private investment in the dynamic biotechnology firms that help bring the breakthroughs in the laboratory to the bedsides of the patients  Unfortunately  instead of building on this progress  the current Administration is undermining it  Under the Presidents budget proposal  NIH will receive a billion dollars less next year than is needed to keep up with inflation  If these budget recommendations are enacted  more than 4 out of 5 new grant proposals will have to be rejectednot for lack of merit  but for lack of funds  We erode our culture of innovation by failing to invest in the discoveries of tomorrow   The legislation that keeps me in Washington today will also make a major contribution to your progress  The bill that Senator Mike Enzi and I have brought before the Senate will bring the work of the FDA into the twenty first century   Every day that a medicine is delayed needlessly in the review process is another day in which the innovations of this remarkable industry are denied to the patients who need them  Every time a test or clinical trial is ordered needlessly is an added cost that ultimately must be paid by patients   At the heart of our proposal is a modern system for improving patient safety  not through additional layers of bureaucracy  but through a flexible structure that emphasizes post market surveillance  As we developed this bipartisan legislation  there were some who urged us to load every conceivable requirement onto the drug review system  They asked us to create a separate office of safety to serve as a check against rapid approvals  We rejected those calls  and adopted a balanced approach that brings the power of information technology to safety surveillance  Under our proposal  FDA will have access to a new array of data about drug safety  not from costly clinical trials but from existing databases and electronic records  This is a proposal that former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan refers to as health IT for drug safety  Currently  FDA might need to request an expensive clinical trial to get information about a drugs action or safety  but under our legislation  that same information could be available at the touch of a button  Already  systems like the Mayo Clinic and the VA can pinpoint the effects of using specific drugs in particular patients without having to do new clinical trials  and FDA should have that ability too  The legislation I am fighting for today will improve patient access to new therapies  Some have argued that any increase in safety will inevitably decrease access  but thats a false comparison  Consider the situation now when FDA is confronted with a new drug that may pose safety risks or where additional study may be required  Todays FDA might conclude that the risks of approving the drug are too great  But under our legislation  FDA could allow patients access to the drug  knowing that effective safety measures were in place   The proposal I am fighting for in Washington also establishes a public private partnership at the FDA  the Reagan Udall Foundation  We have heard time and again that there is a need for better research tools to aid FDA in evaluating the safety of drugs and to help researchers move through the long process of developing drugs more effectively   The Reagan Udall Foundation sets up a way to develop these new tools  not so they can help just one researcher or one company  but to aid the entire research enterprise   Our legislation also includes a commitment to the nations children by renewing the important incentives to encourage testing of medicines for children  Our work together wont be over when the current debate concludes  Our committee will soon take up the important question of follow on biologics  Weve heard important testimony on the European system  and Ive received excellent recommendations on a policy that is led by science  protects safety  and values innovation  My door is always open to you  and I welcome your expertise and your views as our deliberations continue  Our FDA legislation also includes a novel proposal from Senator Brownback and Senator Brown to encourage the development of new therapies for neglected diseases  Companies that develop new therapies or vaccines for tropical diseases will receive a credit entitling them to a priority review at FDA for a product of their choosing   The proposal will not raise costs to consumers  nor will it change FDA safety standards  But by allowing a company to move one of its products to the head of the line for review  it will provide a responsible incentive for the development of new medicines  That proposal is but a start  but we need to go much farther  The United Kingdom and many other European nations have created innovative advance market commitments and other financial incentives to spur development of new ways of treating diseases of the poorest nations  and we should learn from their example  We must lead in compassion as we have led in innovation  The greatness of our hearts must match the greatness of our inventions  Biotechnology can help break down one of the highest barriers between rich nations and poor  the crushing burden of disease that thwarts the progress of billions around the world  The challenge of this new century must be to see that the benefits of the biotechnology revolution are shared by all citizens of the world  not just those fortunate enough to live in America and other developed nations   Countless lives and the potential of a continent have been lost to the ravages of AIDS  TB  malaria and other infectious diseases in Africa  I believe that it is within the capability of the extraordinary assembly of talent at this convention to cure each of these scourges within the next two decades  Already  doctors are exploring new ways to deliver vaccines that do not require refrigeration  which is unavailable in so many parts of the world Your industry must take as its challenge the needs not only of the developed world  but of those nations where disease has held back progress  The life sciences era must belong to all the citizens of the world  The awesome task before the biotechnology industry then is not simply to innovate and that is challenging enough  but to innovate in ways that help make your miracle products more affordable and more accessible to those who need them so urgently This conference is both a celebration and a call to action  You are right to celebrate a breathtaking record of achievement  and right to call for action from your colleagues and from government to create and sustain a culture of responsible innovation for the people of America and the world   Thank you for inviting me to be part of this distinguished gathering  And thank you for all you do  THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REVITALIZATION ACT Title I  Prescription Drug User FeesTitle I codifies the user fee agreement reached by drug and biotech industries with the FDA  It establishes an overall amount for user fees of nearly  393 million for 2008  which will be adjusted upward based on 2007 workload   It includes the expansion of use of drug user fees by nearly  30 million for post approval drug safety programs Title I also includes a user fee program under which drug companies can submit direct to consumer television advertisements to FDA for review before they are distributed Title II  Drug SafetySubtitle A  Risk Evaluation and Mitigation StrategiesA system of routine active surveillance for post market drug safety will be established  The partnership will aggregate data from Federal and private health databases  Active surveillance will occur for every newly approved drug  Using a risk based approach  drugs and biologics may be approved with risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  REMS   Personnel from offices for drug safety are integrated into the drug review process Minimal Elements of a REMS  FDA approved professional labeling  A timetable for periodic assessment of the REMS Additional Elements of a REMS For drugs with out of the ordinary risks  the REMS may include additional elements to protect patient safety  such as  Special training for doctors who prescribe the drug  Additional studies conducted after approval Compliance  Civil money penalties for violation of any component of a REMS Resources  Increased drug user fees would be used to review REMS and for FDAs general drug safety surveillance  This subtitle steps up user fee revenue annually  including  25 million authorized for the routine surveillance of drugs once marketed to reach the  100 million called for by the IOM Direct to Consumer Ads  DTC   The bill as reported allows FDA to impose a moratorium on DTC in rare circumstances  We are evaluating whether requiring expanded safety information in DTC ads  coupled with fines for misleading ads may be an alternate way of achieving the goal of accurate information to consumers  IMPROVING THE SCIENTIFIC ENVIRONMENT AT FDATransparency The bill includes important measures to promote transparency  such as posting of the action package for approval for drugs  including scientific commentaries   as well as requiring notice of the actions of the Drug Safety Oversight Board  and a report on the involvement of safety staff in drug review activities at FDA  Improving Science The bill includes additional measures to improve science at FDA  including the establishment of an Office of the Chief Scientist  and putting in statute a required consultation with the Drug Safety and Risk Management committee on priority drug safety questions and on the effectiveness of aspects of the REMS process Subtitle B  Reagan Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug AdministrationSubtitle B establishes a foundation to lead collaborations amongst the FDA  academic research institutions  and industry directed to improving the process of drug development and evaluation  Collaborative research projects will be selected that are designed to bolster R  D productivity  provide new tools for improving safety in drug evaluation  and in the long term make drug development more predictable and manageable  This institute will be financially supported by both industry and the government Subtitle C  Clinical TrialsClinical Trials Registry  To enhance patient enrollment and provide a mechanism to track subsequent progress of trials  clinical trials of late Phase II  Phase III and Phase IV would be required to register in a publicly available database  Certain basic pieces of information would be placed in fields in the database entry  while the bulk of the information would be in summary documents Clinical Trials Results  To ensure that results of trials are made public  and that patients and providers have the most up to date information  publicly available information  including the FDAs action package on a drug  will be deposited in a publicly available database  Device clinical trials to support FDA approval or clearance are also included  as well as pediatric postmarket surveillance  HHS will be given regulatory authority to require inclusion of results for trials not covered by publicly available information  Civil monetary penalties will enforce these requirements Subtitle D  Conflicts of Interest Subtitle D requires pre disclosure of conflicts of interest of advisory committee members  and greater efforts by FDA to identify non conflicted members Title III  Medical Device User FeesThe legislation implements the agreement between the FDA and the medical device industry groups  It reauthorizes the medical device user fee program  streamlines the third part review program  and provides for electronic registration of device manufacturing plants Title IV  Pediatric Medical ProductsSubtitle A  Best Pharmaceuticals for ChildrenSubtitle A would reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and improve its provisions in order to make it more effective at ensuring that drugs are safe and effective for pediatric populations  BPCA provides increased market exclusivity to drug manufacturers to encourage the determination of safety and efficacy of drugs in pediatric populations  The bill contains a three month adjustment on exclusivity if the annual U S  sales of the drug exceed  1 billion  Products earning less than  1 billion continue to receive six months of exclusivity Subtitle B  Pediatric Research ImprovementSubtitle B reauthorizes the Pediatric Research Equity Act to make it more effective at ensuring that drugs for children are safe and effective  If a company chooses not to pursue pediatric exclusivity for an already marketed drug under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act  the Secretary can require the submission of pediatric data for such drug  This authority has never been utilized for drugs that are already approved  in part due to the lengthy administrative process required to invoke such authority  PRIA would streamline this administrative process and help get essential pediatric data for important drugs  It would also expand the ability of the Secretary to use this authority in cases where such data would represent a benefit to a large number of children  or help us to learn more about risks with certain drugs Subtitle C  Pediatric Medical DevicesSubtitle C modifies the existing humanitarian device exemption  HDE  for medical devices to allow profit for HDE approved devices specifically designed to meet a pediatric need  It maintains existing requirement that a humanitarian use device is limited to one that treats and diagnoses diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 4 000 individuals in the U S  per year  No profit will be allowed for a device used in more than 4 000 individuals  Miscellaneous Provisions The bill contains two amendments adopted in committee  one on medical marijuana and the other on drug labeling  It also makes a technical correction to two bills enacted last year  the BARDA legislation and the NIH reauthorization          Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
