         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Senators Specter and Leahy have devoted an enormous amount of time and effort to negotiating this revised Asbestos Trust Fund legislation  They deserve great credit for their work  But  the bill before us still contains serious flaws  which make it both unfair and unworkable  It does not provide a reliable guarantee of just compensation to the enormous number of workers who are suffering from asbestos induced disease    The problem is that powerful corporate interests responsible for the asbestos epidemic have fought throughout this process to escape full accountability for the harm they have inflicted  The Republican leadership has given these corporate wrongdoers a virtual veto over the terms of this legislation  As a result  the focus has shifted from what these companies should pay victims to what they are willing to pay them  That is preventing the Senate from enacting Trust Fund legislation that will truly help the workers who have been seriously injured by this industrial plague    The real crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation crisis  it is an asbestos induced disease crisis  Asbestos is the most lethal substance ever widely used in the workplace  Between 1940 and 1980  there were 27 5 million workers in this country who were exposed to asbestos on the job  and nearly 19 million of them had high levels of exposure over long periods of time  That exposure changed many of their lives  Each year  10 000 of them die from lung cancer and other diseases caused by asbestos  Each year  hundreds of thousands of them suffer from lung conditions which make breathing so difficult that they cannot function at all     Even more have become unemployable due to their medical condition  And  because of the long latency period of these diseases  all of them live with fear of a premature death due to asbestos induced disease  These are the real victims  They deserve to be the first and foremost focus of our concern     All too often  the tragedy these workers and their families are enduring becomes lost in a complex debate about the economic impact of asbestos litigation  We cannot allow that to happen  The litigation did not create these costs  Exposure to asbestos created them  They are the costs of medical care  the lost wages of incapacitated workers  and the cost of providing for the families of workers who died years before their time  Those costs are real  No legislative proposal can make them disappear  All legislation can do is shift those costs from one party to another    Any proposal which would shift more of the financial burden onto the backs of injured workers is unacceptable to me  and it should be unacceptable to every one of us    The legislation before us would close the courthouse doors to asbestos victims on the day it passes  long before the Trust Fund will be able to pay their claims  Their cases will be stayed immediately  Seriously ill workers will be forced into a legal limbo for up to two years  Their need for compensation to cover medical expenses and basic family necessities will remain  but they will have nowhere to turn for relief  Even those victims who have less than a year to live will be forced to stop their cases for nine months  Nine months is an eternity for those with only a year to live  Many of them will die without receiving either their day in court or compensation from the Trust Fund    Experts tell us that the Asbestos Trust created by this legislation is seriously underfunded  It is  13 billion less than the amount provided in the Committee s 2003 legislation  even though many of the award values have been increased  The funding plan in this bill relies on very substantial borrowing in the early years as the only way to pay the flood of claims  The result will be huge debt service costs over the life of the Trust that could reduce the  140 billion intended to pay claims by 40  or more according to testimony we will hear today  The amount remaining would be far too little to pay claims to cover all of those who are entitled to compensation under the terms of the bill    In addition  there is a strong constitutional argument that the existing bankruptcy trusts cannot be forced to turn over all their assets  which will place  7 6 billion in jeopardy  Many companies are also likely to challenge their obligation to finance the Asbestos Trust  It is not at all clear how much will actually be available to pay eligible victims what the legislation promises they will receive    There is likely to be a serious shortfall in the early years  when nearly 300 000 pending cases will be transferred to the Trust for payment  The Trust may not have the resources to pay those claims in a timely manner  Payments to critically ill people may be delayed for years    One way to reduce the enormous financial burden on the fund in the early years would be to leave many of those cases in the tort system  especially cases which were close to resolution  That would be fair to the parties in those cases and it would greatly improve the financial viability of the fund  Unfortunately  that proposal has also been rejected    If the Trust Fund does become insolvent  a very real possibility  workers will not have an automatic right to immediately return to the court system  The process outlined in the current bill could take years  Workers could end up trapped in the Trust with reduced benefits and long delays in receiving their payments  There needs to be a clear  objective trigger    inability of the Trust to pay a certain percentage of claims within a set period of time    that will automatically allow victims to pursue their claims in court if the Trust runs out of money  The Committee s 2003 legislation contained such a provision  but this bill does not  We cannot allow seriously injured workers with valid claims who are not paid in a timely manner by the Trust to be denied their day in court  That would be a shameful injustice    I am particularly upset by the change in the way lung cancer victims are treated  Under the medical criteria adopted by this Committee overwhelmingly two years ago  all lung cancer victims who had at least 15 years of weighted exposure to asbestos were entitled to receive compensation from the Fund  That provision remained in every draft of the bill written since  until the Specter Leahy legislation introduced last week  Under this bill  lung cancer victims who have had very substantial exposure to asbestos over long periods of time are denied any compensation unless they can show asbestos scarring on their lungs  The Committee heard expert medical testimony that prolonged asbestos exposure dramatically increases the probability that a person will get lung cancer even if they do not have scarring on their lungs  Deleting the Level VII category will deny compensation to approximately forty thousand victims suffering with asbestos related lung cancers  Under the legislation as now drafted  these victims are losing their right to go to court  but receiving nothing from the Fund  How can any of us support such an unconscionable provision    This bill also tampers with the agreed upon medical criteria by raising the standard of proof for each disease category  The new language requires the workers to prove that asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to their disease  instead of just a contributing factor  This is a major increase in the burden workers must overcome to receive compensation  It is significantly higher than most states currently require in a court of law  Rather than having to show that asbestos exposure contributed to their illness  they will now have to address the relative impact of asbestos and other potential factors  This change is a serious step in the wrong direction  raising the bar even higher on injured workers    While this legislation does contain some improvements    increasing some compensation values  protecting workers from subrogation  and providing medical screening for high risk workers    they are outweighed by the bill s weaknesses    This is a bill that shifts more of the financial burden of asbestos induced disease to the injured workers by unfairly and arbitrarily limiting the liability of defendants  It does not establish a fair and reliable system that will compensate all those who are seriously ill due to asbestos  It lacks a dependable funding stream which can ensure that all who are entitled to compensation actually receive full and timely payment  These are very basic shortcomings   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
