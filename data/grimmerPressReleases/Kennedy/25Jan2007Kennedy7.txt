         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  In taking up the DeMint Amendment  its critically important that we all understand whats really going on here  Lets call this what it is  its a hoax  This amendment is a poison pill  It serves no legitimate legislative purpose other than to take a political stab at Members from those states with the foresight to raise their minimum wages above the federal level in response to almost a decade of federal inaction  This amendment would further raise the federal minimum wage in states that have already passed such wages on their own initiative  It was intended to give Senators in high minimum wage states an uncomfortable vote today  not to raise wages for hardworking Americans  Its shameful to play such political games with an issue that means so much to working Americans  The minimum wage should be about protecting workers lives  not scoring political points Even if this amendment were offered in all seriousness  even if Senator DeMint  who has never once  in his history in the House and the Senate  voted for a real increase in the minimum wage  and who just yesterday voted to repeal the federal minimum wage  even if Senator DeMint has had a genuine change of heart  responsible Senators still could not support this amendment  It reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Fair Labor Standards Act is  and what it was intended to do When Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 the goal was to establish minimum federal standards  These standards were intended to address serious problems facing the nation that were caused by the race to the bottom among unscrupulous employers  child labor  abusive hours  and starvation wages  The federal minimum wage was created as a wage floor  As Representative Kent Keller explained during those original debates  the wage was intended to be a minimum standard below which labor cannot be compelled to work and live  This floor has always been a uniform floor for all states  It reflects our shared recognition  as a nation  that there is a wage below which no one should have to work in a just society  The minimum wage that we pay our workers is a reflection of our fundamental values  Right now  that floor is too low  and it doesnt reflect our values  The vast majority of Americans want this Congress to raise it  and we should do so as soon as possible However  the framers of the FLSA clearly intended that states have a role as well  States have always been free to pass stronger laws for their workers  and many have done so over the years  Twenty nine states and the District of Columbia have all passed minimum wages above the federal level  often through a direct vote of the public by ballot initiative  In fact  we had six such ballot initiatives pass last fall  giving more than a million workers a raise on January first of this year  And more than 140 cities across the country that have passed local living wage ordinances as well These states and localities have made a judgment that they want a wage higher than the federal floor  It is an informed judgment about the cost of living a decent life in their area of the country  Senator DeMints amendment would second guess that judgment  even in states that voted on the issue just a few short months ago  It would tell these millions of voters across the country that they were wrong in the judgment they made when they went to the ballot box  This Congress has too many other important priorities to spend its time overruling local decisions  Our national wage floor is a national issue  how states and localities should respond to local costs of living is a local issue  and should be left as such We need to get back to talking about a real minimum wage proposal  Not a political dodge thats intended merely to waste this Congresss time  I fully support a fair increase in federal minimum wage  I fully support those states and localities that have decided to go further than the federal level  I do not support Senator DeMints amendment  and I urge my colleagues to vote against it   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
