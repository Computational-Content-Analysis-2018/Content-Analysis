         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr   Chairman  it is high time that Congress investigate how this White House has  played politics with the Department of Justice  The Department of  Justice used to be respected as place where politics stopped and prosecutors  were allowed to do their jobs  Not any more  You need only to glance at the  front page of todays paper to see the damage being done to the public interest  and public confidence in our government  Today we will take a critical  step towards playing our critical role in making certain that the office of US  Attorney does not become a partisan tool  But this latest issue is just the tip  of a much larger problem  The front page of todays paper contains not  only a story about the firing of eight US Attorneys  but another alarming story  of politics intruding into the Department of Justice  In it  a career attorney  at the Department says that political appointees dictated that she pull her  punches in a lawsuit that sought to hold big tobacco responsible for their lies  to the American people  Two weeks before closing arguments  and after years of  trial preparation by career attorneys  political appointees ordered her to  reduce the damages request from  130 billion to just  10 billion   These kinds of stories require that this Committee take very seriously  its role in providing oversight over the Department of Justice  The  politicization of the Department of Justice was well under way in 2002  when  Attorney General Ashcroft abolished the process for hiring new career attorneys  for the Department of Justice that had been established by the Eisenhower  Administration half a century ago to eliminate partisanship and cronyism in the  Departments hiring  Predictably  the result has been partisan and  ideological law enforcement  The Civil Rights Division virtually stopped  enforcing the Voting Rights Act on behalf of African Americans  Instead  it sued  African American officials in Mississippi for discriminating against white  voters  The new regime began to simply ignore the recommendations of  career attorneys  Political appointees approved the Texas redistricting law  that was later struck down by the Supreme Court  Political appointees approved a  Georgia photo ID law for voting that was subsequently struck down by a federal  court as a poll tax  Approval of the Georgia photo ID law was driven  by the same partisan motivations that produced the current U S  Attorney  scandal  Georgias Republican dominated state legislature said it was enacting  the law to respond to allegations of voter fraud  But there was no evidence of  such fraud  The ID law was passed anyway  with full awareness that it would  disproportionately prevent minorities from voting Not only did  political appointees reject the career attorneys recommendation to block the  law  but they transferred Robert Berman    the leader of the career team that  reviewed the Georgia law and a 28 year veteran of the Civil Rights Division     out of his job as a Deputy Chief of the Voting Section and into a dead end job   The conclusion is inescapable that the Department of Justice ended Mr  Bermans  long and distinguished career as a Voting Section attorney because he applied  the law faithfully and well  and refused to serve the partisan interests of his  political superiors  Incredibly  Bradley Schlozman  the inexperienced  political appointee who oversaw approval of the Georgia ID law and the  retaliation against the career staff  was rewarded with an appointment as  interim U S  Attorney for the Western District of Missouri  He has served in  that capacity for a year without Senate confirmation  Mr  Schlozman is  a good example of the new regime at our Justice Department  His professional  resume is a short one  He practiced law for about one a year at a large firm  before joining the Bush Administration in a series of political jobs at the  Department of Justice  He had no experience prosecuting cases  But he was a  loyal Bush supporter who was willing to use the power of federal law enforcement  to benefit the Republican Party  While supervising the Voting Section  of the Civil Rights Division  he presided over the Texas redistricting and  Georgia photo ID fiascos  He failed to authorize the filing of a single  affirmative voting rights case on behalf of African American voters  but he  jumped at the chance to sue African American officials in Mississippi for  discriminating against white voters  On the eve of the 2004 election  he  orchestrated the filing of two extraordinary amicus briefs  one in Florida and  the other in Ohio  that argued that individuals could not go to court to  enforce the Help America Vote Act  The briefs argued that only the government  could enforce the act and that individuals who wanted to get their provisional  ballots counted were simply out of luck  This extraordinary partisan  intervention by the Civil Rights Division weeks before a national election in  battleground states to suppress the votes of predominantly Democratic voters was  unprecedented  Mr  Schlozman also led the charge in punishing other  dedicated career attorneys who were insufficiently partisan  For example  he  transferred at least two longtime career attorneys out of the Divisions  Appellate Section and told several others that they could no longer work on  civil rights cases  but would have to stomach a full docket defending  deportation orders  He changed performance evaluations to punish career  attorneys  He was a key participant in a politicized hiring regime that  as  the Boston Globe reported  started looking to partisan credentials and  membership in the Federalist Society and de emphasized academic qualifications  and any experience in enforcing the civil rights laws  For this  disgraceful record  Mr  Schlozman was rewarded with a U S  Attorney position for  which he would never have to face Senate confirmation The continuing  revelations about the eight fired U S  Attorneys simply confirm how thoroughly  partisanship has infected the administration of justice in the Bush  Administration  As explanation after explanation has unraveled  it has become  increasingly clear that the purge of U S  Attorneys reflected the desire of the  White House to remove U S  Attorneys who were not sufficiently committed to the  political agenda of the Administration  It is well past time to expose  the politicization of our system of justice by this Administration  We should  press ahead vigorously with the investigation of the U S  Attorney firings and  expose the deeper problems that corrupt the enforcement of federal law by this  Department of Justice          Laura Capps Melissa
