         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Its a great honor to share a few memories of my friend Red Auerbach with all of you today          Red was a pioneer  in sports  in civil rights  and as one of the architects of the new Boston   Hell never be forgotten  and therell never be another like him          The teams he led with the legendary Bob Cousy  and the incomparable Bill Russell  set the gold standard for professionalism and transformed his sport and this city           Bob  I still cant believe he didnt take you right out of Holy Cross  or that his strategy for snatching Bill in the draft required sending the Ice Capades to Rochester           I cant imagine ever having to negotiate with him on a trade because  as my brother Jack might say  Red was the kind of opponent who wouldnt tell you if your shirt was on fire          The stories of his competitive drive are legendary  and that drive came from his deep and abiding passion for life and for living each day as if it was a gift from above   Whenever you were in his presence  you could sense the powerful joy that comes to those rare few like Red  who know theyve done everything possible in every way on every day to achieve their dream  Red Auerbach was a great coach   And he was a good man   He believed in winning  and he believed that every individual should have the chance to be a winner   In the late 1950s  before ever Celtics game Red would invite 5 kids to play a game of basketball with uniforms  referees  etc  on the famous Boston Garden parquet floor  He would have one kid from the CYO    our very own Congressman Ed Markey was one of those kids   one Chinese American from Chinatown  one African American from Roxbury and one kid from the Young Mens Hebrew Association   Long before anyone ever dreamed about it  Red created his very own Rainbow Coalition and was a Civil Rights Champion the rest of his life  He was the first to go overseas with American players to teach basketball to kids in Europe  Asia and was responsible for making it the international game that it is today          He also had a great wit  You all know about Reds famous victory cigars   I remember hearing one story about the box of cigars he always had on his desk in his office   After every game  sportswriters  players would go into his office  take the cigars  by the end of the evening  all the cigars would be gone   No one could figure out why Red never said anything about his missing cigars   Finally  curiosity got the best of them  they asked Red if he ever noticed that his cigars were gone every night   He promptly shot back  of course I did you foolsI only put my stale ones there   Did you think I was going to give you my good cigars          The Kennedy family called Red a friend  and Id like to share one memory of what a blessing he was in our lives    In the early 1970s  my son Teddy was 12 and lost his leg to cancer   When he returned to his hospital room to recover from that operation  there was a basketball waiting from him   It was from Red  with the signatures of every Celtic   It immediately became one of Teddys treasures           For many months after that  Teddy had to go to Childrens Hospital for session after session of chemotherapy   He endured it with great courage  and to take our minds of the treatments we began going to Celtics games  Red had moved on to the front office by then  and he invited us to sit with him at some of the games         Im sure all of you can imagine what a thrill it was for a twelve year old boy    not to mention his father    to be near the legendary Red Auerbach in the Garden   Red took the time to explain to Teddy how coach Tommy Heinsohn was adjusting his strategy  why a particular play had worked or a particular defense had failed  and what to watch for next    And we could feel the surge of excitement in the Garden and the raw energy on the floor whenever John Havlicek stole the ball  or JoJo White drove to the basket  or Dave Cowens blocked a shot or grabbed a rebound          In one hard fought game  a young Kareem Abdul Jabbar was so dominant that Teddy and I began to worry the Celtics might lose  Yet Red seemed so relaxed  and as time went on  Teddy finally asked him  Mr  Auerbach  are we going to be able to pull this one out           Red smiled with a gleam in his eye and said  Dont you worry   Pretty soon its gonna feel like 120 degrees in here  and Kareem will begin to wilt   Youll see   And sure enough  thats exactly what happened   The cigar came out and the Celtics won          Little did I realize that day that Reds statement was no casual observation   Fast forward ten years to the historic 84 finals and Red was still torturing Kareem and his Showtime Lakers with the  Gardens oppressive heat and humidity           Red made our family part of the Celtics family at a time when we needed a champion in our corner  He helped lift us up and he gave us memories well cherish forever           Red put basketball on the map in Boston   He created Boston Celtic magic  mystique and backed up every bit of it with 9 world championships as coach  8 in a row  and 16 world championships all together   He was voted the greatest coach of all time by the Professional Basketball Writers of America  There are very few people in the world known by one nameCher  Madonna  Elvis  Bono   And then there is our very own Red  He will be greatly missed  but never forgotten   Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley    617  565 4472
