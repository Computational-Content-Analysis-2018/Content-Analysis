         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE          For nine years  Democrats have been trying to pass an increase in the minimum wage from its current level of  5 15 an hour  For employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  thats  10 700 a year  almost  6 000 below the poverty line for a family of three    Americans believe that no one who works hard for a living should have to live in poverty  A job should lift you out of poverty  not keep you in it   Thats why Ive offered an amendment which will raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps  My amendment will help almost 15 million Americans put food on the table  pay bills  and build a better future for their families    My colleague  Senator Enzi  has also introduced an amendment today that would increase the minimum wage by just  1 10 per hour  over the same timeframe as my amendment  But my amendment is three pages  while the Enzi Amendment is 73 pages    The Enzi amendment is loaded with anti worker poison pills  It would increase the minimum wage with one hand  while taking away minimum wage  overtime  and equal pay rights from millions of workers with the other hand  Its a wolf in sheeps clothing  and its a threat to American workers    The Enzi amendment is an attack on fundamental worker rights  10 million workers currently protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act would no longer be covered by the minimum wage  and no longer eligible for overtime pay  This hurts both the poorest families  who lose the protections of the minimum wage  and middle class families that often rely on overtime to pay for basic necessities    His proposal would also be the death of the 40 hour workweek  It would allow employers to refuse to pay workers up to ten hours of earned overtime pay every two weeks  While Republicans say this change is needed to give workers flexibility  thats simply not the case  Employers are already free to offer more flexible schedules under current lawthe only difference is that now they have to pay workers overtime when they work more than 40 hours in a week   The Enzi amendment is also an assault on states rights  It prohibits states from providing stronger wage protections than the federal standard for tipped employees like waiters and waitresses  overturning the labor laws of thirty one states    The Enzi Amendment will hurt many workers  while helping only a precious few  The  1 10 minimum wage increase it provides would help only 1 8 million workers  4 8 million fewer than my amendment    Minimum wage workers have waited nine long years for a raise  They deserve a raise thats fair    Nearly fifteen million Americans will benefit from a minimum wage increase to  7 25 an hour  6 6 million directly  and another 8 3 million indirectly  Sixty percent of these workers are women  and forty percent are people of color    My amendment will help more than 7 3 million children whose parents would receive a raise    It is shameful that in America today  the richest and most powerful nation on earth  one in six children are living in poverty  and one in five children live on the edge of hunger because their parents  many of whom are working full time  just cant make ends meet    The poverty rate for children in the United States is substantially higher than in other major Western industrialized nations  And the reason is all too clear  were not taking the basic steps we need to take to eradicate poverty in this country  Steps like raising the minimum wage   In 1999  Prime Minister Tony Blair made a commitment to cut child poverty in Great Britain in half in 10 years  and completely eliminate it by 2020  One of the major steps he took to achieve this goal was to raise the minimum wage several times  The current minimum wage is about  9 26 per hour last year  and will be raised again to  9 81 in October of this year    This strategy has seen remarkable success  already lifting almost 2 million British children out of poverty    We should be following their lead  Our failure to act is a moral outrage  Todays minimum wage is not a just wage  The people who earn the minimum wage are being exploited  and that is wrong   It is wrong that our productivity soars but hardworking people cannot afford to put food on the table or heat their homes  People who work hard and play by the rules should be able to support themselves by their work   It is wrong to give billions upon billions of dollars in tax relief to the wealthy  but turn your backs on the hard working families who live in poverty each day   The Republican leadership is out of touch on this issue  They are caving to industry lobbyists and special interests  and ignoring whats best for working Americans    When you give the American people a chance  they will always vote for fairness  Its time for us in Congress to heed their example  and vote to raise the minimum wage   When Martin Luther King Jr  called for an end to segregation on the steps of the memorial to Abraham Lincoln in Washington  he said I have come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now  he said  Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God s children   Well  I have come to the Senate today to remind my colleagues of the fierce urgency of now  Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of Gods Children  Now is the time to raise the minimum wage for millions of Americans            Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
