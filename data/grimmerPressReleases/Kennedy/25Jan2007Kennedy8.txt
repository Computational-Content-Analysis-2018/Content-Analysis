         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   This amendment does nothing to help working families  especially those who earn the minimum wage   Its a travesty that were debating more tax breaks for the wealthy who use health savings accounts as another way to shelter income when we should be talking about a long overdue pay increase for working families The real world impact of this amendment is just one more tax break that makes health savings accounts  already the most tax preferred accounts in history  even more alluring to those who are healthy and wealthy   It seems my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have yet to run out of more sweeteners for wealthy health savings accounts holders We shouldnt spend another dime on health savings accounts   At the same time theres no money for health care for children or those who are poor or frail  theres no limit to the money they want to spend for new tax breaks for the wealthy Health savings accounts dont work for working families   A minimum wage worker who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year makes 10 712 dollars   The deductible for a high deductible family plan can be as much as 11 000 dollars  more than the worker makes in a year   And thats just the deductible  that doesnt even include premiums   These accounts are no solution for working families who are uninsured or underinsured   A recent survey by the Commonwealth Fund found that compared with those with traditional comprehensive insurance  families using high deductible health plans with health savings accounts were less than half as likely to have been uninsured before being covered by their current plan   Instead  those opening health savings accounts are more likely to be healthy and wealthy  and switching to a health savings account to take advantage of tax breaks These plans dont work for working families because the high out of pocket costs associated with the high deductible plan leaves these families at great financial risk   Its no wonder that over half of all bankruptcies in America are caused by patients unable to pay their medical bills   Of those who go bankrupt due to medical expenses  75 percent had health insurance but found that it didnt cover the care they needed when they got sick   Health savings accounts contribute to this  with those who are in high deductible health plans with the accounts twice as likely to spend 5 percent or more of their income on medical costs and twice as likely to delay or avoid needed health care as those with traditional health plans   The large majority of low and moderate income working families who are given no choice but a high deductible plan cant afford to fund a health savings account   And many employers dont contribute to their employees accounts  and if they do  the contributions are well below the funds needed to meet the high deductible  While more than half of those with incomes above 50 000 dollars contribute 1 000 dollars or more annually to their accounts  more than two thirds of those with lower incomes contribute less than 1 000 dollars  and more than one quarter are unable to contribute any money to their account Even if they manage to come up with money to put into their account  those with lower incomes are disadvantaged because of the regressiveness of the tax code   A family of four earning 20 000 dollars who manages to scrape together 1 000 dollars gets no tax advantage for their contribution  while a family earning 120 000 dollars gets a 310 dollar tax reduction   The inequity only increases with higher contributions   In the unlikely event that a family earning 20 000 dollars was able to contribute 5 450 dollars  last years maximum contribution  would still get no tax advantage for their contribution  while a family earning 120 000 would receive a tax break of 1 667 dollars Its no surprise that a study late last year by the Government Accountability Office found that health savings accounts were being disproportionately used by those with high incomes   The GAO found that the average income of those using health savings accounts was 133 000 dollars  almost three times that of all tax filers   And account holders in a health savings account focus group acknowledged that many were using their health savings accounts to shelter income Finally  the GAO noted that when individuals are given a choice between HSA eligible and traditional plansHSA eligible plans may attract healthier individuals who use less health care or  as we found  higher income individuals with the means to pay higher deductibles and the desire to accrue tax free savings   The adverse selection that would result will raise premiums for working families in traditional plans  increasing the likelihood that they will join the ranks of the uninsured     I urge you to vote against this amendment   Promoting health savings accounts is bad health policy  its bad tax policies  and it does nothing to help low and moderate income working families    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
