         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  America at its best is when we are united in common cause and a unified purpose  We came together to overcome the Great Depression  We came together to fight two world wars against tyranny  We came together in the Cold War years to contain and defeat communism   We came together to fight polio    to explore the heavens    and to create a secure retirement for our seniors   We came together after much struggle to expand the circle of opportunity in America    for civil rights  voting rights  disability rights  and women s rights   We came together on 9 11  as a nation determined to fight terrorism and defend our land   As Americans we know how to come together to achieve great goals    to make stronger our communities  our families  our economy  our schools  our nation   That s the America I believe in  That s the America I fight for every day  An America where we are joined arm in arm to advance the cause of opportunity  freedom  and fairness for all of our people   But this legislation breaks the bond that unites America  the bond that makes our country strong  It says the concerns of low and middle income families don t matter  They no longer have a voice in the United States Senate  What matters is the special interests   This bill sacrifices the hopes and dreams of average Americans to the rampant greed of the credit card industry  It turns the United States Senate into a collection agency for the credit card companies reaching the long arm of the law into the pocketbooks of average Americans who have reached the end of their economic rope   That is wrong  That is not what we should be doing here  We have a responsibility to the people to fight for them and their needs    not to do the bidding of the almighty credit card companies   Our bankruptcy laws are intended to give families a second chance  As Americans  we believe that if you work hard  live responsibly  but fall on hard times  our bankruptcy laws should be there to help you get back on your feet  If you get sick and face a mountain of medical bills  if you face divorce and no longer have two incomes to support your family  if your job gets sent overseas  then Americans believe you should have the opportunity to rebuild your lives   If you ve been irresponsible and a profligate spender  and try to game the bankruptcy system  then our laws should hold you responsible  You should be required to pay back what you owe or face the consequences  But if you ve done everything right  but fall on hard times  then bankruptcy is there to help you   However  this bill changes everything  It takes dozens and dozens of bankruptcy rules and rewrites every single one of them in favor of the credit card industry   Yesterday  we witnessed the powerful grip of this industry over the Republican Party  Republicans defeated amendment after amendment that tried to give average Americans a fair chance when they face the credit card company lawyers in bankruptcy court  But when it appeared that an amendment closing a special interest loophole for the financial services industry  threatened to be closed by the Leahy Sarbanes Warner amendment   Republicans shut down the Senate   It s not as if the credit card industry is suffering  In the eight years that this bill has been before the Senate  credit card profits have jumped 163   from eleven and a half billion dollars a year to more than 30 billion last year   In the meantime  middle class families are facing tough times with incomes falling  health costs out of control  college tuition through the roof  and now gasoline prices rising once again   But this bill says that what s going on your life every day doesn t matter   You may be a member of the Guard or Reserve called to Iraq  and your business failed because you were away serving your country  In fact  40  of those called up say they lost income and 16 000 soldiers declared bankruptcy just last year  They sacrificed their lives in Iraq and their financial security here at home  But the credit card companies will honor their service by squeezing every last dime out of our veterans in bankruptcy court   Democrats tried to correct this problem  to put some balance and fairness in this bill  Senator Durbin offered an amendment to protect those who protect us  But our Republicans friends said no  Every single Republican in the United States Senate voted for more credit card profits and against our service men and women   You may be a cancer survivor  but you haven t survived the  35 000 in medical bills that your insurance company won t pay  And you lost another  20 000 for all the months you couldn t work and had to use your credit cards to pay the mortgage  cover the car payment  pay the utilities  and buy the groceries  You re doing everything you can to pay down your debt  You ve taken out a second mortgage  You ve cashed in your retirement savings  Your family is sharing one car   But that doesn t matter  Under this bill  the profits of the credit card companies are more important than your recovery from cancer   Democrats fought to correct this problem  I offered an amendment to give responsible Americans who have fallen on hard times due to illness or injury a fair chance in bankruptcy court  But Republicans voted against these Americans in favor of the credit card companies   You may be a single mother trying to raise your family  juggle your job and school  and rely on alimony and child support to pay the bills  But more than 200 000 women owed alimony or child support are forced into bankruptcy every year   Democrats are addressing this problem  too  Republicans have a chance to vote for single mothers later this morning  We have a chance to say to women across America who are taking responsibility every single day for their children  but have a deadbeat dad who won t do his part  that we re on your side  We believe it s more important for you to get back on your feet than for credit card companies to have greater profits   And maybe your job was one of the 2 8 million manufacturing jobs that have been shipped overseas in the past four years  You ve found a new job  but it pays only half as much  But under this bill  it doesn t matter  In bankruptcy court  you ll still have to keep paying exorbitant interest payments to the credit card companies as if you still had your old  better paying job   It doesn t matter that you ve worked hard and lived responsibly all your life  It doesn t matter that you were willing to take a lower paying job because you want to be a contributing member of society  All that matters in this bill is for the credit card companies to have more and more profits   We ll have a chance to vote on this question later this morning  too  But I have a feeling that Republicans are going to say no to the needs of Americans whose jobs have been outsourced overseas  just as they have to Iraq veterans  to single mothers  to children  and to seniors   We should be working to unite the country to achieve great goals again  We should be fighting for quality  affordable health care for all Americans  We should be battling to improve our schools and to make college more affordable  We should be strengthening our economy and training our workers to compete against globalization  We should be fighting to keep our country safe from terrorism   But this bill makes these goals more difficult to achieve  It divides America by rewarding the powerful special interests at the expense of the low and middle income families  A Republican supporter of the bill said yesterday that this bill was fair and balanced  But where is that fairness and balance     It does nothing to fix the millionaires  mansion loophole that allows millionaires to go into bankruptcy and still keep their massive estates  You may lose your home  but they get to keep their palaces    And it does nothing to help the thousands upon thousands of employees and retirees of companies like Enron and Worldcom and Polaroid who are left twisting in the wind after a bankruptcy process that lets the responsible corporate executives go free   This destructive legislation may pass today  Republicans and the credit card companies may get their way  and the American people may lose this round  But the fight is never over    until we ve assured fairness and freedom and opportunity for every one of our citizens  That s our pledge as Democrats today  tomorrow  and into the future       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
