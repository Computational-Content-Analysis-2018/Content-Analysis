the Higher Education Act  HEA  and seeking feedback on how to make college more affordable for students and their families in Massachusetts  On Friday  February 16th  Senator Kennedy  Chairman of the United States Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  will convene a hearing on college affordability  As part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act  Senator Kennedy will strive to increase need based grants for low income students  provide more help for borrowers struggling to repay their student loans  and reform the federal student loan programs so they work for students  not the banks  Senator Kennedy has introduced several proposals to improve aid for college students and reform the student loan industry  Summaries of those proposals are available below      February 13  2007Dear President XX  The reauthorization of the Higher Education Act is one of my highest priorities for the new session of Congress  and I plan to do all I can to enact worthwhile and bipartisan legislation in the coming months  This Friday I will hold a hearing on college affordability and I am reaching out to you for input and advice  Across America today  students are dreaming about what they hope to be  Their parents know all too well that those great dreams depend on a college education  But major increases in tuition and cuts in financial aid programs are creating serious financial barriers to higher education  and forcing students to borrow money at unprecedented rates or give up on college entirely  You know first hand that a college degree leads to improved skills and knowledge  greater employment opportunities  and higher pay  Making college education more accessible and affordable must be a top priority for all of us  It s time to turn these priorities into real help for college students and their families  Ive recently introduced a number of proposals to address the challenges that college students face  including the Student Debt Relief Act  Its obvious we need to act immediately to make both college costs and student debt more manageableand that is what this bill does  The Student Debt Relief Act will help lift the financial yoke that burdens students and families as they try to pay for college  It increases the maximum Pell Grant to  5100  expands debt management and loan forgiveness for students struggling with burdensome loan payments  and reforms the federal student loan programs  Students and families are pinching pennies to pay for college more than ever  so the President and Congress need to work aggressively together on all these fronts to give them as much help as possible  As I talk with my colleagues in Congress over the next few months to find a solution that works for all college students  I look forward to your input and perspective  Please feel free to send your thoughts to me at my Boston office  2400 John F  Kennedy Federal Building Boston  MA 02203 With respect and appreciation for your insight and dedication to higher education   Sincerely   Edward M  Kennedy STUDENT DEBT RELIEF ACT Senator Edward M  Kennedy The American dream is at risk if we fail to make college more affordable  Parents and students understand the importance of college and are willing to sacrifice a lot to pay for a degree  But that sacrifice is getting harder and harder as college costs and student debt increase  Access to college is key to our opportunity  to our economy  and to our values  We must act now to address the crisis of student debt and ensure that cost is not a barrier to a college education  To do this  the Student Debt Relief Act  Need Based Aid  Immediately increases Pell Grant maximum to  5 100 with mandatory funding  and provides additional Pell Grant increases through enactment of Student Aid Rewards Act  STAR Act   which reforms the student loan programs and generates savings to use for student aid by encouraging schools to use more efficient of the two federal loan programs  Interest Rates  Cuts interest rates in half  from 6 8 percent to 3 4 percent  for subsidized undergraduate student loans over 5 years  Debt Relief  Provides borrower option of having federal student loan payments capped at 15  of a monthly discretionary income  and forgives student loans after 25 years  Public Service Loan Forgiveness  Provides loan forgiveness for public sector employees after 10 years  Consolidation Reconsolidation  Allows students to reconsolidate loans  repeals the elimination of in school consolidation  Origination Fees  Reduces origination fees in Direct Loan program by 1  to track FFEL program origination fee reduction  and gives Secretary explicit authority to reduce origination fees  as FFEL lenders have   Direct Loan Student Aid Administrative Funds  Repeals Reconciliation provision that moved administrative funds to discretionary side of budget to restore funding as mandatory  to ensure continued operation of the student aid programs  College Tuition Tax Deduction Student Loan Interest Tax Credit  Extends college tuition tax deduction and increases allowable deduction to  12 000  Converts existing student loan tax deduction into a tax credit  BOOST COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS at NO COST to the Taxpayer THE STUDENT AID REWARD  STAR  ACT OF 2007The bipartisan Student Aid Reward  STAR  Act  introduced by Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA   Senator Gordon Smith  R OR   Congressman George Miller  D CA   and Congressmen Tom Petri  R WI   provides billions in additional college scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students at no additional cost to taxpayers  The plan is simple  the STAR Act encourages colleges to utilize the less expensive of the federal governments student loan programs  The Congressional Budget Office reports that the STAR Act would generate  13 billionin savings  at least  10 billion would go to increased scholarship aid  all at no additional cost to taxpayers  Currently  there are two main student loan programs that provide essentially the same loans and interest rates to students  but one costs billions more annually than the other  In the first program  loans are issued from U S  Treasury funds  and private companies are contracted to service and collect student loan payments  In the second program  the federal government underwrites and subsidizes loans issued by private lenders and banks  These loans bear virtually no risk for private banks  yet have an assured rate of return and are guaranteed against default by the government  The first program is much less expensive  because it secures loan capital at a lower rate  eliminates the middleman  lenders   and cuts out billions in unnecessary subsidies to banks  Congressional Budget Office  2006  10 year estimate  Estimate will be updated following release of CBOs March 2007 baseline  According to President Bush s 2008 education budget  student loans made through the more expensive program in 2007 cost  3 more for every  100 lent than the same loans made with U S  Treasury funds  Estimates from the Presidents 2008 budget include administrative costs for both loan programs  The STAR Act calls upon the Secretary of Education to determine which program is more efficient  Schools would then be rewarded with additional scholarship funds for utilizing the more efficient of the two student loan programs  The competition will encourage the federal loan programs to improve the efficiency of their operations  Schools  students  and taxpayers all would be the beneficiaries  If you have questions or would like additional information on the STAR Act  please contact Missy Rohrbach with Senator Kennedy at 202 224 5501  Jacob Triolo with Senator Smith at 224 9063  Julie Radocchia with Congressman Miller at 202 226 2068  or Tom Culligan with Congressman Petri at 202 225 2476  Student Loan Sunshine Act Senators Edward M  Kennedy and Richard J  DurbinThe Student Loan Sunshine Act protects students and parents from exploitation by private lenders and lenders who offer gifts to colleges as a way to secure loan business  It requires full disclosure of special arrangements that lenders and colleges have to offer loan products at the college  bans lenders from offering gifts over  10 to college employees  and encourages borrowers to maximize their borrowing through the governments loan programs before taking out private loans with higher interest rates  The Student Loan Sunshine Act Protects Students and Families by  Ending Inappropriate Lender Practices  o The Act prohibits lenders from offering any gift worth more than  10 to a college employee  including free or discounted trips  meals  invitations to entertainment events or other form of hospitality  o It also prohibits lenders from offering services to financial aid offices that create a conflict of interest  such as lending staff during peak loan processing times  o It prohibits lenders from entering arrangements with colleges that require the college to brand the lenders loan product with the colleges emblem or logo  Giving Students and Families More Information About Special Arrangements Between Lenders and Colleges  and the Terms and Conditions of Loans  and Preferred Lender Lists  o The Act requires lenders to report any special arrangements they have with colleges to make loans to the Secretary of Education  including the terms of the arrangement related to marketing  recommending  endorsing student loans  and any benefit  direct or indirect  provided to or paid to any party in connection with the loan arrangement  o The Act requires the Secretary of Education  together with members of the higher education community and students  to develop a clear  easy to use model format for reporting the terms and conditions of student loans  similar to the APR disclosure required for other types of loans  o The Act requires colleges preferred lender lists to  include at least three non affiliated lenders  clearly and fully disclose why the college has identified a lender as a preferred lender  and state that students do not have to borrow from the preferred lender list  Encouraging Borrowing Through the Governments Loan Programs  and Discouraging Overborrowing through Direct to Consumer Education Loans  o The Act requires all lenders of direct to consumer private educational loans to clearly and prominently state that borrowers may qualify for low interest loans through the Federal governments loan programs  It also requires these lenders to clearly disclose how the interest rate is determined  sample loan costs disaggregated by type  information on any and all fees  information on collection in the case of default  and information on Better Business and state consumer agency or state attorney general complaints against the lender and their resolution  o Before a DTC lender can offer an education loan of more than  1000  the Act requires the lender to notify the borrowers college of the amount of the proposed loan  so the school can advise the borrower if the loan exceeds whats necessary to cover the students cost of attendance after other aid sources are factored in  o The Act bars lenders from offering a private loan through a college  also known as an alternative loan  until the college has informed students and parents of all their options for borrowing under the governments Title IV loan programs    including information on any terms and conditions of Title IV loans that are more favorable than the private loan  Facts about Private Loans  Lender Gifts  and Preferred Lender Lists  Private Loans  Private student loans now total  17 3 billion  and have grown at an average rate of 27 percent per year since 2001  In 2001 02  private loans accounted for 12 percent of total education borrowing  in 2005 06  they accounted for 20 percent  Unlike loans offered through the federal governments loan programs  private loans frequently carry much higher interest rates  especially for students without credit histories and families without strong credit ratings   Some lenders are increasingly using questionable methods to market private loans to students and their families and court the favor of colleges and universities  For example  o The private loan company Loan to Learn invited college officials and their spouses to attend an all expenses paid education conference in the West Indies  o The private loan company Student Loan Xpress has offered 100  loan approval at colleges if the college agrees to brand the private loan with the colleges name and emblem  making the loan appear to be offered by the college  not the private lender  o Other private loan companies encourage borrowers not to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid  FAFSA     which allows borrowers to obtain loans at lower interest rates  while not prominently disclosing the fact that private loan interest rates are typically much higher  Lender Gifts o Lenders who participate in the governments Federal Family Education Loan  FFEL  program also engage in questionable tactics  like offering educational conferences at luxury hotels  and offering college officials free entertainment and tickets to sporting events  Many lenders offer their staff to work in financial aid offices during peak loan processing times  print materials for financial aid offices  and even e mail students on behalf of the financial aid office  Preferred Lender Lists  Most colleges maintain preferred lender lists and encourage students to borrow from the list  While some colleges use a rigorous process to ensure that these preferred lenders offer the best loan terms and conditions to students  others dont  and many preferred lender lists dont clearly state why the lenders has earned preferred status  Some preferred lender lists dont offer a real choice of lenders at all  because all the names on the list are subsidiaries of the same big lender
