         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  DC  Today Rep  Henry A  Waxman and Sen  Edward M  Kennedy released a GAO report which finds that U S  trade policy under the Bush Administration has paid little to no attention to public health and access to medicines  This represents a lack of commitment to the Doha Declaration  which affirms the right of World Trade Organization  WTO  members to promote access to medicines for all     Regrettably  the U S  trade strategy has prioritized patents over public health  said Rep  Waxman  The Democratic leadership in Congress has pushed the White House to make significant changes in the Peru and other recent free trade agreements  I support these important first steps to achieve a more balanced policy  But as todays report demonstrates  we have a long way to go in improving the public health aspects of U S  trade policy as a whole     The Bush Administration must stop putting the financial interest of the pharmaceutical industry ahead of the needs of the poor and sick in developing countries  said Sen  Kennedy      The GAO report  Intellectual property  U S  Trade Policy Guidance on WTO Declaration on Access to Medicines May Need Clarification  assesses how the office of the U S  Trade Representative  U S T R    along with other agencies  has interpreted and implemented the 2002 Trade Promotion Authority  TPA  Act  which affirmed the United States commitment to the Doha Declaration  The report indicates that until the current congressional leadership negotiated public health modifications to pending free trade agreements  U S T R  made virtually no changes in its trade strategy to advance the goals of the Doha Declaration  It further finds that the Bush Administration entered into a series of free trade negotiations with developing countries demanding provisions that threaten the ability of our trade partners to take necessary public health measures  These provisions  found in CAFTA and other FTAs already in effect  could significantly delay the availability of lower cost generic medicines  As GAO notes  unaffordable prices are among the primary challenges in expanding access to medicine globally      The 1994 WTO agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property  TRIPS  set down minimum standards for intellectual property regulation across multiple sectors  In 2001  the WTO sought to clarify the scope of TRIPS with regard to public health with the Doha Declaration  Adopted by 141 countries  including the U S   the Doha Declaration states that TRIPS can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Members rights to protect public health and  in particular  to promote access to medicines for all  When Congress passed the 2002 Trade Promotion Authority  TPA  Act  it included an amendment offered by Sen  Kennedy directing the Administration to respect the Doha Declaration as a principal negotiating objective in the area of intellectual property     The key findings in the new GAO report include      U S T R  has only modified two intellectual property demands in trade negotiations  GAO found that in negotiating free trade agreements  the U S  has demanded that our trading partners adopt more extensive intellectual property protections than required under TRIPS  Many public health groups and experts have said that these provisions conflict with the Doha Declarations affirmation that TRIPS can and should be implemented in the way that best serves public health  Until the recent improvements urged by Congress  the Administration had made only two limited changes to conform to the Doha Declaration            The complete GAO report is available online at www oversight house gov and www kennedy senate gov       Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
