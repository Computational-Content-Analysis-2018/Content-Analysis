         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I m delighted join my colleague  Senator Bayh  in sponsoring this amendment  which increases funding for the procurement of Humvees for the Army     The Senate is currently debating an appropriations bill that would provide  81 billion  primarily for our ongoing war effort in Iraq  This funding will bring the total U S  bill for the war in Iraq to  192 billion and still counting     All of us support our troops  We obviously want to do all we can to see that they have proper equipment  vehicles  and everything else they need to protect their lives and carry out their missions  It s scandalous that the Administration has kept sending them into battle in Iraq without proper equipment     No soldier should be sent into battle unprotected  but that is exactly what happened in Iraq  As recently as last December 2004  soldiers were still digging through landfills to find metal plating to attach to their vehicles for protection  Their hillbilly armor  they call it  It has also been well documented that parents went in desperation to the local Wal Mart to buy armored plates and mail them to their sons and daughters serving in Iraq  That is totally incomprehensible for our soldiers    More than 400 troops have already died in military vehicles vulnerable to roadside bombs  grenades  and other so called improvised explosive devices    Our amendment will provide an additional  460 million to buy Up Armored Humvees and Add On Armor kits for Humvees for the Army  As we all know  the Humvee is a highly mobile  four wheel drive vehicle  The Up Armored Humvee is a version with bullet resistant windows and steel plate armor on the doors and underside to protect against rifle rounds and explosive blasts  It has additional armor for the turret gunner on the roof to protect against artillery  and a powerful air conditioning system     Add on armor kits are mounted on existing Humvees to give almost as much protection      According to a Philadelphia Inquirer article two weeks ago  the Army says all of its 35 000 vehicles in Iraq now have some sort of armor  But a third of them are protected with nothing more than crudely cut sheets of steel  which are inadequate by the Army s own standards  according to figures released Friday    The largest threats for vehicles are improvised explosive devices  rocket propelled grenades  small arms rifle fire and land mines  Humvees and other military vehicles have become the target of choice for insurgents  Shrapnel from a roadside bomb  or even a simple AK 47 rifle round  can slice through an unprotected Humvee   some of them have little more than vinyl fabric for their roofs and doors  Our troops in unprotected Humvees in Iraq would be safer riding in SUVs    According to the Center for Army Lessons Learned  the harm to both personnel and equipment from improvised explosive devices is greatly reduced when traveling in an up armored Humvee     It s taken far too long to solve this problem  We have to make sure we solve it now  once and for all  We can t keep throwing money at it and hope it goes away    The delay in correcting the problem has cost the lives of many brave young men and women  killed in combat because they were in an un armored vehicle     On July 20  2003  Sgt  Justin Garvey  a Massachusetts casualty  was with the 101st Airborne division and was killed in Mosul when his unarmored Humvee was hit by a rocket propelled grenade while on patrol    Just a few months later  on September 1  2003  Staff Sgt  Joseph Camara and Sgt  Charles Caldwell  Massachusetts natives with the Rhode Island National Guard were killed north of Baghdad when their unarmored Humvee struck a mine    On October 18  2003  PFC John Hart of Bedford  Massachusetts  was killed in Taza in Iraq  when his unarmored Humvee was hit by a rocket propelled grenade  I attended his burial at Arlington National Cemetery on November 4  2003    Just last week  a Kentucky National Guard soldier died when shrapnel came through the window of his vehicle  A comrade says James A  Sherrill  27  could have been saved if antiballistic glass had been installed    The saddest part of this story is that the Army could have  and should have  moved much more quickly to correct the problem  As retired General Paul Kern  who headed the Army Materiel Command until last November  said   It took too long to materialize  He said  In retrospect  if I had it to do all over  I would have just started building up armored Humvees  The most efficient way would have been to build a single production line and feed everything into it    In a letter to me  dated October 20  2003  General Abizaid  CENTCOM Commander  said  The FY 2004 Supplemental Request will permit the services to rapidly resolve many of the equipment issues you mentioned to include the procurement of     Humvees    In February 2004  General Schoomaker  Chief of Staff of the Army  testified at an Armed Services Committee hearing that the army never intended to up armor every Humvee    never until this kind of situation that we have today We have taken armored units  artillery units  all kinds of other units and put them into Humvees as motorized formations  which never existed before  And so this is an area where you cannot fix it overnight     On December 8  2004  during a town hall meeting with U S  Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld in Kuwait  a young soldier alerted the American public to the issue of armor shortages when he asked    Why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to up armor our vehicles and why don t we have those resources readily available to us    After applause from the troops  Rumsfeld replied    It s essentially a matter of physics  It isn t a matter of money  It isn t a matter on the part of the Army of desire  It s a matter of production and capability of doing it  As you know  you go to war with the army you have  not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time    He later remarked in the same town hall meeting  You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can be blown up  And you can have an up armored Humvee and it can be blown up    We have been told for months that the shortage of Up Armored Humvees was a thing of the past and that the Army has enough to ensure that every Humvee that left a protected base in Iraq would be an Up armored Humvee or a Humvee with an add on kit     Just this month  the GAO released a report that clearly identifies the struggles the Army has faced  In August 2003  only fifty one Up Armored Humvees were being produced a month  It took the industrial base a year and a half to work up to making 400 a month  Now the Army says they can now get delivery of 550 a month  The question is  why did it take so long  Why did we go to war without the proper equipment  We can t let this happen again     It s obvious that the Department has no solution to protect our troops  Secretary of the Army Brownlee told the Armed Services Committee in October 2003 that with the up armored Humvee  it is more of a challenge  If we go strictly with that up armored Humvee  it could be as late as the summer of  05 before we would have them all  Since it is now Spring  05  it looks like he was right    According to the GAO report  there are two primary causes for the shortage of up armored vehicles and add on armor kits  First  a decision was made to ramp up production gradually rather than use the maximum available capacity  Second  funding allocations did not keep up with rapidly increasing requirements  Obviously  the Pentagon was still being influenced by its cakewalk mentality    The GAO report specifically states that Pentagon decision makers set the rate at which both up armored Humvees and armor kits would be produced  and did not tell Congress about the total available production capacity  GAO was unable to determine what criteria were used to set the pace of production  In both cases  additional production capacity was available  particularly for the kits     The funding issue was part of the problem  Funds were available to support the planned pace of production of up armored Humvees  but GAO found that four program managers were not aware of the time frame for releasing funds  Although the Army received over  1 4 billion between fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to produce 7 502 vehicles  it was not released in a timely and predictable manner  In August 2003  the managers received requirements for 1 407 vehicles  but had received funding to produce less than half of that number     By October 2003  program managers had a requirement to produce 3 279 vehicles  but once again received funding to produce less than half of that  Significant differences continued until April 2004  when requirements reached 4 454 vehicles and the program managers received funding to produce 4 320 vehicles    The major short term solution to the up armored Humvee funding issue has been the additional funds from Congressional increases  Parents and spouses of fallen service members contacted members of Congress to demand attention to the problem     For fiscal years 2003 and 2004  the Army received over  1 4 billion to produce 7 502 up armored Humvees to meet worldwide requirements  including 8 105 vehicles required for CENTCOM s area of operation    In fiscal year 2004  the Army received more than a billion dollars to produce up armored Humvees  Compared to the Bush Administration s budget request for a paltry  51 Million  the parents and spouses had made an enormous impact  To meet continuing needs for force protection  Congress recommended  865 million in the 2005 appropriations bill to be used by the Army for armor for additional Humvees and other vehicles  As part of the Rapid Response Force Protection Initiative  Congress intends the funds to be used for a variety of vehicles to respond rapidly to the threat of improvised explosive devices and mortar attacks against our forces     These are short term fixes  Amazingly  the GAO found that Army officials have still not made long term efforts to improve the availability of up armored Humvees or add on armor kits     We need to get ahead of this problem  The requirements for uparmored Humvees keep changing  By August 2003  commanders wanted more armored Humvees  The goal went to 1 200  then 1 400  Because those requests were relatively modest  the Army chose to simply bring armored Humvees from bases around the world instead of stepping up the production line  The total amount has grown substantially since then  A year ago  the total request was just over 8 000  On Friday  the Army pushed the total past 10 000    almost ten times the original number requested less than two years ago     Gary J  Motsek  director of support operations for the Army Materiel Command in Fort Belvoir  Va   said I m going to get in trouble  but the real challenge is  there had always been an assumption  quite frankly  that the requirements would continue to tail off  Obviously since we are still losing an average of more than one soldier a day since the Iraqi elections in January  those assumptions are clearly wrong    It s a tragedy that our soldiers are still paying the price for this delay  In 2003  when it came time to mass produce up armored Humvees  the Army had only a single source to turn to  It had little interest in this work before Iraq  and did not shop for others  Pentagon acquisition chief Michael Wynne testified to Congress a year ago  It s a sad story to report to you  but had we known then what we know now  we would probably have gotten another source involved  Every day  our soldiers are killed or wounded in Iraq by IEDs  RPGs  small arms fire  Too many of these attacks are on Humvees that are not up armored  We are directing that all measures to provide protection to our soldiers be placed on a top priority  most highly urgent  24 7 basis    But 24 7 didn t happen even then until January this year  the plant had capacity that the Army never consistently used  as the plant s general manager has said    In November 2003  I asked Secretary Brownlee about armor delays  noting that three Massachusetts soldiers had died in unarmored Humvees  Are they running their plant 24 hours    Secretary Brownlee said the plant in Ohio was running at maximum capacity    But it wasn t  Army documents show that monthly armor production at the plant fell after that   from about 55 to 45 Humvees a month  in December 2003    The plant took its usual week off at Christmas and the armoring plant took two four day weekends  Owners say they could have built more    if the Army had ordered more    In early 2004  members of Congress toured the plant and found that its ballistic glass operation was operating on just one shift    Now we have an opportunity to end this frustration once and for all  Our soldiers in Iraq deserve the very best and it is our job to make sure the Department of Defense is finally getting it right  Too many soldiers have died because of these needless delays  but hopefully  this will be solved by what we do in this bill today    The Bayh Kennedy amendment contributes significantly to this goal  and I urge my colleagues to support it    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
