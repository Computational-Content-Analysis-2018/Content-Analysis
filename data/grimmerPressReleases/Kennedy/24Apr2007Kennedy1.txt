         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   I welcome our witnesses to this hearing on modernizing middle and high schools we prepare to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act   The Act sets lofty goals for all schools to meet  and requires states to establish strong standards  a rigorous curriculum  and reliable assessments   Its helped schools make significant progress in closing achievement gaps and helping students learn     One of our principal priorities in the reauthorization is to ensure that the Act is working for all students at every grade level in elementary school  middle school and high school      Recent surveys demonstrate that we still have much to do in secondary schools   Only 30 percent of 8th grade students scored proficient or better in 2005 on math assessment and reading assessment  In 12th grade  less than a quarter of students scored proficient or better on the math assessment  and only 35 percent were proficient or better on the reading assessment   Its clear that secondary school students need as much attention and help in these essential courses as students in lower grades do     We also need to do more to assist students in the transition from middle school to high school and help them graduate   About 1 000 high schools across the country only graduate half their students  and only about 70 percent of high school students graduate on time   Among African Americans and Latinos  only 55 percent graduate on time   Its clear that high schools need more assistance in supporting and retaining students Federal investment at the middle and high school level is not sufficient   The main source of federal funds is through the Title I program  Yet  only 8 percent of students who benefit from these funds are in high school  90 percent of high schools with very low graduation rates have many low income students  But only a quarter of these schools receive Title I funds  We need to dedicate more resources and support for secondary schools to improve academic achievement and ensure that every student has a fair opportunity to graduate      States and cities across the country are already taking steps to address these challenges  such as offering extra help during the school day  extending learning time  and other school based interventions   To improve Bostons high schools  the district worked with private partners to create smaller learning communities  improve instruction  and strengthen professional development      Boston high school programs now focus on business  technology  health professions  arts  public service  engineering  sciences  international studies  and social justice  Through many of these programs  students can enroll in courses for college credit or get hands on experience in a field that interests them  We know that proven strategies and interventions will help students make progress  stay in school and succeed  Research conducted by one of our panelists  Dr  Robert Balfanz shows that we can identify students who are most at risk for not completing high school as early as sixth grade  Early intervention  quality teachers  small classes  and data driven instruction will strengthen schools and help keep students engaged     We also know that better alignment of standards and curricula between middle school and high school can ease the transition for many students   High school students also have to be prepared to meet the expectations of college and the workplace  We need to promote models that allow students to pursue college level work as soon as possible  such as dual enrollment  early college high schools  International Baccalaureate  and Advanced Placement programs  each of which can make a difference in students skill levels and future opportunities  To do all this  we cant remain bound to the schoolhouse model of past decades  We need to bring our middle and high schools into the 21st century        So  I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about the successful programs theyre implementing     I turn now to my good friend from Wyoming  Senator Enzi so he can make his opening remarks      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
