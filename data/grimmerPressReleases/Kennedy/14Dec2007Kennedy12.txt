         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I rise to express my deep disappointment that the Congress is taking up the Conference Report on the Defense bill without the hate crimes provision  I commend Chairman Levin for his strong leadership in our efforts to have it included as part of this measure  Despite his efforts  and the strong support of Majority Leader Harry Reid  its an extraordinary missed opportunity that we are not able to send the hate crimes bill to the President before the end of the year      The inclusion of the hate crimes provision in the Defense bill was appropriate  Our military stands for America s ideals and fights for America s ideals  At a time when our ideals are under attack by terrorists in other lands  it is more important than ever to demonstrate that we practice what we preach  and that we are doing all we can to root out the bigotry and prejudice in our own country that leads to similar violence here at home      In Iraq and Afghanistan  our soldiers are fighting for freedom and liberty  they are on the front line fighting against evil and hate  Were united in our effort to root out the cells of hatred around the world  We should not turn a blind eye to acts of hatred and terrorism here at home  We should not shrink now from our role as the beacon of liberty to the rest of the world      If America is to live up to its founding ideals of liberty and justice for all  combating hate crimes must be a national priority      The hate crimes bill would have advanced those values and goals  and we re committed to getting it enacted  It s long past time for this measure to become law      We are now facing a time when the FBI reports that hate crimes are on the rise  and theres been a sharp increase in the number of hate crimes reported against Hispanics  and are at the highest levels since the reports were first mandated by the Hate Crimes Statistics Act  demonstrating the real societal impact of anti immigrant campaigns     The Southern Poverty Law Center also reports that hate groups are on the rise  Since September of this year  when thousands of Americans marched for civil rights in Jena  Louisiana  thereve been more than 50 noose incidents across the country  Just a few weeks ago  the New York Times included a chart reflecting the Geography of Hate across America   over the last two years  it shows that nooses have been sighted in many different states      This terrifying symbol of racism and prejudice has even appeared recently on schoolyards and college campuses  creating fear in their whole communities  Apparently  we have not succeeded in adequately teaching the lessons of Americas long history of discrimination  Education is an important part of prevention  but we also need strong national legislation to punish those who engage in hate motivated violence and to expand federal resources available to investigate and prevent these vicious crimes      As my colleagues here in the Senate know  Senator Gordon Smith and I have been fighting this battle for a long time  Just a few months ago  the hate crimes provision was adopted by the Senate with a vote of 60 39 as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill  Its not the first time that the Senate voted to pass this bill  In 2000 and 2002  a majority of Senators voted to pass this legislation      In 2004  we had 65 votes for the bill and it was adopted as part of the Defense Authorization Bill  But  that time  like this time   it was stripped out in conference  Twice in the last two years  Chairman Conyers has succeeded in getting the House to vote to pass this legislation  but  once again  the House and Senate have not come together to get this bill done      Weve been in this battle for nearly a decade  and well continue to press ahead  Its long past time to stand up for the victims of these senseless acts of violence  victims like Matthew Shepard  for whom this bill is named  and who died a horrible death in 1998 at the hands of two men who singled him out because of his sexual orientation  Nine years after Matthews death  nine years  we still havent gotten it done  How long are we going to wait      This year  with Matthew Shepards mother Judy at our side  we were filled with hope that finally this would be the year that we would get this bill to the Presidents desk  A broad and growing coalition of 210 law enforcement  civic  disability  religious and civil rights groups support the bill  including the International Association of Chiefs of Police  the Anti Defamation League  the Interfaith Alliance  the National Sheriffs Association  the Human Rights Campaign  the National District Attorneys Association and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights      Over 1 400  1  400  clergy from a broad spectrum of religious traditions from across the country have come together to support the Matthew Shepard Act  These leaders of Americas religious communities have called on Congress to stand united against one of the worst forms of oppression  violence based on personal characteristics and identity  Together  we must work together to create a society in which diverse people are safe as well as free      Well continue to fight to protect the rights of our fellow citizens  and not let a veto threat stop us from doing the right thing  Were not giving up  and well continue to push to get the bill through the Congress next year  I remain hopeful that the President will hear our call and that he too will finally support this much needed measure     Hate crimes are an appalling form of domestic terrorism that cannot and must not be tolerated anywhere in our country  Weve made progress over the years  and our focus now should be to strengthen protections for hate crimes so that all Americans will be protected under the law  No Americans should feel that they are second class citizens because Congress refuses to protect them against hate crimes
