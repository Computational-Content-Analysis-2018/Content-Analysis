         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    This is  a defining moment for our country   The American people are watching   The world  is watching    The issue is clear   Will we stand with our soldiers by changing  their mission and beginning to bring them home   Or will we stand with the  President and keep our soldiers trapped in Iraqs civil war  History  will judge us   We can either continue down the Presidents perilous path  or  insist on a new direction   If we dont change course  we know what lies ahead   more American casualties  more wounded  and more destruction    A new  strategy that makes Iraqis less reliant on our military is the best way  forward  More of the same misguided policy will result in more of the  same tragedy for our military   Lets try a new course  and lets try it now   because Iraq is the overarching issue of our time and because we need to protect  our national security   We are told we need to be patient  We  are told we have to give the latest escalation a chance to succeed  But  weve heard all that before  Weve heard for years that this  administration has a plan for success  Weve heard for years that  progress is just a few months away  Weve heard for years that weve  turned the corner  But the plans for success keep getting tossed aside  for new plans   The Administration has benchmarks to measure success   but there are no consequences when the benchmarks are not met    The  timelines for progress keep getting extended  Weve turned so many corners  that weve ended up back where we started  trying to control Baghdad     Its time to change direction   Too many parents have had to bury  their sons and daughters  Too many children have been left without their  father or their mother  Too many soldiers are missing arms  or  legs  Nearly 3200 of our forces have been killed  and more than 24 000  have been wounded  The casualties keep mounting   The violence in Iraq  continues to spiral as well  Our troops are in the impossible position of trying  to stabilize a country at war with itself   The recent National  Intelligence Estimate confirms the nightmare scenario unfolding for our troops   Iraq is sliding deeper into the abyss of civil war  and our brave men and women  are caught in the middle of it  Prospects for halting the sectarian violence are  bleak  Greater chaos and anarchy are looming ahead  Needless additional U S   causalities are inevitable   The intelligence community has finally  determined what everyone but the Bush Administration has been willingly to admit  for some time   As the intelligence Estimate stated  the term civil war  accurately describes key elements of the Iraqi conflict  including the hardening  of ethno sectarian identities  a sea change in the character of the violence   ethno sectarian mobilization  and population displacements    Those are  the words of the intelligence community  Secretary Powell agrees   Former UN  Secretary General Kofi Annan agrees   Only President Bush continues to  stubbornly deny that our troops are policing a civil war   The facts  speak for themselves   According to the United Nations  nearly 35 000 civilians  were violently killed in Iraq last year  In November and December of  last year  more than 6000 civilians were violently killed   Most were killed in  Baghdad  where unidentified bodies killed execution style are found in large  numbers daily  More than 2 million refugees have fled the violence in  Iraq  and another 1 8 million have been displaced internally Our military  should not be caught in the middle of this quagmire   Only a political solution  can solve Iraqs problems     General Casey  in his June 2005 testimony  to the Senate Armed Services Committee  called out for a political solution   He  said  If you look back historically at how insurgencies have been defeated   they have been defeated when the insurgents saw their options as better  protected in the political process and their prospects for economic advancement  can be better protected by the political process than fighting for them   And  thats the essential element here     Last August  General  Abizaid spoke about the need for a political solution   He said  Our troops are  the best equipped  the best trained  the best led in the world   And I am  enormously proud of them  and I have the utmost confidence in their ability to  handle any mission   Yet  sectarian violence is worse than ever in Baghdad in  particular   And I wonder about the validity of a strategy that says that less  capable troops that are not as well equipped  trained and led as the best troops  in the world can handle the security of this country if the upswing in violence  has occurred despite the presence of the best troops in the world   It doesnt  give me a lot of confidence in our underlying strategy   And it suggests to me  that what we need is a political rather than a military solution   Last  week General Petraeus  the new Commander of our forces in Iraq  stated that  there is no military solution in Iraq   But no one in the Administration has  been able to clearly articulate a political solution or how it can take hold in  the midst of this chaos  Instead of giving the Iraqis a necessary  incentive to get their political house in order by beginning an orderly  redeployment of our troops out of Iraq  the President stubbornly insists on  sending more and more American troops into Iraqs civil war  Escalation didnt  work in Vietnam and it wont work in Iraq either  The Presidents latest  proposal  to increase the number of our troops in Iraq makes no sense at all    Sending more American troops into the cauldron of Iraqs civil war is not the  solution   In addition to the fact that we know a military solution is not  the answer  the administration still has not leveled with us on the number of  troops the President plans to send to Iraq for the surge  On January  10th  President Bush announced that hed committed more than 20 000 additional  troops to Iraq   Within a few days  this number had been revised to  21 500  The CBO estimated that it would be far higher  as much as  35 000 to 48 000 troops when support troops are  included     On February 6th  I asked General Pace and  Secretary Gates for the best military estimate as to the actual size of the  escalation   Their answer was an additional 10 to 15 percent   General Pace  said  you re going to need no more than another 2 000  2 500 troops on the  ground  By February 15th  the number had more than doubled     General  Schoomaker told the Armed Services Committee his estimate was somewhere between  5 000 and 6 000 troops when he included imbedded trainers  Then  on  March 6th Deputy Secretary of Defense  Gordon England  told a House Committee  about 4 000  maybe as many as 7 000    Last week  at the request of  General Petraeus  Secretary Gates authorized an additional 2 200 Military Police  troops    We still dont have an accurate total for the size of this  escalation  The Administration refuses to speak with clarity and candor     Since the current surge began  Shiite militias in Baghdad may be lying  low  but violence has increased elsewhere in Iraq      In Diyala  province  in just three months  American casualties have exceeded the number for  the entire year of 2006  In January this year  83 American soldiers were  killed  compared to 62 in the same month a year ago  80 more American  soldiers were killed in February this year   In the same month last year  we  lost 55 soldiers  Already  in just two weeks this March  we have lost  more than 31 soldiers  the same number killed in the entire month of March in  2006     Continuing our open ended commitment to stay in Iraq will not  bring victory   It will not stop the violence  and it will not protect our  national security      The Administration has outlined military   economic  and political benchmarks to measure success  But it has not given any  timeline to achieve them  and it has not stated any consequences if the  benchmarks are not met  This same Administration supported timelines for  every Iraqi election and for drafting the constitution    Yet  it remains  emphatically opposed to any timeline for the redeployment of our military      The American people have been patient   But America has now been in  Iraq longer than it took us to win World War II  Instead of progress  we  continue to see unacceptably high levels of violence  death  and  destruction  We are putting too much strain on our Army  especially the  Army National Guard   The Army is overextended   Many soldiers are now on their  3rd rotation  To deal with recruitment shortages  weve eased the standards and  increased the bonuses   The Department of Defense is formalizing a policy to  deploy reservists more often and for longer   But in the long run  we cant  protect our Army if we dont end the war  Our troops have done their  part   They have served with great courage   Were proud of their service  and  were ready to welcome them home  Its time to change course its time  to ask the Iraqis step up to the plate and take responsibility for their own  future  Its time to and begin to redeploy our troops out of Iraq  It is time  to put the Iraqis on notice that our military will no longer be a permanent  crutch for them to lean on   As General Abizaid told the Armed Services  Committee last November  I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis  from doing more  from taking more responsibility for their own  future  Its time for American combat troops to begin to come  home  Those of us who opposed the war are used to the Administrations  attacks when we disagree with their wrongheaded policy   We have come to expect  that   They have questioned our patriotism and called us defeatists    When we challenged the Presidents misguided policy  they accused us of  having political motives and being partisan  Before the war  Vice  President Cheney said we hadnt seen all the intelligence they had seen  But  after the war  when things were going badly  the President said more than 100  times that we had seen the same intelligence  More than two years ago  I  called on the Administration to focus on training the Iraqi Security Forces and  begin to redeploy our troops out of Iraq   I said the Iraqis need to take  responsibility  and that we should set a goal of about a year for the  redeployment of most of our forces out of Iraq     Rather than debating  the merits of the policy  the Republican spin machine went into over drive    A year ago  on the third anniversary of the war  Vice President Cheney  went on national television and said  I would not look to Ted Kennedy for  guidance and leadership on how we ought to manage national  security  Well  the American people certainly know that we cannot look  to the Vice President and this Administration about national security     The Administration has been consistently wrong about the war in  Iraq  Year after year  they insist on a dangerously incompetent  strategy  They were wrong about the link between Al Qaeda and Saddam  Hussein  They were wrong about Saddam Husseins weapons of mass  destruction  They were wrong about America being greeted as  liberators  They were wrong about the insurgency being in its last  throes  And they are wrong to deny that Iraq is in a civil war The  American people are far ahead of the Administration  For all of us who  oppose this misguided war  our goals have always been clear   to protect the  lives of our soldiers and to protect our national security  We have an  obligation to stand up for our troops and stand up to our President when he  stubbornly refuses to change course in Iraq            Our legislation will do just that   It  will change the mission of our military away from combat and require the  President to begin to redeploy American combat troops out of Iraq in four  months    The target date for the completion of the redeployment is March 2008   one year from now   A limited number of troops would remain in Iraq after that   to train and equip the Iraqi Security Forces  to conduct counter terrorism  operations  and to guarantee the safety of our soldiers              Our proposal is consistent with  the bipartisan Iraq Study Groups findings   It recommended that   The primary  mission of U S  forces in Iraq should evolve to one of supporting the Iraqi  army  which would take over primary responsibility for combat operations  By the  first quarter of 2008  subject to unexpected developments in the security  situation on the ground  all combat brigades not necessary for force protection  could be out of Iraq    Those are the words of the Iraq Study Group    Legislation is clearly necessary to give the Iraqi Government enough of  an incentive to step up to the plate  work out its political differences  and  take responsibility for Iraqs future   It is also consistent with  the wishes of the American people  who want most of our troops home within a  year    How much clearer does it have to be before Republicans in Congress and  the President finally respond to the voices of the American people  We  are meeting our responsibilities by changing the mission of our military  We are  not micromanaging the war   Many of us oppose the war  but all of us  support our troops   We dont want to keep sending more and more of them into  the middle of a civil war   Under no circumstances do we want them to go to war  without proper armor and equipment    Our troops deserve better   Their families  and loved ones deserve better     For the good of our men and women in  uniform in Iraq and the American people  its time for us to take a stand  We  need to adopt a new strategy    We need to make clear to the Iraqi Government  that the mission of our troops must change and that we have a clear timeframe  for their departure from Iraq  The recent hearings on Walter Reed should  inform our debate here as well  They tell us how little faith we can put  in this administration  The very people who hide behind the troops when  we question their policies have failed to keep faith with our wounded  soldiers  But just as importantly  the hearings on Walter Reed remind  all of us of the human costs of the war   This administration has done  all it can to conceal them from us    They have forbidden photographs of  the coffins flown back from Iraq    The President has avoided attending  the funerals of the fallen   The tours of Walter Reed never included  Building 18       But the hearings on Walter Reed swept away  all the spin and camouflage  they put our wounded soldiers back where they  belong  at the heart of our debates about the war  At the end of those  hearings  everyone agreed that the Administration failed these brave soldiers    But we failed them long before they arrived at Walter Reed   The  administration failed them when it trumped up the intelligence in order to make  a case for war   It failed them when it sent too few troops with too little  armor into battle       And we in the Senate will fail  them today unless we vote to change course and begin to bring our soldiers home    At the end of this debate  the American people will know where each of us  stands   On our side of the aisle  we stand with the American people   The  voters told us in November to change course and begin to bring our troops home   and thats what were going to do  We stand for our constitution  in  which the Congress speaks for the people in matters of war and peace  and can  require the President to listen    We stand with our troops   We and we  alone are the ones insisting on a policy worthy of their courage and  sacrifice   We stand for protecting Americas national security     The war in Iraq has been a disaster from the start  It has made America more  hated in the world  It has made it harder to win the war against terrorism  It  has made it harder to work with other nations on every issue  Peace and  progress in Iraq must be earned by Iraqis and their neighbors  We must  no longer send our brave soldiers to an uncertain fate on the streets of  Baghdad    We must begin to bring them home  to the heros welcome they  have surely earned                                                                                  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202 224 2633
