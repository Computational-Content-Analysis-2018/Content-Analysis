         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Boston  MA Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy was at Northeastern University to deliver a major address on his plan to reinvest in America s competitiveness and turn around damaging impact of the global economy  He was joined by President Richard Freeland  business leaders  students and educators to share his ideas of how to this country back on track     Kennedy argues that our nation is at a crossroads  we can continue to be buffeted by the harsh winds of the global economy or we can think anew  and guide the currents of globalization with a new progressive vision that strengthens America and equips our citizens to move competitively to the future  He believes that we cannot advance forward by continuing down the same path of the last five years that put special interests over America s interests by cutting back on investments in education  invention  and innovation  as the Administration has done     He said  The 20th century was widely hailed as the American century is up for grabs  No nation is guaranteed a future of lasting prosperity  We have to work for it  We have to sacrifice for it  We must open new doors and new avenues for all Americans to make the most of their God given talents and rekindle the fires of innovation in society  By doing so  we can turn this era of globalization into a new era of opportunity for America    Senator Kennedy proposed a plan to move the country forward and to restore America s advantage in the workforce  education  health care and research and development  As he outlined it he said  The essence of the American Dream is the ability to provide a better life for yourself and your family  At its very heart are a good job  first class education  good health care  and a secure retirement  Some say the dream is out of reach in today s global economy  But I m here today to tell you it doesn t have to be that way  We can revitalize the American Dream     Senator Kennedy s bill  the Right TRACK Act  The Right Time to Reinvest in America s Competitiveness  seeks to    1  Create high quality jobs    2       Educate Americans to fill the jobs of the future    3       Preserve good jobs in the US    4     Level the Playing field for US workers and businesses abroad    5     Help those harmed by globalization  workers and communities    6      Modernize U S  Labor and Employment Laws    Senator Kennedy s remarks at Northeastern University are attached  as well as a summary of the bill and fact sheets that illustrate the impact of globalization in both a national and Massachusetts    THE RIGHT TRACK FOR THE ECONOMY Senator Edward Kennedy   The strength of the American economy has always been the innovative spirit of the American people  Innovation creates jobs and moves the economy forward  The U S  has led the way in information technology  high tech manufacturing and the physical and life sciences  And because of it we ve had the best paying jobs and our workers have enjoyed a higher standard of living than any other country  These technologies and economic growth have brought with them greater demands on our basic infrastructure and demand for new types of infrastructure     Today our global economic leadership is being challenged by fast growing countries that are pushing themselves to innovate  Countries like China  Japan  Ireland  and South Korea are increasingly recognizing the immense potential for economic growth from basic research  China alone has doubled its investment in RD as a percentage of its GDP  But the U S  has only increased it by a third  We are also the only major industrial nation without a national broadband policy and developing countries like India are vastly expanding their networks  Expanding access to high speed broadband could add billions of dollars and millions of jobs to the U S  economy by helping to facilitate growth in areas like health IT     To help America embrace the competitive challenge we face  we must invest in promising new technologies and high growth industries that will lead to the jobs of the future  The Right TRACK Act     Increases Investment in Research and Development Across Sectors and Disciplines   Makes the RD Tax Credit permanent and expands it to encourage small businesses  universities and federal laboratories to collaborate on research   Increases RD funding for the NIH  NSF  NASA  the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense by 10  each year   Creates a Presidential Advisory Committee on Research and Development and an inter agency workgroup to identify and support collaborative biomedical research    Massachusetts receives almost 5  of total Federal RD spending  Total federal RD expenditures per capita are higher than any other leading technology state  Massachusetts also has the highest private RD expenditure  In 2003  Massachusetts Colleges and Universities alone spent  1 8 billion on RD   Invests in High Job Growth  High Technology Industries   Creates a tax credit for investing in nanotechnology based businesses and establishes a Business Incubator Program to facilitate collaboration between business and academia to move nanotechnology research out of the lab and into the marketplace   Increases funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Advance Technology Program at the Department of Commerce   Encourages energy efficiency and development of alternative energy sources   Creates a tax credit for construction of vaccine manufacturing facilities   Requires healthcare providers to establish a system to allow patients and doctors to community over the internet o Massachusetts is ranked number one of all US States in its ability to create jobs and attract investment through nanotechnology    Massachusetts nanotech firms attracted more than  120 million in venture capital  In 2004  the Manufacturing Extension Partnership in Massachusetts created or saved 2 349 jobs and contributed  196 million to the GSP  In Massachusetts  jobs in health IT grew 21  from 2001 2004    Supports the Infrastructure Our Economy Needs   Creates a national broadband policy with specific goals for improving and expanding broadband access by 2010 by the end of 2006    Authorizes funds for operating grants  capital improvements and long term debt repayment for Amtrak   Expands and increases tax credits for school bonds to leverage a  25 billion investment in repair  renovation  and construction of elementary and secondary schools equipped with 21st century technology   Massachusetts has the highest penetration of broadband in the country   18 subscribers 100 residents  Amtrak ridership is greatest in the Northeast and Massachusetts is 5th in passenger boardings     THE RIGHT TRACK FOR EDUCATION Senator Edward Kennedy   Spurred into action by launch of Sputnik  Congress passed the National Defense Education Act  NDEA  in 1958  The law declared a national educational emergency and led to the doubling of the federal education budget in four years  The programs authorized under the Act helped the United States to improve rapidly in math  science  engineering  technology  and critical foreign languages and led to our dominance in the arms race and global economy    Today  our nation once again faces an international education challenge in education  The United States ranks ninth in the world in the number of 25 34 year olds with high school diplomas  Third in the world in 1975  America now ranks 15th in the production of new scientists and engineers  These trends pose a threat to our national and economic security  To help America meet the global challenge  we must invest in every individual by ensuring access to the highest quality educational opportunities  The Right TRACK Act includes a New NDEA that     Modernizes America s Education System     Helps states increase academic rigor to meet national and international benchmarks and prepare students to succeed in college  the 21st century workforce  or the Armed Services    Massachusetts students are first or tied for first in the nation in reading and math in both 4th and 8th grades  But there is work to do  Massachusetts ranks 47th in the nation in the percentage of low income 4th graders scoring proficient in reading    Invests in attracting high quality math  science  and critical need foreign language teachers to high need schools through scholarships  loan forgiveness  tax incentives  grants for innovative postsecondary programs  and invests in NSF teacher training programs    University of Massachusetts Boston was recently awarded a  500 000 NSF grant to increase the number of qualified science  technology  engineering  and mathematics graduates who are also qualified to teach    Ensures cost is not a barrier to college for any student by creating state based Contract for Educational Opportunity grants to cover students  unmet need    Massachusetts is first in the nation in the percentage of high school graduates enrolling in and graduating from college  but it is becoming increasingly difficult for families to afford their children s education  In Massachusetts  31  of the average family income is required to pay for annual expenses at a 4 year public university    after accounting for financial aid     Arms Americans with 21st Century Knowledge and Skills     Makes college and graduate school tuition free for low  or moderate income individuals who study science  math  engineering  technology  or a critical need language  doubles funding for NSF education programs  and invests in math  science  engineering and technology textbooks and laboratories for high need schools    In 2004  only 19  of Massachusetts students who took the SAT expressed interest in studying science  math  technology or engineering    Improves global knowledge and skills through significant investment in programs to increase the study and mastery of critical need foreign languages and international cultures from the early grades through graduate school    73 schools in Massachusetts have expressed interest in the Chinese Language and Culture AP class    Augments existing formula funds for job training with competitive grants to support innovative strategies to meet emerging labor market needs    There are now 72 800 job vacancies in Massachusetts  Last year  for the first time ever  there were more vacant jobs requiring higher education than there were jobs requiring just a high school diploma or job training  Yet Massachusetts ranks 49th in the nation in terms of investment in higher education    THE RIGHT TRACK FOR AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND WORKERS Senator Edward Kennedy   One of the fundamental challenges of the global economy is that American companies are losing business  and American workers are losing jobs  because we re not competing on a level playing field     American companies are struggling because many foreign governments don t play by the rules  They manipulate their currencies to give their products an unfair advantage  They refuse to enforce basic labor protections like a minimum wage  They use abhorrent practices like child labor and forced labor  As a result  these countries can produce goods much more cheaply and dominate the global marketplace  Our trade deficit is skyrocketing as we produce less at home  and buy more from other countries  In 2005  we imported a record  726 billion more than we exported  an all time high     American workers are also struggling  More and more companies are shipping our jobs overseas  73 percent of Massachusetts manufacturing companies have shifted production out of the country  Nationwide  we ve lost nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs since 2001  and we re losing high paying white collar jobs as well  Appallingly  our tax system and even our own government encourage the offshoring of public and private sector jobs that would otherwise be performed by American workers  Massachusetts already has state contracts with firms that are using workers in Bangladesh and India to perform our government services  Good  middle class jobs  with decent wages and benefits are disappearing  replaced by low paying service jobs  This downward pressure on wages threatens the American middle class  Wages in Massachusetts have fallen by 8   just since President Bush took office    The good news is that we ve got a firm foundation to retain our economic preeminence in the world  American companies are innovation leaders and American workers are the most productive in the world  They can compete with anybody  if they have a fair chance  The Right TRACK Act makes the global competition for business opportunities and good jobs fair by protecting American companies from unfair business practices  preserving good jobs in the United States  and raising living standards worldwide  The Act will      Protect American workers and businesses by requiring the President to impose a tariff on goods from countries that unfairly under price their goods through currency manipulation    Ensure that the United States does not enter into trade agreements with countries that use forced labor or child labor    Create a seal of approval program for American companies that meet standards for decent treatment of their foreign workforces  and a Good Multinational Labor Practices Award for companies  like Massachusetts  own Reebok Corporation  that have developed good workplace standards and monitoring at overseas facilities    Eliminate the tax break that gives American companies an incentive to ship jobs overseas    Ensure that Americans  hard earned tax dollars benefit American workers and communities by barring contractors from using federal funds for work performed overseas    Give workers 60 days notice that their jobs are being shipped overseas so they can organize to save them or find new jobs    Direct the Department of Labor to collect comprehensive statistics on how many and what types of jobs are being shipped overseas  THE RIGHT TRACK FOR WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES Senator Edward Kennedy   The globalization of commerce and industry has brought tremendous opportunities and benefits for our country  Americans now live better because of global trade  But globalization has a darker side  More than ever before  working Americans today are competing against workers around the world  Sadly  this competition could become a race to the bottom  where whoever is willing to work for the lowest wages gets the work  Good  middle class jobs are being shipped overseas  and the workers left behind can t find their place in the new economy  Massachusetts alone has lost a quarter of its manufacturing jobs in the past five years  While we all benefit from the lower prices and economic growth that globalization provides  some of our workers are paying all of the price  We owe a particular duty to those American workers who lose their jobs due to the effects of trade or economic downturns to help them adjust and find new opportunities in the global economy  The darker side of globalization also manifests itself by pressuring the United States to compromise our standards  Wages in Massachusetts are down by 8   just since the President took office  But we cannot compete by lowering our standards    we must continue to value our workers and live by the principles that created the American Dream  We can bring the benefits of globalization to all American workers  Communities like Lowell  Lawrence  and Haverhill that have lost high paying manufacturing jobs can modernize and diversity to emerge even stronger in the future  And workers who lose their jobs can train to find new jobs    good American jobs with high wages and strong protections for workers  rights  The Right TRACK Act will help workers and communities harmed by globalization adjust to the profound changes of the new economy  It will also modernize our country s labor and employment laws to reinforce our commitment to basic workers  rights  The Act will       Expand Trade Adjustment Assistance to cover service workers whose jobs are shipped overseas  and to cover workers harmed by production shifts to any country with which we have normal trading relations  such as China and India   not just countries with which we have preferential trading agreements    Provide transitional assistance to workers over the age of 40 who accept new jobs that pay less than their previous jobs    Provide health care assistance to ensure that workers are able to retain health benefits when transitioning to a new job    Double the funding available for retraining workers who lose their jobs because of trade and for businesses harmed by trade    Provide resources to assist communities in recovering from job losses due to trade  and in developing a strategic plan to modernize and diversity the community s economy    Increase the federal minimum wage  A federal minimum wage of  7 25 would directly benefit seven and a half million workers nationwide  and would automatically increase the Massachusetts minimum wage to  7 35 per hour    Allow states to more easily extend unemployment benefits during tough economic times    Improve unemployment insurance so that all states cover low wage workers  as Massachusetts already does  and part time workers    Establish efficient and fair procedures for workers to choose a representative when a majority say they want a union    Strengthen protections for workers who exercise their rights in the workplace  and use mediation and arbitration to help parties to reach a first contract     Globalization and the American Dream Senator Edward M  Kennedy  As prepared for delivery    These have not been easy times for vast numbers of Americans  In many ways  the American dream is in peril for millions of our fellow citizens as global forces have caused the economy to shift against them    Complacency is not the answer  Few things more affect the way we live than our shrinking and rapidly changing world  Unless we begin to address this immense challenge more effectively  the nation will pay a high price for years and years to come    The people of Massachusetts know the problem  They see it in the lives of families here and across the nation  It s measured in jobs moving overseas  stagnant or even falling wages and benefits  our schools are losing ground compared to other nations  and fewer opportunities to attain the American dream  Indeed  the course we are on today is a course that will make the American Dream the Impossible Dream     In a speech today  President Bush is addressing the issue of globalization  Hopefully  it will mark a new beginning in our understanding of the challenge  and meaningful policies will emerge  So far  unfortunately  not only has the Administration lost valuable time in meeting the challenge  but its policies have made a significant response more difficult    America cannot move forward if we cut back on investments in education  invention  and innovation  as the Administration has done  We cannot compete in the world if our companies and our workers are saddled with soaring costs for health care  We cannot advance if we fail to invest in our own employees by paying them a decent wage  by taking steps to enable companies to keep jobs here at home  and by investing wisely in our own economic growth    The 20th century was widely hailed as the American century  but the 21st century is up for grabs  No nation is guaranteed a future of lasting prosperity  We have to work for it  We have to sacrifice for it    We have a choice  We can continue to be buffeted by the harsh winds of the global economy  Or we can think anew  and guide the currents of globalization with a new progressive vision that strengthens America and equips our citizens to move confidently to the future    Competing better in a race to the bottom is not the answer  Equality of opportunity    a bedrock principle of our democracy    is suffering already  Today  children born of parents in the bottom 20 percent of income have only a one in fifteen chance of reaching the top 20 percent in their lifetimes  Also disturbing is the fact that those born in the middle are more likely to sink to the bottom than to rise to the top  And those born at the top are likely to stay at the top    We cannot and should not compete by lowering wages  Instead  we must open new doors and new avenues for all Americans to make the most of their God given talents and rekindle the fires of innovation in our society  By doing so  we can turn this era of globalization into a new era of opportunity for America    As Thomas Jefferson said  Every generation needs a new revolution  And I believe the revolution for this generation is to master our own destiny in the new global economy    What s most required is a new vision for America s future in the global community  Our goal is to rekindle the American Dream  so that if people work hard and play by the rules  they can succeed in life  be better off than their parents  live in good neighborhoods  raise strong families in safe surroundings  work in decent jobs with decent pay and decent benefits and a decent retirement    To do all that  we must make a commitment to lifelong education  to prepare every man  woman and child for the new world of intensifying competition and increasingly sophisticated technologies     We must create high quality jobs for the years ahead by investing in research and development  encouraging innovation  and modernizing all aspects of our infrastructure    We must level the playing field for American businesses and employees  to ensure fair worldwide competition and preserve good jobs in the United States     And we must make a fair commitment to assist and care for workers and communities harmed by the forces of globalization     We can do all that  but only if we make the right choices  and the time to start is now      I strongly believe that our highest priority must be a world class education for every American  We must seek a future where America competes with other nations  not by reducing our employees  pay and outsourcing their jobs  but by raising their skills     At Northeastern  you work to meet this challenge every day  Your cutting edge engineering and life science programs demonstrate your commitment to meeting the needs of our evolving economy  You re rightly proud to be the nation s number one cooperative education program  Students receive a unique college experience  because as they acquire the knowledge they ll need  they re simultaneously learning to apply it  In today s competitive economy  that strategy is increasingly beneficial  Northeastern is a model for other schools striving to improve their graduates  chances for success     As a nation  we must invest in Americans by ensuring access to the highest quality educational opportunities  We must make the American worker and manager the best educated  best trained  and most capable in the world  We need to nourish the capacities of every person in the nation     To do that  we must begin in the earliest years  Research proves conclusively that what we do for children s early education and development does more to ensure their later success in school than any other investment we can make  It s far less costly to society to spend millions to put young children on the right track from the start  instead of spending billions to rescue them from the wrong track later  In fact  one study concludes that in the long run we save  13 for every dollar invested in the early education of our youngest citizens  Prevention works in health care  and it can work in education too     For generations  we have treated education as a three legged stool    elementary and middle school  high school  and college  To create a solid foundation for the future  we have to add a fourth leg    early childhood education    In elementary and secondary education  the No Child Left Behind Act was a pioneering reform that held great promise when it was signed into law by President Bush four years ago  In fact  much of its inspiration came from our reforms here in Massachusetts and their proven success in our schools     No Child Left Behind was not just an abstract goal  It was a moral commitment to every parent and every child and every school in America  and I was proud to stand with President Bush when he signed it  It soon became clear  however  that to the Administration  it was more a slogan than a promise  Too many parents  too many children  too many schools are still waiting for the help we pledged     We can t reform education without the resources needed to pay for the reforms  Promises alone won t provide the qualified teachers  high standards in every classroom  good after school activities  and the range of supplemental services that every good school needs if it s to provide the right help for students who need it     No Child Left Behind was also a promise that every child counts    black or white or brown  rich or poor  It was a promise that disabled children too will have the qualified teachers and individual support they need to succeed in school and in life    We must also do more to help students prepare for college  afford college  be admitted to college and complete college  In 1950  when I graduated from school  only 15 percent of jobs required some post secondary training  Today  the number is over 60 percent and rising rapidly     However  we are witnessing a growing gulf in college attendance between the rich and poor  The gap is shameful  Each year  400 000 college ready students don t attend a four year college because they can t afford it  Never before has the financial challenge of attending college been greater for young students    It s time for America to agree that cost must never be a barrier to college education  Every child in America should be offered a contract  when they reach eighth grade  making clear that if they work hard  finish high school  and are accepted for college  we will guarantee them the cost of earning a degree     Perhaps nowhere is it more obvious that we are falling behind than in math and science  For a nation that prides itself on innovation and discovery  the downward slide is shocking  In recent years  we have dropped to 28th in the industrial world in math education  and we ve fallen from 3rd in the world to 15th in producing scientists and engineers  Each year  China graduates three times as many engineers as we do  Other nations are gaining on us because they give higher priority to education  American students perform well in international assessments compared to other nations in elementary school  but by middle school they re falling behind  and by high school they re near the bottom compared to our competitors    The last time America was shocked into realizing we were unacceptably behind in math and science was in 1958  when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik  Republican President Eisenhower and a Democratic Congress responded by passing the National Defense Education Act  and almost overnight we doubled the federal investment in education    In fact  throughout our history  we have re made American education to conquer the challenges of each time  In the mid 1800s  with the Industrial Revolution in full swing  we created free and mandatory public schools before most other nations did  And to stay ahead  we rapidly established public high schools at the start of the last century to keep pace with a growing economy    Once again  we did something comparable at the end of World War II  We passed the GI Bill of Rights  and gave every returning veteran the chance for a college education  The nation reaped a seven dollar return for every dollar it invested in their education  The result was the greatest generation  and it would never have happened without the GI Bill    What is it about the Bush Administration that keeps them from responding like that today  That s the kind of initiative we need  because the need is just as great  We need a new Education Bill of Rights  a new National Defense Education Act  for our own day and generation in science and math    Let s make college free for any students training to become math or science teachers    Let s make college and graduate school free for middle and low income math and science students    Let s see that our standards are internationally competitive  so that our graduates can succeed in this new economy  Let s offer incentives and other support for schools to develop and implement rigorous standards and courses in math and science    From our earliest days as a nation  education has been the engine of the American dream  In fact  many of the great developments in education found their first home in Massachusetts  from the commitment to public education in our state constitution to the earliest vocational education schools to our world class universities  We cannot let these achievements stall now  Slogans aren t strong enough  We have to put first things first  and give children  parents  schools  communities and states the support they need to re fuel the amazing engine of education and keep our country great in the years ahead    Beyond education  we must recognize that the foundation of our prosperity in this global world is to remain on the cutting edge of technology and medical and scientific breakthroughs in the years ahead and translate those advances into reliable products and services  A strong and fully developed infrastructure will provide the backbone for that success    America has always been a world leader in research and development  but we can no longer take our success for granted  Even in highly skilled industries  where our technology and infrastructure have preserved our competitive advantage  we re increasingly at risk today  Rapidly growing economies in Asia  Eastern Europe and South America are now formidable competitors  developing their economies into engines of growth based not just on low wages but on well educated citizens  advanced infrastructure  and well run businesses    In Bangalore  India  a G E  center employs more than 2 200 Ph D s  These workers are not sewing buttons on shirts  They re carrying out advanced research on jet engines and developing mathematical models for investment  An Intel research and development center in the same city employs 3 000 engineers designing the next generation of computer chips    Massachusetts is positioned well to surge ahead in an innovation driven economy  We are home to one of the largest biotechnology clusters in the country and per capita the Commonwealth receives more funding from NIH than any other state  Our colleges and universities alone invest almost  2 billion in research and development  Overall six percent of total federal RD spending comes into the state     However  the federal commitment to research outside the defense arena has declined under the Bush Administration  Of particular concern is the drop in funding for basic research  Much of the research conducted by private companies is focused on getting a product quickly to market  That s not the basic research that lays new foundations for new discoveries  Funding for basic research has declined in the past few years at the National Institutes of Health  the National Science Foundation  the Department of Energy  and other key scientific agencies  And overall the federal investment in research which once exceeded one percent of our GDP is now less than half a percent    We cannot allow this trend to continue  To maintain our position as the leader in innovation both in Massachusetts and across America  we must redouble our efforts to fund and encourage research and development in both the private sector and federal agencies     We also must invest in innovation and infrastructure    highways  mass transit  new sources of clean energy  health I T   and more  These investments not only improve the quality of our lives  but they also create the quality jobs that drive our economy forward    An example is broadband  Two years ago  President Bush declared that every American should have access to affordable broadband technology by the year 2007  But the Administration still has no plan to get us there  In the meantime  we have fallen to 16th in the world in broadband access behind countries such as Japan and the Netherlands that have broadband speeds four and five times faster than ours    Widespread use of basic broadband would add  500 billion to our economy and create 1 2 million jobs  Clearly  this is the kind of infrastructure we should invest in to produce good jobs and economic growth in the future    We also live in an age exploding with medical miracles  A generation ago  few could possibly have imagined the advances in science and biology that have revolutionized the practice of medicine  No one today can predict how new discoveries in the life sciences will improve our lives and change the world  but we can be certain the effects will be profound     Thanks to the genius and dedication of scientists  doctors and business leaders  the potential of medical research is virtually limitless  Diagnosing a faulty heart valve or blocked artery once meant risky and traumatic exploratory surgery  Today  doctors make the diagnosis with a miniature camera and fiber optic cable  and the patient can walk out of the office moments later    A few years ago  it seemed inconceivable that anyone could decipher the entire genetic code    the very blueprint of life  But today  doctors across the globe can read that sequence on their computer screens  and use the information to search for new ways to treat cancer  diabetes  Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and other major illnesses    Continuing at the forefront of the life sciences may well be the most important way for America to retain its leadership in the world economy in the coming years    Here in Massachusetts  we recently witnessed an example of how our high tech progress can put us ahead in the global economy  Hainan Airlines of China had a choice of six different American cities in which to launch direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai  The airline wanted to bring Chinese goods and passengers to America  But they chose Logan because they wanted to fly our medical products and high tech goods back to China  And they are even interested in flying fresh Bay State lobsters to Chinese consumers     Another of the fundamental challenges of the global economy is that our companies are losing business and our people are losing jobs because they re not competing on a level playing field     Foreign governments manipulate their currencies to give their products an unfair advantage  They refuse to enforce basic labor protections like a minimum wage  They use abhorrent practices like child labor and forced labor  As a result  these countries can produce goods much more cheaply and dominate the global marketplace     Our own trade deficit is skyrocketing because we re producing less at home  and buying more from other nations  Last year  we imported a record  726 billion more than we exported    an all time high    We can t continue down this reckless path  It s too damaging to our economy  Over  2 2 trillion of our national debt today is owed to foreign investors and foreign governments  America has always controlled its own destiny  But when foreigners are bankrolling our government  our destiny is no longer in our hands    It s not just our companies that suffer    our workers are also struggling because the playing field is so uneven  More and more of our companies are shipping U S  jobs overseas  54 percent of America s top companies have already done so  Even governments are part of the offshoring bandwagon  The state of Massachusetts has hired a contractor that uses workers in Bangladesh to process Medicaid data  It s hired another contractor using workers in India to answer questions about food stamps    The nation as a whole has lost nearly three million manufacturing jobs since 2001  The pain is widespread    48 states have lost manufacturing jobs under President Bush  Massachusetts has lost a quarter of its manufacturing jobs in the past five years  These are not just blue collar jobs  Millions of high paying  white collar jobs are also at risk of being shipped overseas  especially in the fields of medicine and computers    The disappearance of these good jobs is reducing our standard of living and threatening the very existence of the American middle class  President Bush s so called economic recovery has the worst job creation record of any recovery since World War II    Those fortunate enough to have jobs are finding that their wages are stagnant even though other coasts are soaring  College tuition is up 46 percent since 2001  Housing costs are up 49 percent  Health insurance is up 58 percent  Gasoline is  2 33 a gallon    40 percent higher than it was five years ago    The foundation of the American Dream is weakening  That s because more of what our economy produces in this recovery now goes to business profits and executive suite salaries  and less to employees  than at any time since such records began in 1929  Wages are down  but profits are up by more than 60 percent    There s a better way   We need policies that reject the Wal Mart ization of the American workforce    We must level the playing field in the competition for good jobs and demonstrate leadership in promoting fair wages for workers around the world  This is not just an economic issue    it s a moral issue    Rejecting the race to the bottom also means reaffirming our commitment to workers here at home  We must stop rewarding companies by giving them favorable tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas    Our commitment to workers at home also demands that we give them their fair share of the economic growth that globalization brings  In this century  just as in the last  we must ensure that workers can organize and have a voice at work    We owe a particular duty to those Americans who lose their jobs due to the effects of trade or economic downturns  When workers lose their jobs in the global economy  we should help in the difficult and painful transition to new employment with top notch job training and income assistance for their families until they get another paycheck    And it s a scandal that the minimum wage has been stuck at five dollars and fifteen cents an hour for the past nine years  below the poverty line for a family of three  It s the lowest the minimum wage has been in real value in more than fifty years  How can so many Republicans in Congress keep voting against any increase  Why can t we all at least agree that no one who works for a living in America should have to live in poverty    America has to rise to each and every dimension of this challenge  We can do it by creating a new culture of innovation and creativity that keeps our nation in the lead in the global market place    by equipping every American to compete and win in the new global economy  Only then will our economy continue to grow and prosper  Only then will the good jobs of the future be made in the U S A    The same can do spirit of innovation  invention  and progress that brought us the automobile  the airplane  and the computer can do it again  Those advances brought the American Dream closer for all  and we can t afford to let it slip away now    The essence of the American Dream is the ability to provide a better life for yourself and your family  At its very heart are a good job  first class education  good health care  and a secure retirement  Some say the dream is out of reach in today s global economy  But I m here today to tell you it doesn t have to be that way  We can revitalize the American Dream     I have full confidence in our ability to meet these challenges and reach new heights of discovery  prosperity  and progress  It will take tough choices and strong leadership  But if we honor the people who make our country great  and respect the values our country stands for  the American Dream shall never die     Thank you very much   Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  202  224 2633
