         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to the border security amendment offered  We hear much talk of national security  but this amendment does nothing to secure our nation and everything to tear it apart  Without a comprehensive approach to resolving our broken immigration system we are merely endorsing ten years of failed policies  We have tried enforcement only approaches for 10 years now  including adding 66 miles of border fences since 1996  tripling the number of Border Patrol agents stationed on the border  stripping undocumented immigrants of virtually all due process rights  and denying undocumented and legal immigrants access to welfare benefits  all at a cost of  20 billion  And what have been the results  Twelve million people are in the United States illegally  Twelve million or more people whose identities are unknown  who live in the shadows and who are outside our detection That number is only going to continue to grow  no matter how many enforcement measures are put in place  unless we address the underlying reason for illegal immigration  Yes  there may be some people who seek to do us harm  and we must use our resources to detect and deport them  But the vast majority of the twelve million are here to work and to be with their family  The primary cause of undocumented immigration is not too little enforcement  but too few visas  American employers and American families demand immigration to meet their labor needs and to meet their demand for family reunification  Our immigration system is broken because the American economy demands about 400 000 new low skilled immigrant workers each year  but our visa system only provides about 5 000  Our immigration system is broken because three million immigrants are already on waiting lists to rejoin their families in the United States  but their wait to legally enter the United States is ten or twenty years in many cases  Enforcement alone cannot address these fundamental imbalances That is why enforcement alone wont work  no matter how strict we try to make it  Those who advocate an enforcement only approach deny the strength of economic and social connections between immigrants abroad and their employers and families within the United States  We will have enforcement first  but we will not have effective enforcement  My colleagues suggest that America wants enforcement first  but Americans have stated repeatedly that they want a workable solution to our immigration crisis  They want to see a way that will allow their neighbors to earn a path to citizenship  they want to find a way to balance enforcement and benefits  they want Congress to heal the ugly divides that are making the immigration crisis that much worse Adopting this amendment will only increase the raids on vulnerable workers  strip away even more due process rights  and encourage retaliation against immigrants If my colleagues genuinely want immigration reform  they must address what the vast majority of Americans really wantan end to an underground economy  an end to harsh and inhumane immigration policies  an end to the isolation of twelve million people  The American public has accepted the need to address these problems  and so must the Senate       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
