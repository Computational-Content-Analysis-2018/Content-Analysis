         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     With a budget  we have a chance to make a difference  We have a chance to make a difference for working families  for the millions of Americans who work hard every day  who care for their families  who want the best for their children  their communities  and their country    This budget should make a difference for them  It should be a budget for America    a fair budget that improves the lives of average Americans    That s not this budget   President Bush and the Republican Congress had a chance to make a difference  and it failed    They chose instead in this budget to lavish more and more tax breaks on the wealthy at the expense of poor Americans who rely on Medicaid  at the expense of seniors who rely on Medicare  and at the expense of parents who want to send their children to college    Medicaid  Medicare  college opportunity    all are harmed by this budget  It s strike one  strike two  and strike three  This budget should be thrown out     Education  Here s how this budget harms education in America    Education is the golden door to opportunity for our citizens  Parents know that education makes the American dream possible for their children     Education is essential to our future competitiveness and our strength as a nation  We cannot compete in the world without skilled workers  We cannot maintain a strong defense without a skilled and educated military     The budget proposed by the President and the Republican leadership in Congress fails our future  It fails American families struggling to pay for their children s college education  It fails American workers seeking to improve their skills and secure better jobs to support their families  It fails out companies looking for the best workers  It fails our military looking for the brightest recruits  It weakens America as we strive to compete in the global economy and to maintain our security in a dangerous world    American workers are being battered by the tidal wave of globalization  and this budget does nothing for them   Nothing    Since this Administration has been in office  2 8 million jobs have been lost  By 2015  3 4 million jobs are at risk of being shipped overseas  The wages of average workers are going down as the cost of living is going up    At the same time  other nations are producing increasing numbers of workers with advanced skills  Since 1975  we have fallen from 3rd to 15th in producing scientists and engineers  We have fallen from first to seventh in college entry rates     We should be facing globalization with confidence  We should invest in the transforming power of education  We should equip our citizens for the future not by giving up and lowering their wages  but by looking ahead and raising their skills  But this budget fails this important obligation    For the first time in a decade  this budget cuts the education budget  As college costs are going up  as the need for a college degree is rising  as we need more graduates in math and science to remain competitive in the modern world  the budget for education is going down    If our country is to remain strong in this rapidly changing world  our economy must work for everyone  and every American must have an equal chance at the American dream  No Child Left Behind is not just a political slogan  It s a solemn pledge to every parent and every child in America  But this budget leaves three million children behind  It cuts student aid to help young people go to college  All of these cuts are made in order to increase tax breaks for the wealthy    It rejects my amendment  passed by a majority of this body  which would have increased college opportunity by  5 4 billion by closing corporate tax loopholes     My amendment would have helped students prepare and complete college by restoring cuts to student support programs such as GEAR UP and TRIO  These programs have helped thousands of students become the first in their families to complete college    My amendment would have helped American families pay for college by increasing the maximum Pell Grant to  4500 today  not in 5 years  and restoring cuts to other student aid programs     The average salary of a person with a college degree is 70  higher today than the salary of a person with only a high school degree  That difference equals about  1 million in earnings over a lifetime of work    Yet  last year alone  400 000 college ready students didn t attend a 4 year college    because they couldn t afford to do so  Almost half of them did not attend college at all     My amendment would have helped American workers attain the skills that they need to obtain jobs to support their families by restoring cuts to career and technical education programs  adult education programs and job training programs  Workers of all ages need training to attain skills to compete for jobs in labor market shortage areas    such as biotechnology and computer technicians     My amendment would have helped our economy by investing in math and science education so we can be first in the world in science and engineering rather than 15th     Over 160 organizations representing students and educators supported my amendment  They generated thousands of calls to their legislators  Just from Massachusetts  I have received more than 1 000 letters from adult education students and teachers urging that this amendment be retained    telling their stories of how adult education is changing their lives for the better  We have letters from colleges and universities across the country urging Congress to increase Pell Grants and to save Perkins loans  We have letters from students  counselors  and young adults urging us to save college preparation programs for first generation students like TRIO and GEAR UP  Over 600 000 students have sought more information about this amendment  On their own  five Republican Senators wrote the Budget Committee conferees to tell them that stopping the President s education cuts and increasing the Pell Grant is essential  And yet  this conference agreement rejects those pleas and cuts education    The Republican leadership and the White House decided it was more important to maintain tax loopholes to reward corporations that send jobs overseas rather than invest in our own young people here at home     My amendment embraced the hopes and dreams of millions of Americans    all parents want their children to have lives of fulfillment and opportunity  to raise strong and healthy families and afford to live comfortably in safe neighborhoods    When we first debated this Resolution a little over a month ago  a majority in the Senate said no to the President s cuts to education  Here today  a majority of the Senate should say no again  We should stop the raid on student aid  We should pass a budget that strengthens  not weakens America    MEDICAID Just last month  the Senate made it clear that cuts to the Medicaid program were unacceptable  In a bipartisan vote  we agreed to not make any cuts until a bipartisan commission had time to examine the Medicaid program and recommend possible reforms based on sound policy  And just this week  in an overwhelming bipartisan vote  the House instructed the budget conferees not to cut Medicaid    Yet the budget we will be voting on shortly not only cuts Medicaid    despite consensus in both the House and Senate against cuts    its cuts to the program are deeper than those we voted down in March  The Senate rejected  15 billion in cuts to the Finance Committee last month  yet this budget report that was drafted in the dark of night behind closed doors forces the Finance Committee to cut  10 billion     And if these cuts were not bad enough  the bipartisan Medicaid commission has turned into a partisan commission that the Administration can stack with members they know will recommend the cuts their predetermined cuts  Instead of a real examination of the Medicaid program so that we can modernize the program with needed reforms  we will have a commission whose agenda will be to recommend cuts    And it s not just Medicaid that is at risk  Medicare is on the chopping block  too    all to pay for more and more and more tax breaks for the wealthy     What does it say about Republican priorities if this Republican budget cuts a program that provides health care for 53 million low income Americans    children  their parents  the elderly and the disabled    in order to provide large new tax breaks for the wealthy     Republicans say they are for a culture of life  But Medicaid sustains that life  One third of all births in America are covered by Medicaid  Medicaid sustains life for one third of our mothers and our babies  But this budget says the lives of poor mothers and poor children are not that important after all  Under this budget  tax breaks for the rich are more important than life itself    Now more than ever  we need to maintain the federal commitment to medical care for the poor  Over the past four years  the number of uninsured has risen by five million to a whopping 45 million  It is no surprise that with poverty increasing and health care costs skyrocketing more people would lose their health insurance  More and more working Americans can t afford coverage because health costs are rising faster than their paychecks  It is unconscionable that working families are forced onto Medicaid because they can t get health coverage but that is the reality in America today    But thankfully these hard working families had Medicaid to fall back on  Over that same four year period  Medicaid enrollment grew by nine million  What that means is that without Medicaid serving as a safety net  we would have had 54 million uninsured  That is what is responsible for Medicaid s growth    a 40 percent enrollment growth over the past five years  not inefficiencies  or fraud  or abuse  Should we turn around and penalize those Americans who have already been penalized by the bad economy  Those are not the kind of values any of us should stand for    Medicaid provides a critical safety net for 53 million Americans    low income children  parents  disabled and elderly citizens who have nowhere else to turn for health care  Medicaid pays for almost 40 percent of all long term care expenses  Half of all Medicaid enrollees are children     We know the harmful consequences the lack of access to health care  In the early 1960 s  President Kennedy commissioned a study to find out why half of all young military draftees were rejected for service  The study  which was released in 1964 and provided the basis for Medicaid s coverage policy for children  found that these young men had physical  mental and developmental problems that would have been highly treatable if they had access to health care as children  As a result of this landmark study  the Medicaid program was enacted so that low income children could receive the health care they needed to become healthy  productive adults  Today  half of all young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 will have received health care through the Medicaid program at some time during their childhood     Those without coverage receive less care  suffer more  and are more likely to die than those who are insured  If we weaken our federal commitment  these men  women  and children will suffer these harmful consequences  We cannot abandon our responsibility to provide for those among us who are less fortunate     Pensions  The Budget Resolution also proposes an increase in the premiums paid by companies to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  PBGC   By increasing these required payments even for companies with secure pension plans  the budget places an unfair additional tax on businesses that are trying to provide a good retirement for their workers  It would harm retirees and workers by taking away funds that should be used for strengthening pension plans or creating jobs     Defined benefit pension plans have already been battered by the current weak economy  low interest rates  and the floundering stock market  More than ever  workers are at risk of losing the pension benefits they have worked a lifetime to earn     We need to act to protect the defined benefit pension system so that employees will receive the benefits they ve been promised in retirement  Companies must adequately fund their pension plans  but it makes no sense to take excessive measures whose effect will be to drive even more companies out of the system  The number of defined benefit pension plans is already very low  Only 20  of workers today are covered by a secure defined benefit pension plan  down from 40  thirty years ago  Yet this budget will accelerate that trend in the wrong direction     Penalizing companies that offer pensions by drastically increasing the cost of their pension plans is the wrong policy  It will hurt workers and retirees  and it will endanger the long term future of the pension system  But that is exactly the policy adopted by this budget resolution  which would require the HELP Committee to raise   6 6 billion dollars in increased payments to the government by employers with pension plans     The Senate bill included a  2 billion increase in premiums  which was already equivalent to increasing payments by companies by 58  for each employee  Adding billions more to this cost will mean that companies could see their premium payments rise by 300 or 400   percent  That s far too much     This excessive new premium tax on these employers will impose a particularly heavy burden on manufacturing companies  which are already under intense pressure from globalization    It will hurt many smaller businesses  Those that belong to the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association will face increases of millions of dollars  Yet each of these businesses has an average of only 43 workers  It s wrong to penalize small firms that want to do the right thing and grant pensions to their workers     These premium increases will obviously hurt the many workers and retirees who will no longer have a secure retirement when their employers leave the defined benefit pension system     It also jeopardizes the long term stability of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  which will have fewer and fewer companies participating in its insurance system     Decent retirement plans are our goal  The heart of a secure retirement plan is a guaranteed pension  It s bad enough that the Administration is already jeopardizing Social Security  which is the gold standard for defined benefit plans  Now they are extending this ideology to defined benefit private pension plans as well  By penalizing companies who are willing to provide secure pensions to their workers  they are attacking another of the very foundations of America s retirement system  and Congress should reject it  just as we should reject the Administration s misguided attack on Social Security  Millions of working men and women across America depend on us  and we must not let them down    Two bright spots in an otherwise dismal budget are investment in health care modernization and in health coverage for families with disabled children    Family Opportunity Act The budget also includes a reserve fund for the Grassley Kennedy bill to provide health coverage for families with disabled children  The bill is titled the Family Opportunity Act    For the last 5 years  Senator Grassley and I have been fighting to get this legislation passed    The Family Opportunity Act allows families of children with severe disabilities to buy health care coverage under the Medicaid program  without becoming poor  staying poor  or giving up custody of your child  It is legislation cosponsored by more than half of the United States Senate and over 200 disability  health care and other organizations     Almost one in ten children in America has significant disabilities  But many do not have access to even the most basic health services they need because the private health insurance won t cover them     In every one of these plans you read numerous exclusions that hurt children with disabilities    no coverage for hearing aids  for special health needs  for assistive technology  for services at school  and on and on and on    These families aren t looking for a hand out    just a helping hand  All they want is the opportunity to buy affordable coverage  because the private health insurance market won t offer it to them     More than any other investment we can make in this budget  we should secure funding for these families who struggle everyday to afford the health care their children need to live healthy and successful lives    I hope that we can finally see this pro family bill enacted into law this year     HEALTH I T  The budget sets up a reserve fund for Senate action to bring the benefits of information technology to our inefficient health care system  Unfortunately  a similar reserve fund is not available for House action    Information technology has revolutionized virtually every industry in America    only health care lags behind    IT is critical our efforts to bring costs down and improve quality  It can provide for more efficient delivery of care  and it can reduce errors and increase quality  HHS estimates that widespread use of IT can save as much as  140 billion a year    The VA has implemented the most advanced IT system in the country over the past few years  The results have been remarkable  Since 1996  VA costs per patient have actually decreased 7   while private sector costs per patient have increased by 62   During this period  the VA has been widely recognized for improving its quality of care     Obviously  not all of these successes have been due to information technologybut the VA system thinks that much of it has      We have a tremendous opportunity to improve the ability of IT to make a real difference in the quality and efficiency of health care    but we have to act now    I commend Senator Gregg and Senator Conrad for working with the Chairman of our Health Committee  Senator Enzi  and me    as well as Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus on the Finance Committee    to include this fund in the budget    The fund is a small step in the right direction  but it will be a wasted step unless Congress enacts legislation to improve the use of health IT in America    The two key components of any legislation  in my view are incentives for hospitals and health care providers to use IT to improve quality and in acquiring IT  Part of this effort is developing technical standards in partnership with the private sector to ensure that the money is spent on systems that really enhance quality    Our economic competitors in Europe and elsewhere are making the investments needed to improve their health IT systems  The British are investing over  15 billion  yet we in this country continue to delay    IT can cut costs in many ways  Our fragmented and uncoordinated health care system imposes high costs in duplication and waste  Patients with multiple chronic illnesses see as many as fourteen doctors a year     Doctors repeat tests that have already been performed  Residents take histories that have already been taken  Patients show up for doctors  appointments that are essentially a waste of time because tests have been performed but the results have not been delivered     It has been estimated that one in seven hospitalizations could be avoided if complete medical records were available for the patient  One out of five laboratory tests are duplicative of ones that have already been performed  This adds up to immense amounts of money  IT can reduce this needless duplication     We as a nation cannot afford to miss this opportunity to make the investments needed to improve health care and cut costs   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
