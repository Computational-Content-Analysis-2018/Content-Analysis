         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy joined Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid for a press conference urging lawmakers to stop the delays on much needed legislation to increase the minimum wage  Due to over 100 Republican amendments on issues unrelated to the raise  the minimum wage vote will be pushed to next week  For almost ten years America s workers have waited for an increase  the longest period without a wage hike in history The American people respect hard work  They understand fairness and know that no one working for a living should live in poverty  But they dont understand why it has taken ten years to give minimum wage workers the raise they deserve  Senator Kennedy said  Republicans are blocking this bill and standing in the way of progress  Its unacceptable  Weve spent 16 days debating our plan to raise the minimum wage over the last ten years and now Republicans are loading it up with amendments to delay it even further  How can we continue to delay a bill that the American people so clearly want   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
