         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Whatever our position on the Iraq war  we should all be concerned that the President does not have a winning strategy on Iraq Our current strategy isn t working  and Congress and the American people know it  I say this with sorrow and regret for our troops  for their families  and for our country Administration officials repeatedly claimed that the insurgents are desperate  dead enders  and in their last throes  The American people know they are not Secretary Rumsfeld insists  progress has been solid  With American casualties currently averaging nearly three every day  the American people know it is not Secretary Rumsfeld insists that the army is not being stretched to the breaking point  But month after month  recruiting goals go unmet and generals are sounding the alarm Secretary Rumsfeld insists that we are not in a quagmire  The American people believe that we are Secretary Rumsfeld says the Administration is not painting a rosy picture  The American people know that they are By last June  after the President declared Mission Accomplished  852 American service members had been killed in action  Today  the number has doubled to more than 1700 By last June  5 000 American servicemembers had been wounded in action  Today  the number has nearly tripled  to over 13 000 A year ago  the United States had 34 Coalition partners in Iraq  Today  we have just 25  and another five are scheduled to pull out by the end of the year The Administration has been consistently wrong about Iraq  The American people know that things are not going well and that we need to correct the course we are on It s ironic that Americans are learning the truth not from our own Administration  but from an ally  The truth should come from the White House  not Downing Street More than anything else  what Americans hope to hear from the President tonight is the unvarnished truth of what s really going on in Iraq and how he plans to put a new strategy in place that assures success When President Bush addresses the nation tonight  all of us hope that he will state a new and more realistic and more effective strategy for the United States to succeed in Iraq  Our current strategy is not worthy of the sacrifices our men and women in uniform are making The war has clearly made America less safe in the world  It has strengthened support for Al Qaeda and made it harder to win the real war against terrorism    the war against Al Qaeda The President needs an effective strategy to accelerate the training of a capable Iraqi security force The President needs an effective strategy to rescue the faltering reconstruction effort  create new jobs and new hope for the Iraqi people  and neutralize the temptation to join the insurgents The President needs an effective strategy to bring the international community into Iraq and to achieve the adoption on schedule of a constitution that protects all the people of Iraq He needs an effective strategy to give our troops the equipment they need to fight the war  and to ensure that veterans returning from Iraq have access to quality health care services He needs an effective strategy to repair the damage the war has caused to our military and to our reputation in the world Realism is hard medicine to swallow  President Bush must face the facts and accept them  Our men and women in uniform deserve no less Our current strategy is not working  I hope the President will outline a winning strategy tonight    IRAQ ONE YEAR FACT SHEETOn the one year anniversary of the Iraqi turnover  Americans    Democrats and Republicans   are increasingly concerned that the Administration has no effective or realistic plan to stabilize Iraq  It continues to underestimate the strength and deadly resilience of Iraqi insurgency  and it has failed to adequately protect our troops Bellow are the current realities Insurgents  General Abizaid told the Armed Services Committee on Thursday that the overall strength of the insurgency is about the same as it was six months ago  Looking ahead  as General Vines said last week  I m assuming that the insurgency will remain at about its current level  The families of the 1700 fallen soldiers know all too well that the insurgents are not desperate  or dead enders  or in their last throes    as Administration officials have repeatedly claimed  Indeed  General Casey indicated that the insurgency is around 26  000 strong  an increase over the 5 000 the Pentagon believed were part of the insurgency one year ago  In the last two months  America has lost an average of three soldiers a day in Iraq and no end is in sight  As General Myers said on May 12  I wouldn t look for results tomorrow One thing we know about insurgencies is that they last fromthree  four years to nine yearsOur military has been stretched to the breaking point  In January 2004  Lieutenant General John Riggs said it bluntly  I have been in the Army 39 years  and I ve never seen the Army as stretched in that 39 years as I have today  He has since been retired at a lower star than he earned  The Department of Defense has had to activate a stop loss policy  to prevent service members from leaving the military as soon as they fulfill their commitment  Nearly 50 percent of the persons serving in the regular Armed Forces have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since December 2001  and nearly 15 percent of them have been deployed more than once  Thirty six percent of all those serving in the Armed Forces  including in the National Guard and the Reserves  have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since December 2001  As Lieutenant General James Helmley  head of the Army Reserve  warned at the end of 2004  the Army Reserve is rapidly degenerating into a  broken  force and is in grave danger of being unable to meet other operational requirements Recruitment is becoming more and more challenging  The war in Iraq and the casualties and the strain on families have seriously undermined the Pentagon s ability to attract new recruits and retain members already serving  Both the regular and reserve components of the Armed Forces are increasingly unable to meet recruitment goals  Major General Michael Rochelle  head of the Army Recruiting Command  stated the problem succinctly in May when he said that this year is the toughest recruiting climate ever faced by the all volunteer Army  To recruit and retain more soldiers  the National Guard has increased its retention bonus from  5 000 to  15 000  The first time signing bonus has gone up from  6 000 to  10 000  General Steven Blum  Chief of the Army National Guard  said  Otherwise  the Guard will be broken and not ready the next time it s needed  either here at home or for war  In May  the Army began offering a fifteen month active duty enlistment  the shortest enlistment tour in the history of the Army  In March  the Pentagon announced it was raising the maximum age for Army National Guard recruits from 34 to 39  and was also offering generous new health benefits for Guard and Reserve members activated after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks Rumsfeld continues to paint a rosy picture  Thursday Secretary Rumsfeld insisted we are not stuck in a quagmire in Iraq  He insisted that the idea that what s happening over there is a quagmire is so fundamentally inconsistent with the facts  In February last year  Secretary Rumsfeld said  We accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces  now more than 200 000 strong  In fact  the numbers of Iraqis who are adequately trained is far lower  As General Meyers conceded a year later  only about 40 000 Iraqi security forces can go anywhere and do anything  When Secretary Rumsfeld was challenged about it by a solider to huge applause from the troops on the Secretary s visit to Iraq last December  he arrogantly and callously responded  You go to war with the army you have  They re not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time But Rumsfeld has just been plain wrong on the war He stated that we were under threat from a state that had weapons of mass destruction   There are a number of terrorist states pursuing weapons of mass destruction    Iran  Libya  North Korea  Syria    to name but a few  But no terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people and the stability of the world that the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq  Senate Armed Services Hearing  September 19  2002    K nowing what we know about Iraq s history  no conclusion is possible except that they have and are accelerating their WMD programs  House Armed Services Hearing  September 18  2002 No terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people than the regime of Saddam Hussein and Iraq    Senate Armed Services Hearing  September 19  2002 Iraq poses a threat to the security of our people and to the stability of the world that is distinct from others  In both word and deed  Iraq has demonstrated that it is seeking the means to strike the United States  our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction for a reason  so that it can acquire the territory of its neighbors  Reserve Officers Association  January 20  2003He underestimated the troops needed for the war  What is  I think  reasonably certain is the idea that it would take several hundred thousand U S  forces I think is far from the mark  Media Availability with Afghan President Karzai  February 27  2003 Because Rumsfeld underestimated the amount of troops needed to fight the war  massive looting occurred after Baghdad fell  In response to the mass chaos  he said stuff happens  Interview on CNN  April 11  2003He failed to provide enough armored vehicles for our troops in Iraq  It isn t a matter of money  It isn t a matter on the part of the Army of desire  It s a matter of production and capability of doing it  Kuwait  December 8  2004  You go to war with the army you have  They re not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time  Kuwait  December 8  2004 The Army never asked the companies producing armored humvees to work at maximum capacity  The Army s contracts didn t provide enough funds to keep Humvee production at maximum production  In August 2003  only fifty one Up Armored Humvees were being produced a month  It took the industrial base a year and a half to work up to making 400 a month  Now the Army says they can now get delivery of 550 a month  On June 20  2005  a report from the Marine corps Inspector General was published for Congress stating that about a quarter of the Second Marine Expeditionary Force s Humvees lack sufficient armor to protect troops against roadside bombings  including 1 000 vehicles that have yet to be fitted with armor plates to protect the undercarriage  The report also says that if the current demands in Iraq continue  the Corps will need another 650 Humvees  which have been logging an average of 480 miles a month  mostly over rough terrain  And despite an agreement with the Army to repair broken vehicles at a maintenance facility in Kuwait  the Marine Corps had not scheduled any repairs as of last month  Meanwhile  those Humvees that have received full armor    which the report says have significantly improved the safety of troops    are suffering excessive wear and tear because they were never designed to carry the additional weight  Boston Globe  June 20  2005He denied the existence of a guerilla war and repeatedly called the insurgents dead enders  Until the regime is gone  until it s finally tipped  until there s absolute certainty that Saddam Hussein is not there any more  I suspect that some of these dead enders will be down there shooting people and doing that type of thing  That s basically what s going on  Department of Defense News Briefing  March 25  2003 They re making progress against the dead enders who are harassing coalition forces  Department of Defense News Briefing June 24  2003 I don t use the phrase guerrilla war is because there isn t one  and it would be a misunderstanding and a miscommunication to you and to the people of the country and the world  Department of Defense News Briefing  June 30  2003 The dead enders are still with us  those remnants of the defeated regimes who ll go on fighting long after their cause is lost  Lackland Air Force Base  August 25  2003 Coalition forces are continuing to root out dead enders and criminal gangs and foreign terrorists that are in Iraq  Department of Defense News Briefing  September 16  2003 It s not been a pacified country  if you will  but in a country where regime dead enders are still violently trying to stop progress    Department of Defense News Briefing November 25  2003 The dead enders  threatened by Iraq s progress to self  government  may believe that they can drive the coalition out through terror and intimidation  and foment civil war among Sunnis and Shias or block the path to Iraqi self rule  But they re badly mistaken  Defense Department Operational Briefing  April 20  2004 There is no popular uprising going on in Iraq right now  This violence  in my view  is a desperate attempt by frustrated  isolated groups  such as the insurgents in Fallujah and Sadr s thugs in Najaf  to derail the progress that we ve been making  Secretary Rumsfeld and Republic of Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan Media Stakeout  April 21  2004 The battle in Iraq today is not a fight between Iraqis and foreign forces    it is a battle between free Iraqis and the last remnants of a defeated regime  who still do not realize that their cause is lost    Department of Defense News Briefing December 3  2004He overstated the number of trained Iraqis We re increasing international military participation in Iraq  We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces  now more than 200 000 strong  Senate Armed Services Committee  February 4  2004 U S  government agencies do not report reliable data on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped The departments of State and Defense no longer report on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are equipped with their required weapons  vehicles  communications  equipment  and body armor  GAO Report  Preliminary Observations on challenges in Transferring security
