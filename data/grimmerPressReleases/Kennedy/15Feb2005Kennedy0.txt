         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The steps announced today by Secretary Leavitt and Acting Commissioner Crawford are an overdue step forward  but they don t go nearly far enough  It is critical that FDA s resources to monitor drugs be dramatically increased  and the FDA must be given the authority to require drug companies to initiate and complete appropriate safety studies  I hope that the Administration will work cooperatively with me and other members of Congress to make the far reaching reforms necessary to protect the health of the American people   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
