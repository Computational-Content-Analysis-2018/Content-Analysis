         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement in response to the federal judges requesting funding for protection    The Schiavo case cast a bright light on the dark forces behind the nuclear option campaign  House Republican Leader Tom DeLay has threatened the judges who acted in this case  just as extremists were threatening their lives  The Senator from Texas has joined the Tom DeLay chorus in tearing down our independent judiciary  To say that the time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior as Delay did is reckless  irresponsible  and dangerous     As the NY Times argues today  deplorable words like these give even more reason for the majority leader to stop his attempts to blow up 200 years of constitutional history in order to rubberstamp the President s judges     Apparently  it s not enough for Republicans to rule the White House and the Congress  They want power over the independent judiciary  too  The checks and balances so vital to our democracy are for them merely an inconvenience    And now today  we ve learned that judges from across the country have asked for our help  The Judicial Conference has asked the White House and the Senate for  12 million dollars to help protect judges from violence  As leaders in Congress incite violence against judges  these same judges    the honorable men and women appointed to uphold America s laws and ideals    are living in fear of violence     I urge President Bush and Senator Frist to call a halt to the reckless Republican rhetoric that is endangering judges  lives and to add this urgent funding to the upcoming bill to fund the war in Iraq    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
