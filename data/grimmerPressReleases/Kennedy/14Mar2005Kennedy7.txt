         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Senator Kennedy has decided to decline to meet with Gerry Adams given the IRA s ongoing criminal activity and contempt for the rule of law  Since the Good Friday agreement  Senator Kennedy has told Gerry Adams that the IRA must fully decommission and cease to exist as a paramilitary organization  The IRA murder of Robert McCartney and subsequent call for vigilante justice underscore the need for IRA violence and criminality to stop and for Sinn Fein to cooperate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland  Sinn Fein cannot be a fully democratic party with the IRA albatross around its neck  The time for decisive and final action is long overdue     Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
