         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The American people have heard time and again that success is just around the corner and that Iraqi security forces are growing in capability and numbers  For example  in August 2006  General Casey said  I can see over the next 12 to 18 months the Iraqi security forces progressing to a point where they can take on the security responsibilities for the country with very little coalition support The most recent report from the Department of Defense  Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq  in June  indicates that a total of 346 500 Iraqi Security Forces have been trained and that more and more Iraqi Army and National Police are in the lead in their areas  But a House Armed Services Committee investigation concluded that the Department cannot report in detail how many of the 346 500 Iraqi military and police personnel that the Coalition trained are operational today  And last month  the National Intelligence Estimate judged that the Iraqi Security Forces have not improved enough to conduct major operations independent of the Coalition on a sustained basis in multiple locations and remain reliant on the Coalition for important aspects of logistics and combat support Earlier this week  GAO reported that the number of Iraqi security units able to operate without our forces has actually declined since March  GAO says that due to Iraqs immature logistics systems  many Iraqi military and police units will continue to depend on coalition forces until December 2008  Today  youre saying that the Iraqi security forces will be unable to fulfill their essential security responsibilities independently over the next 12 18 months  Further  youve concluded that the National Police are ineffective  not viable  Youre recommending that we disband it to purge it of corrupt officers and Shiite militants suspected of complicity in sectarian killings and start rebuilding it all over again  Were you and your commissioners able to determine if any of the Iraqi Security Forces can fight without our assistance How long do you think it will be before the Army is trained and able to conduct operations without our forces  In other words  how long will it be before the Iraqi military can really stand on its own feet Can adequate training continue with less than 160 000 American troops as many of us are proposing What about the police  How long will it take to train them if we have to start tomorrow Time is running out on the Administrations failed strategy  Our military has done everything we have asked them to do  but we cannot expect them stay indefinitely to train security forces that are nothing more than a cover for sectarian militias  General Casey has expressed concern about the overall strain on our forces as a whole  and our ability to conduct operations elsewhere in the world  Secretary Gates has said he wants U S  troops to be deployed in Iraq for no more than a year at a time  rather than the 15 months they are deployed now  Were borrowing against our future to keep recruitment levels up  The American people want to know when it will end  Clearly  the Iraqi security forces are important  But their development cannot come at the expense of our national security and the well being of our own security forces  General Jones  your report says  the ability of the Iraqi Security Forces to end sectarian violence in Iraq and contribute to setting the conditions for national reconciliation is limited in the absence of a strong central government and an active political reconciliation process  It says  The Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police Service have the potential to help reduce sectarian violence  but ultimately the Iraqi Security Forces will reflect the society from which they are drawn  Political reconciliation is the key to ending sectarian violence in Iraq  Some argue that we should stop funding the Iraqi Security Forces  As long as there is no political consensus among Iraqi leaders  they argue  funding security forces with ties and loyalties to militias only increases the likelihood that the sectarian violence and civil war will be more vicious and bloodier  An additional concern is that with an unstable government in Iraq  its possible that U S  supplied weapons could be used against our soldiers or allies  Do you share these concerns  In the absence of a political accommodation  are we pouring fuel on the fire by funding security forces whose loyalty may be to a militia rather than the central government If so  is cutting off funding the solution If not  how do we train security forces that dont contribute to the sectarian violence and tension      Laura Burton Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
