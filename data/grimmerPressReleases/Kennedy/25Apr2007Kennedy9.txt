         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  In the wake of the tragic events of September 11th  Congress  the Administration and the country faced the urgent need to do all we can to strengthen our national security and counterterrorism strategy  Since then  we have also enacted legislation to reform our intelligence laws  and we spent significant time re authorizing key provisions of the PATRIOT Act last year  Given the circumstances driving the passage of these measures  we must continue to work together to assess whether existing national security laws are adequate and make necessary improvements when required  For this reason  Im pleased that Senator Norm Coleman and I have strong bipartisan support for the Terrorist Hoax Improvement Act of 2007  I am pleased to have Senator Colemans support  and applaud his efforts on this bill  In 2004  Congress enacted the first federal terrorism hoax statute  Its purpose was to establish definitions and set serious penalties to deal with the problem of hoax crimes  A significant number of prosecutions have taken place against individuals who disrupt communities with terrorist hoaxes  but a disturbing pattern has also developed relating to new circumstances not contemplated by the original law  Our bill corrects gaps in current law to include hoaxes related to the taking of hostages to coerce the federal government  hoaxes related to attacks on military bases  or hoaxes related to attacks on railways and mass transportation facilities   In addition  this measure expands civil liability to allow federal and state governments to seek reimbursement from someone who knows that emergency personnel are responding to a hoax and fails to inform authorities that no such event has occurred  The bill also increases the maximum penalty for hoaxes involving the death or injury of a U S  soldier during wartime and improves the laws allowing prosecutions against those who engage in threatening communications  Since September 11th  federal  state and local law enforcement have struggled to deal with the real threat of terrorism  At the same time  another challenge has arisen because of reckless individuals who perpetrated hoaxes that caused panic  unrest and expenditure of critical resources  Such hoaxes have seriously disrupted many lives and needlessly diverted law enforcement and emergency services resources  Here in Congress  many of us remember the real danger of anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001  In the wake of this serious threat  a number of individuals mailed unidentified white powder  intending for the recipient to believe it was anthrax     over 150 000 anthrax hoaxes were reported between September 2001 and August 2002  In Massachusetts  one of these hoaxes was directed at a military facility  Fire trucks and hazmat responders rushed to the scene at the Agawam armory  only to learn that the powder spread over the armory equipment was not a toxic substance  Its unconscionable in this post 9 11 world  for anyone to be perpetrating hoaxes that cause panic and drain already limited public safety resources  All of us remember where we were and what we were doing on 9 11  We will never forget the lives that were lost and the heroism of the first responders  We honor all those working so hard today to prevent future attacks  Hopefully  this bill will fulfill its purpose of preventing the false alarms that can be so disruptive of our families and our communities in these difficult and dangerous times        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
