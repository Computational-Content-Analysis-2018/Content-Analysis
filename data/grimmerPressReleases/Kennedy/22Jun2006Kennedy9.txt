         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            Todays hearing is entitled Medical Liability  New Ideas for Making The System Work Better for Patients  Fair treatment for seriously injured patients is certainly the yardstick we should use to evaluate both the current system and proposals that would dramatically change it  Under close scrutiny  it becomes clear that many of the proposed reforms would actually harm seriously injured patients and deprive them of their basic rights    The historic right of injured persons  including victims of medical negligence  to have their claims for compensation decided by a jury is a fundamental part of our democratic process  It is the American way  The medical liability system cannot be made to work better for patients by denying them this basic guarantee of justice    The right to a jury trial is important to ensuring fair treatment in practice as well as in theory  It is the best assurance that an average citizen who has been injured will receive a fair hearing when he or she brings a case against often wealthy and powerful defendants  Numerous empirical studies  including those conducted by two of todays witnesses  have shown that most juries are conscientious and do render a decision based on the evidence    A recent study led by Professor David Studdert of the Harvard School of Public Health and published in the New England Journal of Medicine stated   Our findings point toward two general conclusions  One is that portraits of a malpractice system that is stricken with frivolous litigation are overblownA second conclusion is that the malpractice system performs reasonably well in its function of separating claims without merit from those with merit and compensating the latter   The study also determined that   nonpayment of claims with merit occurred more frequently than did payment of claims that were not associated with errors or injuries   Thus  while juries are an important guarantee of fairness for injured patients  there was no evidence of jury bias against defendants    Another of todays witnesses  Professor Neil Vidmar of Duke University School of Law  author of Medical Malpractice and the American Jury  reached similar findings  He concludes   Multiple sources of data strongly indicate that  on the whole  juries do not favor claimants over doctors and do not make negligence judgments based on the depth of defendants pockets or the severity of patients injuries  In fact  their verdicts are remarkably consistent with doctors ratings of negligence  On the issue of damages the story is much the sameawards are generally proportional to seriousness of injury and are not unreasonably above independent estimates of economic loss    Even though only one medical malpractice case in ten actually goes to trial  the fact that defendants know their conduct will be scrutinized by a jury is a major factor in producing fair settlements  In many cases  without the imminence of a jury trial  there would be no reasonable offer of settlement made by the defendant  The availability of a jury trial benefits injured patients who settle their claims as well as those who try their cases to verdict    There are several myths that opponents of the jury system rely on that are clearly false and should be rejected at the start of this hearing   The first myth is that medical malpractice cases are somehow responsible for the high cost of health care  There is no basis in fact for such a claim  The cost of medical malpractice premiums constitutes less than two thirds of 1    0 66   of the nation s health care expenditures each year  For example  in 2004  health care costs totaled  1 88 trillion  while the total cost of all medical malpractice insurance premiums was  11 4 billion  Malpractice premiums are not the cause of the high rate of medical inflation  Legislation changing the medical liability system will not make health care more affordable   The second myth is that restricting an injured patients right to recover fair compensation will reduce malpractice premiums  This claim is also false  Between 2000 and 2003  there were dramatic increases in the cost of medical malpractice insurance in states that already had damage caps and other restrictive tort reforms on the statute books  as well as in states that did not  No substantial increase in the number or size of malpractice judgments suddenly occurred which would have justified the enormous increase in premiums that many doctors were being forced to pay  Now rates have stabilized  again both in states with and states without damage caps  Unfortunately  the record shows that the cost of Malpractice insurance is effected much more by the investment earnings of insurance companies then by events in the nations courtrooms   Comprehensive national studies show that medical malpractice premiums are not significantly lower on average in states that have enacted damage caps and other restrictions on patient rights than in states without these restrictions  Insurance companies are merely pocketing the dollars which patients no longer receive when tort reform is enacted  Based on data from the Medical Liability Monitor on all fifty states  the average liability premium in 2005 for doctors practicing in states without caps on malpractice damages was actually lower than the average premium for doctors practicing in states with caps  There are many reasons why insurance rates vary substantially from state to state  The evidence clearly shows that it is not a state s tort laws which determine the rates  Caps do not make a significant difference in the malpractice premiums which doctors pay   The third myth is that capping how much compensation a seriously injured patient can receive will eliminate frivolous lawsuits  This too is false  In reality  such a provision only serves to hurt those patients who have suffered the most severe  life altering injuries and who have proven their cases in court   They are the paralyzed  the brain injured  and the blinded  They are the ones who have lost limbs  organs  reproductive capacity  and in some cases even years of life  These are life altering conditions which deprive a person of the ability to engage in many of the normal activities of day to day living  It would be terribly wrong to take their rights away    Many of the proposed alternatives to jury trials  including those contained in the Enzi bill  would limit compensation for seriously injured victims by imposing an arbitrary defined compensation schedule setting a ceiling on what the victim can recover for various types of injuries  This would have the same unfair effect as the damage caps contained in earlier tort reform bills  It would prevent the Court from considering the individual circumstances of a particular victims injuries and the impact those injuries have had and will continue to have on the victims life  Advocates of such restrictions talk about deterring frivolous cases  but caps by their nature apply only to proven cases involving the most severe injuries   One legitimate concern about the current medical liability system is that in some jurisdictions  victims must wait years for their day in court before a jury  But the answer to the problem of delay is certainly not to deprive victims of their right to that day in court  To do so would be both unreasonable and unjust  The appropriate response is to provide greater resources to our courts so that cases  especially those involving disabling injuries  reach trial more quickly  Mediation programs that are truly voluntary  and do not deprive victims of their right to a jury trial should efforts to quickly resolve the dispute fail  are also worthwhile  A number of states are already using some form of pretrial mediation successfully    However  there is an enormous difference between voluntary mediation programs that can make the system work better for patients and mandatory alternatives  such as administrative tribunals and health courts  that deprive injured patients of their historic right to a jury trial   Voluntariness is the first and most fundamental standard by which we should evaluate all alternative dispute resolution proposals  We should reject any proposal that would deny the injured patient the option of taking his malpractice claim before a jury  The patient must be given a genuine choice between a traditional court proceeding and the alternative process  That choice by the patient must be an informed choice  with a full understanding of the rights being relinquished  made after the injury has occurred  Merely obtaining the patients signature on one more consent form at the time he or she first visits the physician or enters the hospital is not sufficient  Such pro forma procedures make a mockery of informed consent  turning the principle of voluntary participation into a sham    Another important standard for evaluating proposed alternatives is whether they permit an individualized determination of the compensation that an injured patient should receive  Imposing a defined compensation schedule will deny the fact finder the ability to consider the full impact of the injury on the victims life  It will result in an arbitrary ceiling on compensation for those who have suffered the most severe  permanent injuries  That would be grossly unfair   Any proposal that will truly make the system work better for patients must meet these standards  Proposed alternatives that fail these basic tests will only harm the patients they purport to help  and should be rejected         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
