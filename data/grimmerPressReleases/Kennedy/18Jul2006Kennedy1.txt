         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Senator Jim Bunning sent a letter to Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman  asking him to refrain from taking any action to implement a proposed reorganization of the environmental  safety  and health programs and activities at the Department of Energy  until Congress has an opportunity to fully review and consider the proposal  Senators Kennedy and Bunning have been leaders in the effort to secure greater health and safety protections for Department of Energy employees  including cosponsoring legislation to establish enforceable worker safety and health standards at DOE facilities and to compensate them for occupational illnesses   In releasing the letter  Senator Kennedy said  By proposing to dismantle its worker safety and health office  the Department of Energy is putting the well being of its employees at grave risk  The Department has a terrible track record in caring for its employees safety and health  This reorganization moves the Department in the wrong direction  toward less oversight and accountability  I am pleased to join Senator Bunning in calling on the Department to abandon its ill conceived plan   July 18  2006   The Honorable Samuel W  Bodman  Secretary of Energy  U S  Department of Energy  Washington  D C  20585   Dear Secretary Bodman    We understand you are considering a reorganization of environment  safety  and health responsibilities currently under the Assistant Secretary for Environment  Safety and Health of the Department of Energy  DOE   As Senate co sponsors of legislation to establish enforceable worker safety and health standards at DOE facilities and legislation to compensate cold war veterans for occupational illnesses  we have a longstanding interest and involvement in this program  We are writing to express our deep concerns about this potential reorganization    As you know  this office has responsibility for several areas of critical importance to the 130 000 DOE employees and the public  DOE is a self regulating entity  not subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act  Within DOE  the ESH Office provides the only independent oversight of worker safety and health at DOE s nuclear facilities  In addition  it funds and oversees DOE s medical screening programs that monitor employees  workplace exposure to toxic or harmful conditions  The ESH Office s role in tracking beryllium disease is essential to ensuring that DOE employees get the medical attention they need and deserve  Any diminution in DOE s attention to these functions caused by their dispersal to other offices could be damaging to the health of the public and DOE s employees    We have seen no analysis to indicate that an organizational problem exists within the Office of Environment  Safety and Health  Absent a clearly defined problem  we do not see how an entire reorganization is justified  Moreover  we see no evidence that any consideration was given to strengthening and improving the current functions of the Office  rather dismantling the Office and sending its functions to different offices within DOE   We are also concerned that depriving environment  safety  and health responsibilities of leadership at the Assistant Secretary level will decrease the prominence of these issues on a day to day basis  There have been dire consequences for the environment and workers in the past when DOE has not paid sufficient attention to these issues  Indeed  it was precisely because of the serious failures of DOE to provide adequate worker safety protections that led then Secretary Harrington in the 1980 s to establish the ESH office with responsibility to oversee worker safety and health at DOE facilities  The need for continued high level attention has not diminished  These critically important issues still need and deserve careful oversight  We believe that adequate attention and oversight require a dedicated Assistant Secretary with an institutional mandate in this area from the President and Congress    We are particularly concerned that the reorganization will likely complicate the implementation of the DOE s new worker safety rule  10 C F R  851 et seq    The rule states  The Assistant Secretary for Environment  Safety and Health has played a central role in the development of the final rule and will continue to playa central role in its implementation and enforcement  Reorganizing the ESH Office that played a key role in the rule will create confusion in the field and among contractors who are currently preparing worker safety and health programs for submission prior to the February 26  2007 deadline  For example  the regulations assign particular duties to the Assistant Secretary for Environment  Safety and Health  If that position is eliminated  the regulations cannot be enforced as currently drafted  causing likely delay and confusion    We urge and request that you refrain from any action to implement a reorganization of the environmental  safety and health programs and activities at the Department until you  1  provide Congress with a detailed  written proposal on the reorganization   2  fully brief Congress about the entire final proposal  and  3  give Congress sufficient time to review this proposal and provide you with feedback on our concerns    Thank you for your attention to and consideration of this important issue    Sincerely   Jim Bunning    Edward M  Kennedy      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
