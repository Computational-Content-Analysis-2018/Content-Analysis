         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        Thank you  Stephanie Perrin  for that generous introduction  You are doing an extraordinary job at the Walnut Hill  School  Under your impressive leadership  it has become one of the most prominent schools for the arts in the United States  and I commend your achievements      I am grateful for your efforts to convene this distinguished group of scholars and academics to discuss arts education  Here in the Senate we are in the midst of important discussions about the No Child Left Behind bill which authorizes federal programs for elementary and secondary education  This timely symposium provides a very useful focus on an essential aspect of a well rounded education  the arts      I thought I could take this opportunity to say that I have enjoyed painting for many  many years myself  Of course  some of my colleagues in the Senate on the other side try to encourage me to take up painting full time  but Ive told them that I am committed to stay here in the Senate until I get the hang of it       From the earliest of times  music and dance and drawing have been a meaningful part of every civilization  a way of articulating joy and sadness  accomplishment and disappointment  The arts distinguish us from one another  define our individual backgrounds and ethnicities but  ultimately  unite us in our common humanity      It is important that our public policy reflect the importance of the arts in all of our lives  We should demonstrate our respect for creative accomplishment and provide an environment that is conducive to pursuing a life in music  dance  drama or painting  We should also ensure that the arts reach as far across America as possible to increase chances for each child to enjoy the arts    either to be a part of a performance or to attend one      A student whose life is enriched by the arts has a better chance of staying in school  achieving in school  and succeeding after he or she graduates from school  Academically and socially  through self confidence and improved communication skills  a young mind is broadened and a life enriched      My friend  composer John Williams  reminds me frequently that the ancient Greeks used music to teach math  Theirs was a civilization rooted in rich culture  committed to progress and destined for greatness      We have the evidence  student test scores rise as participation in arts education increases  SAT scores for students who take four years of arts and music classes were a full 100 points better than students without that opportunity      And  now  there is the expectation that we  too  can provide the kind of leadership that offers Americas youngest citizens a brighter future  A Harris Poll revealed that 93  of Americans believe that arts are vital to a well rounded education for children  They also strongly believe that a students experience at school improves measurably with involvement in the arts      Accordingly  the No Child Left Behind Act included the arts as a core subject  affirming our federal belief in their integral role that arts education plays in the educational experience  The bill also reauthorized the Arts in Education program at the Department of Education and asked the Department to submit a report to Congress every three years regarding programmatic outcomes and evaluations of model school based arts education programs funded by the Department      I am pleased that the bill recognized the important role of the Kennedy Center in national arts education programming  The Center has an extraordinary archive of programming that is available to school children and their families  These programs travel to communities across the nation  with accompanying educational materials  The Centers website provides an impressive range of curriculum based arts education programming for students and teachers alike to use and enjoy  These educational programs are an integral part of the Centers mission and a living legacy to President Kennedys belief that the arts should have a central role in our national life      As we move forward with the reauthorization of the Act  I hope we can further encourage and support arts education in the new iteration of the law  We will include a new program to provide funding for States  districts and schools to expand learning time for students  to provide more time for arts and music education and experiential learning  as well as reading and math  And we will ask States to keep track of how much time students are spending in arts and music  to ensure that all students receive a full and well rounded education      President Kennedy once said  A nation which disdains the mission of art invites the fate of Robert Frosts hired man  the fate of having nothing to look backward to with pride  and nothing to look forward to with hope      As I look around the room today  I see so many of you who have done so much to engender a cultural excitement and richness in our country  I know that it would make my brother very  very proud      Its a privilege to have so many distinguished panelists  including Lourdes Santiago  Principal of Sumner Elementary School  Steve Seidel  of the Harvard Graduate School of Education  and Ellen Winner of Boston College all here to share their expertise and guidance with us      As we move ahead  with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization this Congress and the years beyond  I look forward to working with all of you to ensure that the arts will remain at the very center of our national life      If we are successful  then I know that we will better equip the next generation of Americans to find their own voice  express their passions and dreams for themselves and our country  to lead by extraordinary example and to inspire the best in all whom they meet      In closing  Id like to congratulate each of you for the hard work and commitment that made this symposium such a success  I admire your dedication and very much appreciate all that you have done to advance the state of the arts in America      Thank you for including me in this important effort          Melissa Wagoner
