 pulverized concrete and highly metallic microscopic shards of glass  They  inhaled these substances into their lungs and gastrointestinal  systems Hundreds of thousands of them have  developed illnesses as a result  Healthy young fathers and mothers found they  could no longer play with their children  They developed the distinct dry World  Trade Center cough  chronic nasal congestion and rashes  Some found lumps in  their chests and were forced to retire permanently Today   well hear from experts who led the effort to build a realistic health  infrastructure for this unprecedented

that effort  and every one  of my colleagues has constituents from their own state who have enrolled in the  World Trade Center Health Registry Congress has begun to  fund these efforts  but more has
