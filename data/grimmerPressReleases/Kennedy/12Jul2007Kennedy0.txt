         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The Committee meets this morning to consider the nomination of Dr  James W  Holsinger of Kentucky to be Surgeon General of the United States  The Surgeon General is Americas doctor  Few positions in government offer greater opportunity to improve the lives of so many citizens  Past Surgeons General who have used their power well include Dr  C  Everett Koops historic and dedicated fight against the countrys AIDS epidemic  Dr  Luther Terrys ground breaking report on smoking that increased the American peoples concern about tobacco and led to a broad based anti smoking campaign  Dr  David Satchers emphasis on the unacceptable racial and ethnic health disparities that continue to plague us  Those are big shoes to fill  The next Surgeon General must be a strong champion of public health  At a time when the nation is deeply polarized on so many issues  we need someone who can unite Americans and who can be trusted by all  We must be confident that the Surgeon General will put public health first and leave politics and ideology behind  As this weeks testimony from former Surgeon General  Dr  Richard Carmona  showed  that standard has not been met  far from it  His testimony showed that the Office of the Surgeon General has become a morass of shameful political manipulation and distortion of science  Dr  Holsinger has a responsibility to provide strong assurances and a clear plan for seeing that these abuses are not repeated during his tenure  if he is confirmed Many of us are concerned about aspects of Dr  Holsingers record that indicate that Dr  Holsinger has let his ideological beliefs cloud his scientific judgment  These concerns are serious at any time  but all the more so in light of Dr  Carmonas alarming testimony Many concerns were raised by a paper that Dr  Holsinger wrote in 1991  on homosexuality for a study committee of the Methodist Church  Dr  Holsinger wrote this paper from his perspective as a medical doctor and he drew on his medical training to analyze the scientific studies he cited  Yet as I read it  it cherry picks the science and is widely disputed scientifically  For example  I recently received a letter from 9 doctors highly respected in their fields  including 1 of the authors of the papers cited by Dr  Holsinger denouncing the 1991 paper as wholly unscientific  biased and incredibly poor scholarship  Indeed  Dr  William F  Owen  a co author of one of the papers prominently cited in the 1991 paper stated recently that he was particularly incensed that Dr  Holsinger misrepresented  his  paper  which was actually written to help physicians feel comfortable in dealing with gay patients  Dr  Holsingers paper is ideological and decidedly NOT an accurate analysis of the science then available on homosexuality  It is not even an accurate representation of the scientific papers  which it cites as authority  Dr  Holsingers paper cherry picks and misuses data to support his thesis that homosexuality is unhealthy and unnatural  For example  a disproportionate amount of the data Dr  Hosinger relies on in his paper is pulled from emergency room and trauma studies   which are not at all representative of the homosexual population as a whole  Dr  Holsinger also artificially padded his papers bibliography by adding citations to three sources that either had nothing to do with either homosexuality or actually directly refuted his papers thesis  This blatant misuse of science gravely concerns me and I need to hear from Dr  Holsinger himself that he will not similarly misuse his position to push his personal ideological beliefs over scientific research We know that Dr  Holsinger has strong personal views  as we all do  about homosexuality  Our country is involved in an important national conversation about it and we will continue to have that conversation  Weve heard reports of Dr  Holsingers kindness toward people who are gays or lesbians  I have no reason to doubt any of these individual accounts of benevolence  But as Surgeon General  Dr  Holsinger will be responsible for providing the best medical and scientific information to all Americans and we must be assured that he can do so free of interference from his personal views Dr  Holsinger brings with him a wealth of experience as Kentuckys former Secretary of Health Services and his 26 years of service to Veterans Administration  I have heard impressive comments about his work against smoking and his passion for ending childhood obesity  His colleagues at the University of Kentucky speak very highly of him  But we need to be confident that he is committed to decision making based on sound science and good judgment  The Surgeon General must be a person who can be an indisputable respected and trusted voice about the health  wellness and safety  The Surgeon Generals message should be able to reach across the divisions that arise in a pluralistic society such as ours to educate  inform and protect all Americans  So  I welcome Dr  Holsinger  and I look forward to hearing from him       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
