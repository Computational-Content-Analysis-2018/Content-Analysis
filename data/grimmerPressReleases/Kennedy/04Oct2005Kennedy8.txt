         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today  President Bush said that Harriet Miers knows exactly what kind of judge I m looking for  If that s the case  then the United States Senate  and the American people  deserve to know what kind of justice will she be  She s a Bush loyalist  with little public record  Therefore she bears a heavy burden in demonstrating that she is an independent thinker who is as committed to the fundamental rights and freedoms as Justice O Connor has been for the last quarter century     To ensure that the American people understand who Harriet Miers is and what she stands for  I have urged President Bush to make available documents and information relating to Ms  Miers s service in the White House during both terms of the George W  Bush Presidential Administration and for Mr  Bush during his terms as Governor of the State of Texas  Although the Administration did not provide the Committee with files relating to John Roberts s service as Deputy Solicitor General of the United States  we were able to receive from the Reagan Library extensive memoranda and files relating to John Roberts s White House service in the Reagan Administration  The American people are entitled    at a minimum    to the same kind of memoranda and files relating to Ms  Miers  For a position as important as a lifetime appointment to the highest court of the land  the President should refrain from invoking executive privilege and give the American people a full and fair look at the record of Harriet Miers    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
