         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to the passage by the HELP Committee of the Higher Education Access Act of 2007 and the Higher Education Amendments of 2007  This is a historic day for America s students  The HELP Committee has passed two bills that will increase access to college and make sure scarce federal dollars are going where they are most needed  to students  This bill renews the promise that all citizens can achieve the American Dream  while also ensuring that our nation remains competitive in the global economy STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON THE INTRODUCTION OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS ACT OF 2007 AND THE HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 2007 Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions CommitteeWhen Congress first passed the Higher Education Act more than 40 years ago  we were guided by one simple principle  that no qualified student should be denied the opportunity to attend college because of the cost  In 1965  and again in 1972 when we established the Pell Grant  we recognized that access to a college education is a vital gateway to helping our citizens achieve the American dream  Shamefully  weve lost sight of that goal in recent years  Today  Americans are coming face to face with rapid changes in the global economy  Theyve seen the value of their wages decline  the cost of living go up  and their jobs shipped overseas  When I graduated from high school  good jobs were available to high school graduates  That is no longer the case  Today  60 percent of new jobs require some post secondary education  compared to just 15 percent of new jobs half a century ago  In the face of these challenges  a college education is more important than ever  But its never been more difficult to afford  The cost of college has more than tripled over the last twenty years  Today  average tuition  fees and room and board at our public colleges is almost  13 000  and its more than  30 000 at private colleges  Each year  more than 400 000 talented  qualified students dont attend a four year college because they cant afford it  At the same time  the buying power of the Pell Grant  the lifeline to college for low income students  has shrunk dramatically  Twenty years ago  the maximum Pell Grant covered 55 percent of costs at a public four year college  Today  it covers less than a third of those costs As a result  students are sinking deeper and deeper into student loan debt  In 1993  fewer than half of all students took out loans to finance their education  but today  more than two thirds of students borrow for college  Today  the average student leaves college with more than  19 000 in student loan debt  This mountain of debt is distorting countless Americans basic life choices  Its causing them to delay getting married  buying a home  and starting a family  Its also discouraging many young people from entering occupations such as teaching  social work and law enforcement  the low paying but vital jobs that bring large rewards for our society  Meanwhile  as our students struggle to pay back their loans  the lenders who offer them are making more money than ever  We pay them enormous subsidies to take part in the federal loan programs  because the structure of the student loan programs is basically unchanged from forty years ago  when major subsidies were needed to attract lenders to participate  Today  thousands of lenders participate  and the largest  Sallie Mae  is so profitable that a group of investors recently offered to buy it for  25 billion  more than 30 percent above the value of its stock  That is why the legislation our Committee is considering today is so important  The Higher Education Access Act of 2007 and the Higher Education Amendments of 2007 will provide more than  17 billion to help students and families pay for college  This legislation will help reverse the crisis in college affordability  It will immediately and dramatically increase grant aid for Pell Grant recipients  help students manage their debt by capping student loan payments at 15 percent of their monthly income  and forgive the loans of those who enter societys most valuable professions  It will restore balance to our broken student loan system by reducing unnecessary lender subsidies  To ensure that lenders and colleges follow high ethical standards  weve included provisions from my Student Loan Sunshine Act  and several other lender ethics and borrower friendly proposals from Senator Enzi and Senator Clinton  Senator Dodd will be complementing these efforts in the Banking Committee with companion legislation regarding private educational loans In short  our proposals will restore the fundamental principle that guided the Higher Education Act at its inception  that no student should have to mortgage his or her future in order to pay for higher education today  This legislation is the product of many hours of bipartisan negotiations among our Committee Members and staff  Over the past four months  our staff has met  on a bipartisan basis  for more than 100 hours to work on these bills  Every Member of this Committee has had multiple opportunities to shape their provisions  and we will continue to work together as our process moves forward  I particularly want to mention that well be working closely with Senator Alexander on his ideas related to college accreditation Without a doubt  the most important aspect of this legislation is the fact that it dramatically increases need based grant aid to students  Everything we know about the college affordability crisis tells us that low income students and families are struggling the most  Earlier this year  after four years of broken promises from President Bush  the Democratic Congress responded to this challenge by increasing the maximum Pell Grant to  4310  Now  the Higher Education Access Act will build on what we started by increasing the maximum grant for Pell recipients to  5 100 next year  a  790 increase  and to  5 400 in 2011  Make no mistake  the single best thing we can do to increase college access and affordability in America is to focus on increasing need based grant aid  That is exactly what this legislation does  But it goes even further  Our young graduates are painfully aware of how difficult those first years after college can be  when their paychecks are small  but their student loan bills are large  Our legislation will help these students by giving them the option of capping their loan payments at 15 percent of their monthly discretionary income  It will also stem the tide of young people who are choosing not to enter public service professions by providing loan forgiveness to borrowers who stay in those professions for ten years  Our society needs more teachers  emergency management and law enforcement professionals  public health doctors and nurses  social workers  librarians  public interest lawyers  and early childhood educators  Senator Harkin has been particularly vigorous in his support of loan forgiveness for public interest lawyers  Under our bill  well produce more of them  because they  and all the groups Ive just mentioned    will be eligible for loan forgiveness A number of our Members have worked hard to ensure that our men and women and the military  and their families  are treated fairly in the student loan system  Senators Bingaman  Murray and Murkowski deserve our thanks for authoring several provisions that will extend loan deferments for active duty service members and take other steps that will help those who serve our country attend college Weve heard the arguments from the big lenders  They claim that if Congress reduces their excess subsidies to pay for the measures Ive just described  theyll be forced to reduce the benefits they offer to borrowers on student loans  But obviously  grant aid is far better than any benefit a lender could offer on a loan  And the lenders wont tell you that many of the benefits they offer are phantom benefits  Some lenders offer more benefits to students at high end colleges  and fewer to community college and career college students  And often  most borrowers never actually receive all the benefits  because they often depend on students meeting certain conditions  like paying their loans on time for three years In the long term  we must inject more market based competition into the student loan system  to make it as efficient to taxpayers as possible  Right now  theres very little competition in the loan programs because many colleges enter special deals to work with a handful of lenders  and students seldom get their loans from anywhere else  Instead  lenders should compete against each other to participate in the federal student loan program  The Higher Education Access Act takes a step in this direction by creating a pilot program in which an auction is used to see what subsidies are truly necessary to keep loans available to students  The money we save through this pilot will be sent back where it is needed most    to increase financial aid for students  Im pleased that Senator Gregg has joined our call to use auctions to operate the student loan programs  and I thank him for his leadership of this long overdue idea Our legislation also addresses the serious ethics scandal over student loans  As investigations by New York Attorney General Cuomo  other states  and our Committee have found  many lenders are entering into sweetheart deals with colleges  Some lenders offer gifts to college and university employees in order to secure their students loan business  Weve documented how lenders who participate in the federal student loan program offer educational conferences at luxury hotels  and offer free entertainment and free tickets to sporting events to college officials  in order to entice those officials to recommend the lenders to their students  Our legislation makes these practices illegal  and protects students by ensuring that when a college recommends a lender  its based on the best interest of students  and nothing else  Id like to acknowledge all the Members of the Committee for contributing to a strong bipartisan proposal on this issue  The bills we consider today will take other common sense steps to improve our higher education system for students and families  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Reed and Senator Enzi  our legislation will dramatically simplify the federal financial aid form  the FAFSA  and examine how we can streamline the federal financial aid process even more in the future  As we provide more aid to students  our bills will recognize that colleges also need to do their part to keep college costs down  The Higher Education Access Act will hold colleges accountable for skyrocketing college costs by creating a nationwide watch list of colleges whose costs are increasing costs at a rate greater than their peers  and by encouraging the Department of Education and colleges to publish more consumer friendly information about college costs and programs Our legislation continues our focus on teacher preparation by strengthening partnerships with the K 12 systems who hire the teachers  based on the most successful strategies like induction and mentoring  Senators Obama and Reed have been a leader on these provisions in the bill  Senator Brown has worked hard to maintain the strength of the TRIO programs  which prepare students to go to college and stay in college  We include a new program to support the graduation of more registered nurses  an effort championed by Senator Sanders and Senator Mikulski  We also create a new student safety grant program to help colleges and universities improve their campus safety and emergency response systems  As the nightmare at Virginia Tech made us all too aware  tragedy can strike anywhere  including on college campuses  From our earliest days as a nation  education has been the engine of the American dream  We cant let it stall today  Our goal is to give all students and their parents the support they need to benefit from a college education and keep our country strong in the years ahead  Access to college is more than ever the key to opportunity for students and the key to a strong America for the future  and I urge the Committee to approve this important legislation       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
