         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today  Senator Kennedy and his colleagues introduced a measure to create a three month extension for the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act to make this a better bill  Senator Kennedy opposes the Conference Report on the PATRIOT Act as it currently stands over remaining concerns on its far reaching investigatory tools  particularly the National Security Letters  Today s bipartisan legislation is co sponsored by Senators Sununu  Leahy  Craig  Rockefeller  Murkowski  Levin and Durbin     Below is the text of the letter sent Friday to Chairman Specter requesting the extension  With the introduction of today s bill   Senator Kennedy offered the following statement     I hope we can reach agreement to extend the date of the sunset provisions of the PATRIOT Act from December 31  2005 under current law to March 31  2006     We obviously need additional time to resolve a number of issues related to reauthorization of the Act  Unfortunately  our House colleagues waited six months to appoint conferees  and the current rushed negotiations won t be able to achieve a satisfactory resolution in the few days remaining in the session     With a March 31 deadline  we can deal responsibly with the major remaining concerns about the contentious and sweeping methods of obtaining detailed bank and telephone records  such as the use of National Security Letters     One of the most glaring omissions in this conference report is the failure to include a sunset on these letters  even though it would be consistent with the new reporting and auditing requirements included in the conference report     As we know from the original PATRIOT Act debate  sunset provisions on the most far reaching investigatory methods are essential to allow adequate Congressional oversight over law enforcement and counter terrorism activities  Congress clearly needs to be able to review the use of other controversial methods     We have not yet achieved the goal set by the 9 11 Commissioners  to adopt governmental powers that truly enhance our national security while ensuring adequate oversight over their use  That should be our guiding principle  With so much at stake  I urge my colleagues to take sufficient time to adopt necessary reforms and achieve a bipartisan consensus that restores the public trust     December 7  2005   The Honorable Arlen Specter Chairman U S  Senate Committee on the Judiciary 224 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington D C   20510   The Honorable James Sensenbrenner Chairman U S  House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary 2449 Rayburn House Office Building  Washington D C   20515   Dear Chairman Specter and Chairman Sensenbrenner    We write to you about our decision not to sign the House Senate conference report on USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization  The conference committee had an opportunity to adjust the PATRIOT Act s expiring provisions to protect the rights and liberties of all Americans more effectively  Regrettably  the opportunity was lost when Democratic conferees were excluded from key negotiations and the conference failed to meet to consider and vote on amendments  The resulting conference report falls short of what the American people have every reason to expect Congress to achieve in defending their rights while advancing their security     The American people do not believe that security and liberty are mutually exclusive goals  and they are right  For four years  the protection of civil liberties has been at the forefront in debates over the PATRIOT Act  The conference report makes some improvements to the current Act  but it fails to make others  and even takes several steps backward  We welcome the enhanced oversight provisions  but they do not offset the report s deficiencies  The Senate bill  which the Senate Judiciary Committee and then the Senate adopted unanimously  reached a far better balance    The reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act must have the confidence of the American people  The Congress should not rush ahead to enact flawed legislation to meet a deadline that is within our power to extend  We owe it to the American people to get this right     If a satisfactory bill cannot be achieved by the end of the year  we propose a three month extension for the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act  Congress has had years to improve and renew these provisions of the PATRIOT Act  but has failed to act expeditiously  The deadline that Congress imposed to ensure oversight and accountability should not become a barrier to achieving bipartisan compromise  This is a vital debate  and these are vital issues  If three more months are needed to make this a better bill  then we should take and prudently use that time    Sincerely    _____________________________ _____________________________ PATRICK LEAHY JOHN D  ROCKEFELLER IV Ranking Member  Vice Chairman  Committee on the Judiciary Select Committee on
