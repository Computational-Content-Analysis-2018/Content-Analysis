         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on President Bushs address at the NAACP annual convention  Senator Kennedy will address the convention and discuss the Voting Rights Act tomorrow at approximately 11 00 AM   Below is Kennedys statement   As President Bush addresses the NAACP and the nation tomorrow  I urge him to state unequivocally that he supports the bill to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act passed last week in the House of Representatives and that he opposes any amendments  The Act protects one of the most basic rights in our democratic society    the right to vote     which Martin Luther King called civil right number one  Unfortunately when I asked Attorney General Gonzales for the Administrations support  he said that he was not prepared at the time to make that commitment  The issue of Voting Rights transcends party lines  as is clear from the bipartisan support for the bill to guarantee that the right to vote is not denied to any American because of race  national origin or proficiency in English  The bill deserves the full support of this Administration         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
