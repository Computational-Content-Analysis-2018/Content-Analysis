         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  joined by his Democratic colleagues  sent the following letter to the President Bush  urging him to reverse the decision to end the Medicare Part D transition policy that expires tomorrow  April 1  2006 Senator Kennedy said  America s seniors and the disabled have had months of headaches since the prescription drug program was enacted and now the Administration wants to end the transition policy that was meant to simplify this mess  Seniors are facing mountains of paperwork and countless hours on the phone to navigate this system  and we ought to help them in any way possible to ensure they re getting the prescription drug coverage they need and deserve  Under the transition policy  plans were required to provide coverage during the transition period even if the drug was not on the plan s formulary  The transition period was originally created to last for one month  but was extended to April 1st due to the chaotic start of the Administration s prescription drug program The transition period was intended to give Medicare beneficiaries time to find a drug plan that covered their needed prescription drugs  or to request an exception from non coverage for a medically necessary drug  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  has said that plans need to educate seniors about their options when the transition ends  including appeal rights  changing plans  or changing prescription drugs  But neither CMS nor the plans have done this  and many of the problems seniors and the disabled have had in getting the drugs they need when the plan began in January are likely to again occur since the underlying problems with the program have not been addressed  The text of the letter and its signatories are included below  March 28  2006 The Honorable George W  Bush The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave   N W  Washington DC 20500 Dear Mr  President  We re writing to express our deep concern that on April 1st  the Administration is planning to end its transition policy that requires insurance companies to cover the prescription drugs needed by seniors and disabled persons enrolled in Medicare  Medicare beneficiaries across America still have had great difficulty under the Part D drug program obtaining drugs they need  and are often forced to pay unaffordable prices for their prescriptions  The transition policy has helped Medicare beneficiaries obtain the prescription drugs they need  since so many of the underlying problems in the Part D program have not yet been solved  We re very concerned that many elderly and disabled citizens will not be able to obtain the drugs they desperately need if the transition policy ends  Many will not even learn their drugs are no longer covered until they go to their pharmacy to fill a prescription and are turned away  There has still been little or no education as to what happens when the transition policy ends  including how to file appeals  The Administration should be doing all it can to improve the new Medicare drug program  not take decisions that will worsen the crisis  We therefore urge you to reverse the decision to end the transition policy  Seniors deserve a Medicare drug program which is effective and comprehensive  and that goal will be undermined if this decision is not reversed  Sincerely  Signed  Senator Edward M  Kennedy Senator John Kerry Senator Christopher Dodd Senator Maria Cantwell Senator Frank Lautenberg Senator John Rockefeller Senator Hillary Clinton Senator Patrick Leahy Senator Herb Kohl Senator Russell Feingold  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
