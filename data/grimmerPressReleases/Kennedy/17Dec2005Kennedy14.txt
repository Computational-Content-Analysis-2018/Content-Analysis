         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Last night the Senate passed by unanimous consent the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005  The House is expected to pass it today  Senator Kennedy is a co sponsor and issued the following statement in support of the measure     STATEMENT OF EDWARD M  KENNEDY  Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 H R  3402 December 16  2005   Mr  President  I strongly support the Violence Against Women Act of 2005  and I commend Senator Biden  Senator Specter  Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch for their bipartisan leadership on this very important legislation  The current authorization for the Act expired on September 30  and it has taken far too long to build upon the successes of existing anti violence against women programs and enhance the safety and security of the victims of domestic violence  dating violence  sexual assault  and stalking     We have a responsibility in Congress to do all we can to eradicate domestic violence  Our bill gives the safety of women and their families the high priority it deserves  and I urge my colleagues in the House to support it    This bill eases housing problems for battered women  It also includes new funds for training health professionals to recognize and respond to domestic and sexual violence  and to help public health officials recognize the need as well  The research funds provided by the bill are vital  because we need the best possible interventions in health care settings to prevent future violence     Violence against women can occur at any point in a woman s life  beginning in childhood and taking place in a wide variety of circumstances and settings  It s essential for any bill on such violence to include girls and young women as well  and this bill does that    Another important section of the bill provides greater help to immigrant victims of domestic violence  sexual assault  trafficking and similar offenses  This section will remove the obstacles in our current immigration laws that prevent such victims from safely fleeing the violence in their lives  and help dispel the fear that often prevents them from reporting their abusers to appropriate authorities    Eliminating domestic violence is especially challenging in immigrant communities  since victims often face additional cultural  linguistic and immigration barriers to their safety  Abusers of immigrant spouses or children are liable to use threats of deportation to trap them in endless years of violence  Many of us have heard horrific stories of violence in cases where the threat of deportation was used against spouses or children    If you leave me  I ll report you to the immigration authorities  and you ll never see the children again  Or the abuser says  If you tell the police what I did  I ll have immigration deport you     Congress has made significant progress in enacting protections for these immigrant victims  but there are still many women and children whose lives are in danger  Our legislation does much more to protect them  and I commend the sponsors for making domestic violence in immigrant communities an important priority    The improvements in immigration protections in the bill are designed to help prevent the deportation of immigrant victims who qualify for immigration relief under the Violence Against Women Act  VAWA   It will consolidate adjudications of such immigration cases in a specially trained unit  enhance confidentiality protections for victims  and offer protection to vulnerable immigrant victims who had been left out of the protections in current law     Overall  the bill represents major new progress in protecting women from violence  and I look forward to early action by the House in this important reauthorization    I ask unanimous consent that a more detailed summary of the provisions on immigrants be printed at this point in the Record  Section 104    This section provides important improvements to legal services for immigrant victims of domestic violence  sexual assault  trafficking and other crimes  This provision authorizes organizations receiving funds from the Legal Services Corporation to use the funds including Legal Services funds to represent any victim of domestic violence  sexual assault  trafficking or other crimes listed under the U visa provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act  Across the country  many immigrant victims have nowhere to turn for legal help  This section will allow Legal Services Corporation funded programs to represent victims in any type of case  including family law  public benefits  health  housing  immigration  restraining orders  and other legal matters  regardless of the victim s immigration status     Section 805    This section assures that self petitioners under the Act and their children are guaranteed all of the Act s aging out protections and any benefits they qualify for under the Child Status Protection Act of 2002  which deals with the lengthy processing backlogs which made aging out a significant problem for child beneficiaries who turned 21 years old    Section 813    This section deals with cases of immigrant victims of abuse who have been ordered removed  or who are subject to expedited removal if they leave the U S  and attempt to reenter the country later  Once they are reinstated in removal proceedings  they cannot obtain relief under current law  even if they have a pending application for such relief  This section makes clear that the Secretary of Homeland Security  the Attorney General  and the Secretary of State have discretion to consent to a victim s reapplication for admission after a previous order of removal  deportation  or exclusion  Section 814    This section gives the Department of Homeland Security statutory authority to grant work authorization to approved self petitioners under the Act  This provision will streamline a petitioner s ability to receive work authorization  without having to rely solely upon deferred action as the mechanism through which petitioners receive work authorization     The section also grants work authorization to abused spouses of persons admitted under the A  E 3  G  or H non immigrant visa programs  These spouses have legal permission to live in the United States under their spouses  visas  but they are not entitled to work authorization under current law  The spouses and their children are completely dependent on the abuser for their immigration status and financial support  and they often have nowhere to turn for help  Financial dependence on their abusers is a primary reason why battered women are often reluctant to cooperate in domestic violence criminal cases  With employment authorization  many abused spouses protected by this section will be able to work legally  and can have a source of income independent of their abusers  Requests for work authorization by these abused spouses will be handled under the procedures for petitioners under the Act and the specially trained VAWA unit at the Vermont Service Center will adjudicate these requests     The VAWA unit employs specially trained adjudicators who handle petitions filed by at risk applicants for relief under the Act  for T visas  for U visas  for adjustment of status and employment authorizations  as well as protections under the Haitian Refugee Immigrant Fairness Act and Sections 202 and 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act  The unit also deals with waivers for battered spouses  parole for their children granted VAWA cancellation  and parole for approved petitioners under the Act  Section 818    This section extends confidentiality protections to the Department of Homeland Security  the Department of Justice  and the Department of State  Under these provisions  immigration enforcement agents and government officials may not use information furnished by an abuser  crime perpetrator or trafficker to make an adverse determination on the admissibility or deportability of an individual  One of the goals of this section is to ensure that these government officials do not initiate contact with abusers  call abusers as witnesses  or rely on information from abusers to apprehend  detain and attempt to remove victims of domestic violence  sexual assault  trafficking  or other crimes    This section gives the specially trained VAWA unit the discretion to refer victims to non profit non governmental organizations to obtain a range of needed assistance and services  Referrals should be made to programs with expertise in providing assistance to immigrant victims of violence and can be made only after obtaining written consent from the immigrant victim     The section also requires the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to provide guidance to officers and employees who have access to confidential information under this section in order to protect victims of domestic violence  sexual assault  trafficking and other crimes from harm that could result from inappropriate disclosure of confidential information  Section 827    This section deals with issues under the Real ID Act of 2005 which imposes a new national requirement that all applicants for driver s licenses or state identification cards must furnish their physical residential address in order to obtain a federally valid license or identification card  The current requirement jeopardizes victims of violence who may be living in confidential shelters for battered women  or fleeing their abuser  The section instructs the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration to give special consideration to these victims by allowing them to use an alternate safe address in lieu of their residence  Our goal here is to guarantee the continuing protection and necessary mobility for these women and their families     Section 831    This section is intended to deter abusive U S  citizens from using the fianc  visa process and to help foreign fianc s obtain information about their prospective U S  citizen spouse that can help them protect themselves against domestic violence  Citizens filing K visa fianc  petitions will be required to disclose certain criminal convictions on the on the K visa application for a fianc  or spouse     In addition  this section requires the Secretary of Homeland Security  in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to develop an information pamphlet for K visa applicants on the legal rights and available resources for immigrant victims of domestic violence    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
