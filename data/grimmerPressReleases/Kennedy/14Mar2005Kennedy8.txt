         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  Chairman  thank you for calling this important hearing on the 9 11 Commission staff report on terrorist travel  I commend the Commission and staff for their thoughtful analysis of the events leading up to September 11th  and for their recommendations for reducing our vulnerability to attacks in the future   We ve made a number of significant improvements since 9 11  but no one would argue we ve adequately repaired the broken system of intelligence  border security and immigration   Better information sharing and training are essential to enable our frontline officers and inspectors to detect and intercept potential terrorists before they do us harm   The Intelligence Reform Act Congress passed last December calls for a strategy to combine travel intelligence  operations and law enforcement in a joint effort to intercept terrorists and identify those who facilitate their travel  It also requires improvements in technology and training to assist border  consular and immigration officers in this mission  and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about the progress being made   A survey by the American Federation of Government Employees last summer found that a majority of the 500 Customs and Border Protection officers say they do not have the tools  training  or support to stop potential terrorists from entering the country  According to the 9 11 Commission staff report  al Qaeda altered passports in four ways    by substituting photos  adding false entry exit stamps  removing visas and bleaching stamps  and counterfeiting passports and substituting pages  I m also interested in hearing about ways to prove training and expedite access to specialists to obtain useful real time intelligence about terrorist organizations and operations   We also need to respect civil rights and civil liberties  As the 9 11 Commission stated  We advocate a system for screening  not categorical profiling  A screening system looks for particular  identifiable suspects or indicators of risk  It does not involve guesswork about who might be dangerous   Our goal is also to strengthen the security of our borders without unduly impeding the legitimate flow of people and commerce  More than 30 million foreign nationals enter the United States legally each year as tourists  students  or temporary workers  Over four hundred million visitors a year cross legally from Canada or Mexico to conduct daily business or visit family members  The goal of border security is to keep out those who pose risk to our security in a way that does not seriously undermine the efficient flow of legitimate border traffic that is an essential part of our national economy   Persons who obtain tourist visas to enter the US can stay here for six months  even if they only planned to stay for two weeks  Most of the 9 11 hijackers entered with tourist visas  and some have argued that routine six month stays is related to security concerns  But  limiting the amount of stay in the US could lead to longer inspection lines and discouraging tourism without substantially deterring terrorism   I look forward to learning more from our witnesses about the many aspects of the critical issues of border security  and how Congress can be most helpful in accumulating the best possible improvements   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
