         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  U S  Senators Edward Kennedy  D MA   Susan Collins  R ME    Norm Coleman  R MN   and Russ Feingold  D WI  are calling for an increase in the amount of money given to students who qualify for Pell Grants   The Senators are urging Office of Management and Budget Director Rob Portman to increase the maximum Pell grant award in the Presidents fiscal year 2008 budget   The current maximum Pell grant award of  4 050 has not been raised in more than five years  and due to rising tuition costs  the Pell grant does not yield the same purchasing power as it has in the past   Today  the maximum Pell grant award covers only 33 percent of the average cost of attending a public  four year institution  compared to 30 years ago when it covered 80 percent of these costs   As a result  students are becoming more dependent on federal and private loans to finance their college education   The Senators wrote a bipartisan letter to Director Portman seeking the increase  Students and families are pinching pennies and going into deep debt to afford college  said Senator Kennedy   Raising the maximum Pell grant  the lifeline to college for low income and first generation college students  should be at the top of the nations agenda for higher education to ensure students dont have to mortgage their futures in exchange for a college degree  The price of a college education continues to rise at public and private institutions all over the country   We must do all we can to keep the doors to higher education open and accessible to all students  particularly the most disadvantaged students  said Senator Collins   Pell grants make the difference in whether students have access to higher education  and a chance to participate fully in the American dream  Education is the foundation upon which the idea of equal opportunity rests  However  with tuition rates at an all time high  many working families are finding the financial burden insurmountable  said Senator Coleman  Pell grants have made college more affordable and accessible to millions of students  By increasing the award amount we can continue to make a college education a reality for many more  while strengthening our nations ability to compete in a global economy  The Pell Grant award provides critical help to many young Americans who hope to continue their education  Senator Feingold said   This widely successful program has helped millions of Americans  regardless of income status  make higher education a reality   By opening the door to higher education  we are investing in the future of this nation  The Pell grant program is one of the most successful federal need based aid programs in our nations history   It has been instrumental in helping millions of lower income students fulfill their dream of pursing a college education   But its stagnant funding and the growing reliance on student loans are having particularly strong deterrent effects on students from low income families and their decision on whether to attend college  One study found that students who rely on aid to afford college tuition costs are significantly less willing to finance their education through borrowed money than their economically wealthier counterparts  A copy of the letter is available upon request    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
