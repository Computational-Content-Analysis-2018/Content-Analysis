         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC Senators Edward M  Kennedy  Ken Salazar and Bob Casey joined Reverend Bill Calhoun of the Montview Presbyterian Church  Rabbi David Saperstein of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism  and Pastor Derrick Harkins of the 19th Street Baptist Church in support of the Childrens Health Insurance Program  They discussed the need to renew this legislation  which would address the need to provide health insurance to the 6 6 million children who are currently enrolled in the program  as well as extending the benefits to 3 2 million children who are currently uninsured   Remarks As Prepared for Delivery Psalms teach us that true leaders should defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy   Psalm 72 4 What says more about our character as a nation than how we care for the children of this country  What says more about our morality than the way we ensure that each and every child can make the most of their God given talents  And what says more about our priorities than a Congress that puts resources towards a program for kids that saves lives and gives a healthy start to our children Today  there are still 9 million children without health insurance  Thats not just wrong  its outrageous  it is immoral  All children deserve a healthy start in life  and all parents deserve the peace of mind that they can take their child to the doctor if theyre sickWhen children get the care they need  they do better academically  emotionally  physically and sociallythis is an investment in their futuresQuality heath care for children isnt just a nice idea  Its not something we wish we could do  Its something we have to do and something we can do In the Bible  Luke writes that when children gathered around Jesus to receive his care his disciples tried to shoo them away  But Jesus called the children to him and said  Let the little children come to me  and do not hinder them  for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these   Luke 18 The children of America need our care  They need our compassion  They need us to not shortchange their dreams but instead to give them the chance in life they deserve     BILL SUMMARY CoverageThe bill will cover 4 0 million children who would otherwise be uninsured  The 4 million who will be enrolled in either Medicaid or CHIP includes 800 000 children who are currently enrolled in CHIP but would lose coverage because of funding shortfalls  2 7 million currently eligible but unenrolled children  and 600 000 newly eligible children  An additional 2 1 million children who currently have private coverage would enroll in CHIP  crowd out effect   for a total of 6 1 million new enrollees  reducing the number of uninsured children by more than one third AllocationsCHIP funds will be better targeted by changing factors that go into determining state allotments  State allocations will be based primarily on past CHIP spending in each state  with some flexibility to anticipate future need  The bill includes a contingency fund for states facing shortfalls  including those due to unforeseen circumstances  economic downturns  or emergencies  FinancingThe bill provides an additional  35 billion in funds  Along with the  25 billion in baseline funding   60 billion will be available over the next five years  While this is less than the  50 billion in the budget resolution  it will provide enough funds to reach about 4 million new children  The bill includes incentive payments to states through bonus payments to encourage states to enroll more eligible children  The bill is fully compliant with pay go  with a 61 cent increase in the existing tobacco tax funding the CHIP increase EligibilityThe bill eliminates coverage for childless adults within two years  with states having the option of transitioning these adults to their Medicaid program  States will be unable to apply for waivers in future to cover parents  and states that currently cover parents will get reduced match rate between the current Medicaid match and the enhanced CHIP match  States will have an additional option to cover pregnant women at state option without having to apply for a waiver Income levelsStates will be allowed to set income levels for children up to 300  of poverty  If states want to cover children at higher income levels  they will receive the lower Medicaid match rather than the enhanced CHIP match BenefitsThe bill will apply your mental health parity language to the CHIP program  It also includes  200 million in state grants for dental coverage  We tried to get a mandate for dental coverage in the bill but were not able  While all states currently provide dental coverage  it is often the first thing dropped when states face fiscal downturns Outreach and EnrollmentThe bill provides an additional  100 million in new grants to fund outreach and enrollment  This will include a national campaign to raise awareness of CHIP  along with more targeted local campaigns  and campaigns aimed at children in rural areas and racial and ethnic minority children  including Native Americans  The bill also includes  49 million in demonstration funds to allow up to 10 states to implement express lane enrollment Citizenship DocumentationWhile the bill extends citizenship documentation requirements to CHIP  they currently only apply to Medicaid   the bill allows states new options under Medicaid and CHIP that are much less onerous than the current requirements  States will be able to meet the documentation requirements by submitting social security numbers  and will no longer have to submit original birth certificates or passports QualityThe bill requires HHS to develop quality measures and funds demonstration programs to improve quality and encourage the development of electronic health records for Medicaid and CHIP Premium AssistanceThe bill allows some additional flexibility for states to offer subsidies to qualified  cost effective employer sponsored coverage KEY FACTS The Childrens Health Insurance Program was enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997  with  40 billion appropriated over the 10 year authorization period  CHIP currently covers about 6 million children throughout the course of the year  with about 4 million children enrolled at any point in time  About 9 million children remain uninsured  About 6 million of these uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP but unenrolled   12 to  15 billion is needed over the next five years beyond the  5 billion per year in the baseline to maintain the existing level of CHIP coverage  About  50 to  60 billion is needed beyond the baseline spending over the next 5 years to provide sufficient funding to cover eligible but unenrolled children   The Presidents budget would provide only  4 8 in new funding over the next five yearsapproximately  8 billion less than what is needed to keep current children covered  Fourteen states  including Massachusetts  are projected to face shortfalls this year totaling  744 million  Georgia is the first state expected to face a shortfall and they have announced they will stop enrolling children on March 11  Before CHIP was enacted in 1997  about 23  of children were uninsured  Today  that number has dropped to about 15 6   27 and the District of Columbia cover children up to 200  of poverty 8 states do not cover children to at least 200  of poverty 15 states cover children at incomes above 200  of poverty  The average federal match for CHIP is 70  compared to 57  for Medicaid 10 states have waivers to cover parents through CHIP  7 states cover pregnant women  and 5 states cover childless adults   Adults make up about 10  of all CHIP enrollees  States are no longer allowed to cover childless adults through CHIP  although the states that already do so can continue to cover them CHIP FACT SHEET CHIP currently covers about 6 million children throughout the course of the year  with about 4 million children enrolled at any point in time  About 9 million children remain uninsured  About 6 million of these uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP  but unenrolled  Before CHIP was enacted in 1997  about 23  of children were uninsured  Today  that number has dropped to about 15 6   Significant declines in infant mortality  8 5   and childhood deaths  5 1    as well as reductions in low birth weight  7 8    have been attributed directly to expansions in eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP 1 Studies of CHIPs impact have found an association between enrollment in the program and improved school performance among low income children  Improvements include increased school attendance  greater ability to pay attention in class  and increased ability to participate in school and normal childhood activities 1 27 states and the District of Columbia cover children up to 200  of poverty  8 states do not cover children to at least 200  of poverty 15 states cover children at incomes above 200  of poverty   40 000 for a family of four in 2007  Massachusetts CHIP Massachusetts currently covers 162  679 children and 4 909 pregnant women under CHIP  Massachusetts utilized a combination program consisting of both a Medicaid expansion program and a separate program to cover children with higher incomes   Under the recent Massachusetts Health Reform package  the Massachusetts SCHIP program has increased coverage for children up to 300  of the Federal Poverty Level  Massachusetts is one of 14 states facing a shortfall in 2007  Massachusetts will have a remaining shortfall of  87 7 million starting on May 4 if Congress does not step in  Financial Impacts of CHIP A recent study in Pediatrics found that a 10  decrease in CHIP enrollment would cost  3 4 million in additional health expenses  or  2121 for each child disenrolled  This increase in costs is due to shifting care into emergency rooms and hospitalizations   CHIP or Medicaid health benefits provide greater access to preventive and well child care  75  of children in CHIP accessed well child or preventive care in 2005  while only 47  of the uninsured were able to do so   Children in CHIP for a full year are more likely to access preventive care than children of the same income with private insurance   Only 3  of children in CHIP have no regular source of health care  while 28  of uninsured children no regular source of health care  Research suggests that having a regular source of health care can improve quality of care   Enrollment in CHIP helps families to manage asthma  A New York study found children with asthma enrolled in SCHIP experienced fewer asthma attacks and had fewer hospitalizations than the uninsured   CHIP enrollment has been found to improve childrens performance in school  Children in CHIP have higher rates of attendance and are more likely to pay attention in class   With regard to dental insurance  children who receive preventive care by age 1 have dental costs 40  lower than those who do not  The costs of treating acute dental conditions are ten times lower in dental offices than in emergency rooms    Laura Capps
