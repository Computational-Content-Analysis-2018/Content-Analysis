         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Thank you so much  Mitch  for that warm introduction and for reaching across the aisle to invite me today  I d also like to thank Gary Gregg  Director of the McConnell Center  Chairman Evan Buckley  Provost Shirley Willinghanz and the entire Board of Trustees for hosting me     I also want to offer a special appreciation to all the alumni and current McConnell Scholars Program students  who ve made us feel a tremendous welcome  and the Kentucky General Assembly and Louisville Metro Council members joining us today    I d have guessed Giacomo had better odds at 50 1 in last year s Derby than I had of drawing such a crowd here  and I m grateful to all of you    Coming to Kentucky always reminds me of the Kentucky Irish poet James Mulligan  who wrote these famous lines    The moonlight falls the softest  in Kentucky  The summer days come oftest  in Kentucky  The bluegrass waves the bluest  The songbirds are the sweetest  The thoroughbreds are fleetest  The landscape is the grandest  And the politics the damnedest  in Kentucky    Not long ago  I was about to deliver a speech in Virginia  when a heckler in the audience jumped to his feet and shouted  Senator Kennedy is a horse s rear end  I m paraphrasing just a little bit    Right away  members of the audience rushed to my defense  roughed him up  and threw him out      So I said to the chairman of the event  I had no idea this was Kennedy country  And he said  It isn t  It s horse country    Mitch  as you all know  is the Majority Whip in the Senate  I used to be the Majority Whip too    back in the last century  when Democrats actually had a majority in the Senate  And I ve told him to enjoy it    all the way till November    But seriously  every day I see how much the people of Kentucky mean to Mitch and how skillfully he advances the ideals he holds so strongly  He is admired and respected by all of his colleagues and for good reason    Mitch and I share a passion for public service  and so does his wife Elaine Chao  We know that our nation s future depends on many things  but one of them is certainly the strength and ability and dedication of the men and women in public service    So it s a special honor to be here with you all at the McConnell Center    where Leadership  Scholarship  and Service are your mission    and I congratulate you on the recent opening of this brilliant new facility     For 15 years  the McConnell Center has had extraordinary success in training the next generation of Kentucky s and the nation s leaders  and what I see here today is an impressive sign that your future here is bright    It s also a privilege to be back in the beautiful Commonwealth of Kentucky  which holds some wonderful memories for the Kennedy family     I remember how moved my brother Bobby was on a visit here to meet with the heroic mining families of Pike County in Eastern Kentucky  and how important that visit was in convincing him to do all he could to eliminate the injustice of poverty in America    Jack campaigned here in Louisville in October 1960 in Jefferson Square  Richard Nixon had been here too a few weeks before and had mistakenly claimed that Thomas Jefferson was a Republican     Jack picked up on the mistake and used it often in the final weeks of the campaign  He d say  Sorry Mr  Vice President  Thomas Jefferson s one of ours  You didn t have FDR either  And Theodore Roosevelt left the GOP as soon as he could    And then Jack would add  But you can claim credit for McKinley  Coolidge  Harding  Hoover  Dewey  and Landon    Today  I d like to speak to you about the importance of public service and political leadership in helping our nation confront its pressing challenges    Not blue state liberal challenges or red state conservative challenges  but American ones that require all of us    private citizens  students  Massachusetts Democrats and Kentucky Republicans    to come together     Throughout our history  America s been blessed that men and women of conscience  ability  and vision have responded to the nation s call in times of great need  That s most certainly true of the people of Kentucky     There was the great Henry Clay    who should have been President by many estimates    but who still found a way to shape a nation s destiny in the House of Representatives and the Senate  where he was rightly known as the Great Compromiser    There was John Sherman Cooper  a Republican Senator who had the courage to stand up to Joe McCarthy at the height of his powers  taking enormous risks in a day when it was perilous just to be a Republican in Kentucky    Senator Cooper was a giant  I only wish he hadn t inspired his young aide Mitch McConnell to work so hard to build the Republican Party here    But you don t have to be a Senator to hear and heed the call of service    Last year  we lost Rosa Parks  who through her simple  brave  and eloquent act shamed a nation into finally confronting the vast discrimination that many chose to ignore for so long    Without her act of civil disobedience  how much longer might we have waited for the spark of conscience to ignite the determination of millions of Americans to demand change    We do not make the world we live in  but we do have the chance to change it  As my brother Robert Kennedy told students in South Africa in 1966    Each time a person stands up for an ideal  or acts to improve the lot of others  or strikes out against injustice  he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope  and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring  those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance    Each of us has the power to send forth a ripple too  and I know that many of you are doing it now    When I look back over my years in the Senate  I m amazed at the progress we ve made on issues of social justice  economic opportunity  and basic fairness  and it gives me hope for our future     When I first came to the Senate in 1963  nearly half of our senior citizens lived in poverty and ill health  Women were not equal in the workplace  and we know too well how the ingrained system of segregation made African Americans second class citizens  under constant threat of violence    The Civil Rights Act of 1964  The Voting Rights Act of 1965  Medicare  Women s rights in the 1970 s  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991  all helped our nation come closer to living up to its ideals    None of these were easy  and each required the sustained commitment of private citizens and elected officials of both parties to overcome entrenched opposition    When the Senate was debating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to outlaw segregation in public accommodations  we faced an intense filibuster     Martin Luther King  Jr   fearing it would succeed  appealed to supporters to join protests of segregated restaurants    Two who responded were the elderly mother of Massachusetts Governor Endicott Peabody  and the elderly wife of the Episcopal Bishop in Massachusetts  The sight of these two women being arrested and jailed for sitting in at the Ponce De Leon restaurant in St  Augustine  Florida attracted enormous national attention  and the ripples of hope they sent out helped create a national current that swept away the filibuster    Time and again throughout our history  we see the lesson that individual citizens have great power to find solutions to our problems  All they have to do is try    Our Founders did not know exactly how to create the world s most enduring democracy  and President Lincoln did not know how to keep the Union together    President Roosevelt did not have a handbook for pulling our nation out of the Depression  Harry Truman did not have all the answers immediately after World War II to rebuild Western Europe    But at each of these critical times  they did have Americans ready  willing and able to serve their fellow citizens and reach out to others in troubled lands    There s no doubt that we re in a similar time of extraordinary challenge today  and again we ll need to call on the American people to help guide us through    One challenge is our response to September 11th  and a world transformed by the realization that never before have Americans faced so many unpredictable dangers from so many unseen enemies  Never has the very idea of America itself been under this kind of assault     The uncomfortable truth is that no one has all the answers to meet this unprecedented danger    no individual  no one in any political party  no one person in any state  no one member of the House or Senate  and no one in any other nation    We all need to be part of the response to this new threat    we cannot shrink from the public square and leave it to others  We must do our part    especially in Iraq    In my view  we need to work more aggressively to ensure that the Iraqis will immediately form a broad based national unity government    only such a government can achieve the compromises necessary to prevent a full scale civil war    We also need to push for the disbanding of the private militias in Iraq that our Ambassador there has rightly called the infrastructure of civil war     We need to work harder as well to meet the other essential needs of the Iraqi people  many of whom still lack electricity  clean water  and basic services    Another great challenge we face is to make globalization work for the American people      For fifty years after the end of the cold war  America dominated the world economy  Europe and Japan were still struggling to rebuild after World War II  and much of humanity was trapped behind the walls of Communism     We made wise decisions that enabled this prosperity to flourish  like educating a generation of returning soldiers through the GI Bill of Rights  and thereby creating an educated and growing middle class     But today  our edge is slipping    other countries want their turn in the limelight     Just in time delivery  the Internet  and the emergence of the educated and entrepreneurial class in India and in China are forces that are changing the world in profound ways    As New York Times reporter Tom Friedman says  It s been 500 years since the world was considered flat  but that s what it s become again     We re not living up to these challenges of education in the new world economy  America s fallen from 3rd to 15th place in producing scientists and engineers  and now we re 28th in math and science    tied with Latvia    Last year 600 000 engineers graduated from institutions of higher learning in China    and 350 000 more graduated in India  The United States    the only nation ever to put a man on the moon    produced only 70 000    The fiercely new competitive world is taking its toll on middle class Americans who see their American dream undermined by depressed wages  job losses  the evaporation of their pensions  and the soaring costs of higher education    The question for us is whether we re going to do what it takes to give our people the power to succeed in the skills intensive industries of the new global economy  or whether we ll simply let them fend for themselves and watch America s economic might wane    As in other times  we don t have all the answers  but we know a few prudent steps we can take immediately    One thing we need to do right away is remove the economic barriers to higher education    our economic security is at stake  and we can t permit the cost of college to be a barrier to achievement any longer    We also need to create a new social contract with young college graduates  If they ll commit to teaching math and science in our public schools for several years  we ll release them from the staggering debt of college loans that too often dictates a graduate s choice of career    We also need to give older workers the new skills they need to qualify for new types of employment when old skills are no longer in demand    Part of the answer to this challenge is to make good health care available to all Americans  The current system is failing more and more citizens every year  It s both a moral failure and an enormous drain on our economic competitiveness                In this new century of life sciences  extraordinary new breakthroughs in medical research hold enormous promise      America is blessed with the best hospitals    like University Hospital right here in Louisville    and the most creative researchers in the world  but far too few of our people receive their benefit    Among industrialized nations  the U S  ranks 22nd in average life expectancy and 25th in infant mortality  Over 46 million of our people have no health insurance  including half a million in Kentucky    and even more in my Commonwealth of Massachusetts    The ramifications are severe  Every year  eight million uninsured Americans fail to take their prescription drugs  because they can t afford them    270 000 uninsured children with asthma never see a doctor    and 27 000 uninsured women are diagnosed with breast cancer    The costs of health care wreak havoc for our competitive position in the world economy  Ford Motor Company spends more on health care than it does on steel for its vehicles  and unpaid medical bills cause nearly half of all personal bankruptcies in the country today     To remain competitive  it s time for change  Sick children can t learn in school  and sick workers can t earn on the job    We need new ideas and a renewed commitment to solve this problem    One thing we could do is to transform health care administration by incorporating information technology and use the  140 billion we d save annually to expand Medicare to cover all our people    Medicare s worked brilliantly for seniors  and it could do the same for every American if we only have the will    But no current issue more clearly illustrates the difficult twin challenges of security in a post 9 11 environment and the forces of globalization confronting us    or our need for real leadership    than the immigration debate now playing out on radio and television and in homes across this country    The history of America is the history of immigration  My own ancestors were confronted with No Irish Need Apply signs when they arrived in Boston fleeing from the Great Famine in their homeland    Generations of immigrants have performed difficult labor in exchange for modest  and often meager  wages  and each successive wave has earned their way into the American family through hard work and perseverance in the face of countless obstacles    In doing so  they ve given new vitality to the American dream  continuing proof that in this land of opportunity  anyone can build a better life for themselves and their families     It is this belief    this powerful belief in American possibility    that has made us the most economically dynamic  creative  and upwardly mobile society the world has ever known     It s an optimism captured in Emma Lazarus  famous words inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty  Give me your tired  your poor  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free          This openness was directly challenged by the terrorist attacks of 9 11  which have forced us to acknowledge some difficult facts     One is that we have no idea who the 11 million undocumented aliens living in our country are  Decades of relegating these workers to the shadows    forcing them to work off the books and out of sight    has created a substantial security risk today     Another uncomfortable truth is that the  20 billion we ve spent enforcing our immigration laws in the past decade has accomplished very little  Too many have tragically died in the desert trying to cross our border  and vastly more have found a way to enter the United States without fear of interception     Sadly  the same is also true of those who would do us harm    As the debate unfolds  there is a strong pressure by some to simply beef up the  enforcement only approach      They would build higher walls to keep aliens out and round up and eject undocumented workers already here  separating them from family members who are here legally    This is the shortsighted approach adopted by the House of Representatives that has sparked growing opposition across the country  It s inhumane    and it s also unworkable  because it requires people to come forward willingly so that they can be deported     Will anyone with a job and a family and new roots here in America do that       More importantly  will any terrorist do that     Part of the intensity of this throw them out attitude is born of genuine frustration in the inability of our government to provide better homeland security     But part of it too is fueled by a demagoguery that fails to acknowledge that the vast majority of undocumented workers are hardworking  honorable people who make great contributions to our economy and seek only to provide for their families    Without question  our immigration system is broken  But how we fix it has enormous implications for our national security  for our economic vitality  and for preserving our status as a beacon of hope and opportunity throughout the world    The stakes couldn t be higher      Last week over a million immigrants marched in our streets  Peaceful and proud families waved the American flag and celebrated their adopted homeland     They are calling on us to show the world that America will stay true to its values of fairness  They seek no special favor except the opportunity to earn legal status in the land they love    I m proud that the Senate seems headed on this path  Our Judiciary Committee approved a strict but fair bill last week that establishes a reasonable process through which undocumented men and women can apply for legal status    They must go to the end of the line  They must pay a  2 000 fine and undergo strict background and security checks  They must learn English  pass a basic civics test  and make good on any back taxes    For those willing to fulfill these requirements in good faith  our Senate says  we will help you come out of the shadows    But the debate is far from over  Some will continue to appeal to fear and prejudice  It s essential therefore for people of good will to make their voices heard in their communities and with their Members of Congress    The outcome of the debate will have far reaching consequences for the type of nation we ll become in the 21st Century  and the choice is up to us    all of us    It won t be easy  but nothing worthwhile ever is    Two centuries ago  Henry Clay was ridiculed when he proposed the American System  a far reaching plan to link the economic fortunes of the North  the South  and the growing Western sections of our country    People called it heretical to think of using federal power to build national roads and take other steps to unlock the interior bounty of our country by linking other regions with our large eastern seaports    Many wanted to leave such development to the states or private interests  But Clay knew that neither had the ability or incentive to see such investments through    Settling the West and opening it to expansion was an urgent national issue in Clay s day  and it required that we respond as a nation to the challenge    That s what we need to do again    respond as a nation to the powerful forces that are reshaping our planet    I m committed to doing all I can to address these great national challenges in the years ahead  and I m deeply honored to be have the opportunity to work on them with your great Senator Mitch McConnell    I hope we ll both get the chance to take these challenges on with some of the bright young McConnell Center scholars in the room today  Thank you very much for hosting me today
