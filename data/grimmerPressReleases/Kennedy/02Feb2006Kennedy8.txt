         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the further temporary extension of the PATRIOT Act It makes sense for Congress to take this extra time to address the serious concerns over the PATRIOT Act  especially given the Administration s domestic spying plan  Hopefully the President will cooperate with Congress and produce the information that is needed  It would clearly be irresponsible for the Senate and House to rubber stamp the Administration s actions now  when hearings on this obvious abuse of Presidential power are scheduled to begin next Monday   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
