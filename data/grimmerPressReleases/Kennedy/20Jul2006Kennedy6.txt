         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Washington  D C Today  the conferees for the Perkins Career and Technical Education reauthorization bill met and approved a Conference Report that will ensure that Perkins remains strong for the next generation of American students and workers  rejecting the Presidents call to eliminate the program  Senator Kennedy  the ranking member on the United States Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  has advocated for career and vocational education programs for forty years  beginning with the 1968 Vocational Education Amendments Act  The program was renamed the Perkins Career and Vocational Education Act in 1984  The Conference Report renames the program the Carl D  Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act  recognizing the evolution of the program at the local level and its focus on preparing students for the jobs of the future    President Bush proposed a twenty five percent cut in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and he proposed complete elimination in fiscal years 2006 and 2007  Senator Kennedy has led successful bipartisan efforts to maintain and increase funding for the program  Senator Kennedy proposed amendments to both fiscal years 2006 and 2007 that would have restored Perkins funding to the previous years levels  about  1 3 billion    In Massachusetts alone  60 000 secondary school students participate in Perkins programs and over 45 000 people are enrolled in college level programs  More than 92  of secondary students in Perkins programs in Massachusetts graduate from high school  Nine months after graduation  over 95  of them are still in college or are still employed   Because of Perkins  more than 12 000 career and technical education students at risk of failing the MCAS were placed in structured internships at over 5 600 employer sites last year  These internships use Work Based Learning Plans to structure students learning and productivity on the job  and to measure the impact of the internship on student achievement    Every single community college in Massachusetts has been able to hire instructional support staff and provide adaptive equipment for students with disabilities who are enrolled in technical education programs because of the resources Perkins makes available    Because of Perkins  career and technical educators throughout the Commonwealth received needed professional development  and gained access to curriculum related resources  technical assistance  and training on a wide range of activities    REMARKS AT PERKINS CONFEREES MEETING BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY   As prepared for delivery   Im pleased that were acting on this bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act  I commend Chairman Enzi and Chairman McKeon for their willingness to have an open  bipartisan process for this legislation  and I commend their staffs for their impressive work  Were proud of our commitment to this program and this process    In this age of globalization  every citizen deserves a chance to acquire the education and skills needed to participate in the modern economy  We must equip all our citizens to compete  not by lowering their pay and sending their jobs overseas  but by increasing their skills  Career and technical education does just that  by preparing students and adults for 21st century jobs    The Perkins Act gives high school and college students the academic coursework and training they need to be competitive in the job market  Its reauthorization is especially important since more and more people are taking advantage of Perkins programs  Between 2002 and 2004  enrollment in career and technical education programs rose by 26 percent nationally  Enrollment in Tech Prep  the Perkins program that supports some of the most creative programs in the field  rose by more than a third  Massachusetts alone has more than 100 000 students at the secondary and postsecondary level participating in Perkins programs   Perkins helps adults as well  In 2004  six million adults were enrolled in programs at community  technical and other colleges  learning new skills and improving opportunities for employment  About 40 million adults participate in short term occupational training  New immigrants  struggling adults  and women seeking jobs outside the home for the first time all benefit from the specially designed programs funded by Perkins   The data are clear  Perkins programs are helping students and adults achieve brighter economic futures  According to the most recent National Assessment of Vocational Education  high school students earned about  450 more in income for each high school occupational course they took  That adds up  especially for the 45 percent of all high school graduates who take three or more occupational courses    Perkins is also preparing more students to enter and succeed in college  Today  almost two thirds of all high school graduates of career and technical programs now enter some form of postsecondary education  Thanks to the improvements we have made in this reauthorization  we will expand this progress even further    Weve also maintained our commitment to Tech Prep  Students can enroll as early as the 9th grade in high tech programs that lead to an associates degree  Tech Prep is a vital bridge that connects high school to college for many students  and I welcome its role in this bill   Our focus is on supporting career and technical education programs that lead to increased graduation rates  professional credentials  apprenticeships  and college opportunities  To do so  we have a strong accountability system that measures the progress that programs are making toward these goals   Weve redoubled our emphasis on making sure that career and technical education programs reach those who too often have been left out  such as girls  women and homemakers seeking jobs for the first time   Weve also addressed the needs of career and technical education teachers  by giving them new opportunities to spend time with the industries theyre teaching about  so theyll have state of the art knowledge of the field    To show how the field has evolved from the vocational education classes of the past  this reauthorization appropriately uses the term career and technical education in its title and throughout the bill   That change also reflects our continuing expectation that career and technical programs should promote strong academic success  Thats certainly the case in Massachusetts  At Worcester Vocational High School  93  of students passed the state assessment in 2005  Also  Blackstone Valley Tech in Upton has been recognized as a Vanguard Model School by the Massachusetts Insight Education and Research Institute for its efforts to improve student achievement  Massachusetts career and technical education programs are impressive  and theyre just a small number of the many programs across the country that are changing students and adults lives for the better  thanks to the Perkins Act   Im pleased that we were able to work together with the House to produce this bipartisan legislation  Chairman Enzi  Chairman McKeon  Representatives Miller and Woolsey  and all the conferees and their staffs deserve great credit for strengthening this important law       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
