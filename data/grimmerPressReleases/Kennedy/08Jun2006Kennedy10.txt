         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in opposition of repealing the estate tax  The Senate today blocked repealing the estate tax in a vote of 57 41   Below is Senator Kennedys statement   The audacity of the Bush Administration and their Congressional allies truly knows no limit  In spite of all of the urgent problems facing our nation  from the ongoing war in Iraq  to the devastating hurricane damage along the Gulf Coast that has not yet been repaired  to the outrageously high gasoline prices that are squeezing American families  the top Republican priority is eliminating the estate tax for the richest families in the country  President Bushs policies have already added nearly  3 trillion dollars to the national debt in the last five years  Now  they are proposing more of the same  more tax breaks benefiting only the wealthiest among us    The first ten years of estate tax repeal would cost  800 billion in lost revenue  nearly a trillion dollars when the cost of interest on the higher national debt that would result is included  It is unaffordable  It is the ultimate example of misplaced priorities  Repealing the estate tax would cost as much each year as the federal government spends on homeland security  and it would cost more than we spend on education  And  it would be grossly unfair   Today  under current law  only 5 estates in 1 000 are subject to the estate tax  By 2009  only 3 estates in 1 000 will be subject to the estate tax  Only estates over  3 5 million will be taxed  Thus  repealing the estate tax would only benefit a few thousand heirs of the richest men and women in the country  One columnist recently called it the Paris Hilton Tax Break and that description accurately identifies who would benefit from such an enormous tax giveaway    The notion of an estate tax is nothing new or radical  We have had an estate tax for over 100 years  During much of that period  it covered a far greater percentage of estates than we are taxing today  One of the strongest advocates of the estate tax was Teddy Roosevelt  who believed it was essential to a fair and democratic society  Those who have benefited most from the opportunities America offers have a special obligation to contribute something back to their country    Advocates of repeal always claim that the estate tax forces the sale of large numbers of farms and small businesses each year  That claim is greatly exaggerated  CBO analyzed this issue  It concluded that if the 2009 exemption level of  3 5 billion had been in place in 2000  only 94 small businesses and 65 farms in the entire country would have owed any estate tax  Of those  most had sufficient liquid assets to cover the estate tax owed without touching the business or farm  The few that did not  have the option of paying the tax in installments over fourteen years    These small businesses and farms are being used as a sympathetic Trojan Horse to conceal those who would really benefit from estate tax repeal  The real beneficiaries of repeal would be the heirs of the richest men and women in America    If we eliminate the estate tax on the largest concentrations of wealth in our society  we will be permitting the very few who inherit huge amounts of money to receive their millions tax free while working Americans have to pay substantial taxes on their wages  It would be terribly unfair to tax work while giving inherited wealth a free ride    The estate tax is the most progressive of all federal taxes  At a time when the income gap between the wealth few and the middle class has grown disturbingly wide  wider than it has been in decades  why would we want to transfer more of the tax burden from the rich onto the shoulders of middle class families  Make no mistake  the trillion dollars that would be lost should the estate tax be repealed will have to be made up by increasing other federal taxes  taxes paid mostly by the middle class  That is the injustice of repealing the estate tax   What we should do is make permanent the estate tax that will be in place in 2009  covering estates over  3 5 million   7 million per couple  with a top tax rate of 45   Only 3 10ths of 1  of estates would owe any tax under that proposal  While the maximum rate of 45  may sound high  that figure is very misleading  Analyses show that the effective tax rate on these estates  the rate after the  3 5 million exemption and other available deductions are taken into consideration would be  on average  only 17    I believe all the revenue from preserving the estate tax at the 2009 level should be statutorily dedicated to the Social Security Trust Fund  Saving Social Security for the many who depend on it is far more important than repealing the estate tax for the wealthiest few    No government program reflects the values of the American people better than Social Security  We are a community that takes care of our most vulnerable members  the elderly  the disabled  and children whose parents have died prematurely  Two out of every three retirees receive over one half of their income from Social Security  Without it  many of them would be living in poverty  Social Security does much more than provide retirement income for seniors  It also provides life time disability insurance protecting those who become seriously injured or ill  When a worker becomes disabled before reaching retirement age  Social Security is there to help him and his family  And when a worker dies leaving minor children  Social Security provides financial support for those children until they reach adulthood    The revenue from the estate tax would reduce the Social Security shortfall by more than 25   according to the Social Security Administrations chief actuary  It would add years of solvency to the program  That would set the right priority for America    The priorities of this Republican Congress have been wrong for our country  If we are serious about reducing the deficit and strengthening the economy  we must stop lavishing tax breaks on the rich  and start investing in the health and well being of all families  These families are being squeezed unmercifully between stagnant wages and ever increasing costs for the basic necessities of life  The cost of health insurance is up 56  in the last five years  Gasoline is up 75   College tuition is up 46   Housing is up 57   The list goes on and on  up and up  and paychecks are buying less each year    The dollars that Republicans now want to spend on the ultimate tax break for the rich   allowing the heirs of multimillionaires to inherit their enormous wealth tax free   are dollars that should be used to help all Americans  The American people deserve better  and in November they will insist on a new Congress that truly shares their values and cares about their needs          Laura Capps
