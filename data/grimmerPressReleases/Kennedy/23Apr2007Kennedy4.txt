         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I felt the best tribute I could pay to Arthur was to come here in one of the things he cared most about  a bow tie  I just wish I could have found one  though  with his trademark  polka dots  As Arthur liked to say  he wore those famous bow ties for two very practical reasons  Its almost impossible to spill anything on them  and they never get caught in zippers  Our family was blessed to inherit Arthur from Adlai Stevenson  Arthur had history in his genes  and as a member of the World War II generation  he had a profound commitment as well to economic progress and social justice in the best tradition of F D R  He had helped found the ADA  and was naturally drawn to Adlai Stevenson at the end of the Truman Administration  After the Presidential campaigns of 1952 and 1956  Arthur was genuinely torn  because Stevenson was determined to run again in 1960  An up and coming young liberal from Minnesota named Hubert Humphrey also seemed very promising  But young John F  Kennedy was coming on strong as well  and Arthur was desperate for a winner  So he signed on with Jack during the 1960 primaries  As Arthur described his new allegiance at the time  he was nostalgically for Stevenson  ideologically for Humphrey  and realistically for Kennedy  Theyd known each other from afar at Harvard in the 1930s  Arthur and Jack were the same age  but Arthur  always the precocious student  had graduated from Exeter at the young age of 16 and entered Harvard in my oldest brother Joes class  two years ahead of Jack  Arthur said that he knew Jack by sight from Harvard Yard  but that his first real meeting with Jack came at Joe Alsops home in Washington in late 1946  Arthur had just published his Pulitzer Prize winning book  The Age of Jackson  and had become a frequent guest at the famous Alsop Saturday night dinner groups  and Jack had just been elected to Congress  Of the dinner with Jack  Arthur wrote  Kennedy seemed very sincere and not unintelligent  but kind of on the conservative side  They met briefly again in 1947  when both were named as Outstanding Young Men of the Year  by the U S  Junior Chamber of Commerce  But it was 1960 that began their beautiful friendship and The New Frontier and Jacks thousand days  It also changed the course of history  Arthur made sure it did  One of Arthurs principal contributions to Jacks victory in 1960 was his famous campaign book  Its title was  Kennedy or Nixon  Does It Make Any Difference  Arthur wrote it practically overnight  with typical speed  after the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles that year  As we all learned  Arthur could write as easily as he breathed  Years later  he wore it as a badge of honor that he made Nixons enemies list  In that close election of 1960  Arthurs book made a very real difference  perhaps all the difference  just as he did in the years that followed  In so many ways  Jack couldnt have had The New Frontier without him  Its been said that Arthurs ideal head of state is a person whos charismatic  but not dogmatic  progressive  yet practical  As Arthur said of Jack  he was a realist brilliantly disguised as a romantic  He was charming  He had infinite curiosity  as FDR did  and he won peoples loyalties and services effortlessly  It was the most exhilarating experience of my life  working for and with JFK  Arthur had the same respect and fondness for Bobby as well  He was as much at home writing his book about Bobby as he was swimming in Bobbys pool with all his clothes on  And he had dinner with Bobby in 1968  the night before Bobby told Walter Cronkite he was going to run for President  Ill also be forever grateful for the needed boost that Arthur gave me in my own first campaign for the Senate in 1962  My qualifications  or lack of them  were an obvious issue  so much so that one of Arthurs colleagues at Harvard  Professor Mark DeWolfe Howe of the Law School  spoke out and mailed a diatribe against me around the state At a critical moment in the campaign  Arthur and I were meeting with a group of academics  and Professor Howe said bluntly  What on earth is Ted Kennedy doing in this race  Hes lacking in everything except ambition  Arthur responded immediately  Relax  Mark  he said  Teds a candidate for the U S  Senate  not the faculty of Harvard Law School  I loved Arthur all the more ever since  He always seemed to be at the very pinnacle of modern historians  and for 60 years he was  Hes written about the age of Jackson and the age of Roosevelt  but in many ways  for the past six decades  weve been living in the Age of Schlesinger  because thats how all of us who knew Arthur and loved him so much felt about those years  The famous English scientist  Lord Rutherford  was once asked how he always happened to be riding the crest of the wave in modern physics  and he replied  I made the wave  didnt I  Thats the way we thought of Arthur and his enduring eminence as an historian with an eye on the future  He believed very deeply that a knowledge of history was essential to temper and civilize the use of power  He loved to quote the words of Winston Churchill  The longer you look back  the further you can look forward  Arthur seemed forever young  Even in recent years  he found it hard to believe he was a senior citizen  As he liked to say  he only felt his age when he was getting in and out of Boston taxicabs   Arthur was a beloved friend for decades who wrote history with unsurpassed eloquence  and shaped history with unsurpassed wisdom and scholarship  In so many ways  Arthur continues to represent the best of the liberal and progressive ideals of the 20th century  and the 21st century too  and were forever in his debt  It has been said that all of us are dust  but some are gold dust  Arthur was truly gold dust  We miss him very much  and we always will       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
