         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner June 27  2007  202  224 2633   SUMMARY INCLUDEDSTATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON THE BIOLOGICS PRICE COMPETITION AND INNOVATION ACTExecutive Session of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Today  our Committee considers important legislation to carry on the work begun over two decades ago when the landmark Hatch Waxman law was enacted in 1984  That bipartisan initiative to deal with out of control drug prices combined patent reform incentives to encourage competition with new incentives to encourage innovation  Its brought new drug discoveries to help patients and generic versions of vital drugs to make them more affordable At that time  however the complex biological molecules that form many important drugs we have today did not exist  and there was no need for an abbreviated pathway to approve follow on versions of such drugs  Now  with the ongoing life sciences revolution  advances in our understanding of biology and biotechnology have created a need for safe versions of follow on biological drugs  The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act we are considering establishes a regulatory pathway for FDA to approve safe and effective follow on and interchangeable biological drugs while maintaining the incentives that spur innovation  This Act will ensure that many more Americans will be able to get the life saving drugs that are transforming health care today  Senator Hatch  Senator Clinton  Senator Enzi and also Senator Schumer have all been leaders in preparing this bill  Three basic principles guided our work  First  we must be led by science  Acceptable legislation on follow on biologics must not pre judge science  but should enable FDA to make the best decisions based on the most complete science reasonably available  Second  protecting patient safety is essential  Congress must make certain that any drug available to patients is safe and effective  Third  innovation must be valued and promoted  Its essential to help patients afford the drugs they need  but its also essential to provide incentives for the innovations that will produce the medical miracles of the future  The bill gives the FDA the flexibility it needs to apply the latest scientific advances in the regulatory process  so that these new follow on products will be safe and effective  It also gives the FDA the flexibility to adapt to changes in scientific knowledge and does not freeze in place an inflexible regulatory structure  Unprecedented scientific advances are taking place  and seriously ill patients have already begun to see the benefits of this new era through new wonder drugs that can make the difference between life and death  These biological products are complex molecules whose healing power is being brought to patients by dynamic biotechnology companies  Such drugs were once a rarity in medicine  but each day now brings new hope from new breakthroughs  With this extraordinary progress comes a challenge to public policy  Due to the cost of developing and manufacturing new biologics  their price is often steep  They can cost patients tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year  putting an extraordinary strain on the budgets of those who must pay the bills patients  insurers  and government programs This Act will save American families and the American government billions of dollars by allowing follow on and interchangeable products to come to market at reduced prices but with the same high level of safety The bill also recognizes that these incredible advances come only when sufficient incentives exist to encourage their development and that is why we have included 12 years of data exclusivity  It is essential to have a clear understanding of the circumstances in which this exclusivity applies  The 12 years of exclusivity applies only to products that are analogous to a new chemical entity  Once a product is first approved under Section 351 a  of the Public Health Service Act  it is granted 12 years of data exclusivity  Subsequent supplemental applications  or even new applications containing a new indication  dosage form  route of administration or strength do not generate a new 12 years of exclusivity  This is an area of law where it is vital to be precise in legislative drafting  In the bill as filed  we used the phrase first licensed to make clear that 12 years of exclusivity applied solely to the initial approval of a product  not to subsequent minor modifications  In the Chairmans Mark  we added a new provision to provide greater clarity  specifying that this phrase first licensed does not apply to any supplemental application or even a new license for a new indication  route of administration  dosage form or strength We welcome the views of experts on these provisions  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that the language is as sharp and precise as it can possibly be  and staff are authorized to make changes to achieve the utmost in precision  The bill also establishes a new process for rapidly identifying patents that could be disputed between the brand company and the biosimilar applicant  It recognizes the inherent complexity of the patents on these intricate biological molecules  and it also expedites the patent resolution process  That process  like much of the rest of the bill  is a balance between competing concerns  The brand company must be able to assert its patent rights on all appropriate patents  But the process shouldnt be a roadblock for the approval follow on products This legislation strikes the appropriate balance  It includes incentives for both parties to seek expeditious resolution of patent issues  and it includes deterrents for all participants not to game the system Overall  the bill reflects a balanced approach that enables patients to have safe  effective and affordable biological drugs  while preserving the incentives that have brought these life saving advances to the American public  We have a number of amendments that members of the committee have offered and I look forward to discussing them with you Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2007This Act amends section 351 of the Public Health Service Act to provide for an approval pathway for safe biosimilar and interchangeable biological products  relying in part on the previous approval of a brand product  while preserving the incentives that have fueled the development of these life saving medicines  Approval Process A biosimilar applicant is required to demonstrate that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety  purity and potency between its product and the brand product  A demonstration of biosimilarity includes analytical data  animal testing and 1 or more clinical studies  unless such a requirement is determined by the FDA to be unnecessary FDA may approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable  meaning it can be substituted for the brand product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed it  Showing interchangeability requires evidence that the biosimilar product will produce the same clinical result as the brand product in any given patient and that it presents no additional risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy if a patient alternates or is switched between products The legislation allows  but does not require the FDA to issue guidance documents to inform with the public of the standards and criteria the agency will use in approving biosimilar and interchangeable products  Development of these guidance documents will require public input  Applications can be filed in the absence of guidance documents Exclusivities The Act provides incentives for the development of both new life saving biological products and interchangeable biosimilar products  12 years of data exclusivity for the brand company during which a biosimilar product may not be approved  and 1 year of exclusivity for the first interchangeable biological product Patent Resolution The legislation includes a multi step process to identify and resolve patents that the biosimilar product may infringe  The biosimilar applicant must provide its application and information about its manufacturing process to the brand company  A series of informational exchanges then occur in which the biosimilar applicant and the brand company identify patents in question and explain their views as to their validity or infringement  The two parties then either agree to a list of these patents to be litigated first or exchange lists when they cant  and the brand company must then sue the biosimilar applicant within 30 days to defend them  If the brand company wins a final court decision that a patent is valid and infringed by the biosimilar product before the 12 year data exclusivity has run  the court must enjoin infringement of the patent until it expires  For identified patents not included in this initial litigation  the biosimilar applicant must give the brand company notice 180 days before it intends to launch its product  and the brand company may then seek a preliminary injunction to block the launch  If the brand company fails to identify a patent  it cant later enforce it against the biosimilar product  If it fails to defend a patent identified for initial litigation  the brand company may only later receive a reasonable royalty  If the biosimilar applicant fails at any step to do what it is required to do  the brand company may immediately defend its patents      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner June 27  2007  202  224 2633   SUMMARY INCLUDEDSTATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON THE MARKUP OF WIRED FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY ACTExecutive Session of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions In this new century of the life sciences  almost every day brings new medical breakthroughs and extraordinary scientific discoveries  Biotechnology has unleashed undreamed of solutions to longstanding medical challenges  Conditions which once required invasive surgery can now be treated through harmless and increasingly less costly procedures  The human genome project has begun to solve some of the greatest medical mysteries  enabling scientists to find better ways to treat cancer  diabetes  Alzheimers Disease  and other major illnesses  Our health care system itself  however  is still plagued by staggering inefficiencies  With the cost of health care approaching 20 percent of our gross domestic product  serious action is required now to turn back this tide of rising costs  We need to recognize that this technology which is revolutionizing the development of new treatments can also increase patients access to quality care at a much lower cost   The VA  and other health systems that use sophisticated health It systems  have known this basic fact for years  While the cost of health care per patient has risen by 62 percent in the period between 1996 and 2003    at the VA  the cost has actually fallen by 7 percent  In recent years  information technology has transformed industries from telecommunications to financial services  Yet  the health care industry continues to lag behind in the implementation of information technology  even though the potential for improvement has existed for years  Today  one in every seven primary care visits is hampered by missing medical information  More than 40 percent of Americans have been victims of preventable medical errors  and as many as 100 000 Americans die each year from such errors  In a nation that spends more on health care than any other country  with the best doctors  nurses  hospitals  and scientists in the world  such errors are intolerable   Information technology can help reduce these errors  and yet  the gap is widening each year in the implementation of such technology  It now costs a physicians office about  40 000 to implement a new IT system  Increasingly  our public hospitals and community health centers remain in the dark ages of technology  while health institutions with financial means are implementing life saving cost effective systems  Estimates from the RAND Corporation indicate that the widespread adoption of electronic health records could save up to  160 billion a year  Our bill seeks to set national standards for health information technology and provide funds to encourage the adoption of IT across the country to bring its benefits to all patients  Interoperability standards will enable separate computer networks to communicate with each another   Adequate funding can close the IT gap  so that communities at risk for health disparities will also have access to the benefits of the information age  By eliminating many of the inefficiencies engrained in our health care system  we can achieve large savings that substantially reduce the number of uninsured Americans in our country  The legislation authorizes federal grants to providers in need and enables states to fund low interest loans to ease the burden on health care professionals who invest in new systems for electronic medical records and other purposes  The bill also provides grants for the local and regional implementation of plans which improve health care quality and efficiency through the electronic exchange of health information   So far  the vast majority of investment in IT has come from the private sector  but federal grants will enable the health care industry to convert individual examples of health IT success into a national trend  The advantages of health IT must be accompanied by careful protection of patient privacy  The legislation stipulates strong privacy protections  including notice to parents of the wrongful disclosure of their medical information  It also codifies the American Health Information Community as a body to make recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on patient privacy  information security  and appropriate uses of health IT  I commend Senator Enzis continuing leadership on this important issue  and I also commend Senator Clinton and Senator Hatch for their work on this legislation   I know that our colleagues on the Finance committee have also given serious thought to issues of health care quality and information technology  and I look forward to working with them to see that we create a seamless and efficient system of quality measures  It is also essential to see that quality measures take into consideration the complexity of medical practice  and I look forward to continue to work with the medical community to make certain that the quality provisions in this legislation take into account their recommendations  I look forward to working with my colleagues  and with experts in the medical community to see that this much needed legislation is approved by the Senate before the summer break  I ask unanimous consent that the managers amendment  the Dodd amendment  and Reed amendment number one  as modified  be accepted THE WIRED FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY ACTInformation technology is transforming all aspects of our modern society  but adoption of IT within health care has progressed slowly  IT systems linked securely and with strong privacy protections to patients medical records can improve the quality and efficiency of care while producing significant cost savings  Despite the potential benefits of health IT  investment and adoption has been limited  particularly among smaller providers who are most affected by the financial cost of implementing a health IT system  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act would give health care providers the assistance they need to invest in lifesaving health IT The legislation encourages the development of standards for health IT through  Codifying the role of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in coordinating the policies of federal agencies regarding health IT  Establishing a publicprivate partnership known as the Partnership for Health Care Improvement to provide recommendations to the Secretary with regard to technical aspects of interoperability  standards  implementation specifications  and certification criteria for the exchange of health information  The National Coordinator will serve as a liaison to the Partnership  The legislation also requires the Secretary to publish a schedule for assessment of standards for significant use cases after consulting with the Partnership   Requiring all Federal IT purchases conform to the standards recommended by the Partnership and adopted by the President  Adoption of these standards is voluntary for private entities   Establishing the American Health Information Community as a body providing recommendations to the Secretary regarding policies to promote the development of a nationwide interoperable health information technology infrastructure  These include recommendations regarding patient privacy  information security  and appropriate uses of health information The legislation assures strong privacy protections for electronic health information by  Requiring that the national strategy on health IT includes strong privacy protections  including methods to notify patients if their medical information is wrongfully disclosed The legislation encourages the adoption of qualified health IT to improve the quality and efficiency of care by  Providing grants for the purchase of health IT systems to providers demonstrating financial need   Providing grants to states to establish low interest loan programs to help providers acquire health IT systems that will improve the quality and efficiency of health care   Providing grants to facilitate the implementation of regional or local health information plans to improve health care quality and efficiency through the electronic exchange of health informationThe legislation will help providers use IT to improve quality by  Providing grants to integrate qualified health IT in the clinical education of health professionals and encourage the use of decision support software to reduce medical errors  Requiring the Secretary to designate a single organization to develop healthcare performance measures  Establishing a Health Information Technology Resource Center where IT users can learn from the previous experience of others who have implemented qualified health IT      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner
