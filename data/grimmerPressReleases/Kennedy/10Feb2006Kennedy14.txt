         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today s Katrina hearings made clear once again the real human consequences of the Administration s failures in its response to that tragedy  While the White House is trying to make Michael Brown the scapegoat  the truth is that the failure rises to the upper ranks of the Department of Homeland Security and the White House itself  Now more than ever  the President owes it to the people of New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast to give his full commitment to rebuild the region and restore people s lives  He can no longer ignore the real damage to the lives  the homes  the schools  the roads  and hospitals   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
