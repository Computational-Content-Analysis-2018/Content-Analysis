summary of his American Competitiveness plan Remarks of Senator Edward M  Kennedy at Raytheon s Math Moves U Hippest Homework Happening Event  AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY Thank you  Bill  for that warm introduction  It s great to see you here today  What many of you don t know is that Bill used to work for me on Senate Armed Services Committee issues before he went on to become comptroller of the Pentagon  Bill  they obviously need you there more than ever today  This isn t the first time Bill has gone to bat for children  Bill and I worked together in his Senate days to establish the Department of Defense Child Care Program  which is now widely regarded as the best in the nation  It s great to be here with you  Bill It s an honor to be here today with representatives from Raytheon  students and teachers from Freedom Middle School in Fredericksburg  to kick off the first ever Hippest Homework Happening  I commend Raytheon for establishing the Math Moves U project and the Hippest Homework Happening event  I m especially proud that a company from Massachusetts is helping students across the nation to become interested in math Recent reports have emphasized the urgent need for American students to become better skilled in both science and math  We re falling behind other countries  Our youngest students perform well on international tests  but by the end of elementary school  we re losing out  Currently  China is graduating over two and a half times the number of engineers and computer science majors as the United States  In today s shrinking world  it s vital for both our economy and our national security that a new generation of students excels in these fields  Most of the jobs of the future will require a college degree  and the jobs that will help keep America first in the world will require math and science skills  We have real work to do to get us there A Raytheon survey found that 84 percent of middle school students would rather eat their vegetables or clean their room instead of doing math homework  More than four out of five middle school students think math is boring  If we can t get students interested in math and science when they are 12 or 13  it will be difficult for them to excel in those subjects once in high school and college But there is also some good news  In the same survey  a third of middle school students said that math is the subject they get the most excited about Across the United States today  13 000 students will log on to the Math Moves U website to work on their math homework with celebrities such as soccer great Mia Hamm and basketball star Lisa Leslie  Each of these celebrities uses math in their work and they know just how important and enjoyable it can be I commend these celebrities and athletes for helping students become more involved in their math coursework We know that one of the key components in helping students succeed in any subject is a teacher who is well prepared and has the resources needed for the classroom  I understand that about 500 teachers across the U S  have already registered for the Hippest Homework Happening  I commend Crystal Beatley  the seventh grade teacher from Freedom Middle School whose class is here today  because she entered the Celebrity Substitute Teacher contest  I hope that teachers across the country hear about the Math Moves U program and visit the website for useful resources and information We need to strengthen math and science teaching at every level to guarantee that America stays on the cutting edge of innovation and progress  Private initiatives like Raytheon s are extremely important  but the federal government must step up to the plate too  Congress and the President need to do more to help schools and students meet this challenge  and I m hopeful that we can work together in Washington to see that the nation s students  schools  and colleges adapt to this new age of global competition and rise to new heights I commend Raytheon for the Math Moves U initiative and for committing two million dollars for its implementation  Countless students around the country will be inspired by the program to pay more attention in class  work harder  and learn how far math can take them in whatever career they choose  To all of the students here today  I say stay involved in Math Moves U and spread the word about how math affects our common future THE RIGHT TRACK FOR EDUCATION Senator Edward KennedySpurred into action by launch of Sputnik  Congress passed the National Defense Education Act  NDEA  in 1958  The law declared a national educational emergency and led to the doubling of the federal education budget in four years  The programs authorized under the Act helped the United States to improve rapidly in math  science  engineering  technology  and critical foreign languages and led to our dominance in the arms race and global economy Today  our nation once again faces an international education challenge in education  The United States ranks ninth in the world in the number of 25 34 year olds with high school diplomas  Third in the world in 1975  America now ranks 15th in the production of new scientists and engineers  These trends pose a threat to our national and economic security  To help America meet the global challenge  we must invest in every individual by ensuring access to the highest quality educational opportunities  The Right TRACK Act includes a New NDEA that Arms Americans with 21st Century Knowledge and Skills Makes college and graduate school tuition free for low  or moderate income individuals who study science  math  engineering  technology  or a critical need language  doubles funding for NSF education programs  and invests in math  science  engineering and technology textbooks and laboratories for high need schools   In 2004  only 19  of Massachusetts students who took the SAT expressed interest in studying science  math  technology or engineering    Improves global knowledge and skills through significant investment in programs to increase the study and mastery of critical need foreign languages and international cultures from the early grades through graduate school   73 schools in Massachusetts have expressed interest in the Chinese Language and Culture AP class    Augments existing formula funds for job training with competitive grants to support innovative strategies to meet emerging labor market needs   There are now 72 800 job vacancies in Massachusetts  Last year  for the first time ever  there were more vacant jobs requiring higher education than there were jobs requiring just a high school diploma or job training  Yet Massachusetts ranks 49th in the nation in terms of investment in higher education Modernizes America s Education System Helps states increase academic rigor to meet national and international benchmarks and prepare students to succeed in college  the 21st century workforce  or the Armed Services   Massachusetts students are first or tied for first in the nation in reading and math in both 4th and 8th grades  But there is work to do  Massachusetts ranks 47th in the nation in the percentage of low income 4th graders scoring proficient in reading    Invests in attracting high quality math  science  and critical need foreign language teachers to high need schools through scholarships  loan forgiveness  tax incentives  grants for innovative postsecondary programs  and invests in NSF teacher training programs   University of Massachusetts Boston was recently awarded a  500 000 NSF grant to increase the number of qualified science  technology  engineering  and mathematics graduates who are also qualified to teach    Ensures cost is not a barrier to college for any student by creating state based Contract for Educational Opportunity grants to cover students  unmet need   Massachusetts is first in the nation in the percentage of high school graduates enrolling in and graduating from college  but it is becoming increasingly difficult for families to afford their children s education  In Massachusetts  31  of the average family income is required to pay for annual expenses at a 4 year public university    after accounting for financial aid   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
