         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FACT SHEET AND LETTERS OF SUPPORT INCLUDED  WASHINGTON  DC   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Representative Henry A  Waxman  Senator John Cornyn  and Representative Tom Davis introduced the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act  Smoking remains the number one preventable cause of death in America and thousands children have their first cigarette every day  This legislation will give the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products in order to keep tobacco manufacturers from enticing young people to smoke and to assist current smokers in quitting  Also in attendance today to support the bill were Matt Myers  President  Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids  Dan Smith  President of American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network  Paul Billings  Vice President of National Policy and Advocacy for the American Lung Association and Neil Meltzer  Chairman of Advocacy Coordinating Committee  American Heart Association Senator Kennedy said  Congress cannot in good conscience allow the federal agency most responsible for protecting the public health to remain powerless to deal with the enormous risks of tobacco  the most deadly of all consumer products  Health experts believe this legislation is the most important action Congress could take to protect children from this deadly addiction Congressman Waxman said  The days of Congress doing the bidding of the tobacco industry are over  This long overdue legislation would give FDA broad powers to regulate tobacco products and protect public health Senator Cornyn said  Smoking and the consumption of tobacco products is a private decision  but it carries with it serious and significant public consequences  In my home state of Texas alone  in 2004  we spent a total of  5 831 billion in medical costs  and a total of  1 62 billion in direct Medicaid costs to pay for smoking related illnesses  Clearly  we can and must do more to address this serious problem Congressman Davis said  For too long our nations tobacco policies have been little more than smoke and mirrors  this legislation will breathe new life into our efforts to reduce tobacco related disease and death  Our bill will reduce the number of new tobacco users by keeping cigarettes away from kids  It will give current smokers more tools to quit by speeding cessation products to market  It also opens the door for truly effective reduced risk options for those who have been unable to quit using tobacco altogether  Finally  this legislation focuses on tobacco producers  not farmers  We take careful steps to ensure tobacco farmers are able to grow their crops as they deem best  With more than 400 000 tobacco related deaths every year  we cannot continue to pretend the dangers of smoking dont exist  Its time to pass this legislation This legislation will give the FDA the legal authority it needs 1  to prevent tobacco advertising that targets children  2  to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors  3  to help smokers overcome their addiction  4  to identify and reduce the toxic constituents of tobacco products and tobacco smoke for those who continue to be exposed to them  5  to regulate claims about reduced risk tobacco products  and 6  to prevent the tobacco industry from misleading the public about the dangers of smoking Chairman Kennedy will convene a hearing on the legislation in the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee on Tuesday  February 27  2007  A summary of the legislation is below  30 LEGISLATION EMPOWERING FDA TO REGULATE TOBACCO PRODUCTSThis bipartisan legislation will give the FDA the legal authority it needs    to reduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising that targets children     to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors     to help smokers overcome their addiction     to identify and reduce the toxic constituents of tobacco products and tobacco smoke for those who continue to be exposed to them     to regulate claims about reduced risk tobacco products    and to prevent the tobacco industry from misleading the public about the dangers of smoking  1  Establishes A New Chapter on Tobacco Regulation   It creates a new section in FDA s legal authority for the regulation of tobacco products  with standards that allow for consideration of the unique issues raised by tobacco use  The legislation gives FDA the authority it needs in order to prevent youth smoking and to reduce addiction to this highly lethal product 2  Authority to Restrict Tobacco Advertising   The Food and Drug Administration will have the necessary authority to regulate the sale  distribution  and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in order to stop tobacco company marketing practices that target children and mislead the public  It grants FDA full authority to regulate tobacco advertising consistent with and to the full extent permitted by the First Amendment  The tobacco industry currently spends more than fifteen billion dollars a year to promote its products  Much of that money is spent in ways designed to tempt children to start smoking  before they are mature enough to appreciate the enormity of the health risk  Nearly 90  of smokers begin as children and are addicted by the time they reach adulthood  This legislation will empower FDA to prevent industry advertising designed to appeal to children wherever it will be seen by children  3  Authority to Prevent Sale to Youth   FDA authority will extend to the sale of tobacco products  Nearly every state makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to children under 18  but surveys show that those laws are rarely enforced and frequently violated  FDA will have the power to limit the sale of cigarettes to face to face transactions in which the age of the purchaser can be verified by identification  This means an end to self service displays and vending machine sales  There must also be serious enforcement efforts with real penalties for those caught selling tobacco products to children  This is the only way to ensure that children under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes 4  Preserves FDA Rule to Curb Tobacco Use by Youth   The FDA conducted one of the longest rulemaking proceedings in its history to determine what regulations would most effectively reduce the number of children who smoke  Seven hundred thousand public comments were received in the course of that rulemaking  At the conclusion of its proceeding  the Agency promulgated rules on the manner in which cigarettes are advertised and sold  Due to litigation  most of those regulations were never implemented  It makes no sense to require FDA to reinvent the wheel by conducting a new multi year rulemaking process on the same issues  In order to curb youth smoking as much as possible  as soon as possible  this legislation will give the youth access and advertising restrictions already developed by FDA the force of law  as if they had been issued under the new statute 5  Stronger Warning Labels   The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette and smokeless tobacco packages  and in all print advertisements  These warnings will be more explicit in their description of the medical problems that can result from tobacco use  The FDA is given the authority to change the text of these warning labels periodically  to keep their impact strong  6  Preventing Tobacco Industry Misrepresentations   For decades  tobacco companies have vehemently denied the addictiveness of nicotine in their products  Overwhelming evidence in industry documents obtained through the discovery process proves that the companies not only knew of this addictiveness  but actually relied on it as the basis for their marketing strategy  As we now know  cigarette manufacturers chemically manipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even more addictive  These companies have repeatedly sought to characterize their products as far less hazardous than they are  FDA will have clear and unambiguous authority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future 7  Authority to Order Removal of Hazardous Ingredients   Over forty million Americans are currently addicted to cigarettes  No responsible public health official believes that cigarettes should be banned  A ban would leave forty million people without a legal way to satisfy their drug dependency  FDA must be able to take the necessary steps to help addicted smokers overcome their addiction  and to make the product less toxic for smokers who are unable or unwilling to stop  To do so  FDA will have the authority to reduce or remove hazardous ingredients from cigarettes  to the extent that it becomes scientifically feasible  The inherent risk in smoking should not be unnecessarily compounded 8  Setting Standards for Reduced Risk Products   Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they plan to develop what they characterize as reduced risk cigarettes  This legislation will require manufacturers to submit such reduced risk products to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed  No health related claims   explicit or implied    will be permitted unless they have been verified to the FDA s satisfaction  These safeguards are essential to prevent deceptive industry marketing campaigns  which can lull the public into a false sense of health

Today  we are introducing legislation to give the Food and Drug Administration broad authority to regulate tobacco products  Congress cannot in good conscience allow the federal agency most responsible for protecting the public health to remain powerless to deal with the enormous risks of tobacco  the most deadly of all consumer products  Health experts believe this legislation is the most important action Congress could take to protect children from this deadly addiction   It is an exciting day because this year we are introducing the bill in a new Congress where the likelihood of passage is very high  What a difference a year makes  2007 is the year that this legislation will finally become law  It is long overdue   This is a bipartisan  bicameral initiative  I am extremely pleased to have Senator Cornyn as my Senate partner in this effort  and I know he will be a persuasive advocate for our legislation  The bill that Senator Cornyn and I are introducing already has 29 co sponsors  Congressmen Waxman and Davis will introduce identical legislation in the House  Our bill has the support of a broad coalition of public health organizations led by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids  the American Cancer Society  the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association  They all recognize the importance of enacting this bill this year  This is a bipartisan  bicameral initiative  I am extremely pleased to have Senator Cornyn as my Senate Partner in this effort and I know he will be a persuasive advocate for our legislation  The Bill that Senator Cornyn and I are introducing already has 29 co sponsors We intend to move forward on the legislation quickly  I have already scheduled a hearing in the HELP Committee for February 27th  and a markup is planned soon thereafter   The stakes are vast  Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America  Four thousand children have their first cigarette every day  and one thousand become daily smokers  More than one third of them will die prematurely from tobacco induced diseases  Cigarettes kill well over four hundred thousand Americans each year   We must deal firmly with tobacco company marketing practices that target children and mislead the public  The tobacco industry currently spends over fifteen billion dollars a year to promote its products  Much of that money is spent in ways designed to tempt children to start smoking  before they are mature enough to appreciate the enormity of the health risk  The industry knows that nearly 90  of smokers begin as children and are addicted by the time they reach adulthood  If we are serious about reducing youth smoking  FDA must have the power to prevent industry advertising designed to appeal to children wherever it will be seen by children  This legislation will give FDA the authority to stop tobacco advertising that glamorizes smoking to kids   FDA authority must extend to the sale of tobacco products as well  The only way to ensure that children under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes is to limit the sale of cigarettes to face to face transactions in which the age of the purchaser can be verified by identification   The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette and smokeless tobacco packages  and in all print advertisements   The tobacco industry has a long  dishonorable history of providing misleading information about the health consequences of smoking  FDA must have clear and unambiguous authority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future  The largest disinformation campaign in the history of the corporate world must end The nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive  Medical experts say that it is as addictive as heroin or cocaine  Yet for decades  while tobacco companies were publicly denying the addictiveness of their products  they were actually chemically manipulating the nicotine in their products to make it even more addictive  FDA must have the power to take the necessary steps to help addicted smokers overcome their addiction  and to make the product less toxic for smokers who are unable or unwilling to stop    This legislation will also require manufacturers to submit reduced risk products to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed  No health related claims will be permitted until they have been verified to the FDAs satisfaction  These safeguards are essential to prevent deceptive industry marketing campaigns  which could lull the public into a false sense of health safety   Enacting this bill this year is the right thing to do for Americas children  They are depending on us  By passing this legislation   we can help them live longer  healthier lives  LETTERS OF SUPPORT BELOW February 15  2007Dear Senator Representative As members of Partners for Effective Tobacco Policy  PARTNERS   we are writing to strongly urge you to support the Kennedy Cornyn and Waxman Davis bills that would regulate tobacco products  PARTNERS is a coalition of more than 60 national organizations committed to reducing and preventing the staggering death and disease caused by tobacco use  Tobacco use kills more than 400 000 Americans annually and is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States Congress has failed to complete action on the strong legislation to address this epidemic that has been introduced in the last two Congresses  Moreover  there is overwhelming support of Americans for regulation of tobacco products by the federal Food and Drug Administration  FDA   This support crosses all party  ideological  regional  state  income and educational lines  even a majority of smokers support FDA regulation of tobacco products Reflecting that support  FDA legislation in the last Congress enjoyed a broad  bipartisan group of 122 cosponsors in the House of Representatives and 28 in the Senate  It has the robust support of every major national health organization and of a broad cross section of American faith leaders and organizations  In 2004  this legislation passed the Senate twice  once overwhelmingly  the second time by unanimous consent  but year  after year  it has languished in the House of Representatives Legislation providing FDA the authority to regulate the manufacture  distribution  and sale of tobacco products is critically needed to protect the public health  FDA oversight is especially required to crack down on illegal sales of tobacco products to children and to restrict advertising and marketing that appeal to children  The tobacco industry is aggressively marketing as well a new generation of products with unproven claims that they are less harmful  This continued deception of consumers makes ever more urgent the need for FDA restrictions on advertising and marketing  especially to children  While virtually every other consumer product is regulated  tobacco products continue to be exempt from the most basic oversight  Tobacco companies are not required to test additives for safety  prevent misleading or inaccurate health claims  inform consumers what is in their products  or take any other action to make their products less harmful or addictive  Congress affords no other industry this degree of special protection  costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year to treat tobacco caused disease through federally funded health programs including Medicare and Medicaid Now that strong  effective FDA legislation supported by the public health community has been reintroduced  we ask that you cosponsor it and work for its speedy enactment into law during the first session of the new Congress Sincerely American Cancer SocietyAmerican Heart AssociationAmerican Lung AssociationCampaign for Tobacco Free

Davis  R VA  and Senators Ted Kennedy  D MA  and John Cornyn  R TX  for their bipartisan leadership in introducing the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act to give the FDA authority to regulate the manufacture  sale  distribution  and marketing of tobacco products  Passage of this legislation will end the cruel irony that cigarettes are the most important preventable cause of death and disease in the United States and one of the least regulated products in our society Every year  440 000 Americans die from diseases caused by tobacco use  which kills more Americans than heroin  PCP  cocaine  alcohol and every other drug combined  Tobacco is responsible for more than  75 billion in health care costs and  92 billion in productivity losses each year Tobacco addiction usually begins in childhood or adolescence  Each day  2 000 kids become addicted smokers and one third will die prematurely as a result  Some of the provisions in this legislation would stop illegal sales of tobacco products to children  restrict tobacco marketing  especially to children  ban fruit and candy flavorings in cigarettes  and require more informative health warnings  The AMA urges Congress to protect the public health of Americans by passing legislation to authorize effective FDA regulation of tobacco products    Dr  Davis is the AMA President Elect and former director of the Office on

ProductsIts Time to End the Special Protection for Big TobaccoStatement of John KirkwoodPresident and CEOAmerican Lung AssociationWashington  DC  February 15  2007   The American Lung Association commends Senator Ted Kennedy  D MA   Senator John Cornyn  R TX   Representative Henry Waxman  D CA  and Representative Tom Davis  R VA  for the introduction of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act  strong  bipartisan legislation that would give the U S  Food and Drug Administration authority over tobacco products  Once enacted into law  this measure will end the special protection enjoyed by the tobacco companies for decades and seriously reduce the devastating impact of tobacco use in the United States  Tobacco related diseases are the leading preventable cause of death in the United States  causing more than 438 000 deaths each year  Each day  more than 1 140 kids become regular smokers  and one third of them will ultimately die from their habit  The tobacco companies spend more than  15 15 billion a year marketing their deadly products  preying on our children  who make up the replacement generation of smokers  In August 2006  U S  District Court Judge Gladys Kessler correctly concluded that tobacco companies have engaged in a long term  fraudulent scheme to mislead the American people about the health risks of smoking  the addictiveness of their products  and their tactics for marketing their products to children  In her decision  Judge Kessler wrote that the tobacco companies have marketed and sold their lethal products with zeal  with deception  with a single minded focus on their financial success  and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted  Unless this important legislation becomes law  the tobacco companies will continue to aggressively market their products to children and lie about the health consequences of smoking  The American Lung Association is committed to working with Congress to ensure that the legislation becomes law in 2007  About the American Lung AssociationBeginning our second century  the American Lung Association is the leading organization working to prevent lung

Henry Waxman  D CA  and Tom Davis  R VA  for introducing legislation that will authorize the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  to regulate tobacco products  For too long  tobacco companies have tried to play by their own rules  escaping much needed federal oversight  They need to play with a clean deck  one thats not marked with misleading and damaging information  Scientific evidence leaves no doubt that tobacco causes death and disability  including one out of every five deaths from heart disease  If we are going to win the war against tobacco  Congress must pass this overdue bill  Tobacco is one of the least regulated consumer products  Rat poison is regulated by the FDA  except when its found in a cigarette  Unlike other manufacturers  tobacco companies are not required to disclose ingredients in their products  It has become increasingly important for Big Tobacco to undergo strict regulation as tobacco marketers surreptitiously entice people to pick up this deadly habit  Tobacco use remains the single most preventable cause of death in the U S  More than 440 000 Americans die each year from tobacco related disease  with heart disease  stroke and other cardiovascular diseases accounting for more than one third of these deaths  Giving FDA the authority to regulate tobacco will save countless lives and hold a renegade industry accountable  FOR MORE

Smoking Prevention Tobacco Control Act  bipartisan legislation in the House and Senate that would grant the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  the authority to regulate the sale  distribution and advertising of tobacco products  Tobacco  which kills more than 400 000 Americans each year and remains the leading cause of preventable death in the country  is the only consumable product the FDA does not regulate Congress has the opportunity to take a monumental step and grant the Food and Drug Administration the meaningful and long overdue authority to regulate tobacco  which kills 440 000 people and costs our nation  96 7 billion in health care bills every year  said John R  Seffrin  PhD  chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society and ACS CAN  The tobacco industry has demonstrated time and again that  if left to its own devices  it will falsely market its deadly products to our children  portraying this deadly addiction as glamorous and cool and luring 4 000 kids to try their first cigarette every day  The FDA has the scientific expertise necessary to effectively regulate tobacco products and the health related claims made by the tobacco companies  As a

of American Cancer Society Cancer Action NetworkSM  American Heart Association  American Lung Association and Campaign for Tobacco Free KidsWashington  D C   February 15  2007   Our public health organizations strongly support the bipartisan legislation introduced today in Congress to provide the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  with effective authority to regulate tobacco products  This legislation presents Congress with a truly historic opportunity to protect our children from tobacco addiction and save lives by addressing the nations number one preventable cause of death  We applaud U S  Senators Edward Kennedy  D MA  and John Cornyn  R TX  and U S  Representatives Henry Waxman  D CA  and Tom Davis  R VA  for their leadership in producing strong bills that would end special protection for the tobacco industry and protect our children and the nations health instead We urge both the Senate and the House to quickly enact this long overdue legislation into law and to reject all efforts to weaken it  Every day Congress fails to act  another 1 200 Americans die from tobacco use and more than 1 000 children become new regular smokers  Each year in the United States  tobacco use kills more than 400 000 people and costs the nation more than  96 billion in health care bills  The legislation introduced today would save countless lives and improve health for generations to come by reducing tobacco use and its devastating consequences  which include cancer  heart disease  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD  and diseases that affect virtually every organ in the human body Unbelievably  despite all the harm they cause  tobacco products are exempt from basic health and safety regulations that apply to other products  such as food  drugs  cosmetics and even dog food  The tobacco companies continue to take advantage of this lack of regulation to market their deadly and addictive products to our children  deceive consumers about the harm their products cause  make changes to their products without disclosing them  such as secretly increasing nicotine levels in cigarette smoke  as recent studies have shown   and resist any meaningful change to make their products less harmful  Until Congress grants the FDA authority over tobacco products  the tobacco companies will continue to get away with their harmful practices that addict children and make it difficult for smokers to quit The proposed legislation would grant the FDA the authority and resources to effectively regulate the manufacturing  marketing  labeling  distribution and sale of tobacco products  The FDA would have authority to  Restrict tobacco advertising and promotions  especially to children   Stop illegal sales of tobacco products to children  Ban candy flavored cigarettes  which clearly are starter products for young new smokers   Require changes in tobacco products  such as the removal of harmful ingredients or the reduction of nicotine levels  Prohibit health claims about so called reduced risk products that are not scientifically proven or that would discourage current tobacco users from quitting or encourage new users to start  Require tobacco companies to disclose the contents of tobacco products  changes to their products and research about the health effects of their products   Require larger and more informative health warnings on tobacco products  Prohibit terms such as light  mild and low tar that have mislead consumers into believing that certain cigarettes are safer than others These are common sense measures that should have been enacted into law long ago  In 2004  the U S  Senate voted 78 15 to pass FDA tobacco legislation as an amendment to a corporate tax bill  but it was killed in the conference committee Despite the tobacco companies claims of reform  recent events underscore that their harmful practices continue today and show why the FDA tobacco legislation is so critical  On August 17  2006  U S  District Judge Gladys Kessler issued a final opinion in the U S  government s landmark tobacco lawsuit that found the major tobacco companies have violated civil racketeering laws and defrauded the American people by lying for decades about the health risks of smoking and their marketing to children  Judge Kessler also found that the tobacco companies wrongdoing  including their marketing to children  continues today  The evidence in this case clearly establishes that Defendants have not ceased engaging in unlawful activity  However  Judge Kessler felt constrained by law in the remedies she could order and put the responsibility on Congress to take additional action  In a democracy  it is the body elected by the people  namely Congress  that should step up to the plate and address national issues with such enormous economic  public health  commercial and social ramifications  Since Judge Kesslers ruling  two studies  one by the Massachusetts Department of Health and the other by the Harvard School of Public Health  have found that the tobacco companies have secretly and significantly increased the levels of nicotine in cigarette smoke since 1998  These findings indicate that as smoking rates decline  and more smokers try to quit  tobacco companies have sought to maintain addiction among smokers and to addict a new generation of replacement smokers  The tobacco companies can secretly increase nicotine levels because no federal agency has regulatory authority over what they put in cigarettes  The tobacco companies have taken advantage of their unregulated status to introduce so  called reduced risk cigarettes with claims like all of the tasteless of the toxins and reduced carcinogens  premium taste  However  no government agency currently has the authority to make sure these claims are scientifically proven and the products are marketed responsibly  These new products risk a repeat of the public health disaster caused by the marketing of light and low tar cigarettes  Millions of smokers switched to these brands thinking they were safer or would help them quit only to find out decades later that neither is true and the tobacco companies knew this all along  as the National Cancer Institute concluded in a November 2001 report   The major cigarettes companies have easily circumvented the minimal restrictions placed on their marketing by the 1998 state tobacco settlement and have since more than doubled their marketing to at least  15 1 billion a year  more than  41 billion every day  according to the Federal Trade Commission  Much of this marketing continues to appeal to children  A study published in the December 2006 issue of the peer reviewed journal Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine found that exposure to tobacco marketing and pro tobacco depictions in movies  television and videos more than doubles the odds that children under 18 will become tobacco users If you have any questions or to schedule an interview
