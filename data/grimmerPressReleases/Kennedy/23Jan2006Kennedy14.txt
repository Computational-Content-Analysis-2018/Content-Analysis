         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent a letter to Senator Specter requesting key documents on Judge Alito s involvement in the Concerned Alumni of Princeton  CAP  as well as raising several questions that need to be answered before the hearings     More than simply a conservative alumni group  CAP was formed in 1972 to oppose Princeton s decision to admit women and minorities and was openly hostile to gay and disabled individuals  When trying to secure a position as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel  Judge Alito proudly noted his CAP membership in his 1985 application     Alito joined CAP shortly after its founding in 1972 and touted his membership as a qualification for an appointment to DOJ in 1985  after many other alumni  including former Senator Bill Bradley and Senator Frist  criticized CAP s positions and tactics  In 1975  an alumni panel that included Senator Bill Frist  a 1974 Princeton graduate  unanimously concluded that CAP had presented a distorted  narrow and hostile view of the university       Despite plugging his CAP membership in 1985  Judge Alito made the decision not to mention his involvement to the Senate Judiciary Committee   which included former Senator and CAP opponent Bill Bradley   after being nominated to the 3rd Circuit  In his questionnaire for his appointment to the Supreme Court  Judge Alito now states that he has no memory of his membership  other than his 1985 job application    In his letter  Senator Kennedy asked Specter to request copies of files in the possession of the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress as part of the Papers of William A Rusher 1940 1989  Mr  Rusher was Publisher of the National Review and an active founder and leader of CAP  His papers include documents related to Concerned Alumni of Princeton  including clipping files  background information  correspondence and memoranda  financial records  fund raising material  lists of supporters  minutes of meetings  issues and other items relating to CAP s magazine Prospect    Below is the text of the letter to Chairman Specter  pdf versions are available upon request    December 22  2005   The Honorable Arlen Specter United States Senate Washington  DC 20510   Dear Mr  Chairman     As you know  when Judge Samuel Alito applied for his job in the Office of Legal Counsel in the Meese Justice Department in November 1985  he submitted a list of his memberships and other activities to impress Attorney General Meese and Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper with his enthusiastic philosophical commitment to their particular constitutional  legal  and political point of view     Among the organizations he listed was Concerned Alumni of Princeton  CAP   an organization created in 1972  the year Judge Alito graduated  The organization was described in the press at the time and in its own literature as opposed to the increasing number of women  African Americans and Hispanics at the university  The organization also published articles critical of the rights of the disabled     Our former Senate colleague Bill Bradley  a graduate of the university in1965  initially joined the advisory board for the group s magazine  Prospect  but publicly separated himself from the group in 1973  because he felt it promoted a right wing view rather than the balanced view he had been led to believe it would present  In 1975 an official report by a committee of Princeton alumni that included William Frist  now Senator Frist  concluded that CAP s distorted  narrow and hostile view of the University had misinformed and even alarmed many alumni and undoubtedly generated adverse national publicity    The heated debate in the University community and in the press continued throughout the life of the organization from 1972 through 1986  For example  Senator Bradley s resignation letter was published in Prospect in September 1973  a New Yorker article covered the controversy in 1977  and the Princeton Alumni Weekly carried articles on the group as late as April and June of 1986  Prospect was originally mailed to CAP members and contributors  and beginning in 1974 to all graduates listed in the Alumni Directory  The Alumni Weekly was mailed to all living Princeton graduates    It appears from recent press interviews that Judge Alito became involved with CAP through one of CAP s founders early in CAP s history  In spite of the prominence he gave to CAP in his 1985 application to the Justice Department and its well known and controversial activities  Judge Alito s participation in CAP was not disclosed in the public documents relating to his 1987 nomination as U S  Attorney for New Jersey or his 1990 nomination to the U S  Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit  The subject was not discussed at his 1990 hearing  In fact  Senator Bradley  based on a recommendation Judge Alito had obtained from the judge for whom he had served as a law clerk  introduced and endorsed Judge Alito one hundred percent for the Third Circuit    In view of CAP s troubling opposition to equal educational opportunity for women  minorities  and the disabled  it is important for the Committee to learn more about Judge Alito s involvement in this organization  However  even after his recollection was refreshed by a document I recently reviewed  presumably his 1985 job application to the Justice Department   Judge Alito s response to our recent questionnaire states that he cannot remember anything about his membership in CAP beyond what is stated in that document  Unless a further reading of the many documents relating to this issue restores his memory of the matter  we are unlikely to obtain any further information from him on this potentially important subject    Clearly  to understand fully the importance of the partial facts known from secondary sources  and to avoid the prospect of a delay in our schedule to obtain the full story  we need answers to a number of questions before our hearings    Was Judge Alito a member of or contributor to CAP  a participant in any of its meetings or on its mailing list   1  in 1973  when Senator Bradley s resignation letter was published in Prospect   2  in 1974  when the controversy was first aired in the New York Times   3  in 1977  when a lengthy article on CAP appeared in the New Yorker  or  4  in 1986 when the debate over CAP continued in the pages of the Alumni Weekly    What was the exact nature of Judge Alito s participation in CAP and his contacts or correspondence with its officers and staff during the years 1972 87    Judge Alito lists other Princeton alumni activities in his 1990 and 2005 Committee forms  indicating that he has remained an active and interested alumnus throughout the relevant period  Did he ever personally express a view either publicly or privately on the CAP controversy or the positions advocated by CAP  as many alumni did    Was anyone connected with CAP contacted regarding Judge Alito s involvement with CAP  either in connection with his New Jersey Bar application  1975   or in connection with his federal job applications and security clearances  1977  1981  and 1985   his U S  Attorney and Judicial nominations  1987  1990   or his possible selection for the Supreme Court  2001  2005     At any time before Senator Bradley appeared before our Committee in 1990 to introduce then U S  Attorney Alito to the Committee and to endorse his Third Circuit nomination  did Judge Alito write  say or do anything documenting his general attention to CAP news or his specific awareness that Senator Bradley had been a public critic of CAP    Did Judge Alito inform Senator Bradley that he had been a participant in CAP before requesting or allowing Senator Bradley to recommend his confirmation as a judge on the Third Circuit    During his 1987 or 1990 confirmation processes  did Judge Alito  the Justice Department  including the FBI   or the ABA provide the Committee with any information relating to Judge Alito s membership in CAP    Would Senator Bradley s unqualified endorsement of Judge Alito for the Third Circuit have been affected if he had known of Judge Alito s involvement in CAP and his voluntary listing of his CAP membership in support of his selection as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General  the position which put him on track toward his later judicial appointment    Answers to a large number of these questions are likely to be found in files in the possession of the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress as part of the Papers of William A Rusher 1940 1989  Mr  Rusher was Publisher of the National Review and an active founder and leader of CAP  According to the Library s Register of that collection  at least four of its boxes  142  143  144  145  contain the files of Concerned Alumni of Princeton  including clipping files  background information  correspondence and memoranda  financial records  fund raising material  lists of supporters  minutes of meetings  issues and other items relating to Prospect  Box 46 also contains materials relating to T  Harding Jones  a founder of CAP and editor of Prospect  and a person who reportedly involved Judge Alito in CAP  There may also be other files with records of CAP leaders who were familiar with the nominee s role    The Congressional Research Service has attempted to gain access to these files  following its usual policy of not disclosing its requestor  but Mr  Rusher has refused to permit access unless he is told which member s  or committee s  are seeking it  and unless he can control the use of the materials released    It is likely that a formal request for access directly from you on behalf of the Committee would be received with more cooperation than the CRS has received so far  and we urge you to make such a request as soon as possible  In view of the importance of the material and its intended use as part of an official Senate inquiry  the request should be for access to the documents without any restrictions on the Committee s use of the information  unless he is aware of specific documents in those files that merit confidential treatment for a stated reason  The request should include the specified boxes and any other boxes containing materials relating to CAP  its activities  or personnel  including Prospect     Judge Alito s assertion that he cannot recall anything about his controversial involvement in CAP  requires us to find other ways of fulfilling our constitutional responsibility to get at the facts  The Rusher papers provide a readily available means of doing so  Certainly we do not want to leave the Committee  the Senate  and the nation open to an unwelcome surprise when the papers eventually become public after Mr  Rusher s death    As always  we thank you for your cooperation and leadership  and your commitment to making the confirmation process as thorough as possible    Sincerely          Edward M  Kennedy  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
