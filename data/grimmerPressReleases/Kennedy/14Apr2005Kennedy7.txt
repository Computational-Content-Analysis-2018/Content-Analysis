         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  Chairman  thank you for calling this important hearing on immigration enforcement      Current enforcement has reached an all time high in terms of deportation  In fiscal year 2004  we deported nearly 160 000 people     The plenary power doctrine gives Congress the authority to deport non citizens including long time lawful permanent residents  But Congress has a responsibility as well  and so do the courts  to see that non citizens receive due process and that the Executive Branch is fairly and justly implementing the law     Yet some current proposals would curtail judicial review for immigrants  Any limitations to rights guaranteed under the Constitution deserve careful and deliberate consideration  Habeas corpus is a bedrock principle of U S  law  reaching back to Magna Carta  six centuries before our Constitution  It declared that No freeman shall be taken  imprisoned   or in any other way destroyed   except by the lawful judgment of his peers  or by the law of the land  To no one will we sell  to none will we deny or delay  right or justice     Habeas corpus is a fundamental principle of American justice  It s called the Great Writ for a reason    because it means justice for people wrongly detained  We owe it to future generations not to undermine the values embedded in our nation s great legal tradition     These basic principles and values are under siege by some today  and have led to a rise in anti immigrant activism  Last month  a group of college students in Texas held Catch an Illegal Immigrant Day  In our previous subcommittee hearing we were told that vigilantes  as President Bush called them  had convened to watch the southern border and catch immigrants all month  One rancher said he would shoot every single one of  em if he had his way  Obviously  vigilante justice violates everything America stands for  and we can t be content with rhetoric alone against it    I m looking forward to hearing testimony today on the detention asylum seekers    men and women who have stood alone  often at great personal cost  against hostile governments for fundamental principles such as freedom of speech and religious liberty     Yet  these courageous persons are often imprisoned in U S  jails when they reach our shores  The recent report by the bipartisan Commission on International Religious Freedom criticized the incarceration used to detain asylum seekers  because they re often held alongside criminals in stark conditions  under constant surveillance  24 hour lights  and moved from place to place using shackles  The Commission recommended specific detention standards to improve the plight of asylum seekers and proposed an Office of the Refugee Coordinator     I look forward to today s hearing on all these issues  and to working with my colleagues to deal with these abuses      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
