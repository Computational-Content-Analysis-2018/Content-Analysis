Like President Kennedy  I hold the Anti Defamation League in the highest esteem   Since 1913  youve been at the forefront of the battle to protect civil rights and end discrimination and bigotry of all kinds   With 30 regional offices around the country  youre an authoritative voice on these issues in the halls of Congress  and youre an indispensable ally today in the struggle to reform our immigration laws  Our strong ties on that issue go back half a century   In 1958  it was the Anti Defamation League that published the first edition of my brother Jacks book  A Nation of Immigrants   He had been passionate about the issue as a Senator and had proposed far reaching reforms as President   He was working on a revised edition of the book when he left us  and ADL published it in 1964 with a new introduction by my brother  Bobby   The book will be reissued again next year  and Im deeply honored that you have invited me to write the new introduction for it       The issue has been close to my heart as well throughout my years in the Senate   A century and a half ago  all eight of my great grandparents crossed the Atlantic in the famous vessels that were known as coffin ships because so many failed to survive the arduous voyage   They arrived in Boston Harbor  came up the Golden Stairs and passed through the citys Immigration Hall on their way to a new and better life for themselves and their families   From my office today in Boston  I can still see those Golden Stairs  and theyre a constant reminder of that heritage     Every time the Senate takes up the issue of immigration reform  I reread my brothers book for inspiration   The words he wrote half a century ago ring just as true today   As he stated  This was the secret of America   a nation of people with the fresh memory of old traditions who dared to explore new frontiers  people eager to build lives for themselves in a spacious society that did not restrict their freedom of choice and action       Immigrants still come to America in search of a better life for themselves and their families  and they make invaluable contributions to every aspect of our society   Our ability to protect their rights is a test of our own humanity  and we have to get it right today     The recent federal immigration raids on worksites in Massachusetts and a number of other states underscore the urgent need for reform   People suddenly see the issue in a new and clearer light   Theyre for strong enforcement of our immigration laws in the abstract  but theyre appalled at the idea of rounding up and deporting twelve million undocumented men  women  and children living among them as part of their communities       These are people who work hard  love their families  practice their faith  and contribute to their communities   We should provide a way for them to earn the privilege of remaining in this country and becoming American citizens   The Torah and the Talmud teach us that we must welcome the stranger in our midst   It is written in Leviticus that  t he stranger who resides with you shall be to you as one of your citizens  you shall love him as yourself  for you were strangers in the land of Egypt    If we refuse to give the current undocumented population a pathway to legal status  stronger enforcement efforts will only force them deeper into the shadows and allow employers to continue to exploit them   It perpetuates the current two tiered economy  which hurts willing American workers  too   The world is watching to see how we respond to the challenge  whether we can achieve a forward looking reform that makes the most of the talents of new Americans  or whether we will give in to fear and recrimination       Extremist groups often attempt to capitalize on our feelings of vulnerability to blame immigrants for Americas problems   But the ADL does a phenomenal job of setting the record straight   One of your recent reports shocked the nation by exposing the Ku Klux Klans attempt to spread fears of an immigration explosion as a way to incite bigotry and violence against Latinos   Sadly  the current debate on immigration reform is being used by other extremist groups as well to poison the national dialogue and gain partisan advantage The ADL also took the lead recently in exposing the outrageous response by some anti immigrant groups to the tragic shootings at Virginia Tech   By focusing on the ethnic background of the killer  they attempted to blame Asians  immigrants  and other minorities for the deaths of the students   That kind of bigotry undermines our growth as a nation and violates our founding principles   Those who hold such views have consistently been on the wrong side of history  and I say  Shame on them What happened at Virginia Tech was an immense tragedy that none of us will ever forget   Nor will we forget the heroic efforts of Professor Liviu Librescu  a Holocaust survivor from Romania who saved his students lives by holding the door of his classroom closed with his body   His courage was a tribute to humanity at its best   The background of many of the other victims  who came from India  Lebanon  Peru  and other places  also reminds us that we truly are a nation of immigrants      Im committed to working with Republicans in Congress and the White House to enact tough  but fair reforms that protect our borders  enforce our laws  and uphold the ideals on which our country was founded       Our negotiations over the last few weeks have not been easy   One of the most contentious issues has been the treatment of family members of immigrants  which has been the cornerstone of our immigration policy for decades   Some Republicans have proposed a new system that would emphasize employment considerations to the exclusion of family ties   It would be a huge mistake to expand employment based immigration at the expense of our historic tradition of family based immigration   In addition to the obvious humanitarian considerations involved  we cant ignore the lasting contributions that family sponsored immigrants have made to our economy by creating new businesses and services that generate jobs for our people The more they learn about the issue  the more the American people agree that a comprehensive approach is the only viable way to heal our broken immigration system   The elements of the system are so closely tied together that it makes no sense to drive a wedge between them   Border enforcement will be successful only if we regularize the status of the current undocumented population  create a temporary worker program that fulfills the needs of American business  and adopt a strict employment verification system to prevent employers from continuing to attract undocumented workers     We face a critical choice  between a future as a nation of immigrants  or a future measured by higher walls and longer fences   We need to do all we can to create strong bipartisan support for this approach   The American people have waited long enough for immigration reform   The time is right  and the result is up to us   May the beautiful words of the famous Jewish poet  Emma Lazarus  inscribed on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor inspire us now   May we always hold high her lamp beside the golden door Thank you very much
