         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Democratic Senators Edward M  Kennedy  Russell D  Feingold and Richard J  Durbin sent a letter to Chairman Arlen Specter today asking for an additional hearing or postponement on the markup on the bankruptcy bill  The Letter follows    February 15  2005   The Honorable Arlen Specter   Chairman   Committee on the Judiciary   United States Senate   224 Dirksen Senate Office Building   Washington  DC 200510     Dear Chairman Specter    We appreciate your holding a hearing last week on the bankruptcy bill  S  256  We believe it was a useful discussion  and it certainly highlighted some of the critical issues that the Committee faces as it works to pass a fair and evenhanded bankruptcy reform bill    We write to urge you to postpone this week s scheduled markup of the bill in Committee in order to hold at least one additional hearing on the bill  In addition  we believe that the markup will be less time consuming and proceed much more smoothly if adequate time is available for our staffs to work with your staff prior to the markup to discuss and possibly reduce the number of amendments that will be offered     This is the first major reform of the Bankruptcy Code since 1978  The effort has been controversial from the start because the original drafters of this bill in 1998 decided to largely ignore the recommendations of the National Bankruptcy Commission  which held 21 hearings and heard from over 600 witnesses around the country before issuing its report     The Judiciary Committee has not done significant work on this bill since 2001  The hearing you convened last week was the first hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee since February 8  2001  Representatives of the credit card industry  which is the primary proponent of this bill  have not appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on this issue since early March 1999  nearly six years ago    In addition to the need for at least one more hearing  we respectfully suggest that this bill is not yet ready to be marked up by the committee  Should you proceed this week  it is likely that Senators will have many amendments to improve the bill  Many of these amendments are technical  or at least would be fairly simple to resolve  but there has not been time for our staffs to work together to narrow the issues that must be debated in a markup  Some are substantive and will need explanation  discussion  and perhaps fine tuning before there is a consensus    On a bill of this complexity  asking Senators to limit their amendments or hold them for the floor would not be appropriate  The Committee  not the floor  is the forum where detailed discussions of the mechanics of a complex bill should be held  We respectfully urge you to let this process work as it should rather than rushing the bill through without careful analysis and revision  We are certain that the final product will be much improved if you follow that course  We are eager to play a productive role in the Committee s work on this bill  and we thank you for your consideration of this request      Sincerely       Edward M  Kennedy   Russell D  Feingold   Richard J  Durbin    cc   Senator Patrick J  Leahy       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
