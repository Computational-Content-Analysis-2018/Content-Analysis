         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Immigration reform is one of the most pressing issues we face today  Its a security issue  an economic issue  and a moral issue  President Bush told us that it was a top domestic priority    Many members in the Senate understood the importance of the issue and devoted an unprecedented number of weeks to hearings  mark ups and extensive floor debate to this priority  In May  the Senate passed a historic bipartisan bill supported by 64 Senators    The House however passed a very different bill last December  one that has been roundly condemned as cruel and ineffective by religious leaders  Latino leaders  and immigration and security experts  It focuses only on enforcement and makes it a felony for any Good Samaritan to help immigrants  As one religious leaders described it this week  you could go to jail for giving an undocumented immigrant a cup of water in Jesus name   Whats more  the bill does nothing about the 12 million undocumented immigrants who are here already  and it does nothing about the nations future immigration needs  both vital ingredients to an effective immigration policy    Common sense tells us that enforcement alone is not the solution to todays complex immigration challenges  We can build fences  but people will come around them  We can put high tech devices on our borders and they will deter some people  but we all know that many others still will find a way to come  We can make criminals of the pastors and priests who help immigrants  but thats not only contrary to our values  it will have little impact on immigration    The logical next step would have been for Congress to appoint conferees so we could begin negotiating a compromise  That is what we do  pass a Senate bill and pass a House bill  Then conferees are appointed from both Houses to reconcile their differences on the bill  That is what Congress does on critical issues    But  instead of rolling up their sleeves and doing the work necessary to get legislation to the President s desk that deals with the key elements of the immigration problem    that will bolster national security  ensure economic prosperity  and protect families    the Republican leadership in the House frittered away the summer  preferring to embark on a political road show    featuring 60 cynical one sided hearings  and wasting millions of precious taxpayer dollars  And after the bunting came down and the klieg lights were removed  after all the political hoopla and hot rhetoric  what did they produce  A fence   Did they do anything about the millions of people who come here on airplanes with visas  and stay here illegally after their visas expire  No  Just a fence   Did they do anything to ensure that employers dont hire people who are here illegally  No  Just a fence   Did they do anything about the 12 million undocumented immigrants who are here already  living in the shadows while working hard to support their families  No  Just a fence   Yes  Republican leaders wasted time  opportunity  and your money  For a  9 billion fence that wont do the job   Thats just a bumper sticker solution for a complex problem   Its a feel good plan that will have little effect in the real world   We all know what this is about  It may be good politics  but its bad immigration policy   Thats not what Americans want  They deserve something better than a fence    Over and over and over again  the American people have told us that they want our immigration system fixed  and fixed now  They have told us that this complex problem requires a comprehensive solution  The American people want tough but fair laws that will strengthen our borders and crack down on employers who hire undocumented workers  but at the same time provide a practical solution that will allow undocumented immigrants to become taxpaying legal workers who perform tasks needed by our economy   Today or tomorrow  this Republican Congress will recess for the elections  and leave this issue still unresolved    I hope that we can use the next few weeks productively to work together on compromises that can be adopted when we return in November   What is the solution  How do we control our borders effectively  How do we restore the rule of law and make sure that immigrants come to this country with a visa  not with a smuggler    The bipartisan bill passed by the Senate is the only practical way to cure what ails us  The only way we can truly bring illegal immigration under control and achieve border security is to combine enforcement and border protection with a realistic framework for legal immigration    Its obvious that we have insufficient legal avenues for immigrant workers and families to come to this country  and no path to citizenship for the 12 million undocumented workers and families already here  The problem is fueling a black market of smugglers and fake document makers  to the peril of citizens and immigrants alike    Rather than saber rattling  chest thumping  and ranting  the American people would like to see both parties and both Houses of Congress come together to negotiate a realistic and enforceable policy for immigration    Piecemeal proposals wont work  They will only make a bad situation worse  Those who are here illegally will not leave  but will go deeper underground  and those seeking to enter will take even more dangerous routes and be less likely to survive  Employers will have an unstable workforce of men and women who are afraid to speak up when abused  The dysfunctions and pathologies of the current failed system will continue to worsen   On this specific proposal for a fence  lets consider the facts   Never mind that months ago the Senate voted to approve a 370 mile fence  exactly what Secretary Chertoff said he needed for targeted urban areas    Never mind that the Senate has voted to fund the fence Secretary Chertoff requested  Its in the appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security that we will pass this afternoon    Never mind that DHS has not requested additional fencing  Last week  in promoting his Secure Border Initiative  Secretary Chertoff said  What we are looking to build is a virtual fence  a 21st century virtual fence  one that does not involve old fashioned fencing   Never mind that fencing is man power intensive  you need border patrol agents to continuously monitor them to apprehend illegal crossers  But this bill will require DHS to construct up to 850 miles of fencing in remote  desolate areas  in desert and wilderness areas  and even across rivers  where it will serve no security purpose whatsoever   Never mind that it will cost billions of dollars  The Congressional Budget Office estimate the cost at roughly  3 million a mile  which may be on the low end    the first 11 miles of the San Diego fence cost  3 8 million a mile and the final 3 5 mile section cost approximately  9 million a mile    As the Congressional Research Service recently noted  the costs may be even higher  You need to take into account the terrain  land acquisition  environmental planning  private contractors  double layering  fence design  procurement costs and a number of other factors  We also cant forget the annual maintenance costs  which could be as high as  1 billion a year   Never mind that fences dont work  Undocumented immigrant entries have increased tenfold since the strategy of fencing was introduced in the mid 1990s  Since that time  the probability of apprehending an unauthorized border crosser fell from 20 percent to 5 percent  The United States now spends  1700 per border apprehension  up from  300 in 1992  San Diegos wall has been a boon for the smuggling industry  and increased the loss of immigrant lives by shifting entry to the desert   Never mind that fencing will do nothing to stop the 40 50 percent of the people currently in the United States who entered the country with legal visas and have now overstayed their visas   Never mind that fences wont keep out criminals or terrorists  The 9 11 terrorists didnt come across the Mexican border illegally   they entered the U S  with visas    Never mind that fences wont stop immigrants from coming here to work  As Governor Napolitano of Arizona recently said  You show me a 50 foot wall and I ll show you a 51 foot ladder at the border to get over it   Narrow  shortsighted  enforcement only proposals like a fence will never fix our broken immigration system    We should listen to Tom Ridge  former Secretary of Homeland Security  who recently said  Trying to gain operational control of the borders is impossible unless our enhanced enforcement efforts are coupled with a robust Temporary Guest Worker program and a means to entice those now working illegally out of the shadows into some type of legal status    A group of former high ranking government officials has said unequivocally  The reality is that stronger enforcement and a more sensible approach to the 10 12 million illegal aliens in the country today are inextricably interrelated  One cannot succeed without the other   President Bush agreed  In May  he got it right when he declared  and I quote  An immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive because all elements of this problem must be addressed together  or none of them will be solved at all   What the Republican leadership doesn t seem to get  is that comprehensive immigration reform is all about security    Homeland Security  Economic Security  Family security    That is what the vast majority of our people want  They want realistic solutions that effectively protect our nation  They dont want piecemeal  feel good measures that will waste billions of precious taxpayer dollars and do nothing to correct the serious problems    What can we expect in the next month   The Republican leadership has two choices  They can bring us together to work out effective compromises for a comprehensive bill   Or they can continue to use hard working immigrants as political pawns for Novembers elections    I hope that they will not choose the politically expedient choice  to embark on another slanderous campaign  featuring more political stunts  misleading press releases  and glossy campaign ads about how tough they are on the border    The Chicago Tribune editorial page understands this tactic  Earlier this week they wrote that Immigrant bashing is so much easier than immigration reform   Sacrificing good immigration policy for political expediency and hateful rhetoric is not just shameful    it is cowardly    We have the bill to solve this problem now    We owe the American people a serious answer on the issue  and our Republican leadership should be held accountable for their inaction and their inability to address this pressing issue facing our nation    Let s stop this farce  Lets stop playing politics with immigration  We know theyre wrong  Their scheme will leave us weaker and less secure  We cant allow them to derail our strong bipartisan reforms    I urge my colleagues to choose good policy over political expedience and oppose this bill
