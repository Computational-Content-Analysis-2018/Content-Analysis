KENNEDY REMARKS AT NATIONAL TRUST  HGTV AWARDS CEREMONY  AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY     Thank you  David McCullough  for that generous introduction  Your brilliant books have taught us so much about our American heritage  Were all very grateful for your passion for history and your extraordinary narrative talent with us    Your books have earned countless awards and recognition because of their intellectual honesty  theyre a constant presence on the bestsellers lists because they are so wonderfully entertaining and informative     Its a privilege also to be here with Dick Moe  Hes a dynamic leader for the National Trust and because of his efforts  many of the most irreplaceable treasures of our heritage and culture are being protected and preserved     Its also an honor to be here with Judy Girard  As President of HGTV  shes doing an excellent job strengthening programming and expanding audiences  and I commend her for her many successes    Were here this evening because we share a strong commitment to protect our nations extraordinary natural and cultural resources     I was fortunate to grow up in Massachusetts  surrounded by countless icons from the days of the revolution  From my office in Boston  I can look out the window and see the USS Constitution  the Old North Church and Paul Reveres Home  If I stretch a little  I can also see the Old State House  It was there that James Otis spoke so eloquently and inspired John Adams to observe then and there independence was born  A little further along Beacon Hill  I can also see the African Meeting House  Bostons oldest African American church    Around the state are countless reminders of colonial history  which provide valuable insights on the first settlers and the ruggedness of their lives    These are the stories of our shared history  and were all in your debt for ensuring that these treasures and memories will be available and accessible for generations to come    Just weeks ago  I was part of the tenth anniversary celebration of the Essex National Heritage Area  This remarkable public private partnership incorporates colonial and pre colonial cultural and historic landmarks into a contemporary economic template for economic growth and cultural tourism  The heritage of the area is preserved in its many outstanding cultural and historic organizations  from the Peabody Essex Museum  the Salem Witch Museum and the Saugus Iron Works  These organizations are tremendous tourist attractions and the linchpins of the economic growth of Essex County  For the past decade  Essex National Heritage Area has been a tremendous success  so much so that it has been replicated in twelve other areas around the country     My mother loved history  and there was a special place in her heart for the stories of the immigrants who settled in Boston and became a part of the city she loved so much  As a young girl  her father  Mayor Honey Fitz  took her on tours of the city to see the neighborhoods and learn about their history    It was one hundred years ago that my grandfather was elected Mayor of Boston  a relatively short time in the annals of history  but Boston has continued to grow and remains today a vital hub of economic prosperity  tolerance and democratic ideals    Mother passed along the stories she heard and the history she learned to all of us in the family  Most of all  she shared her love of history    Mother often brought us on picnics to Walden Pond  She would talk about the woods  about Thoreau and Emerson  it was an opportunity to celebrate arts and the environment  She would be very pleased with all the efforts that have been done to preserve those historic woods  I know that Don Henley received this award several years ago and it is a wonderful recognition of his tireless efforts to preserve Walden Woods     Her love of history affected us all  And it is no surprise that some of the warmest memories I have during my brothers Presidency are weekends we spent together at Camp David  From that rustic retreat  we would venture out and visit Civil War battle sites  Ill never forget those times together  private moments  learning the lessons of the past to prepare for the challenges at hand     Today  one of the beautiful traditions we have in our far flung family is to gather for an annual visit to a historic site  Forty of us  with lots of children  nieces and nephews  visited Harpers Ferry earlier this year  It brings history to life for all of us    I always hoped everyone was paying attention while enjoying these family reunions  But I was overwhelmed when I received a note from my nephew Mark about his daughter Mollys reaction to our most recent trip to Harpers Ferry  She decided to write a letter to President Bush  In her own hand she wrote    I think war should stop  It is a horrible thing  People are getting really hurt  I am praying for them  and for war to stop  I wrote you this note because on Friday my Great Uncle Teddy took me to the history museum  And Saturday he took me to Harpers Ferry  And I learned about John Brown  and I learned how bad war was  If you can stop it  I will be so happy  If it takes you ten years  I will still be happy  Love  Molly Shriver    I was proud of Molly  and I know her great grandmother Rose would be pleased and very proud  too     I know that so many of you have similar memories  family visits to such sites in your own home states    Dick Moe and his staff have the important mission to keep these sites intact so that future generations of Americans can visit and learn and be better prepared to serve our nation in their own time and their own way    So  its a great honor to receive this award  I commend each of you for all that youre doing to advance the cause of historic preservation  Its a wonderful mission  and the nation is grateful for your leadership    Id like to thank David McCullough again for being a part of this special evening for me  We worked together to preserve the historic home in Cambridge of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow  The home had been an important revolutionary headquarters before becoming the residence for this beloved American poet  I am reminded of Longfellows words     Lives of great men all remind us  We can make our lives sublime   And  departing  leave behind us  Footprints in the sands of time   Footprints  that perhaps another   Sailing oer lifes solemn main   A forlorn and shipwrecked brother   Seeing  shall take heart again      Congratulations to all of you  for all that you do so that others  many years to come  might take heart again         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
