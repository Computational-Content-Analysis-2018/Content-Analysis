FORUM ON  IMMIGRATION REFORM JUNE 9  2006   As prepared for delivery    Its a great honor to be here at the John F  Kennedy Library to speak about Boston as an immigrant city  and about our effort in Congress to pass reforms in our immigration laws    Theres no more appropriate city than Boston for such a conversation  A century and a half ago all eight of my own great grandparents walked up the Golden Stairs from Boston Harbor and passed through the citys Immigration Hall on their way to a better life for themselves and their families   No one spoke more eloquently about our history and our heritage as a nation of immigrantsand no one fought harder on behalf of fair and rational immigration lawsthan President Kennedy   One of his last acts as president was to introduce a major series of immigration reforms to end the ugly race based national origins quota system  which had defined our admissions policies at that time  As he told Congress in July 1963  The enactment of this legislation will not resolve all of our important problems in the field of immigration law  It will  however  provide a sound basis upon which we can build in developing an immigration law that serves the national interest and reflects in every detail the principles of equality and human dignity to which our nation subscribes   My own first important legislative accomplishment was to shepherd President Kennedys proposal through Congress in 1965  and to repeal the national origins system    In recent years  however  our immigration laws have not kept pace with the changing demands of our economy  The basic structure of our immigration laws has remained unchanged for forty years  even though our economy and our relationships with other countries have changed dramatically   For decades  waiting lists for family visas have grown longer  and the unmet demand for legal immigrant workers has grown larger  For decades  we built fences at the border but failed to enforce immigration laws at the worksite  We left in place the jobs magnet that has motivated millions of immigrants to enter the country illegally  The result has been a crisis of undocumented immigration that is totally at odds with our basic respect for the rule of law  Immigrants fuel our economy  but undocumented immigration undermines American wages and leaves employers unsure about the reliability of their workforce and vulnerable to capricious enforcement  Immigrants enhance our security by strengthening the ties with other lands and providing the energy and the drive to keep America at the top of the global economy  But undocumented immigrants weaken our security at the border and within the United States    The need for reform is obvious  Labor and business both want a better system in which employers rights are respected and they are no longer vulnerable to deportation  And in the post 9 11 world our national security demands that we know the names of those living and working among us  and that the United States must gain control of its borders   Members of Congress are united about some of the steps necessary to respond to these demands  We all agree that part of the answer is strict enforcement at the border  The House bill relies heavily on walls and fences  which Im skeptical about  The Senate bill uses cutting edge surveillance toolsa virtual fenceand more cooperation with our neighbors   We also agree that part of the answer is tougher enforcement at American worksites  We passed employer sanctions legislation back in 1986  but we never gave employers the tools to distinguish among legal and undocumented immigrants  and we never put enforcement resources in place to hold bad apple employers to account  Both the House and Senate bills would require employers to check the eligibility of new employees against an electronic database  a resource which will finally give employers certainty about the status of their job applicants  Both would devote significant new funding and personnel to worksite enforcement  and both would substantially increase penalties on non compliant employers   Beyond that  the bills diverge  The House version criminalizes undocumented immigrants  and even makes criminals out of Good Samaritans such as priests and social workers who minister to undocumented immigrants or give them emergency assistance   That makes no sense    We cannot solve the current crisis by relying exclusively on higher walls and stricter enforcement     The Senate bill addresses the obvious need for immigration by modernizing our legal visa system to ensure that the demands of American families and employers are met legitimately  and we provide a pathway to legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants already here    Comprehensive immigration reform is good for our economy and our security  and its consistent with our values and our heritage as a nation of immigrants  Hopefully  a majority in the House will agree  and this major battle will conclude successfully  If not it will obviously be a high priority for the newly elected Congress in November   Thank you all  again for the opportunity to speak about this important issue at my brothers library  Its time to finally fulfill his vision for Americas immigrants  Were almost there and I appreciate your support for this great goal              Melissa Wagoner
