         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the party line vote on his amendment   This vote was a sad confirmation that this Republican Congress has become a rubber stamp for the Bush administration  My amendment would have told the world that we will not stand for the abuse of any American anywhere  Through its secret prisons and outrageous conduct at Abu Grhaib and Guantanamo  this administration has made the world doubt our commitment to the Geneva Convention  and so weakened its protection of Americans abroad  My amendment would have required that this Administration correct course by reaffirming the United States insistence that other nations follow the Geneva Conventions when dealing with Americans  As such  it would have provided essential protection for Americans who are overseas fighting the war in terror  Similar legislation the War Crimes Actwas proposed by a Republican Congressman in 1996  and passed without opposition  Likewise  this Congress passed  90 9  legislation prohibiting our armed services from using certain practices  All the amendment would have done is tell the world that they cannot use those same practices  which include waterboarding and induced hypothermia    I believe that if every Senator voted his or her own conscience  this measure would have passed unanimously  I refuse to believe that Senators are not deeply concerned with the safety of Americans overseas  Unfortunately  that concern was outweighed today by blind loyalty to the party and the President who negotiated this legislation in secret and then had the nerve to tell the United States Senate that it must not add or subtract a word  This Republican Congress is so focused on providing our President with unlimited authority that has left open the door to tyrants abroad who would claim the same authority over American citizens     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
