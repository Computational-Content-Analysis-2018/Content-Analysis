         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   I support this resolution    Apart from President Bush  no one embodies the Administrations failures in Iraq more than Secretary Rumsfeld  On issue after issue  Secretary Rumsfeld has been wrong  and the consequences have been severe for our men and women in uniform and for the safety of the American people    In September 2002  as Congress was preparing to vote on whether to authorize the war  Secretary Rumsfeld stated categorically to the House Armed Services Committee that  Knowing what we know about Iraqs history  no conclusion is possible except that they have and are escalating their WMD programs  As the world now knows  Secretary Rumsfeld was wrong    When General Eric Shinseki estimated at the start of the war that we would need several hundred thousand soldiers to carry out the mission  Secretary Rumsfeld scoffed and said  The idea that it would take several hundred thousand U S  forces I think is far from the mark  Again  Secretary Rumsfeld was profoundly wrong   When concerns were expressed that America would end up in a lengthy and intractable war  Secretary Rumsfeld said that the war could last  you know  six days  six weeks  I doubt six months  He was convinced that the war would be easy  cheap  and fast  But as he well knows  its now been more than three years  with no end in sight to the quagmire were in   Secretary Rumsfeld was careless and callous about issues that have proven critical to our chances of success in Iraq  When massive looting occurred after Baghdad fell because we did not have enough troops to maintain order  Secretary Rumsfeld cavalierly dismissed the problem  saying  stuff happens    Secretary Rumsfeld failed to see the insurgency that was taking root in the streets and cities of Iraq  He consistently called the insurgents dead enders and failed to see the huge danger that their improvised explosive devices posed to our troops    Secretary Rumsfeld sent our soldiers into battle without adequate armor  and failed to correct the problem immediately  when it became obvious in the casualty reports  Instead  he blithely excused his own preparations for war by saying You go to war with the army you have  Theyre not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time    Secretary Rumsfeld still doesnt understand the war he rushed us into  He has said  The idea that what s happening over there is a quagmire is so fundamentally inconsistent with the facts  But the dictionary defines a quagmire as a complex or precarious position where disengagement is difficult  No serious person thinks that definition does not describe our plight in Iraq    On issue after issue  Secretary Rumsfeld has blundered  He is the chief architect and defender of a policy that has failed our soldiers and our national security interests  and failed miserably  He has consistently put ideology above basic military planning  As long as he remains at the Pentagon  our policy will not change    Fundamentally  however  the American people know that the buck does not stop with Secretary Rumsfeld  It stops with President Bush    It is preposterous for President Bush to pretend that the war in Iraq has made America safer    President Bush and his administration distorted and misrepresented the intelligence about Saddam Husseins links to Al Qaeda and his nuclear weapons program    The Bush Administration bungled pre war diplomacy on Iraq  leaving America isolated and unable to obtain real allied support   The Bush team failed to consider the possibility that the liberation of Iraq might not be the cakewalk they predicted    The President failed to consider the possibility that his preoccupation with Iraq could undo much of our achievement in Afghanistan   The Bush Administration failed to understand the grave implications of disbanding the Iraqi military  and they had to begin training a new one from scratch when their blunder was finally obvious too obvious to deny   President Bush once said that the war in Iraq was a catastrophic success  He was half right the war has been a catastrophe  for our soldiers  who were foolishly sent to war with no plan to win the peace  It has been a catastrophe for our nations standing in the world  It has been a catastrophe for the war on terror  The war in Iraq has distracted us from the real threat of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and elsewhere  It has made the war against terrorism far harder to win    None of this in any way detracts from the extraordinary heroism of our soldiers  They have responded to their mission in Iraq with immense courage and dedication  But their outstanding service to our country does not and cannot excuse the incompetence of their civilian leaders   In an August  2004 report on the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison  General Anthony Jones defined leadership failure as a situation where leaders did not take charge  failed to provide appropriate guidance and failed to accept responsibility or apply good judgment  By this standard  and on this record  President Bush and his Administration are clearly guilty of leadership failure   Despite their colossal failures and their gross incompetence  no one has been held accountable    On the contrary  those who have been wrong on Iraq  consistently and deadly wrong and whose advice has made America less safe have been rewarded    President Bush refused to accept Defense Secretary Rumsfelds resignation  despite blunder after blunder    Paul Wolfowitz  former Deputy Secretary of Defense and a chief architect of the war  was promoted to President of the World Bank  despite his persistent rosy assessments of progress in Iraq and his assurances that Iraqi oil would pay for the reconstruction    George Tenet  former Director of the CIA  was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom  the nations highest civilian honor  despite his slam dunk assurance that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction    Paul Bremer  former head of the American occupation entity  was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom as well  despite his decision to disband the Iraqi army with their weapons in tact    Iraqi exile leader Ahmad Chalabi was given a warm welcome on his visit last year to the United States to meet with Vice President Cheney  Secretary of State Rice  and National Security Advisor Hadley  despite the fact that he is under investigation by the FBI for allegedly divulging U S  secrets to Iran    By contrast  the military holds its soldiers accountable for their failures    In 2003  the Navy fired 14 Commanding Officers  In October that year  the Commanding Officer of a Prowler Aircraft Squadron lost his job after one of his jets skidded off a runway  The Navy cited a loss of confidence when they made the decision to dismiss him    In December 2003 and January 2004  respectively  the Commanding Officers of the submarine JIMMY CARTER and the frigate USS GARY were fired  both for loss of confidence   In 2004  the Navy fired the Captain of the U S S  John F  Kennedy aircraft carrier for running over a small boat in the Persian Gulf  The Navy didnt hide the incompetence or gloss over the facts  It responded decisively  It stated plainly that it had lost confidence in the Captains ability to operate the carrier safely  He was the 11th Commanding Officer of the Navy to be fired that year    In February 2004  the Commanding Officer of the frigate USS SAMUEL B ROBERTS was fired for a loss of confidence  after he spent a night off the ship during a port visit to Ecuador   For military officers in the Navy  the message is clear  if you fail  youre fired  The message to the civilian leadership in this Administration is equally clear  if you fail  there will be no consequences and no accountability  even if more than 2 600 Americans lose their lives    It is time for the Department of Defense to run a tighter ship at all levels of command  including the civilian leadership  Those leaders at the Pentagon should be held at least to the same standard of accountability that military officers in the Navy are held to    Secretary Rumsfeld must be held accountable for the massive failures in Iraq  Civilian control of the military is one of the great cornerstones of our democracy  But what if the civilian leaders dont know what theyre doing  and mindlessly order our troops into battle unprepared   Clearly  clearly  there must be accountability for this breathtaking incompetence  which has put our soldiers in daily danger  and weakened Americas national security    In a hearing by the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2004  former Defense Secretary Harold Brown described the key to accountability  At each level  the question is loss of confidence  And in the Navy  the loss of confidence goes with grounding your ship  At a higher level  the loss of confidence has to be determined on a basis thats somewhat broader  the full performance  And I think that applies at the highest military levels  And it applies at the level of the Secretary of Defense and his staff        And the electorate has to decide on the basis of its confidence at election time   The Bush Administration has had its chance  and it failed the basic test of competence  It is more focused on the spin war than the real war in Iraq   There is broad agreement among military experts  members of Congress of both parties  and the overwhelming majority of the American people that we need to change course in Iraq    We need this administration to face up to its mistakes and correct them  A good place to start would be for President Bush to replace Secretary Rumsfeld   A President who valued competence rather than loyalty would have fired Rumsfeld long ago  A President who wanted to be a uniter  not a divider would fire Rumsfeld today for equating his critics with Nazi appeasers  And a President who was serious about the war on terror would nominate a new Secretary of Defense who will focus on battling the terrorists instead of battling the growing number of Americans calling for change in our policy in Iraq    It is long past time for Secretary Rumsfeld to go  I urge the Senate to pass this resolution     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
