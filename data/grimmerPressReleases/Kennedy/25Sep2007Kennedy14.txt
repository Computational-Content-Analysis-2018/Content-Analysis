         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Id like to speak for a moment regarding the Hate Crimes Amendment    at a time when our ideals are under attack by terrorists in other lands  it is more important than ever to demonstrate that we practice what we preach  and that we are doing all we can to root out the bigotry and prejudice in our own country that leads to violence here at home  Now more than ever  we need to act against hate crimes and send a strong message here at home and around the world that we will not tolerate crimes fueled by hate     Since the September 11th attacks  weve seen a shameful increase in the number of hate crimes committed against Muslims  Sikhs  and Americans of Middle Eastern descent  Congress has done much to respond to the vicious attacks of September 11th  Were doing all that we can to strengthen our defenses against hate that comes from abroad  Weve spent billions of dollars in the War on Terrorism to ensure that international terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda are not able to carry out attacks within the United States  There is no reason why Congress should not act to strengthen our defenses against hate that occurs here at home      In Iraq and Afghanistan  our soldiers are fighting for freedom and liberty    they are on the front line fighting against evil and hate  We owe it to our troops to uphold those same principles here at home     Hate crimes are a form of domestic terrorism  They send the poisonous message that some Americans deserve to be victimized solely because of who they are  Like other acts of terrorism  hate crimes have an impact far greater than the impact on the individual victims  They are crimes against entire communities  against the whole nation  and against the fundamental ideals on which America was founded  They are a violation of all our country stands for     Were united in our effort to root out the cells of hatred around the world  We should not turn a blind eye to acts of hatred and terrorism here at home  We should not shrink now from our role as the beacon of liberty to the rest of the world  The national interest in condemning bias motivated violence in the United States is strong  and so is our interest in condemning bias motivated violence occurring world wide  When the Senate approves this amendment  we will send a message about freedom and equality that will resonate around the world     Mr  President  hate crimes violate everything our country stands for  They send the poisonous message that some Americans deserve to be victimized solely because of who they are  These are crimes committed against entire communities  against the nation as a whole and the very ideals on which our country was founded     The time has come to stand up for the victims of these senseless acts of violence  victims like Matthew Shepard  for whom this bill is named  and who died a horrible death in 1998 at the hands of two men who singled him out because of his sexual orientation  Nine years after Matthews death  nine years  we still havent gotten it done  How long are we going to wait     Senator Smith and I urge your support of this bipartisan bill  The House has come through on their side and passed the bill  Now its time for the Senate to do the same  This year  we can get it done  We came close twice before  In 2000 and 2002  a majority of Senators voted to pass this legislation  In 2004  we had 65 votes for the bill and it was adopted as part of the Defense Authorization Bill  But  that time   it was stripped out in conference     The President has threatened to veto this legislation  but we cant let that threat stop us from doing the right thing  Lets display the same kind of courage that came from David Ritcheson  a victim of a brutal hate crime that scarred him both physically and emotionally  This spring  David testified before the House Judiciary Committee  He courageously described the horrific attack against him the year before    after what had been an enjoyable evening with other high school students near his home in Spring  Texas      Later in the evening however  two persons attacked him and one attempted to carve a swastika into his chest  He was viciously beaten and burned with cigarettes  while his attackers screamed terrible epithets at him  He lay unconscious on the ground for 9 hours  and remained in a coma for several weeks  After a very difficult recovery  David became a courageous and determined advocate  Tragically  though  this life changing experience exacted its toll on David and recently  he took his own life  He had tried so hard to look forward  but he was still haunted by this brutal experience      My deepest sympathy and condolences go out to Davids family and friends coping with this tragic loss  Davids death shows us that these crimes have a profound psychological impact  We must do all we can to let victims know they are not to blame for this brutality  that their lives are equally valued  We cant wait any longer to act     Our amendment is supported by a broad coalition of 210 law enforcement  civic  disability  religious and civil rights groups  including the International Association of Chiefs of Police  the Anti Defamation League  the Interfaith Alliance  the National Sheriffs Association  the Human Rights Campaign  the National District Attorneys Association and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights  All these diverse groups have come together to say now is the time for us to take action to protect our fellow citizens from the brutality of hate motivated violence  They support this legislation  because they know it is a balanced and sensible approach that will bring greater protection to our citizens along with much needed resources to improve local and state law enforcement     Our bill corrects two major deficiencies in current law  Excessive restrictions require proof that victims were attacked because they were engaged in certain federally protected activities  And the scope of the law is limited  covering hate crimes based on race  religion  or ethnic background alone      The federally protected activity requirement is outdated  unwise and unnecessary  particularly when we consider the unjust outcomes of this requirement  Hate crimes now occur in a variety of circumstances  and citizens are often targeted during routine activities that should be protected  All victims should be protected  and its simply wrong that a hate crime  like the one against David Ritcheson  cant be prosecuted federally because it happened in a private home      The bill also recognizes that some hate crimes are committed against people because of their sexual orientation  their gender  their gender identity  or their disability  Passing this bill will send a loud and clear message  All hate crimes will face federal prosecution  Action is long overdue  There are too many stories and too many victims     We must do all we can to end these senseless crimes  and I urge my colleagues to support cloture on this amendment and to support its passage as an amendment to the DOD authorization bill           Melissa
