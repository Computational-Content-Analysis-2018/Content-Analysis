         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy gave the following statement in reaction to the news that the Administration attempted to influence its own witnesses by asking them to tone down their testimony  One public health expert who was scheduled to testify was expressly told by a DoJ career prosecutor that her superiors wanted him to scale back his recommendations of sanctions to be imposed upon the tobacco companies  He rejected this improper request  Below is Senator Kennedy s statement These new allegations are a source for further alarm and should be part of the investigation we requested by the Inspector General of the Justice Department  This is supposed to be a government of the people  But that principle is undermined when political appointees side with big tobacco companies instead of millions of parents who don t want their children to grow up to be smokers  This is political interference at its worst because literally millions of lives are at stake  If the Administration were really committed to a culture of life  they would do everything they can to prevent smoking  Americans whose health has been ruined and whose lives may be shortened by the misconduct of the tobacco industry are entitled to a Justice Department that fights for them  not one that takes a dive for the tobacco companies   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
