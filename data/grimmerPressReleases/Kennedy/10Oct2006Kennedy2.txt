         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington DC  Today  Senators Kennedy  Biden  Salazar  Schumer  Kohl  Clinton  Lincoln  Dodd  and Obama sent the following letter to President Bush urging him to fund two programs critical to the safety of our nations schoolchildren    Below is a text of the letter  a PDF version with signatures is available upon request      October 10  2006    The President of the United States  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  DC 20500    Dear Mr  President    As you begin preparing the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget  we write to urge you to include funding for two programs critical to the safety of our nations schoolchildren  COPS in Schools  CIS  and Secure Our Schools  SOS     CIS was created in response to the 1999 tragedy in Columbine  Colorado and has funded more than 6 420 School Resource Officers  SROs   law enforcement officials trained to engage in community police work in and around schools  SROs funded by the CIS program have improved cooperation between school staff  students  parents  and law enforcement personnel  and have prevented crimes and improved the response to incidents that have occurred    SOS provides funding to law enforcement agencies to partner with schools for the acquisition of crime prevention equipment  staff  and training  For example  SOS grants have covered the cost of metal detectors and other hardware  security assessments  and security training for students and school personnel    Despite the fact that CIS and SOS enjoy the strong support of both law enforcement and school officials  you have proposed zero funding for both programs in each of your previous five budget requests  Unfortunately  Congress complied with your request regarding CIS and eliminated funding in fiscal year 2006  Congress has funded SOS at  15 million for each of the past two fiscal years    As experts will likely reiterate at the White House conference on school violence you recently announced  Americas children spend more time in school than anywhere outside the home  This places enormous responsibility on teachers  administrators  security staff  and law enforcement officials to keep them safe  and the federal government must do everything possible to support this complex effort    Therefore  we are requesting that you include in your proposed FY 2008 budget  200 million for the CIS program  with  180 million dedicated to hiring School Resource Officers and  20 million to support the Community Police Development Institutes  which enhance training and emergency planning for local police agencies and school districts  We also request that you allocate at least  15 million to the SOS program    As the recent tragedies in Colorado  Wisconsin  and Pennsylvania have made clear  our children remain all too vulnerable in school    We appreciate your deep concern about the welfare of our nations schoolchildren  and we look forward to working with you on this and other issues related to school safety  Thank you for your consideration                                                   Sincerely      Senators Biden  Salazar  Kennedy  Schumer  Kohl  Clinton  Lincoln  Dodd  Obama   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
