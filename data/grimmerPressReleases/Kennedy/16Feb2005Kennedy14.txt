         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       We are here today because of a cruel and tragic irony  For years  patients and their families waited for a medical breakthrough to provide new hope for serious illnesses like Parkinson s Disease  spinal injury and Alzheimer s Disease    Then at last  dedicated scientists made that breakthrough  They discovered stem cells  which can repair the injuries that cause untold suffering and shorten lives    In his State of the Union address  the President talked about the need to protect a culture of life in America  I couldn t agree with him more  The legislation we introduce today promotes a real culture of life   one that takes every appropriate step within our vision to enable our fellow human beings to lead full and productive lives  Legislation should be an expression of our values  and this legislation says loud and clear that we value patients and their families   not rigid ideology and a refusal to look at the facts  Our culture of life will free the nation s best scientists  NIH  to explore the full potential of stem cell research to save lives and reduce suffering for millions     But just as these life giving therapies are giving patients new hope  the Bush Administration snatched it away through needless restrictions on stem cell research  American people deserve better than this  If we really care about protecting a culture of life  then we should honor it by unleashing the potential of this research to save lives     If different choices had been made by the Bush Administration  we could be here to celebrate the achievements of stem cell research   not to mark the opportunities lost    We owe it to humanity to move forward on stem cell research   It s time for Congress to act     Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
