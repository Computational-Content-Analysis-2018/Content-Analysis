         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to the report released today on the progress in Iraq  The Administration s own report confirms that the Iraqis have failed to meet the essential benchmarks  As long as the commitment of American troops continues to be open ended  we can expect more of the same  Its obvious that the Iraqis wont make the hard political choices needed to achieve reconciliation until they know our troops are about to leave  We have given the President every opportunity to demonstrate that progress is possible  but his policy has been failure after failure after failure  Its wrong to keep pouring more and more lives into the endless black hole of a failed policy  Its time to say enough and bring our troops home      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
