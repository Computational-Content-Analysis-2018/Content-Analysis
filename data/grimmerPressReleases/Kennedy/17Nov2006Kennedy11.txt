         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The Robert F  Kennedy Human Rights Award is one of the many good works of my brothers foundation  It serves as a reminder to all of us of the vital importance of human rights and the many challenges we face at home and abroad to protect those rights  It also reminds each of us of the power of an individual to make a difference in the lives of many  Its a privilege to present this years award to one of those individuals  Sonia Pierre  Sonia has devoted her life to the cause of equality and justice  two of the most fundamental human rights  My brother believed very deeply in those rights  As he once said  We must recognize the full human equality of all our people   before God  before the law  and in the councils of government  We must do this not because it is economically advantageous   although it is  not because the laws of God and man command it   although they do command it  not because people in other lands wish it so  We must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do  Bobby saw this challenge firsthand in the United States  in the plight of farm workers in our fields  and in the struggles of African Americans for equality  He saw it also in the history of immigrants from Ireland  Italy  and Poland  and he spoke of the painful slowness  by which  the United States extended and enlarged the practice of freedom to all of our people  He spoke out for the thousands every day denied their full and equal rights under the law and dedicated his life to do what it took to make equal opportunity a fact  not just a goal  We see that issue still playing out in the current immigration debate  Weve long welcomed immigrants as members of our communities  but for decades we have denied them legal status  Theyve been victims of an unfair systemliving in fear of deportation  exploited at their worksites  unable to create the better futures they hope for and dream about  Some in power would like to close our borders and isolate America  violating the very principles on which America was founded  Surely we can enact an immigration reform bill that protects our borders  without denying opportunity and basic dignity for all immigrants in the United States Sonia Pierre has similarly fought for the rights of a people long denied equality  Her story is the story of the people of two countries  joined by history and geography but separated by economic circumstances  Haiti and the Dominican Republic  Haiti remains the least developed country in the Western Hemisphere and one of the poorest nations in the world  It ranks 154th out of 177 countries in the Human Development Index of the United Nations  It ranks last on Transparency Internationals index of corruption  Two thirds of all Haitians depend on agriculture for their livelihood  They work mainly in small scale subsistence farming  Deforestation and frequent natural disasters  especially hurricanes  highlight the peril of that dependence  By contrast  sharing the same island  the Dominican Republic has had economic success  it was one of the fast growing economies in the world in the 1990s  expanding at an average rate of nearly 8 percent a year from 1996 to 2000  Only a quarter of its citizens live in poverty  compared to 80  in Haiti  The boundary separating the two nations is stark  the brown  deforested lands of Haiti end at the green forests of the Dominican Republic The contrasts between these two countries create an unequal dynamic  Haitians fleeing perennial poverty supply cheap labor for the Dominican economy  particularly during the sugar cane harvest  They fill jobs that even the poorest Dominicans won t do  As a result of this constant cross border migration  approximately 650 000 Haitians live in Dominican territory  where they face discrimination  abuse  harsh living conditions  and the constant threat of deportation  It is for the equal rights of these people  many of whom have lived in the Dominican Republic for decades  that Sonia has dedicated her life  She was born to Haitian parents in 1963 in one of the settlements for sugar cane cutters in the Dominican Republic  She grew up facing first hand the social  economic  legal and cultural barriers that prevent Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent from enjoying their basic human rights Her father died when she was two years old  Her mother was a cane cutter  an unusual profession for a woman because of the immense physical stamina required  She raised Sonia and her eleven other children in a one room portion of a barrack with a dirt floor  Because of the respect her mother had earned among sugar workers  Sonia and her sisters did not have to endure the rape and physical abuse that was commonly inflicted on the migrant community by the authorities There was no school for the children  but when Sonia was nine  she and a hundred other children began to attend two hours of classes a day  offered by a local resident  When she was older  she walked several miles each day to attend the nearest school  She refused to be silent in the face of obvious repression  At 13  she was arrested for speaking at a demonstration on behalf of Haitian migrant laborers in the Dominican Republic  The demonstration lasted five days and actually led to improved conditions for some of the workers  At 16  Sonia helped found the Dominico Haitians Cultural Center  She later studied social work in Cuba before returning to the Dominican Republic to fight for the rights of her people there   Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent  Her community needed a champion  Immigration of Haitians to the Dominican Republic has occurred for generations  but these workers and their descendants are treated as illegal and subjected to abuse and rejection by the Dominican authorities and population  In fact  the Dominican Constitution grants citizenship to all persons born in the territory of the Republic with the exception of those born of diplomats or those in transit  But government policy discriminates against Haitians  Children born in the Dominican Republic to Haitian immigrants confront enormous difficulties in obtaining a birth certificate that will allow them to attend public schools and have all the political and social rights of Dominican nationals  Even documented Dominicans of Haitian descent face serious discrimination in voting or obtaining the social  health and education services available to Dominican citizens  and may also be deported after arbitrary round ups by authorities  Living conditions are deplorable  with precarious housing and no running water or electricity  My brother Bobbys grandson lived in the country when he served in the Peace Corps  and he remembers the barns with a family living in each stall  and without electricity  running water  or bathrooms  The situation is especially harsh for women and children  Women are paid less for field work and cannot obtain legal status  because the State Sugar Council recognizes only male Haitian migrant workers in its temporary foreign worker program  Children in the sugar mill towns are also victims of abuse and exploitation  and the lack of official status prevents the community from accessing education  health care and other public services  Sonia saw all of this first hand  She lived it  And she devoted decades of her life to their search for equality and justice  In 1983  she founded a movement dedicated specifically to the empowerment of women in the community The work of her organization  called MUDHA consists of five main programs  education about human rights  assistance in obtaining birth certificates  provision of legal representation  medical assistance  and early childhood education  It provides education for an average of 175 preschool  first and second grade children each year  and has substantially improved the health of women and children in the settlements  MUDHA has helped more than 5 000 children obtain birth certificates over the past 10 years  It has also been very successful at raising international awareness of the injustices facing the community  MUDHA was a petitioner in a landmark case before the Inter American Court for Human Rights  which for the first time in the courts history upheld human rights laws prohibiting racial discrimination in nationality and citizenship  The Court also ordered the government to admit all children to its schools  and end the rampant discrimination in education  So far  this government has refused to comply  but the case has brought increased international awareness to the plight of the community  Sonia has also strongly opposed the random and arbitrary deportation of Haitians living in the Dominican Republic  which are estimated to reach 45 000 a year  Lily Serrat  of the organization Haitian Women for Haitian Refugees  said of Sonia  I am a better person today for having met  worked  and traveled this road with Sonia Pierre  With certitude  I can affirm that Sonia is one of the most selfless  courageous and compassionate human beings of my generationBefore  seeing her work   I knew of no one who took a firmer stand  no one who risked more  no one with that laser like focus in dealing with the issues that affected these disenfranchised  mistreated  and voiceless groups of people  the Haitian cane cutters and their Dominican Haitian descendantsIn life  we have many heroes and heroines  Sonia is very near the top of my list of heroines   Her colleagues compare her to a Nobel Peace Prize winner and call her a hero  One said  Sonia never held anything back in promoting the human rights of our communities  Sonia has personally affected the lives of thousands of her people  She has given voice to their struggles  won landmark legal victories for them  and created new networks to meet their basic needs  Because of Sonia  this neglected  impoverished  downtrodden community has greater rights and greater hope for a future where equality and justice are not just ideas  but reality  Her struggle is captured in an excerpt from the Dominican poet Pedro Mirs famous poem  There is a Country in the World  which he wrote about the sugar cane cutters in these words  Some will think that in this fluvial country in which earth blossoms and spills over and cracks like a bursting vein where day has its true victory the farmers will go amazed with their spadesto cultivate singingtheir strip of ownership This love will shatter its solitary innocence But no       There is a country in the world where a farmer  cut down withered and bitter dies and bites barefoot his defeated dust lacking enough earth for his harsh death Listen closely  Lacking earth to go to sleep in It is a small and beleaguered country  Simply sad  sad and grim  sad and bitter  Sonia overcame immense personal hardship to become the voice and the champion for hundreds of thousands of others  Her courage gives us all hope  As they say in Creole  kenbe fem   keep the faith  Eventually  because of Sonia  there will be equality and justice for all  She has been unique in her vision of a Dominican Republic that embraces its entire people equally  And for all of us  she is a model for what it means to make a difference  It is an honor now to join Ethel in presenting Sonia Pierre with the Robert F  Kennedy Human Rights Award for 2006      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
