         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C     Senator Edward M  Kennedy applauded last nights passage of legislation keeping existing federal student aid programs operational  He urged Congress to take up more comprehensive legislation that would expand student aid and reform the student loan programs  In the extension bill passed today  Senator Kennedy helped negotiate language that would   1  provide loan forgiveness to spouses of 9 11 victims   2  make it easier for applicants to qualify for the Hispanic Serving Institutions program  and  3  ensure that lenders do not exploit a loophole in a recently passed law that requires that proceeds from student loans originated by schools go to need based aid    I am pleased that we were able to pass legislation to continue the Higher Education Act programs  ensuring that more than 10 million students will continue to receive the federal grants and loans needed for their education  said Senator Kennedy  We need to move quickly to complete action on more comprehensive legislation that does more than continuing the status quo  Families are pinching their pennies to send their children to college and 170 000 students each year do not attend college at all because of cost  We need to re open the doors to the American Dream by providing additional student aid and making college more affordable     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
