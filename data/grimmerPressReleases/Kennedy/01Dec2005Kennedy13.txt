         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today s results demonstrate that in many cities across the nation  the hard work of students  teachers  and school leaders is beginning to pay off  Such progress is hopeful  but it s clear that our work is far from over  Student achievement is still static in reading  and we have a long way to go to eliminate achievement gaps  In today s increasingly competitive economy  we must do better  America deserves better  We must ensure that our students  teachers  and schools have the resources they need to succeed and rise to the challenges of a global economy    I m especially proud of the progress made in Boston  which scored among the top four large city school districts in the nation at grade eight  and among the top six districts in grade four  Boston has outpaced the national average with respect to improvements made in mathematics  showing the greatest gains among African American and Hispanic students    These results show that in most of our nation s largest school systems  African American and Hispanic students perform on par or better than their peers at the national level  This data    and areas of improvement like those Boston    dispel the myth that improving America s city schools is an impossible task  Progress is possible if we dedicate the resources needed to carry out effective reforms   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
