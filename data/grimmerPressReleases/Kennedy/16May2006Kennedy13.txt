         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    This amendment demonstrates a basic misunderstanding about immigration control and the nature of our current crisis  We confront a crisis of undocumented immigration because we have failed to provide legal channels for immigrants entering the United States  and a burgeoning culture of illegality has emerged as a result  We cannot gain control of our borders until we address these core problems  Any delay in implementing the reforms in Titles IV and VI of our bill undermines our short term enforcement efforts and weakens immigration enforcement and our national security    Everyone agrees that we need more border security  S 2611 includes at least 14 separate measures to strengthen border enforcement  alone  and an equally lengthy list of reforms to strengthen interior and worksite enforcement    I support the border security measures in Title I  and I support the acquisition of more detention space  but both of these changes will likely take years to fully complete and become fully operational  to use the language from this amendment  We cannot wait this long to begin making the fundamental changes necessary to fix our broken immigration system    Enforcement first may be an attractive campaign slogan  but it is bad policy  Our security  our prosperity  and our values require effective enforcement instead     Enforcement first is another way of saying more of the same  We ve tried enforcement first for the last 12 years and it has failed because our immigration system has not kept pace with growing demand for legal visas  We must modernize our immigration system to secure the border  These are intimately connected tasks  and they cannot be accomplished sequentially    Serious people who care about immigration enforcement support comprehensive reform    As President Bush has emphasized  By allowing workers and families to come legally  comprehensive immigration reform will free up enforcement resources to focus on the real security threats which exist  smugglers  criminals  and especially potential terrorists     The Isakson amendment would ensure that our Border Patrol agents spend their time chasing gardeners and nannies around the desert for years instead of concentrating on these real security risks    Nine former high ranking DHS and White House officials responsible for homeland security agree  These former officials all of whom worked under Republicans recently published a letter which concluded     Enforcement alone will not do the job of securing our borders  Enforcement at the border will only be successful in the long term if it is coupled with a more sensible approach to the 10 12 million illegal aliens in the country today and the many more who will attempt to migrate into the United States for economic reasons    I agree with these former DHS officials and with President Bush that comprehensive reform is good for American security  but I also understand why some of my colleagues are apprehensive as we move forward with this reform agenda  Senator Isakson s amendment is not the right response because it ties the government s hands and stands in the way of needed reform    I urge my colleagues to reject Senator Isakson s amendment and vote instead for Senator Salazar s amendment  The Salazar amendment recognizes that the reforms in Titles IV and VI have important implications for our national security  and requires that the President certify that these reforms will enhance U S  security before they can be implemented  This is sensible way to address whatever concerns people may have about the security implications of S 2611 without derailing the important work we are now involved with    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
