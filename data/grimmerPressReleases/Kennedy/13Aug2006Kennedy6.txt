         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washignton DC  The following oped by Senator Edward M  Kennedy was published in the Hartford Courant today    http   www courant com news opinion commentary hc commentarykennedy0813 artaug13 0 5926112 story  Demeaning Democracy   Cheney Paints Lamont Victory As Helping Terrorists   By Edward M  Kennedy  August 13 2006  Vice presidents are notorious for serving as an administration s chief attack dog  and time and again Dick Cheney has been unleashed to accuse anyone who is opposed to the Bush administration of aiding the terrorists  But this time he has gone too far   The comments he made on the result of the Connecticut Democratic primary   that it might encourage the al Qaida types who want to break the will of the American people in terms of our ability to stay in the fight and complete the task   are an attack not just on Democrats  but on democracy itself   What happened in Connecticut is in fact a model for democracies everywhere  The people of the state heard a vigorous debate between two competing visions of how to protect this country  Young citizens became deeply involved  and turnout was high  The primary reminded us of the miracle of our democracy  in which the nation is ruled by its people   not by any entrenched set of leaders  There are few better messages we could send the world in these troubled times   Cheney s comments about the election were ugly and frightening  They show once again that he and his party will stop at nothing to wrap Republicans in the flag and to insinuate that anyone who votes against them is giving aid and comfort to the terrorists  It s obvious that this administration lacks basic respect for our fundamental freedoms   Cheney and his crowd are all for free and open elections   as long as they turn out their way  They are all for free speech   provided it supports the administration  They are all for the rule of law   as long as the law does not prevent them from doing whatever they want to do  When elections  speeches or laws are inconvenient  he does not hesitate to declare that they are helping the terrorists  I can think of no graver offense against our democracy   Ned Lamont s victory in Connecticut scares Cheney for one simple reason  It demonstrates that a free and independent people can and do hold public officials accountable for their words and deeds   If the terrorists are indeed paying any attention to the Connecticut primary results  they must be worried   The people of Connecticut spoke out loud and clear in favor of change  Ned Lamont will stand strong for the people of Connecticut  and put tough and smart foreign policies ahead of the politics of fear and more stay the course failures  Republicans will stop at nothing to make sure that the November elections are not a referendum on their misguided policy in Iraq or on the way they have run our country for the past six years  Unfortunately  this time the facts are getting in their way   The American people are ready to change an administration that let Osama bin Laden escape  They are ready to change a Congress that let precious years go by without demanding the implementation of the recommendations of the bipartisan 9 11 Commission to keep us safe   They are ready to change a policy on Iraq that has drained our resources  weakened our security  stretched our troops and recruited new terrorists   The November election will teach Dick Cheney and others of his ilk that they cannot use fear to cling to power  As Will Rogers said  It s no disgrace not to be able to run a country nowadays  but it is a disgrace to keep on trying when you know you can t   Edward M  Kennedy is a U S  senator from Massachusetts  Copyright 2006  Hartford Courant        Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
