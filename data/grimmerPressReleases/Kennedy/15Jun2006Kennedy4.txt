         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                Washington  D C      U S  Senators Edward M  Kennedy and Mike Enzi today praised President Bush for signing into law the first major overhaul of mine safety laws in 28 years   a sweeping bill that will reduce safety risks for miners across the country in response to the tragedies in West Virginia and Kentucky early this year       The bill  the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006  MINER Act   S  2803  approved unanimously by the Senate on May 24th  adopts a range of new regulations that reflect the demands of todays workplace and promote use of world class  21st Century technologies aimed at reducing safety risks to the nations coal miners  The House passed the bill on June 7 by a vote of 381 to 37   Senator Kennedy said  This historic legislation will provide dramatic and long overdue improvements in mine safety   The families of the brave miners who died this year became the conscience of the nation  inspiring us to try to make the nations mines the safest in the world    We owe all miners and their families nothing less   The tragic loss of lives in coal mines this year brought together leaders from labor unions  the mining industry and government  and helped forge  a commitment to change the laws governing mine safety Enzi said   Republicans and Democrats   all of us   understand that no aspect of mining is more important than protecting the health and safety of those whose hard work fuels mining industry  The MINER Act  which is now law  reflects that bipartisan commitment   The bill was originally cosponsored by Senator Kennedy  Senator Jay Rockefeller  D WV   Senator Robert Byrd  D WV   Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee Chairman Senator Johnny Isakson  R GA   the Subcommittees Ranking Member Senator Patty Murray  D WA   Senator Rick Santorum  R PA   and Senator Mike DeWine  R OH    As Chairman of the HELP Committee  I am pleased that the President has acted so quickly to ensure that such tragedies will not be repeated  Mining  and coal mining in particular  is vital to our national and local economies  and to our national energy security  Enzi said   I am deeply grateful for the cooperation and support of my distinguished cosponsors on this bill who have worked tirelessly to make these improvements a reality  he added            THE MINER ACT TAKES MINE SAFETY INTO  THE 21ST CENTURY               The MINER Act  which passed the Senate unanimously  marks the most comprehensive mine safety reform in a generation   It addresses the critical lapses in mine safety exposed by this years disasters   For the first time  every coal mine will have to take a comprehensive  proactive approach to mine safety by developing an emergency response plan that must be approved by the Secretary of Labor   Those plans must be continuously updated to incorporate the latest developments in mine safety technology and changing mine conditions   The Secretary of Labor will review the plans every six months to ensure that they provide for the highest possible level of safety at every mine   The MINER Act mandates a comprehensive  proactive approach to safety           For the first time  every mine will have a comprehensive emergency response plan          The plans must provide for both the evacuation of miners and the maintenance of miners who are unable to evacuate        The plans must address post accident communications  tracking  breathable air  lifelines  training  and coordination with local emergency response personnel   The MINER Act requires coal mines to provide vital oxygen to save miners lives in the event of a disaster         Each miner will have substantially more oxygen than under current law  including at least 2 hours of oxygen nearby  additional stores of oxygen every 30 minutes along escape routes for miners trying to evacuate  and additional caches for trapped miners for a sustained period        MSHA will enforce monitoring of emergency supplies for reliability        As oxygen storage technology improves  companies must update their stores to use the best available oxygen devices   The MINER Act requires that every mine have flame resistant lifelines for the first time   The MINER Act requires MSHA to take action to prevent future disasters caused by blown out seals  like at Sago and Darby   The Secretary must raise the standard for seals for abandoned sections of mines from the current 20 psi standard   Concern about seals has risen dramatically as the failure of seals has been implicated in the Sago and Darby disasters     The MINER Act makes penalties for safety violations meaningful and gives the Secretary new power to shut down mines that dont pay          Criminal penalties will rise tenfold to  250 000 for first offenses and  500 000 for second offenses and the penalty for flagrant violations will rise from  60 000 to  220 000          Companies that take serious risks with their miners safety will face serious penalties   Many of the violations found at Sago will now be subject to a minimum penalty of  2000 or  4000   Prior to the MINER Act  MSHA set the minimum penalty at  60   The MINER Act requires that all mines adopt state of the art two way wireless communications and electronic tracking systems  as soon as possible  but not later than three years   Until those new systems are feasible  all mines are required to install multiple systems to ensure that communications continue in the event of a disaster     The MINER Act ensures that every mine must have a well trained rescue team nearby          Rescue teams must train in the mines they monitor so they are familiar with them in case of an emergency        Mine rescue teams must be available at the mine within one hour  cutting in half the current response time allowed by law        Rescue teams will be better qualified and the rules for their qualifications will be regularly updated   Contract team members must have recent experience underground          Rescue teams members and their employers will know ahead of time that they are not liable for any injuries or deaths that occur as a result of rescue operations and will be more likely to participate in those operations   Rescue teams will not be delayed at the site of an emergency  while employers negotiate liability issues     New programs included in the MINER Act will advance safety technology and train a new generation of skilled miners and safety inspectors         NIOSHs mine safety activities will be enhanced and an interagency working group will be created to ensure mine safety technology benefits from technological advances achieved by other federal agencies        Belt air will be studied by an expert panel and refuge chambers will be field tested   The Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee has committed to hold hearings on the results of those studies in order to expedite the appropriate legislative response        A new grant program is funded to identify  avoid  and prevent unsafe working conditions in Americas mines and MSHA will provide scholarships to increase the skilled workforce for mining operations and the federal inspector corps    The MINER Act ensures that families will be better informed and served in the event of a disaster   Families should never again have to go through the experience of the Sago families in receiving tragic misinformation   From now on  the Secretary of Labor will appoint a liaison to the families of disaster victims to ensure that families receive the most accurate and up to date information as it becomes available and will serve as the primary communicator will families  mine owners  and the public            Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
