         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following summary of how the Higher Education Access Act of 2007 will impact students in Massachusetts   Overall  under Kennedys bipartisan bill  Massachusetts would receive over  317 million in new aid over five years   College education has become more important that ever  Senator Kennedy said  Yet the cost of college has been rising faster than family incomes in Massachusetts and across the country  and federal financial aid has failed to keep up  As a consequence  many students are being shut out of college altogether because of unmet need  Others have been forced to rely heavily on loans to finance their college education  Significant student loan debt is increasingly distorting important life decisions  both professional and personal  The high cost of college  combined with insufficient grant aid  is pricing many students out of a college education  Even with student loans and work study programs  students can be confronted with thousands of dollars of unmet financial need that they cannot afford to pay  After all forms of aid grants  loans  work study  and other financial aid are taken into account  over 88 000 students in Massachusetts had an average unmet need of over  4 500    The Higher Education Access Act of 2007 addresses these problems  immediately increasing the Pell the number of Pell grants recipients and the amount of aid  simplifies the financial aid process for low income students  restricts the amount monthly student loan payments to 15  of their discretionary income  forgives the debts of those who commit to public service  and reforms the student loan system so it works for students  not banks THE HELP COMMITTEE HIGHER EDUCATION PACKAGE A NEW COMMITMENT TO MASSACHUSETTS STUDENTSThe Higher Education Access Act of 2007 and the Higher Education Amendments of 2007 will increase access to higher education and ensure that scarce federal dollars are going where they are most needed  to students   The Higher Education Amendments will also improve our K 12 schools by promoting effective teacher preparation programs Increasing Student Aid and Addressing Rising College CostsThe cost of college has tripled in the past 20 years  but federal financial aid has not kept up   The HELP Committee package will make college more affordable  The package     Increases access for low income students by raising the maximum Pell Grant to  5 100 next year and to  5 400 by 2011 and simplifying the financial aid process for low income students by increasing the income level at which a student is automatically eligible for the maximum Pell       After accounting for all grants and loans  88 000 students in Massachusetts had an average unmet need of  4 500 in 2005       Under this package  Massachusetts will receive  36 9 million in new grant aid in 2008 2009  In all  Massachusetts will receive over  317 million in new aid over five years       The average Pell Grant award to Massachusetts students would increase by  440 in 2008 to  2 950     Helps borrowers manage student loan debt by capping monthly loan payments at 15 percent of discretionary income       62 percent of 4 year college graduates in Massachusetts graduated with student loan debt in 2004 05  and the average amount was  18 169       Under this plan  a starting public school teacher in Massachusetts earning  35 421 with average student loan debt of  18 169  would see their monthly loan payment decrease by  61  an annual savings of  732      A social worker with one child in Massachusetts  earning  47 830 and with average student loan debt of  18 169  would have his or her monthly payments reduced by  24  from  209 to  185  a 12 percent reduction     Encourages public service by forgiving the student loans of borrowers who work for 10 years in public service careers  such as in law enforcement  emergency management  public health and social work  public education  public interest legal service  and public services for individuals with disabilities and the elderly      A public school teacher in Massachusetts would have  10 365 forgiven under this program      Protects working students and ensures they are not penalized by increasing the amount of student income that is sheltered from the financial aid process     Holds colleges accountable for rising costs by publicizing colleges whose cost increases outstrip those of their peers  and ensuring students and parents have access to objective data about the cost of college      There are over 140 postsecondary institutions in Massachusetts  and the Commonwealth is the only state in the nation that educates more students in private colleges than in public colleges      From 1996 to 2006  tuition and fees increased by 39 percent at UMass  by 29 percent at the State Colleges and by 9 percent at the Commonwealths community colleges  after accounting for inflation       Similar trends are seen across the nation  especially in years when state appropriations to public colleges and universities have stagnated Simplifying the Financial Aid Process for all Students by Reforming the FAFSAThe Free Application for Federal Financial Aid  FAFSA  is currently seven pages long  and acts as a barrier to low  and middle income students applying for the aid they need for college   The Higher Education Amendments will make the financial aid application process more student friendly  The bill     Simplifies the FAFSA  by immediately creating a new 2 page EZ FAFSA for low income students  and phasing out the current 7 page FAFSA for all applicants within 5 years       More than 430 00 students are enrolled in private and public colleges in Massachusetts  and many will fill out a FAFSA each year        After all grants and loans are taken into account  approximately 88 000 students in Massachusetts had an average unmet need of  4 500 in 2005  and even more students may never apply for aid  believing they cant afford the cost of college     Facilitates student planning by creating a pilot program that allows students to receive an aid determination or estimate in their junior year of high school Promoting Innovative Models in Teacher Preparation ProgramsThe nation faces a shortage of high quality  well prepared teachers  and it is often the neediest students who suffer the most   The Higher Education Amendments will improve teacher quality  training and retention  The bill     Promotes high quality and effective teacher preparation programs for new and prospective teachers  including effective preparation  induction  and residency programs      Over 90 percent of mentors and beginning teachers who participated in induction programs in Massachusetts in 2002 reported that the program was highly important       Two thirds of beginning teachers and 84 percent of mentors reported in the same survey that these programs enabled the beginning teacher to perform at higher professional levels     Helps high need schools  by focusing on recruiting and retaining high quality teachers in these schools      This past school year  95 percent of teachers in core academic subjects were highly qualified and 95 percent of teachers in Massachusetts public schools taught a subject in which they were licensed      However  in high poverty schools  just 90 percent of teachers in core academic subjects were highly qualified and 92 percent of teachers were licensed in the subject they taught Reforming the Student Loan System so it Works for Students  Not LendersRecent investigations have shown that lenders and even some financial aid officers have been exploiting the student loan system  to the detriment of the students they are meant to be helping   The package will ensure the system works for students by      Protecting students by ensuring colleges recommend lenders to their students based on the best interest of students  not the self interest of financial aid officers     Cleaning up the industry by prohibiting payments from lenders to schools school officials that create conflicts of interest      Saving taxpayer dollars by using market mechanisms to cut outrageous subsidies to lenders  and redirecting these savings to students through the student aid increases above      Melissa Wagoner  Keith Maley  617  565 4472
