         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     On the eve of the Iraqi elections  all Americans hope that the Iraqi people will once again demonstrate their courage  dedication  and resilience by going to the polls in large numbers to place their future    and the future of their country    squarely on the side of democracy     Forty one Senators asked President Bush to use his new speech today on Iraq to finally lay out a serious strategy for victory in Iraq  Unfortunately  once again  the President declined  Successful elections can and should be the turning point we ve been waiting so long for  when our troops can begin to come home  The Iraqi people are doing their part  and it s time for President Bush  Secretary Rumsfeld and the rest of the administration to do theirs     Despite the President s statement today  the misguided war in Iraq was  in fact  a war of choice  America could have avoided war  We should have given weapons inspectors more time  There was no reason for America to go to war when we did  the way we did  and for the false reasons we were given    Today  the President said for the third time that Congress had access to the same intelligence they did in decided to go to war  How the President can continue to make such an obvious falsehood is beyond belief  It s bad enough that the President distorted the intelligence on the need for war  Now  he keeps blatantly distorting the facts about how much access Congress had to the intelligence  Someone on the White House staff obviously needs to correct the President s talking points before he parrots them again     The President should have taken a hard and comprehensive look at the intelligence  rather than building a case for war based on cherry picked intelligence  It s not enough to say the intelligence was wrong  Whatever flaws existed in the intelligence were far outweighed by the devious way the Administration manipulated the intelligence to support its preconceived desire for war and ignored the serious doubts that we now know undermined its trumped up case   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
