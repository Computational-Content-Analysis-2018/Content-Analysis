         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy offered an amendment to increase the amount awarded to Pell grant recipients from  4 050 a year to  4 250 a year  This critical increase can mean the difference between a student being able to attend a four year institution or community college or forgoing the opportunity to receive a college education  In Massachusetts alone  nearly 80 000 students at Massachusetts colleges and universities received over  180 million in Pell grants last year    Senator Kennedy offered his amendment on the Senate floor this morning     Senator Kennedy said  Giving young Americans the chance to get a college education is fundamentally an issue of fairness  As a nation we can t afford to lose our young minds and to waste the opportunity to keep us globally competitive  Instead of lining the pockets of the wealthy with tax cuts  we should be giving our students the resources they need to go to college  America deserves better  The Pell grant provides the indispensable link to between hardworking families and a college education  The United States has never shied away from meeting the challenges of educating tomorrow s leaders  and this amendment is a reasonable step forward in ensuring that our future is in good hands     Kennedy Amendment  1 Pell Grant Increase   Summary   The Kennedy amendment would increase the maximum Pell grant from the current  4 050 to  4 250    an increase of  836 million in total appropriations     This amendment increases the maximum Pell grant by  200  At a time when 4 year public college tuition has risen 7   it is critical that we make a good faith effort to improve the purchasing power of Pell     The buying power of the maximum Pell grant declined from covering 57  of the cost of attending a 4 year public university in 1985 86 to only 33  in 2005 2006      Independent students are more likely to receive Pell grants than dependent students  61  vs  34    but are less likely to receive grants from states  19  vs  24   or institutions  15  vs  35    They need increased Pell aid to make those college courses possible so that they can earn their degree as quickly as possible     42  of Pell recipients are still dependent on their parents  62  of those dependent students come from families with incomes below  32 000  This  200 increase can help with tuition or the cost of books for a semester      This amendment will mean 98 additional recipients in Alaska  almost 8 000 new recipients in California  1 200 in Iowa  nearly 300 in New Hampshire  and over 1 500 in Massachusetts    Pell Grant Fact Sheet    The average cost of college attendance for 2005 2006  includes tuition  fees  and for 4 year colleges  room and board  is     4 year private college  29
