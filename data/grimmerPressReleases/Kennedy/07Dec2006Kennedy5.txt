         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  it would be hard to understate the importance of the position for which Andrew von Eschenbach has been nominated  The Food and Drug Administration oversees products that account for fully a quarter of the entire U S  economy Every day  the agency makes decisions that mean the difference between life and death for countless patients  Millions of Americans rely on the drugs the FDA approves to protect them from sickness  and every family in America counts on the FDA to see that the food they eat is free from contamination But now  the agency itself urgently needs treatment For too long  it has been without a confirmed leader  Its become a ship without a captain  lacking the initiative and confidence that only a confirmed Commissioner can bring  Year after year after year under this Administration  the FDA has been allowed to drift  and year after year after year  the challenges it faces have grown larger Think of the controversiesabout antidepressantsabout the withdrawal of Vioxxabout the sale of Plan B over the counterabout adequate review of drugs on the market  The agency has had to struggle unfairly with difficult scientific questions  inadequate resources and authority  and irresponsible political pressures to ignore the science that must be at the heart of its mission Finally  finally  the day is here when the Senate can act to confirm a Commissioner whose Job One will be to restore leadership to this essential agency  and begin the process of addressing the many major concerns that have gone unmet for so long Dr  von Eschenbach is a good choice to lead the FDA  At the National Cancer Institute  he led bold new initiatives on the human genome and on nanotechnology  As a physician for patients with cancer and a survivor of cancer himself  he brought an indispensable  patient centered perspective to the Cancer Institute  and he ll bring it to the Food and Drug Administration as well Dr  von Eschenbach was able to find a solution to the controversy about allowing over the counter sales of Plan B  We may never know the battles he had to fight  and win  to achieve that solution  but his integrity and tenacity in achieving a solution speak volumes for his character and his commitment to public health  FDA has long been regarded as the gold standard in its regulatory work  but that will continue to be true only if it makes independent  science based decisions  in both fact and appearance  Under Dr  von Eschenbach s leadership  we expect FDA to make decisions solely on the basis of science  and in the best interest of public health  To do the job we expect it to do  the agency will clearly need additional resources  Its budget is now  1 8 billion a year  That may sound like a lot  but it works out to about  6 a year for every American For  6  we expect FDA to assure the safety of all the prescription drugs we take  the purity of all the food we eat  and the effectiveness of the medical devices that save or improve so many lives   6 a year obviously isnt enough to carry out this immense responsibility  Its time for Congress to give FDA the support it needs to make the right decisions on ever more complicated scientific and health issues  Next year will be another very important one for the agency  Four major reauthorizations of health programs will come before our Health Committee and Congress  and we will need the agency s assistance to enact them  We look forward to working closely with the new Commissioner to do our best to get these issues right Dr  von Eschenbach is a dedicated healer  advocate for public health  and public servant  It is long past time to remove the word Acting from the title of Commissioner  and give the FDA the full leadership it needs to confront the challenges ahead  I urge the Senate to approve his nomination   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
