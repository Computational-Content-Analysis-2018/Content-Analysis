         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  Chairman  thank you for calling this hearing on the importance of improving cooperation with other governments to help mend our immigration system Without cooperation from neighboring countries  immigration reforms adopted unilaterally by the U S  are less likely to succeed  We need to work with Mexico  Central America  and Canada on migration problems and enforcement  It s in the best interests of all of our countries to improve security too  Bilateral and multilateral agreements provide a framework and incentives for safe and legal immigration Every year  thousands of Mexicans and Central Americans come to the U S   legally or illegally  to work and join their families  Illegal immigration continues to increase annually  To deal with the growing numbers of undocumented workers  we have to modernize our laws to meet the challenges of the 21st century  As Mexican officials understand  a guest worker program and a path toward earned legalization are two essential components of any effective proposal for reform  We need fair steps to respond to family needs  economic needs  and basic migration patterns between the U S   Mexico  and Central American nations Another critical component of comprehensive immigration reform is border security and control of illegal immigration One of the mistakes we continue to make is throwing money at border enforcement as our primary means for reducing illegal immigration  By making it more difficult for many Mexican citizens to cross the border to work and reunite with their families living in the United States  we are essentially trapping them inside the U S  It s an incentive for desperate families to do whatever it takes to be together A more sound policy is realistic immigration laws that that provide legal avenues for qualified immigrants and strong enforcement of those laws  This plan will restore control of our borders  improve national security  and strengthen our economy Another mistake of past immigration bills is to assume we can control illegal immigration on our own  America needs to do its part  but Mexico and other nations must do their part  too  to replace illegal immigration flows with regulated  legal immigration We need a framework for negotiating an agreement with Mexico to prevent Mexico from being used as a transit corridor for third country nationals attempting to enter the U S  illegally  We need to work with Canada and Mexico to help Guatemala and Belize maintain the security of their borders We need a framework for the U S  to work with all the countries of Central America to set up a database on the activities of criminal gangs  control alien smuggling and trafficking  prevent the use and manufacture of fraudulent travel documents  and share relevant information Under the leadership of President Fox  significant efforts have been made to address Mexico s economic problems  Remittances from the United States continue to be a principle source of income for many Mexican families Tapping into these funds  the Fox Administration has adopted promising initiatives such as the three for one program to match these funds with federal  state  and local money  The pooled funding is then used to build schools  clinics  and establish other programs to help economically depressed areas in Mexico John McCain and I have included all of these proposals in our bill  We know that effective enforcement of our immigration laws depends heavily upon the participation and commitment of neighboring governments  I thank our witnesses at today s hearing  and I look forward to working with them to address these important challenges ahead of us   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
