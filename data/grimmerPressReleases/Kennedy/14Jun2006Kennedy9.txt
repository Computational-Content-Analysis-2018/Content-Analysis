Educational and Cultural Affairs whos also a passionate advocate of youth exchanges   I also thank AYUSA and its consortium partners  Because of your efforts  weve successfully launched this valuable program    Every spring  thousands of American students your age come to this city to see its monuments and learn about the nations history  They walk along the Mall from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol  and through the halls of Congress  In addition to being the seat of government  the city of Washington serves us as a monument itself  It embodies the inspiration of our past and helps us live up to the ideals of our nation    Over the past year  Im sure youve experienced many aspects of American life  and I hope that the overall impression is positive  Ala Al Ebi  for example  came all the way from Yemen to Massachusetts  He became part of the strongest academic group in the school  the principals group  and was an A student  He said that the people here are very nice  and that he loved Massachusetts    Hes learned a lot about the many challenges facing us in America  but he appreciates the many blessings and opportunities too  Im sure hell be an effective ambassador in the years ahead  Its said that democracy is the worst form of government  except for all the others that have been tried from time to time  We have a long history in Congress of debating nearly everything our government does  We often disagree with one another  but we share some fundamental American ideals  The most important are our beliefs that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed  and no one is above the law    Upholding these ideals was one of the reasons Senator Lugar and I worked together to create this program after the tragedy of 9 11  We believe that the people of the Islamic world and the people of the United States can do more to understand each other and work together so that all our peoples can live in peace    The challenge we share  you and your families at home  the Americans youve lived and studied with  our citizens and your citizens  is to understand each others ideals and aspirations  and avoid the negative stereotypes    Already the alumni of the Cultural Bridges program are making a difference in their communities  In Morocco  Guita Khalil  has been working to reduce the number of road accidents in Casablanca  Pakistani alumni Turab Hassan and Abdul Saboor  have been helping those affected by the earthquake in northern Pakistan    In the same spirit  you too will return to your native lands with a better understanding of the United States  Although you may not agree with all the United States says and does  I hope youll be able to better explain our country and our ideals to your friends and families  We hope your friends  families  and neighbors will understand us a little better  and know something of our ideals  hopes and aspirations    Most of you have probably spent much of the year explaining your own country and your lives to Americans  Its very important  because youre helping to bring our countries together  Each time you do so  you send forth a new ripple of hope    During his visit to South Africa in 1966  my brother  Robert Kennedy  celebrated the transforming power of youth that we celebrate today  He said  I hope you will often take heart from the knowledge that you are joined with fellow young people in every land  that they are struggling with their problems and you with yours  but all joined in common purpose  that  like the young people of my own country and of every country I have visited  you are all in many ways more closely united to the brothers of your time than to the older generations of any of these nations  and that you are determined to build a better future    Thank you all for your dedication to this better future and for your participation in the Cultural Bridges Program  I commend you for the bridges youve built here and I hope that youll continue to build them throughout your lives and careers   Cultural Bridges Fact Sheet   The Cultural Bridges program was established by Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Senator Richard G  Lugar  R IN  in October of 2002 after the
