         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE             Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the passage of H R  810  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act   The act passed today with a vote of 63 37   This is the most important health care vote in a decade  That is because it is about hope for new cures for millions of Americans    I was here for the controversial debates over DNA research  invitro fertilization  and fetal tissue research   In each case  it took leadership and persistence to see it through   And now we see the results as we enter a new century of the life sciences with breathtaking  breakthrough medical advances each and every day   The foundation of this new century is our progress in mapping the human genome  splicing DNA  and understanding how cells work   And now  stem cells could be one of the building blocks for that new century    No vote and no veto can deny this hope forever  Already  other countries are moving ahead without us to explore the promise of stem cell therapies   We urge the President not to veto hope   Stem cell research will happen with or without this President  its a matter of when  not if  But if he does  we will be back and back and back to allow this life saving research to go forward     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
