         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE         This latest version of the Asbestos Trust Fund legislation does not correct the fundamental problems that made the original bill unacceptable  The new bill  S  3274  would still create an Asbestos Trust Fund that excludes many seriously ill victims of asbestos induced disease from receiving compensation and that fails to provide a guarantee of adequate funding to make sure the victims who are eligible will actually receive what the bill promises them     As I have said before  the real crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation crisis  it is an asbestos induced disease crisis  Asbestos is the most lethal substance ever widely used in the workplace    All too often  the tragedy these seriously ill workers and their families are enduring becomes lost in a complex debate about the economic impact of asbestos litigation  We should not allow that to happen  The litigation did not create these costs  Exposure to asbestos created them  They are the costs of medical care  the lost wages of incapacitated workers  and the cost of providing for the families of workers who died years before their time  Those costs are real  No legislative proposal can make them disappear  All legislation can do is shift those costs from one party to another    While I appreciate the enormous effort that Senators Specter and Leahy have put into this issue  their latest proposal does not correct the basic flaws in earlier versions of the legislation  The Trust Fund is still seriously underfunded  It lacks sufficient financial resources to pay all the victims of asbestos diseases that the legislation promises to compensate  The major problems identified by the Congressional Budget Office are still present in the new bill  In addition some of the changes in S  3274 may actually create new problems for victims attempting to collect from the Asbestos Trust  More of the burden of asbestos induced disease is being shifted back onto the victims  This new legislation does not provide a fair and reliable solution to the enormous problem of compensating asbestos victims   If S  3274 were to be enacted it is probable that the Asbestos Trust Fund created by the bill would soon become insolvent  As Professor Eric Green of Boston University Law School  one of todays witnesses  states in his written testimony   In the end  it is highly likely that a choice will have to be made between bailing out the Fund with federal dollars or abandoning future claimants  Either way  the perpetrators and profiteers escape while the needy and the innocent suffer   It is not enough to say that there are serious inadequacies in the way asbestos cases are adjudicated today  That does not mean that any legislation is better than the current system  Our first obligation is to do no harm  I regret to say that  despite the best intentions of its sponsors  this legislation would do harm      When this Committee considered the original Specter Leahy bill in May of 2005  I identified ten areas in which the legislation was seriously deficient both unfair and unworkable  Unfortunately  all of those problems are still present in the latest version   There are major flaws in the bill   1  Experts have repeatedly told us that the Asbestos Trust created by this legislation is seriously underfunded  The funding plan in this bill relies on very substantial borrowing in the early years as the only way to pay the flood of claims  The result will be huge debt service costs over the life of the Trust that could reduce the  140 billion intended to pay claims by as much as 40  or more  The amount remaining would be far too little to pay the claims of all of those who are entitled to compensation under the terms of the bill  The legislation does not guarantee that sufficient resources will be available to keep the commitments which this bill makes to eligible victims    2  Seriously ill victims are not allowed to continue their cases in court until the Trust Fund is ready to process and pay claims  These victims will be left in a legal limbo  unable to recover either in the courts or from the Trust Fund  while time is running out for them    3  Thousands of lung cancer victims who have had very substantial asbestos exposure are denied any compensation from the Trust Fund  Under the legislation  these victims are losing their right to go to court  but receiving nothing from the Fund    4  The bill makes it harder for asbestos victims to recover compensation from the Trust Fund by unfairly raising the standard of proof  Victims should simply have to prove that asbestos exposure was a contributing factor to their disease  That is the standard used in most state courts and workers compensation proceedings today  This bill requires a much tougher standard   5  Some victims whose claims are nearly resolved in court will have to start pursuing their claims all over again  Years of work by these victims to obtain compensation are being wiped out   6  The bill lacks a clear  automatic sunset that allows victims to quickly seek compensation in the courts if the Trust Fund becomes insolvent and unable to pay their claims  The Committees 2003 legislation contained such a provision  but this bill does not  Under the current bill  workers could end up trapped in the Trust with reduced benefits and long delays in receiving their payments    7  Residents of other asbestos contaminated communities are denied the same opportunity to receive compensation from the Trust Fund that the residents of Libby  Montana have under the bill    8  Victims with complex cases will be unable to get a qualified attorney to pursue their claims because the legislation unreasonably limits attorneys fees in complex cases    9  The bill takes rights away from victims of silica disease even though they are not eligible to receive any benefits from the Trust Fund    10  Before victims lose their right to proceed in court  the legislation should require full disclosure of the corporations and insurers who will fund the trust and the amounts each of them will pay  It does not    These shortcomings cannot be overlooked  They are too fundamental  They will end up hurting the seriously ill victims of asbestos disease who we are trying to help  The Senate should reject this new bill  It has not solved the problems that made earlier versions unacceptable             Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633
