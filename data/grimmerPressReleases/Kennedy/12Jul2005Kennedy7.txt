         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Kennedy statement in response to Bush s assertion that he will consider judicial philosophy in choosing a Supreme Court nominee    Today s meeting was a good first step  but consultation is more than a process    it s about an outcome that unites the country rather than divides it  I agree with President Bush that judicial philosophy is important to consider  if he really means what he said  that the judicial philosophy we all look for is an intent to interpret the law  not make the law  Ideological activists ought to be excluded from consideration  because they do not meet the test of proper judicial philosophy  All candidates must be committed to protecting the constitutional rights and freedoms of all Americans     The American people deserve to know that basic constitutional principles they ve relied on for decades such as equality in education and the workplace  the right to vote and right to privacy in family planning will be not overturned as a result of a nominee s personal ideology  Like the President  members of the Senate Judiciary committee look forward to understanding any nominee s judicial philosophy  including his or her view of stare decisis  and commitment to uphold the law  not mold the law to a predetermined agenda   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
