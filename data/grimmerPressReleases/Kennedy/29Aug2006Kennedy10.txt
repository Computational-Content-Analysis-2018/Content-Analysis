         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    LETTER BELOW AND PDF AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST BOSTON  MA  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy was pleased to learn that the 150 Massachusetts reservists of the 220th Transportation Company  94th Regional Reserve Command  will return to Massachusetts via charter service on Tuesday at 10 00 AM  Following the arrival of the flight at Logan  a welcome home ceremony will be held at 11 45 AM at the Holiday Inn in Boxborough  Senator Kennedy said  We all expect that our men and women in uniform will not only have the best training and equipment  but will be treated with honor upon their return   I am pleased to know that the Secretary of the Army has decided to fly these brave soldiers back to Massachusetts  as should have been the case from the start  The nation owes them a debt of gratitude  and they all deserve a heros welcome  In response to phone calls from distraught unit members and families on Friday  Senator Kennedy sent a letter to Francis J  Harvey  Secretary of the Army  requesting that the 150 Massachusetts soldiers of the 220th Transportation Company  94th RRC  in Camp Atterbury  Indiana be transported home to Massachusetts by air service  instead of by bus  As a result of Senator Kennedys request  the soldiers are being flown home   The soldiers of this unit have been on active duty in Iraq for a minimum of one year  and they are currently moving through the demobilization process  The 220th Transportation Company traveled over 600 000 miles throughout Iraq and completed 150 missions  transporting over 1 4 million gallons of fuel  In their multiple missions  they provided fuel and vehicle support to both Army and Marine Corps units in Al Anbar province  Iraq          August 25  2006  The Honorable Francis J  Harvey Secretary United States Army The Pentagon Washington  DC 20310  Dear Secretary Harvey              I learned today that the Massachusetts based 220th Transportation Company  94 th RRC  arrived at Camp Atterbury in Edinburgh  Indiana a little after midnight  The 150 soldiers in the Company have been on active duty for at least a year  I also understand that approximately half are nearing their 24 month limit and that 20 or more of these soldiers have exceeded their 24 month limit              These soldiers who ve made enormous sacrifices to serve our country  placing themselves at great risk  are now on the verge of being reunited with their families  who ve also made extraordinary sacrifices  I m sure you share my concern that they receive extraordinary care through demobilization with the best mental and physical health servies  and that they be returned expeditiously and comfortably to their families              It s my understanding that the current plan to return them to Massachusetts is to have them board buses on Monday morning for an 18 20 hour ride from Indiana  even though the Indianapolis International Airport is located just 38 miles from Camp Atterbury  With air service such a viable option  I don t believe putting these soldiers on buses for an extended overnight ride is the most appropriate way for the US Army to show its gratitude for their considerable sacrifices              I m writing to request your immediate attention to ensure that the soldiers receive quality care they may need during this demobilization process and that the Army take immediate steps to find air service to bring them home to their families quickly and in comfort  This country has asked a great deal of them  and we should be prepared to demonstrate how much we appreciate their service              Many thanks for your attention to this urgent matter                                                                        Sincerely                                                          Edward M  Kennedy   Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
