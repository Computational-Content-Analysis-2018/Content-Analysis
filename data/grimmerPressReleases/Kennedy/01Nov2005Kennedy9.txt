         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     This appointment is business as usual and shows that the Gulf recovery is not a top priority for the President  Mr  Powell may be an accomplished banker and political fundraiser  but according to the Administration  he has no disaster recovery experience  I find this terribly troubling    especially given the tragic missteps of Michael Brown     I am also concerned that the person responsible for directing federal efforts will not be reporting directly to the President  at a Cabinet level position  As I have called for  the redevelopment efforts should be led by a nonpartisan leader  at the Cabinet level  who can cut through the red tape to ensure that federal funds are deployed swiftly  efficiently and effectively  It is important to put a strong emphasis on local control and recognize that while the federal government possesses the necessary resources to rebuild the devastated areas  the state and local officials know the area best and should share the decision making authority  America can do better for the people of the Gulf Coast  they have already suffered enough and deserve experienced leadership from from someone they can trust as they continue to rebuild their lives    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
