         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy participated in a meeting between National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher  U S  Representatives Barney Frank and John Tierney  Massachusetts Lt  Governor Kerry Healey  Massachusetts State Senator Bruce Tarr and New Bedford Mayor Scott Lang  Kennedy joined them  and representatives from the Massachusetts fishing industry  in calling for a renewed look at the Framework 42 and a temporary emergency rule that could drastically cut the number of days fisherman may be out on their boats The emergency rule  currently at the NOAA headquarters  would result in a combined reduction in days at sea of 61  since 2001  or approximately 53 days Senator Kennedy s remarks at today s meeting are below  as well as a letter he and colleagues sent to Admiral Lautenbacher asking the comment period for the emergency rule to be extended SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY REMARKS  As prepared for delivery Admiral Lautenbacher  thank you for hosting this meeting  I wish that I could be there in person too  but I m between mark ups I want to reiterate what I m sure you ve been hearing from everyone in the room     that we re very concerned about the direction NOAA is headed with Framework 42 and this emergency rule  and ask that you look at ways to take a more targeted approach to help rebuild the stocks I agree with you     as I imagine everybody in your office does     that we need to rebuild some stocks in the fishery  like Gulf of Maine Cod and Yellowtail  Yellowtail in southern New England  and Georges Bank Winter Flounder But Framework 42 and the Emergency Rule would make severe across the board reductions in the days at sea program on top of differential counting measures that will cut even deeper into the time fishermen have on their boats It isn t necessary to make these kinds of across the board cuts to rebuild stocks  I really hope that you ll take a close look at alternatives  like the one that Vito Giacalone and Mayor Lang and Senator Tarr and others drafted  the so called TAC alternative I m concerned that unless NOAA changes course these measures will collapse the 400 year old fishing industry in Massachusetts  I m sure you know that many of these fishermen are from families that have been fishing in these waters for generations  but for many of them Framework 42 will mean that they ll be the last professional fishermen in their family line It s just not going to be economically feasible for them anymore  Framework 42 will cost the North Shore 31  in groundfish revenue  the South Shore 32   and the Cape and Islands will lose more than 20  of their groundfish landings revenue I m sure Mayor Lang will tell you this  if he hasn t already  but if Framework 42 is enacted  then we re going to see half of the fleet of 125 groundfish boats in New Bedford put out of use Again  I sincerely hope that you ll look at alternatives     and be aware of the real world impact these kinds of across the board cuts will have on my constituents  30 March 8  2006The Honorable Conrad C  Lautenbacher  Jr  NOAA Administrator Herbert Hoover Building  Room 5221 14th St  and Constitution Ave   NW Washington  DC 20230Dear Vice Admiral Lautenbacher We re writing to respectfully request that you extend the comment period for NOAA s recently proposed emergency secretarial action on the Northeast Multispecies Fishery  Docket No  060209031 6031 01   This major rule proposal will have an enormous impact on the Northeast s groundfish fishery  and to have a fair and open rulemaking process  additional time is needed for interested parties to analyze and submit their comments NOAA published its Proposed Rule in the Federal Register on March 3  2006  and set a comment deadline of March 9  A proposed rule of this magnitude should have 30 days  at a minimum  for public comment The Proposed Rule includes major changes for the fishery  such as applying an across the board reduction in the number of days at sea in which permit holders are allowed to fish  It would force a net reduction of 34 5 percent in Category A DAS for all NE multispecies vessels  and the cumulative impact of the Amendment 13 DAS reductions and the Proposed Rule would result in a net reduction of approximately 61 percent from 2001 to 2006  Additional time is needed to assess the profound economic impacts of making such major DAS reductions An alternative proposal  the TAC alternative  which the New England Fishery Management Council has already voted to analyze as a possible alternative to the Northeast Fishery s Framework 42  could also be applied to the emergency regulation As you know  the emergency regulation was proposed as a bridge until Framework 42 is approved after May 1  2006  The TAC alternative would likely take a more precise approach to achieving the necessary biological objectives and fishing mortality rate reductions  and it would achieve those objectives in a way that will have far less harmful economic impact  Extending the public comment period will allow more time for this alternative to be reframed for providing comment on the Proposed Rule We believe it is essential for additional time to be provided for public comment on this extremely serious issue  which will have a major impact on all of our states  economies and particularly on our fishing communities  We hope that you will agree  and that you will provide additional time for public comment on the Proposed Rule as soon as possible With respect and appreciation  and we thank you for your consideration of our request Signed Edward M  Kennedy John F  Kerry Jack Reed Barney Frank Jeb Bradley William
