         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            Washington  D C     Below is Senator Kennedys statement on at the nomination hearing of Dr  Von Eschenbach to be Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration       Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding todays hearing on the nominations of Dr  Andrew von Eschenbach to be Commissioner of Food and Drugs and Paul DeCamp to serve as Administrator of the Wage and Hour division at the Department of Labor   These are two critical positions worthy of serious consideration  and I appreciate this opportunity hear from them and learn more about them   Ive always been a strong supporter of the National Cancer Institute  and I admire Dr  von Eschenbachs leadership there  especially on initiatives such as genomics and nanotechnology   As a survivor of cancer himself and as a physician for patients with cancer  he has brought an important  patient centered perspective to the Institute  and hell bring it to the Food and Drug Administration as well   In the controversies over antidepressants and suicidal behavior in children  the withdrawal of Vioxx  the agencys refusal to approve the sale of Plan B over the counter  weve seen the FDA struggling with difficult scientific questions  inadequate resources and authority  and unfair pressures to ignore science   FDA needs a strong commissioner to deal with these and other issuesto refocus the agency and enable it to make decisions based solely on science  developed after an open  unencumbered scientific debate  not on ideology or political expediency     The pending decision on Plan B is a test case of FDAs integrity   Yesterday  Dr  von Eschenbach announced that FDA would not pursue the rulemaking that the Administration had previously claimed was needed to respond to this application  in favor of a more informal negotiation with the manufacturer   If this step leads to a swift and clear decision  I applaud it  but we must make certain that the Administration does not use it as yet another delaying tactic   Serious concerns have been raised about the degree to which political pressures influenced  FDAs actions on Plan B  and I urge Dr  von Eschenbach to use the upcoming negotiations to begin to allay those concerns  not raise them anew    Sadly  Plan B is not the only example in which this Administration has pressured FDA to value political considerations over the statutes under which it operates and the science before it         A recent survey by the Union of Concerned Scientists presents serious evidence of problems at the agency   A majority of the agencys scientists who responded disagreed or strongly disagreed that FDAs leadership consistently stands behind scientific staff or managers who propose science supported decisions  even though they may be politically controversial     FDA has long been regarded as the gold standard in its regulatory work  but that will continue to be the case only if it makes independent  science based decisions  in both fact and appearance  Under Dr  von Eschenbachs leadership  we expect FDA to make decisions solely on the basis of science  and in the best interest of public health  I hope that he will assure us that FDA management will no longer reject the view of agency scientists  or actively discourage them from voicing their concerns     Next year will be an important year for the FDAfour reauthorizations will come before this committee  and we will need  the agencys assistance to enact them   Senator Enzi and I are preparing to introduce a drug safety bill  which will require the agency and companies to develop a strategy to consider the post approval safety of a drug   I hope we will have Dr  von Eschenbachs support for that effort and the support of all at the agency      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
