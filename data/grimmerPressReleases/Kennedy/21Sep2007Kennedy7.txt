         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Every day  families across America rely on the Food and Drug Administration in ways they barely realize  When they put dinner on the table  they are counting on FDA to see that it is free from contamination  When they care for a sick child  they are trusting FDA to make sure the drugs prescribed are safe and effective  From pacemakers to treatments for cancer to the foods we eat  FDA protects the health of millions of Americans  and oversees products that account for a quarter of the US economy  The agency does all this on a budget that amounts to less than two cents a day for each citizen      An agency that does so much so well deserves to be supported and strengthened  Yet too often  the opposite has been true  FDA s vital mission has been jeopardized by inadequate resources  occasionally insufficient legal authority  and absent leadership      Americans are worried about the safety of the products they use  from food to toys to drugs  and they are right to be worried  Dangerous lapses in safety oversight have exposed American families to intolerable risks from lead paint in toys  to bacteria in foods  to drugs that cause unreported and lethal side effects  The right response is comprehensive  considered and bipartisan legislation  and thats what the Senate has approved      The prestigious New England Journal of Medicine editorialized earlier this year that the bill was the most important drug safety legislation in a century      Earlier this week  the House of Representatives approved this bipartisan measure by a broad bipartisan margin of 405 to 7  Our House colleagues from all parts of the political spectrum united to send that bill to the Senate with a resounding bipartisan endorsement  I am pleased that the Senate did the same  sending that bill to the President with a unanimous voice of approval       The stakes could not be higher  Funding for the FDAs vital safety mission has reached the breaking point  If we had not acted  the FDA Commissioner would have sent a letter today to over 2 000 employees informing them that their jobs were slated for termination       Each of those individuals is a trained and experienced professional with many career options in academia or industry  yet each of them has made the decision to devote themselves to public service  If those talented public servants had left the agency  the consequences would have been with us for years  in terms of slower access to medicines for patients  weaker safety oversight and loss of Americas competitive edge in the life sciences       FDA has an urgent need for these funds  Its work load has increased massively in recent years but its resources have not kept pace  Since 1990  the number of adverse events submitted to the FDA has increased by over 1 300 percent  but the agencys resources have increased only 130 percent  The legislation provides over  400 million this year for the review of drugs and medical devices at FDA  and over  50 million for needed safety reforms to give these talented professionals the tools they need to do the job we are counting on them to do      The bill before us is not just about resources  far from it  It is a strong and comprehensive measure to improve the safety of the medicines we rely on  and it takes important steps toward a safer food supply and less expensive prescription drugs      At the heart of our proposal is a new way to oversee drug safety that is flexible enough to be tailored the characteristics of particular drugs  yet strong enough to allow decisive action when problems are discovered  For drugs that pose little risk  these actions might be as simple as a program to report side effects and a label with safety information  items that are currently required for all drugs  Drugs that raise major potential safety concerns might require additional clinical trials  a program to train physicians in using the drug safely  or a requirement that the prescribing physician have special skills       A second major element of our legislation is a public registry of clinical trials and their results  A complete central clearinghouse for this information will help patients  providers and researchers learn more and make better health care decisions  Now  the public will know about each trial underway  and will be able to review its results    Our bill recognizes that innovation is the key to medical progress by establishing a new center  the Reagan Udall Foundation  to develop new research methods to accelerate the search for medical breakthroughs  During the discussions that led to consideration of this bill  we heard time and again that there was a major need for better research tools to aid FDA in evaluating the safety of drugs and devices and help researchers move through the long process of developing these products more effectively       If new research tools and better ways to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs could be developed  patients will benefit from quicker drug development  If current procedures can be made more effective  then the cost of developing new drugs will drop      The Reagan Udall Foundation sets up a way to develop these new tools  not so they can help just one researcher or one company  but so they can help the entire research enterprise       The bill helps preserve the integrity of scientific review by improving FDAs safeguards against conflicts of interest on its scientific advisory committees  not through a rigid policy that could deny FDA needed expertise  but though a flexible approach that will reduce the number of waivers given for conflicts of interest at FDA overall      The bill also takes action on the abuse of citizens petitions  FDA has a common sense policy to allow ordinary citizens or medical experts to submit petitions to the agency about drugs that it is considering approving  This procedure should be used to protect public health  but too often  it is subverted by those who seek only to delay the entry onto the market of generic drugs       Even if the petitions are found to be meritless  they will have accomplished their mission  delaying access for consumers to safe and lower cost medicines  Some petitions do present legitimate public health concerns  and FDA should not ignore them  The critical test of any proposal on citizen petitions is that it strike a balance so that the abuse of citizens petitions is prohibited  but those petitions that have genuine safety information are reviewed       The proposal the Senate approved strikes that balance  It rightly states that the mere filing of a citizen petition should not be cause for delay  but allows FDA to delay the approval of a generic application if it determines that doing so is necessary to protect public health  This is the right approach  It prevents abuse  but protects health       The legislation also includes important reforms of direct to consumer  or DTC  advertising  I want to thank Senator Roberts and Senator Harkin for working with Senator Enzi and me and with many members of the committee on this important provision      Instead of the moratorium included in our original bill  the current proposal puts in place strong safety disclosures for DTC ads  coupled with effective enforcement  Under current law  safety disclosures can be an afterthought  a rushed disclaimer read by an announcer at the conclusion of a TV ad while distracting images help gloss over the important information provided  Our proposal requires safety announcements to be presented in a manner that is clear  conspicuous and neutral  without distracting imagery  We also give FDA the authority to require safety disclosures in DTC ads if the risk profile of the drug requires them      Our legislation also takes important first steps toward a safer food supply  These are only first steps  and our committee will work on a comprehensive package of food safety legislation later in the fall  but they are important steps  Consumers and FDA have too little information about contaminated food  Our bill creates a registry and a requirement to report food safety problems  Consumers will have information about recalls at their fingertips  and FDAs response will not be slowed by antiquated and inefficient reporting systems  Our bill also establishes strong  enforceable quality standards for the food we give our pets  to guard against the problems of tainted pet food that we have seen in recent months      In this new era of the life sciences  medical advances will continue to bring immense benefits for our citizens  To fulfill the potential of that bright future  we need not only brilliant researchers to develop the drugs of tomorrow  but also strong and vigilant watchdogs for public health to guarantee that new drugs and medical devices are safe and beneficial  and that they actually reach the patients who urgently need them  Congress has ample power to restore the luster the FDA has lost in recent years  and this bipartisan consensus bill can do the job  I congratulate my colleagues on approving this legislation  and look forward to working with them on its effective implementation          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
