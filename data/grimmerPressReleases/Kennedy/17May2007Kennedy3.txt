         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent the following letter to General George Casey  Chief of Staff of the Army  in response to NBC News report on body armor  May 17  2007General George CaseyChief of Staff  Army200 Army PentagonRoom 3E528Washington D C  20310Dear General Casey  Im writing you today because of my continuing concern that our soldiers in Iraq are not operating with the most effective body armor we can provide  I was especially troubled to see the report on the NBC News investigation finding that the Armys current body armor does not meet military standards  and that the Armys testing of some types of body armor was faulty  This is not a new issue  The Senate Armed Services Committee has held a number of hearings on body armor  and Im surprised that an investigation could show that our soldiers have anything less than the very best in protective body armor I know how strongly you feel about ensuring that our soldiers have the best possible protective body armor  and I hope you provide me with information showing that the Armys testing of body armor has resulted in our troops having body armor that best meets their requirements  Im concerned as well that as better body armor becomes available  that is not being delivered to the field as quickly as possible  The Army has apparently approved new lighter weight body armor  but the contract for its production still has not been awarded  PEO Soldier is on record stating that the Army would begin fielding this new body armor in early April  Would you please explain to me why this was not done  I look forward to your prompt response to these concerns   With respect and appreciation  I am Sincerely Edward M  Kennedy       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
