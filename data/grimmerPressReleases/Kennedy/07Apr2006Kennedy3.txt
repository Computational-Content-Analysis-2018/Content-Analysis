         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I want in this stage of the whole consideration of immigration reform to just mention my friend and colleague  senator McCain  who I ve had the good opportunity to work with  and others  particularly Senator McCain over the last three years in terms of developing a comprehensive approach on this issue  And sort of a bipartisan group that came together  members of our judiciary committee  people that had a particular interest that were outside of our committee  I m very grateful to them  our chairman of our committee  to Senator Specter  always a valued friend  and always a leader  senator Leahy  I thank my own leader  Senator Reid  for all of his good work and counsel and advice  to the senator from Illinois  Senator Durbin  Senator Salazar  Menendez  Lieberman  Obama have all been good supporters during this period  The other side has worked closely with us  Senator Feinstein has been a person of enormous knowledge  understanding on a range of immigration issues  with very special attention to California  which presents such challenges  and she has not only in this debate and discussion    has been an extraordinary ally  but to any debate and discussion on immigration and immigration reform  she brings a special dimension  and she worked with Senator Craig in a very strong bipartisan way     In the initial proposal that Senator McCain I had introduced  we recognized that the AgJobs bill was important and rather than making this issue more complicated  we did not include it  we welcomed it when we had the leadership of Senator Feinstein and Senator Craig  So this has been a bipartisan effort really on trying to bring about immigration reform     I will not review the very strong and positive arguments about the border being broken and our need for focus and attention on the border  Our national security interests and issues of trying to get it right in considering who comes to the united states and who does not come and to our sense of humanity  which I ll speak about for just a few minutes  How we re going to treat those that have come here  work hard  play by the rules  are devoted to their family and religion  join the armed forces and serve our country and serve nobly     So  Mr  President  I rise this morning recognizing that the United States Senate has failed to adopt the urgently needed immigration reform and in doing so we really fail in our duty to our nation and our democracy and our American people     We really only make progress when we have that bipartisanship  We haven t had a great deal of bipartisanship over the recent past  We certainly did on this issue  and that s why it is doubly disappointing and sorrowful that we have missed the opportunity at this time  We also failed  I believe  our immigrant heritage and the 11 million undocumented workers and families who look to us for hope  Clearly the obstacles to progress are many but for those who are committed to immigration reform  this debate is certainly not over     We will continue  if not today  then tomorrow and the days ahead because the battle must go on  As one who has been in the trenches on this issue since I first came to the United States Senate and has been a part of this effort to try and put into perspective the enormous magnet of America  to people to look to it with the with the hope and opportunity and progress  and those that understand that we have to do this in an orderly and rational  reasonable and lawful way  there s always tension  But we are proudly a nation of immigrants  And I m certain I certainly feel that we have lost a chance to make important progress on this issue     Mr  President  what s at stake is not just our security but our humanity as well  and we can t set that aside  We vote today on our security but also on our humanity  We cast a vote of what congress will do about Sheilah  an undocumented immigrant originally from Cork Island  has lived on Cape Cod the last ten years  left Ireland due to economic depression  Now her whole life is in the United States  Her citizen brother is fighting in Iraq  but upon petitioning for her  he found he had a 15 20 year wait  Sheilah listened to her grandfather s funeral through a cell phone because she wasn t able to travel to Ireland  A talented musician  she has helped pay taxes as a carpet cleaner and secretary  We vote today about what to do about William  who came to Massachusetts 14 years ago from Guatemala to make a better life for his family  He is a factory worker  has been paying taxes for the past 14 years  He has son David  seven years old who has cerebral palsy  David is blind and can t walk  William is the sole provider     I am reminded in these last moments  I read the statement that the archbishop of Los Angeles has been a courageous voice on these issues  Now is an historic moment for our country  We need to come together to enact immigration reform which upholds our basic rights and dignity  That is the challenge before us     Mr  President  50 years ago President Kennedy wrote a book called the nation of immigrants and in this book  I ll just mention a very brief part  He talks about just over 350 years  nearly two million have grown up almost entirely populated by others who came from other lands  As president Franklin Roosevelt reminded a convention of the Daughters of the American Revolution  remember always that all of us  you and I especially  descended from immigrants and revolutionists     Walter Whitman said these states are the amplest poem  Here is not merely a nation but a teaming of nations  To know America it is necessary to understand this peculiarity of the American social revolution  It is necessary to know why over 50 million people gave up their settled lives to start anew in a strange and settled land we must know how they met the land and how it met them and how important it is these things are for our future  these lived words are as alive today as they were then  We want to give the assurance of those who have given us great support over this period of time that we re in the battle to the end
