         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I agree with President Bush in the need for immigration reforms that include a rational and humane program for immigrant workers  He s absolutely right that our economy couldn t function without them  We need realistic and comprehensive solutions that will protect our borders  enable temporary workers to come here legally  and allow workers already here to earn legal status  The enforcement only bill that passed the House last December would leave our broken immigration system still broken President Bush should back up his rhetoric by saying no to his right wing allies who want to close our borders and yes to the many Americans who want tough border security and an orderly immigration system that is consistent with our values  Once he has done that  I m hopeful that we can work with the President to enact the McCain Kennedy bill into law  We need responsible immigration reforms that are consistent with our country s ideals and reflect our heritage as both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
