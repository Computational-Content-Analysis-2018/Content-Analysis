         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy heard testimony from Lieutenant General Michael D  Maples  Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and General Michael V  Hayden  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency at the Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing  He questioned them about the delay in the completion of the next National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq  given that it has been over two years since an assessment has been made and three and a half months since Negroponte announced that the work would begin  Can you explain why the intelligence community is dragging its feet on a new assessment on Iraq  Senator Kennedy said  We all have an interest in a thoughtful assessment  but its unacceptable that more than three months after the Director of National Intelligence agreed to prepare an updated assessment  work has barely begun  Below is Senator Kennedys statement as well as a time line of the National Intelligence Estimate  STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDYSENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEENOVEMBER 15  2006  STATEMENT AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY America deserves an open and honest assessment from the intelligence community about Iraq  particularly on the question of whether Iraq is descending into full scale civil war  With 150 000 American troops on the ground in Iraq  this is our most urgent foreign policy priority The last National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq was completed in July 2004  more than two years ago  On August 3  the Senate approved an amendment I authored to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill mandating an updated NIE  and on August 4 the Director of National Intelligence agreed to task the intelligence community to prepare it  Two days ago  we received a letter from the Director of National Intelligence informing us that the National Intelligence Council  working with the Intelligence Community  has been finalizing the Terms of Reference for this NIE and is beginning to work on the assessment Can you explain why the intelligence community is dragging its feet on a new assessment on Iraq  We all have an interest in a thoughtful assessment  but its unacceptable that more than three months after the Director of National Intelligence agreed to prepare an updated assessment  work has barely begun  There has been significant discussion about finding a political solution to end the violence and stop the slide to full scale civil war in Iraq  However  the Shiite dominated Parliament has just approved legislation to allow more autonomous regions against the strong objections of the Sunni leadership  which suggests less unity  not more  What is the best we can hope for in Iraq  The last time the intelligence community prepared a National Intelligence Estimate more than two years ago  the best case scenario was an Iraq whose stability would remain tenuous in political  economic  and security terms  The worse case was developments that could lead to civil war  Timeline on Iraq National Intelligence EstimateJuly  2004  last National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq prepared July 26  2006  Senate Democrats write to DNI Negroponte asking that he prepare an updated National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq to address whether Iraq is in or descending into a civil war  Letter sent by Senators Kennedy  Rockefeller  Biden  Levin  Reid  and Reed August 2  2006  Kennedy and Senate Democrats introduce amendment to DoD Appropriations bill mandating an updated NIE in two months  October 1  and outlining issue areas to be covered  August 3  2006  Senate approves modified Kennedy amendment mandating an updated NIE within five months  90 days from enactment  and outlining issue areas to be covered August 4  2006  DNI Negroponte announces that he will prepare an updated NIE  There have been numerous developments in Iraq since the last National Intelligence Estimate  NIE  in mid 2004  to include three political transitions  The DNI believes it is timely to prepare an updated estimate  given a variety of pressing questions concerning Iraq  As a result  we will initiate drafting the NIE shortly  Judith Emmel  ODNI Director of Public AffairsAugust 15  2006  DNI Negroponte responds to July 26 letter from Kennedy  Rockefeller  Biden  Levin  Reid  and Reed  I have instructed the National Intelligence Council to initiate the process of preparing such an EstimateI appreciate your laying out a specific set of issues and questions for consideration in the upcoming EstimateThese will be an important part of our deliberations as the National Intelligence Council begins to draft the Terms of Reference for the EstimateWe will seek to complete the Estimate in as timely a manner as possible  commensurate with adherence to the highest standards of tradecraft and thoroughness November 13  2006   Although three and a half months have passed since DNI Negroponte announced he would ask the intelligence community to prepare an updated NIE on Iraq he sent a letter to Kennedy and colleagues to inform them that the National Intelligence Council is just beginning to work on the assessment      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202
