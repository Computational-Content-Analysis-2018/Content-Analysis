         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  Senator Kennedy joined his fellow co sponsors of the bipartisan Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act and advocate Michael J  Fox to urge passage of the embryonic stem cell research legislation previously approved by the House of Representatives by a wide bipartisan margin  The legislation would allow federal funding for stem cell research using stem cell lines derived under strict ethical requirements from excess in vitro fertilization embryos  regardless of the date they were derived  House sponsors Mike Castle  R DE  and Diana DeGette  D CO  participated in the Senate event  emphasizing the strong bipartisan support for this bill in both chambers and across the country    We re here because we believe that when science opens a door to hope  we shouldn t allow a rigid ideology to slam it shut  A true culture of life seeks to cure disease and alleviate suffering  not deny help  Senator Kennedy said  Let s tell the Senate to bring up the bipartisan stem cell bill  with a clean vote  just as the House passed it  Let s ask the President to stand up to the right wing and sign it into law    While other measures are being discussed  advocates and scientists agree that there is no substitute for the extraordinary potential of embryonic stem cell research to bring new cures to the patients who need them  Senator Kennedy is an original cosponsor of the Specter Harkin stem cell bill  along with Senators Hatch  Feinstein  and Smith  Specifically  the bill would    overturn the Bush policy that prohibits NIH and other Federal agencies from supporting or conducting research on stem cells lines created after August 9  2001          allow NIH to support stem cell research provided that the following ethical requirements are met                       1   the embryos from which the cells are derived were leftover from the process of in vitro fertilization                       2  the embryos were donated for stem cell research after informed consent                       3  the embryos were donated for stem cell research without any financial inducements     Below are Senator Kennedy s prepared remarks    REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY RALLY ON STEM CELLS JULY 13TH  2005                                        as prepared for delivery    We re here because of the courage of people like Michael J  Fox  and many many others  They are determined not to let a tough diagnosis dampen their spirits or their hunger for life     We re here because we believe that when science opens a door to hope  we shouldn t allow a rigid ideology to slam it shut  A true culture of life seeks to cure disease and alleviate suffering  not deny help  That s why many of the nation s major religious leaders have written to Senator Frist today to urge him to schedule an immediate vote on the bipartisan stem cell research bill    We should be going full speed ahead  but those who oppose this research keep slamming on the brakes    Let s wait  they say  until we ve exhausted the potential of adult stem cells    I m all for trying new methods to bring cures to patients  but let me ask you this  Does anyone here think we should wait until adult stem cells have been tried  before we allow scientists to do more embryonic stem cell research    Others say  Let s wait until scientists explore untried and untested new theories for generating stem cells    I m all for new ways to obtain stem cells  but it makes no sense to delay obvious types of such research until speculative new theories are proven    Our opponents say  Let s not vote yet  Give us time to load up the bipartisan stem cell legislation passed by the House with poison pills and unrelated issues    I m all for full debate  but let me ask you this  Does anyone here think we should put poison pills ahead of the search for cures  Does anyone think we should delay any longer before bringing the House bill to vote in the Senate    Does anyone think the President should veto the bill once it reaches his desk    Let s tell the Senate to bring up the bipartisan stem cell bill just as the House passed it    not muddy the waters by trying to substitute proposals on less promising alternatives  Let s have a clean vote on it  just like the House did  Let s ask the President to stand up to the right wing and sign it into law   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
