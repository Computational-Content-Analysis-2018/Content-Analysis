         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today s Senate action to move to debate on increasing funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program for this winter will hopefully become a step in the right direction  Democrats have pressed for months to increase funds for LIHEAP to the authorized level of  5 1 billion  We ve urged the Republican leadership and the President to act  but the Republican majority has blocked our efforts at every turn  and families are paying a steep price for that neglect  The average LIHEAP grant has decreased by almost 10 percent since 2002  and is now only  288  In fact  countless citizens in communities throughout America live year round with the constant threat of power shut offs because they can t pay their energy bills  and they have no confidence that either Congress or this President are on their side  In Massachusetts  the state government has provided  20 million in additional funds for LIHEAP this year  Low income families are more fortunate in our state than in most other states on this issue  but we have exhausted all federal funds  and there is still great need  Even the poorest households with the highest bills will get no more than  840  less than half what is needed to get through the winter  It s wrong to let people like this suffer  We can and must do more  The Republican majority has refused to fully fund LIHEAP  but surely they won t deny our most vulnerable citizens an increase of  1 billion so that they can make it through the winter FACT SHEET ENERGY COSTS AND LIHEAP MASSACHUSETTS In Massachusetts  LIHEAP served approximately 131 000 households in 200513 000 to 14 000 households in Boston   The need for LIHEAP is increasing  As of December 31  2005  Massachusetts received 131 448 applications   a 6 9  increase over applications received in December 2004  122 958 applications    Even the poorest households with the highest bills will get no more than  840 benefit  less than half what is needed to get through the winter   In Massachusetts  the average price of heating oil     which nearly 40 percent of households use to heat their homes     is  2 38  up   41 from the 2005 average of  1 97  NATIONAL Since the winter heating season 2001 2002  the price of home heating costs for heating oil increased from  627 to  1474  natural gas from  465 to  1000  and propane from  736 to  1286   The number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance has increased from 4 2 million in 2002 to 5 million in 2005  the highest level in 10 years  Yet  the program only serves about 15 6 percent of eligible recipients  The National Energy Assistance Directors  Association projects the number of households receiving LIHEAP Assistance to increase to 5 6 million in 2006   94 percent of households served by LIHEAP have at least one member who is elderly  disabled  a child under 18  or has a single adult living with one or more children  The average LIHEAP household has an income of less than  10 000  Households in poverty will owe an average of 25  of their entire annual income for their energy bills  The average LIHEAP grant has decreased since 2002 and is now  288a cut of 9 8 percent   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
