         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Pensions and Labor Committee and Representative John Dingell  Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  introduced their legislation to give all Americans quality healthcare  Their bill will extend Medicare to all Americans  from birth to the end of life and will reduce costs and improve quality  including more effective use of health information technology   It also puts a new emphasis on preventive care  because preventing illness before it occurs is always better and less expensive than treating patients after they become ill    The nation s health care has reached such a crisis point that the American people are looking for bold action   Our experience last year in adopting health reforms in Massachusetts shows that this can happen  Political leaders  business representatives  health experts and average citizens all came together around a health reform plan   Senator Kennedy said   Congress should follow this lead   I believe that the best plan for the nation is to build on a program that all Americans know and respect by creating Medicare for All    Medicare administrative costs are low  Patient satisfaction is high  Patients can choose their doctors and hospitals  And all Americans will be free from the fear of medical expenses and enable them to seek the best possible care when illness strikes  Not only will covering all Americans improve millions of lives  it will actually save money by reducing emergency room costs and increasing access to prevention services and earlier treatments  said Dingell   We will all reap the benefits of a healthier nation  a stronger economy and lower health insurance costs MEDICARE FOR ALLQUALITY  AFFORDABLE  HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANSKey points      America now spends  2 3 trillion per year or  5 3 billion per day on healthcaremore than we spend on food      According to the McKinsey Global Institute  excess spending in our healthcare system amounts to almost half a trillion dollars per year or 21  of current spending       The value we receive for this spending is poor   over 46 million Americans are uninsured  yet we spend six times more on administrative costs than our economic competitors  while ranking high in medical errors and low in coordination of care for the chronically ill      According to the Institute of Medicine  the cost of lost productivity of the uninsured due to inability to get medical care ranges from  75 billion to  205 billion per year      According to the Urban Institute  providing coverage to all Americans would cost roughly 3  to 6  of current spending        Medicare for All will achieve universal coverage  and address many of our healthcare systems greatest challenges by providing      universal coverage within 5 years through a three stage phase in      benefits equivalent to those every Senator and Congressman gets through their publicly subsidized insurance plan      choice of enrollment in Medicare or private plans through a plan similar to the one available to federal employees      fair financing through a payroll tax that will sharply reduce average employer health care expenses  and     incentives to improve quality and bring information technology to medical care The Health Care CrisisAmericas failure to assure the basic human right to health care to all its citizens was one of the great public policy failures of the 20th century    As a result  forty six million Americans are uninsured  and the number of the uninsured is increasing at an accelerating rate   Even these figures understate the problem   Over a two year period  82 million Americansone out of every three non elderly Americanswill be uninsured for a significant period of time    No American family is more than one pink slip or one employer decision to drop coverage away from being uninsured   Even for those who have coverage  health care costs are skyrocketing out of control   Health costs are threatening their livelihoods with health premiums rising over four times faster than their wages   Health care spending has reached 16  of GDP  the highest level in our nations history   The bottom line is that Americans pay  5 3 billion a day for health care  more than we pay for food  Our dysfunctional health care system hinders the ability of American companies to compete in the global marketplace   Our health care costs much higher than our trading competitors  and our system forces employers and employees to finance a much higher proportion of costs than firms abroad because foreign systems rely much more on broad based public financing     The heavy burden the health care financing system adds to labor costs in the United States also acts as a drain on hiring and provides an additional incentive for outsourcing jobs abroad     Fact sheets with further details on the crisis are attached Medicare for All Medicare for All will make health care coverage available to every American by expanding the Medicare program to the under 65 population   To promote competition and choice  enrollees will also have the option of choosing any of the plans offered to members of Congress  the President  and federal employees  Costs will be reduced by administrative savings from moving to a Medicare style financing system  by having a robust marketplace open to everyone for private plans  by bringing modern information technology to health care  by improving quality of care  and by rewarding health care providers based on performance  not just on the number of procedures performed  To ease the transition to the new system  coverage will be implemented in phases   In the first  coverage will be extended to individuals 55 65 and to children and young adults under 25 years old   Within 5 years of enactment  coverage will be extended to all other Americans not already covered under Medicare Benefits    Benefits available to the under 65 population under the expanded Medicare  program will be the same as those provided under Medicare  with additional benefits appropriate to the wider age range served by the new program   Enrollees may also choose any private insurance plan available to members of Congress under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program  Freedom of choice    Every enrollee in the expanded Medicare program is guaranteed the right to go to the doctor  hospital  or other health care provider of their choice  just as they are under the current Medicare program   This is a significant improvement over the current health financing system  under which insurers generally limit enrollees to providers chosen by the insurer or require them to pay high additional cost sharing if they want to go to an out of network provider  Private health care delivery system     While the new program will be largely publicly financed  the health system itself will remain private   Just as under the current Medicare program  doctors  hospitals and other providers will continue to operate as independent  private entities   As under Medicare  the program will be largely be administered by private carriers and intermediaries Eligibility and enrollment      Any individual with a social security number is eligible to participate in the plan and will be automatically enrolled in the extended Medicare plan unless they choose one of the private options    There will be the opportunity to switch plans annually  just as there is under the FEHBP program Cost reduction through improved quality of care    Information technology can make a real difference in patient care   Computerized medical records  coupled with decision support software  can help avoid dangerous medical errors  assist in coordinating care for patients receiving services from multiple providers  help patients take responsibility for their own health  and improve the quality of care   Under Medicare for All  health care providers will be rewarded for improving the quality of care they give to patients   One measure of health care quality will be appropriate use of information technology systems that improve care quality and reduce costs Role of Medicaid and Medicare    Medicaid will continue to provide services to very low income and disabled individuals   The current Medicare system will continue to provide insurance for the over 65 population and for eligible disabled individuals Cost of planAccording to the Urban Institute  the net additional cost of universal coverage ranges from 3 to 6 percent of current health spending or about  70 billion to  138 billion  assuming no other reforms   Substantial indirect and direct subsidies for the uninsured are already in the system   However  this proposal includes reforms that should generate significant offsetting savings       98 billion in excess administrative costs through open enrollment in Medicare for All  simplification of billing and claims  and the consolidation of marketing through the FEHBP        50 billion a year from reduced administrative costs to providers from dealing with a simpler  more uniform billing system        160 billion a year as the result of universal adoption of an electronic medical record and advanced information technology         savings from the prevention and better management of cardiovascular disease  diabetes  and certain types of cancer  that comes with universal coverage  and     reduction in premium costs created by a functional marketplace for private plans      While the plan will create savings  there will be a significant transfer of costs from individuals and businesses who now pay for the cost of health insurance to public financing sources  In other words  the funding of insurance through the government will substitute for spending currently by businesses and individuals  not add on to current private spending  Preliminary estimates of the transfer to federal spending are  600 billion a year   The cost increase to the government will be fully covered by payroll taxes and general revenues and will not add to the deficit Financing    The plan will be financed by a combination of payroll taxes and general revenues that will substitute for private payments   A preliminary estimate of the payroll tax financing necessary will be a payment of 7 percent of payroll by businesses and 1 7 percent by workers   By comparison  businesses providing coverage today spend an average of 13  of payroll to cover their workers    Fact Sheets attached  The Burden of Being Uninsured     In any given year  1 3 of the uninsured go without needed medical care           Eight million uninsured Americans fail to take medication their doctors prescribe  because they cannot afford to fill the prescription      Two hundred and seventy thousand children suffering from asthma never see a doctor   Three hundred and fifty thousand children with recurrent earaches never see a doctor   More than three hundred and fifty thousand children with severe sore throats never see a doctor      27 000 uninsured women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year   They are twice as likely as insured women not to receive medical treatment until their cancer has already spread in their bodies   As a result  they are 50  more likely to die of the disease      32 000 Americans with heart disease go without life saving and life enhancing bypass surgery or angioplasty  because they are uninsured         Whether the disease is AIDS or mental illness or cancer or heart disease or diabetes  the uninsured are left out and left behind   In hospital and out  young or old  black or white  they receive less care  suffer more  and are 25  more likely to die than those who are insured      Medical costs account for about half of all bankruptcies  affecting over 2 million people annually    More than 9 million families spend more than 1 5 of their total income on medical costs       According to the Institute of Medicine  the cost of lost work productivity of the uninsured due to inability to get medical care ranges from  75 billion to  205 billion per year  Characteristics of the Uninsured     81  of those without insurance are employees or family members of employees   Of these uninsured workers  most are members of families with at least one person working full time       The uninsured are predominantly low and moderate income persons who cannot afford to buy coverage in the individual market   Approximately two thirds have incomes below 200  of poverty       8 3 million children are uninsured  one fifth of the total uninsured population      Large numbers of people in all racial ethnic groups are uninsured  but minorities are disproportionately affected  One in ten non Hispanic whites are uninsured  one in five African Americans are uninsured  and one in three Hispanics are uninsured  Health Care Costs    Excessive inflation in health care costs not only burdens the economy but is a major factor in increasing the number of the uninsured   For each 1  increase in health insurance premiums  another 150 000 people become uninsured      After several years of low growth  health care costs are now rising very rapidly   Health insurance premiums increased 10 9   in 2001  12 9  in 2002  13 9  in 2003  11 2  in 2004  and 9 2  in 2005   The cumulative increase over the five years was 73   while the cumulative increase in the CPI was only 13 6       National health expenditures are projected to reach  2 3 trillion this year and  3 6 trillion in 2014  growing at an average annual rate of 7 1   from 2003 2014  As a share of GDP  health spending is projected to reach 18 7   by 2014      According to the McKinsey Global Institute  even accounting for our greater wealth  the United States spends  477 billion or about half a trillion dollars more per year than is expected based on our national income      Claims processing and other administrative functions cost the health care system  600 billion per year  money that could be better spent on patient care     Americas fragmented health financing system is a major driver of these high administrative costs  We spend six times the average of OECD countries on administrative costs   In Canada  where health insurance is publicly financed and providers bill the government for all services rather than having to deal with a multiplicity of insurance companies with different rules and payment formulas  administrative costs are only about half as high as in the United States  16 7  of total health costs in Canada vs  31  in the United States       The administrative expense needed by the government to run the Medicare program accounts for only 3  of Medicare spending    By contrast  the amount of every premium dollar retained by private insurance companies for marketing  administration and profit is 14       The private insurance industry spends 64  of its administrative costs on medical underwriting and marketing alone which means that less than one third of private insurance administration is spent on claims processing  fraud management  and care coordination      Healthcare is one of the least efficient industries in America   Settling a single transaction in health care can cost as much as  12 to  25  whereas banks have cut their costs to less than a penny per transaction by using modern information technology        According to a study conducted by the RAND Corporation  by utilizing advanced information technology and adopting electronic medical records for every patient  America could save over  160 billion a year by reducing duplicative care  lowering health care administrative costs  and improving quality   Value ReceivedEven though we spend significantly more than our nearest competitors  studies of health outcomes and utilization in the United States indicate that Americans fare worse than their neighbors in quality and access to care on many important measures   Put simply  Americans are not getting value for our investment     Life expectancy in the US is below the OECD average      The USA ranks 26th in the world in infant mortality  below the Czech Republic and Cuba       34 percent of American chronic care patients report medical errors  more than in any other surveyed country  No other country exceeds a 30 percent error rate       16 percent of American chronic care patients do not have a regular doctor  twice the 8 percent level of the second highest country      Only 50 percent of U S  chronic care patients have been with the same doctor for 5 years or more  In the second lowest country  61 percent have such continuity of care      33 percent of U S  patients experience problems with coordination of care  such as results failing to reach the doctors office in time or redundant medical tests  In the second highest country  26 percent experience such coordination problems       Only 55 percent of medical care received is medically appropriate  the remaining 45 percent reflecting either underutilization or overutilization      Americans consume 20 percent fewer prescription drugs than patients in Germany  Canada  and the United Kingdom but pay 70 percent more  Burden on U S Competitiveness and Job Growth    Government data  industry surveys  and interviews with employers indicate that many businesses remain reluctant to hire full time employees because health insurance has become one of the fastest growing costs for companies      A recent study found that employers have reduced hiring in response to rising health insurance premiums  and that industries with higher health care costs have had slower job growth   This has been especially true for the manufacturing sector      U S  employee benefit costsof which health care is the largest component  for manufacturing firms are higher than most of its major competitors and the private share of overall health expenditures is much higher in the U S  than it is for its major competitors        Ten percent of the total cost of a ton of steel manufactured in the United States is consumed by retiree health benefits alone    Starbucks now spends more on health care than it does on coffee    The difference between the way health care is financed in Canada and the U S  saves the Canadian auto industry  4 00 an hour in worker compensation compared to the U S  The Canadian branches of the big three automakers have released a joint letter with Canadian Auto Workers Union stating that the Canadian health care system is a strategic advantage for Canada and has been an important ingredient in the success of Canadas most important export industry    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
