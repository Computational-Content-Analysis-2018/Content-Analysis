         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I commend the House and Senate conferees for their decision to include in the conference report on the Intelligence Authorization Bill a provision requiring all U S  government agencies  including the CIA  to comply with the Army Field Manuals rules against torture  This major reform is urgently needed  and its enactment will mark a clear rejection of torture in interrogations     In the Detainee Treatment Act passed in 2005  Congress attempted to restore confidence in Americas treatment of detainees and affirm our commitment to the basic rights enshrined in the Geneva Conventions  These rights protect both the ideals we cherish as a free society and the lives of our servicemen and women overseas  But by not explicitly applying the Army Field Manuals standards to all government agencies  we left open a loophole that an Administration determined to use abusive interrogation techniques might exploit     The Bush Administration drove a Mack truck through that loophole  The CIAs so called enhanced interrogation program  carried out at secret sites  became an international scandal and a shameful stain on America in the eyes of the world  The Administration issued an Executive Order last year to minimize the outcry  but the Order failed to provide meaningful guidelines for civilian interrogators or to renounce abuses such as waterboarding  mock executions  use of attack dogs  beatings  and electric shocks  The recent disclosure of secret opinions by the Office of Legal Counsel gave further evidence that the Administration still intended to use such techniques  and Attorney General Mukaseys refusal at his confirmation hearings to say whether waterboarding is illegal gave us even more reason for concern     Remarkably  the outrages do not end there  Just today  new reports have surfaced that the CIA in 2005 destroyed at least two videotapes documenting the use of severe interrogation techniques on detainees in its custody  These videotapes were withheld from the 9 11 Commission and from congressional committees  General Hayden claims that one of the reasons for destroying these tapes was fear of reprisals on United   States personnel and their families      All of these disgraceful episodes leave no doubt that the only solution is for Congress to apply the Army Field Manuals standards across the board  Thats why I introduced the Torture Prevention and Effective Interrogation Act in August to do just that      The Field Manual clearly states that  u se of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results  may damage subsequent collection efforts  and can induce the source to say what he thinks the  interrogator  wants to hear  The Manual leaves great flexibility for our interrogators  but makes clear that torture is forbidden     Applying the Field Manuals standards throughout our government will bring us closer to repairing the damage to our international reputation that began with the Abu Ghraib scandal in Iraq  Once again  the United States can be the worlds beacon for human rights and fair treatment  The new law will improve the quality of intelligence gathering  and help protect our own personnel from such abuse anywhere in the world  It will make America safer and stronger     Torture is a defining issue for every country  and its distressing that under the Bush Administration  America lost its way  By applying the Field Manuals standards to all government interrogations  Congress can move America backback to our ideals  back to the rule of law  and back to respect in the world          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
