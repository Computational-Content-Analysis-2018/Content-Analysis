M  KENNEDY ON THE SIGNING OF THE MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION April 12  2006 Boston  Massachusetts    Governor Romney  President Travaglini  Speaker DiMasi  assembled leaders and friends     You ve given Massachusetts just what the doctor ordered    With the signing of this landmark health reform bill  after so many years of false starts  our actions have finally matched our words and we have lived up to our ideals    At long last  the impossible dream of health care for all will finally become a reality in our Commonwealth  and quality care will truly be available and affordable for each and every man  woman  and child in our state    We take pride that Massachusetts has long been renowned for its extraordinary pre eminence in medical care and medical research  We have been the gold standard in those fields for many years  But to our shame  we have tolerated a double standard as well  in which millions of our fellow citizens have suffered needlessly  because the miracles of modern medicine were out of reach for all but the few    As with any great undertaking  our ascent to this landmark day has had its stresses and strains  Our climb has involved true sacrifice  hard work  and artful compromise     Now  yet again  the pioneering spirit of the people of Massachusetts has prevailed  The ideals of the American revolution are still alive and well here  Those great ideals have taught us never to give up and never to give in     It is appropriate that we observe this auspicious occasion in Faneuil Hall  the Cradle of Liberty  The negotiations over this health reform have been intense  and the passion of the debates across the state have sometimes seemed a reminder of the oratory that once shook the ancient timbers of this edifice    To our Governor  our Senate President and our Speaker  we say  Well done  You laid the cornerstone of our bipartisan progress on this new law from its earliest days  You led the way over the long and winding path to this moment  And now you may well have fired the shot heard round the world on health care in America  I hope so     Many others had major roles in shaping this reform as well  Our State Senators and Representatives  Our business leaders  Our religious leaders  Our hospitals and our health centers  And most of all  the people of Massachusetts  who reminded us why we still call ourselves a Common Wealth  with a solemn responsibility to act for the common good    We know that this day is only a beginning  but what a new beginning it is  There is still much to be done to fulfill the promise of this new law in the daily lives of our people  There are regulations to be written  federal approval to be sought  adjustments to be made in good faith as the new law takes effect  I join in a solemn pledge to continue our progress in the days  months and years ahead    Looking back from the future  may it be said that of this day  that something good and lasting happened here    for parents and children  for merchants and workers  from the Berkshires to Boston  This is a moment to savor of hope and promise and achievement for all the people of our Commonwealth  and perhaps for the rest of America too  and we intend to make the most of it     Thank you very much       Melissa Wagoner  Keith Maley  202  224 2633
