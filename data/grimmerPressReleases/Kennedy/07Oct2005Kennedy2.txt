         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC    Today  a group of Democratic Senators joined together to urge the Bush administration to lay out its plans to prepare Americans for a potential Avian flu pandemic  In a letter to Secretary Michael Leavitt  the Senators called on the administration to provide crucial information to the Congress and the American people about their plans to prepare and protect Americans from this potentially catastrophic illness    A text of the letter is below    October 7  2005   The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt Secretary U S  Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Avenue  SW Washington  DC 20201   Dear Secretary Leavitt    We are writing regarding the federal government s preparedness to deal with the threat of an avian influenza pandemic  Although all experts agree that our level of preparedness here at home is critical to limiting the human and economic costs of an avian flu pandemic  we are deeply concerned that the federal government is ill prepared to respond to this looming crisis  We need to hear from you how this troubling situation developed and what you believe can be done to address it     As you know  it will take several months to produce and distribute a vaccine once we have identified a strain of influenza with pandemic potential  In the meantime  public health experts agree that antiviral medications will be a crucial stopgap defense against a pandemic  These medications could greatly help to reduce illness and death and to contain an emerging pandemic prior to the development of an effective vaccine    The World Health Organization has recommended that countries stockpile enough antivirals to treat at least 25 percent of their populations  The Infectious Disease Society of America has recommended that the U S  stockpile enough antivirals to treat up to 50 percent of the population  While other nations have ordered enough antiviral medication to treat between twenty and forty percent of their populations  the federal government has only ordered enough to treat less than two percent of Americans  On September 29  2005  the Senate unanimously approved a  3 9 billion amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill that would provide more than  3 billion to purchase enough anti viral medication to protect at least 50 percent of the U S  population     Unfortunately  resources alone do not guarantee that we will be able to secure in a timely manner enough antivirals to protect a large portion of Americans  Currently  experts believe that the antiviral oseltamivir  known as Tamiflu   is the best treatment option for individuals infected with the current avian influenza strain  H5N1   According to Hoffman    La Roche  the only pharmaceutical company licensed to produce Tamiflu  their manufacturing process for Tamiflu takes eight to twelve months and they lack a surge capacity to meet large scale demand upon the outbreak of a pandemic  Moreover  because the United States is behind other nations that have already placed orders with Roche  it would take until the end of 2007 to deliver enough Tamiflu to the Strategic National Stockpile for just 25 percent of our population  Obviously  protecting at least 50 percent of the American public as called for by all 100 U S  Senators will take even longer     In light of this deeply troubling state of affairs  we believe it is critical that you undertake the following steps    1  explain why our preparations are behind those of other nations  2  explain your plan to provide sufficient protection for the American people  3  provide us with your assessment of whether your administration possesses the legal authorities required to address this critical issue  and 4  if a determination is made that the Administration lacks the requisite authorities  that you immediately consult with congressional leaders on legislation that would address this problem    We look forward to hearing from you      Sincerely    Senator Harry Reid Senator Dick Durbin Senator Evan Bayh Senator Tom Harkin Senator Ted Kennedy Senator Barack Obama  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
