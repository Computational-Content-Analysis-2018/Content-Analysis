         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the Mining Safety Health Administration s  MSHA  Announcement it will review fines    A review of MSHA s lax penalty standards is long overdue  For too long the agency has allowed companies that repeatedly violate safety laws to pay fines lower than most parking tickets  Any new standards must ensure that companies that repeatedly violate safety rules and put workers at risk of injury receive fines that serve as real deterrents to jeopardizing miners  safety not mere slaps on the wrist  And we must enforce these fines and not allow violators to shirk their responsibilities through repeated appeals     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
