         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     This weeks broad bipartisan vote for childrens health in the House of Representatives was a stunning rebuke for the President and the politics of fear  For months  the Administration had spared no effort to hold opposition to childrens health care and even worked to increase it  They burned the phone lines with calls to members of the House  put pressure on governors to sway the Representatives from their states  and called in every last favor from their allies on K Street to try to bring this bill down      Then  just as the House and Senate were beginning negotiations  the Administration even issued a directive form CMS that would further limit the income eligibility for CHIP and result in children across the country losing coverage     All of this coming from a President  who  when running for office in 2004  the President said     America s children must also have a healthy start in life  In a new term  we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government s health insurance programs  We will not allow a lack of attention  or information  to stand between these children and the health care they need      And for what result  Did opposition to the childrens health bill grow  or even hold steady      No  just the opposite     38 members of the House of Representatives who had opposed the bill when it was first brought before that chamber supported it yesterday      With each passing day  the President stands a little more isolated      With each passing day  his arguments ring a little more hollow      With each passing day  he reveals ever more clearly that the values of his Administration are out of touch with those of average Americans     Americans overwhelmingly support investing more money into the CHIP program not less  Nine out of ten American want Congress to cover more uninsured children and the vast majority considers CHIP important  And 63  think that President Bush would be doing the wrong thing if he vetoed the CHIP legislation  But the President has other priorities  And we can see what they are      The senate bill provides  35 billion over 5 years for CHIP  Just one year of the presidents tax cuts is  72 6 billion  And we spend  120 billion on one year in Iraq       Each day we spend  333 million on Iraq  Thats over 23 times what we currently spend on children needing health care every day  For one day in Iraq  we could cover the healthcare of over 256 000 American children  For one month in Iraq  we could cover the total cost of CHIP for over a year     The children of America should not become the latest casualties of this Administration       Some will point out that 25 more votes are needed in the other chamber to override a veto  and that is true  But something else is also true     We have heard from many communities of faith  wondering why anyone could oppose legislation to bring good health care to children  They may differ in their creeds or in their form of worship  but they are united in one unshakeable foundation of faith  that we have a solemn duty to serve humankind  and to leave the world a better place than the one we found      Yesterday  religious leaders from many different traditions of faith spoke out in favor of the childrens health bill  Each of them comes from congregations or organizations that have a profound commitment to putting faith into action by caring for those in their community who are sick or who need help    but each of these leaders recognizes that they cannot do the job alone  Government has a fundamental responsibility to provide the help that many cannot provide for themselves     And CHIP helps us do that    CHIP has grown steadily from the beginning and now provides coverage for over 6 million children     In the past decade  the percentage of uninsured children has dropped from almost 23 percent in 1997 to 14 percent in 2005  That reduction is significant  but its obviously far from enough      Recently  the Census Bureau reported that in the past year 600 000 more children have become uninsured  The struggling economy is causing employers to drop family coverage and even the robust and successful CHIP program hasnt been able to stave off decreasing coverage for children     CHIP helps to improve childrens school performance  When children are receiving the health care they need  they do better academically  emotionally  physically and socially        And CHIP all but eliminates the distressing racial and ethnic health disparities for the minority children who disproportionately depend on it for their coverage     For specific diseases  like asthma  children on CHIP have dramatically better outcomes than when they were uninsured  Delays to the doctor and getting prescriptions decreased 27 percent  Emergency room visits decreased 19 percent  And hospitalizations decreased by almost two thirds     Even the Administrations own studies confirm that CHIP works     A report the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released last week showed that over the past 10 years  CHIP has improved overall access to care  reduced the level of unmet need  improved access to dental care  expanded access to preventative care  and reduced emergency department use      Supporters of CHIP know that a healthy work force is a productive work force  and when parents have to take time away from work to tend to a sick child or for sudden visits to the emergency room because they cannot get care elsewhere  the business of America suffers      Supporters of CHIP know that it allows more of their students to come to class ready to learn and ready to contribute      Supporters of CHIP know what a difference it makes in the lives of the children in their care  They know that too many families are one layoff  one off shoring or one employers decisions away from losing the coverage they have for themselves and their children      Supporters of CHIP know that it makes the difference between a life of opportunity and good health  and one of denial and illness  CHIP changes lives     We must pass this bill and show our commitment to the children and working families of America  This bill moves us forward together  Republicans and Democrats alike  to guarantee the children of America the health care they need and deserve      It is incomprehensible that President Bush has continued to issue a cruel veto threat on the bill  The question for President Bush today is why he would even consider rejecting a program that has long brought Republicans and Democrats together to help children     The President says he will veto the bill because CHIP is just a step towards socialized medicine but thats untrue  CHIP allows parents to choose insurance for their son or daughter from a private insurance company  That is one reason why Republicans have long supported the CHIP program  Indeed  CHIP uses the same private insurance model that President Bush supported in creating the Medicare prescription drug benefit      If Members of Congress and the Administration really feel strongly that its wrong for the federal government to support health care coverage  maybe they should start by giving up their own taxpayer subsidized health care through the federal employees program  If members can take their children to the attending physician of the Senate with all the benefits that affordsshouldnt all American children also have access to quality healthcare  The American people pay 72  of our health care premiums  I would hope that my Senate colleaguesRepublican and Democrat alikebelieve that the children of hard working American families deserve a healthy start in lifethe same start our own children had  The people that pay for our health coverage with their tax dollars should at least be able to take their children to the doctor when they are sick     The President says he will veto the bill because it costs too much  But I will tell you what costs more  treating children in emergency rooms after their conditions have become severe  CHIP saves money    and untold suffering    by getting health care to our nations children before they are seriously ill       This bill is paid for by an increased tax on cigarettes    not by raiding the treasury  That tax will itself save us countless dollars and lives by discouraging smoking     This bill does what is needed to cover 4 million more uninsured children  Experts  including those at the Congressional Budget office  say that this bill is the most cost effective way to cover uninsured children  But under the Presidents proposal  1 4 million children would lose their coverage because it is  8 billion short of what is needed to cover the children currently covered by CHIP     The words of parents whose children are enrolled by CHIP are more eloquent than any Senator could be on how important CHIP is      In Massachusetts  I met a woman named Dedra Lewis  Her daughter Alexsiana developed an eye disease that if left untreated would make her go blind  Because of our state CHIP program Masshealth  Dedra is able to get the medicine and doctor visits needed to prevent her daughters blindness      Dedra said this     If I miss a single appointment  I know she could lose her eyesight  If I can t buy her medication  I know she could lose her eyesight  If I didn t have Masshealth  my daughter would be blind     This is the tremendous impact CHIP has on families across America      The President has broken his promise to Americas children  We must not break ours  I urge my colleagues to support this motion          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
