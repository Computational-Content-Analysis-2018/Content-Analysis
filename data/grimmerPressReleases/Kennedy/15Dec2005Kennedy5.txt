         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     As Congress meets for a final session before we adjourn for the holidays  we should be focused on the true meaning of Christmas and the special thoughts that Americans of many faiths have at this time of year regarding their families  their friends and neighbors  and the rest of humanity    There are those in America who urge the return of the word Christmas to this holiday season  I believe that while it is an important one  Christmas is more than a word  It is a belief in a power far greater than ourselves  It is a belief in the possibility of lives full of hope and fulfillment  It is a belief that each of us has a sacred obligation to care for one another and to help those in need    to lend a hand to the least of those in our midst  As the Bible teaches us  we should Love thy neighbor as thy self    But I m sad to report  that s not what we re seeing in Congress with this week  Today  we are debating two funding bills    the budget bill and the annual funding bill for labor  health and education  Both of these bills will make life harder for millions and millions of Americans in order to secure tax give aways for the wealthy     Some of these cuts will mean that the average millionaire will receive  32 000 next year  while the average middle class American will receive  29    To pay for these tax breaks  the Republican budget ignores American priorities in the areas of education  health  and job training  and takes money from the poor     For example  if the Republican funding bill before the Senate today is enacted three million disadvantaged children will not get smaller classes  better teachers or afterschool programs because funding under the No Child Left Behind program will be cut by  780 million  The first cut to education in a decade     At the same time  under the Republican budget  170 000 students each year will not have the opportunity to attend college as Pell Grants will be frozen for the fourth year in a row  despite tuition rising 46  at four year public colleges since 2001    Jobs will go unfilled across the country  because workers will not have the training they need  In my state  over 70 000 jobs are vacant  yet Massachusetts will receive millions less for training programs to help fill these jobs and put America back to work     Americans will continue to be vulnerable to the threat of avian flu  without the funds needed to prepare for a pandemic      Shockingly  the Republican leadership has rejected the  8 billion amendment that Senator Harkin offered and the Senate approved to enhance vaccine production  stockpile flu medicine  accelerate research  and take other measures needed to prepare for the growing threat    The proposed NIH budget will be woefully inadequate to maintain our tradition of research excellence and breakthrough medical science  This is the smallest percentage increase to the NIH budget since 1970 and the research and development budget fails to keep up with inflation  These budget cuts will mean that four of five innovative new ideas will be ignored  Over 500 new research grants will fall by the wayside     There are 45 million Americans who lack health insurance  but the House Republican budget bill would increase costs and cut health benefits to millions of low income families slashing Medicaid funding by  12 billion over the next five years  and  48 billion over 10 years    Under this Administration  the number of uninsured has already risen to historic levels  But the House bill will add to their ranks  with as many as 2 million poor families dropped from the Medicaid program because they can t afford to pay  Another 5 million people    half of them children    will see their health benefits cut    For those who face hunger this Christmas season  these proposals add to their pain by cutting food stamps by  700 million  denying assistance to a quarter of a million poor people    And it makes life worse for poor children who rely on child support to survive  The House Republican bill greatly weakens enforcement efforts to make dead beat dads live up to their responsibilities and provide for their children  Under the Republican plan  nearly  8 billion will be lost in child support payments over the next five years     24 billion in child support payments will go uncollected over the next ten years     These are the nation s poor children  They are vulnerable and in need  But the Republican plan would abandon them this Christmas    The Republican budget proposals will cause many families to choose between putting food on the table and keeping warm this winter    In Massachusetts  the LIHEAP program serves 134 000 needy families  Patsy Lewis  the Executive Director of the Worcester Community Action Council  reports that    for the families receiving LIHEAP aid    the maximum benefit for a family under current funding levels is only  765 for the heating season  for a household at the poverty level  This is enough for only one tank of oil  It takes at least two to four tanks to make it through the winter    These efforts are all done so that tax breaks can be given to the wealthiest Americans      That is why today  under Senator Harkin s leadership  we are asking our colleagues to reject the appropriations bill    a bill that fails American students seeking a better education  fails American families seeking protection from a pandemic flu and fails American workers seeking the training they need to succeed     That s why Democrats are demanding during this holiday season that we meet our obligations to our families and to those who have fallen on hard times    That s why we offer the Senate the chance to vote on motions to    o Reject cuts to Medicaid so that families can keep their health coverage     o Reject cuts to food stamps at a time when child hunger is increasing    o Reject cuts to child support at a time when single mothers are having difficulty making ends meet  and   o Insist on a real increase for LIHEAP so families can keep their children safe and warm this winter    That is why I will ask the Senate to insist that we do more to ensure that all American students seeking a college education have the assistance they need to do so     Under Chairman Enzi s leadership  the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions reduced the excessive profits of banks and lenders and redirected those funds to help students afford the cost of college    My motion instructs the conferees to retain those provisions in negotiations with the House  and to reject the provisions by House Republicans that would increase costs for students     We have learned from history that education is the key to keeping America strong  secure  and competitive  Now more than ever we must embrace and invest in education to advance America in the years ahead    This requires a commitment to ensuring educational opportunity for all    especially for our talented youth who have so much potential  but need help affording a college degree    In the Senate bill  we took a step in the right direction  The bill includes over  8 billion in new need based aid which will mean a long overdue increase in Pell grants for 5 million students     The provision will increase the maximum grant for Pell eligible students from  4 050 to  4 500 immediately  It also offers an additional  1 500 in grants for the neediest students who study math and science  in order to reduce the critical shortage of graduates in these fields    In Massachusetts  nearly 80 000 students received Pell grants last year  Under the Senate provision   120 million in additional aid will be available for Massachusetts students over the next 5 years    We know that education is the great equalizer  Young men and women willing to work hard in school should be able to go to college    But the cost of even public college tuition and fees has skyrocketed in recent years and the Pell grant has not kept pace  Under current law  this will be the fourth year in a row that the maximum Pell grant has not increased even by a penny     For countless families  the gap is too great  and college is out of reach  Over 400 000 talented  qualified students each year can t go to a 4 year college because they can t afford it  170 000 do not attend college at all  That s unacceptable    Take the case of Carli  from Hampton  New Hampshire  She s a junior at a public college in the state  and she already has  25 000 of debt  She relies on her Pell grant  but even with that aid  she has to work 20 hours a week during the school year and 40 hours a week in the summer    She writes  This is not a question of not working hard enough  It has been an uphill battle to put myself through school  I am happy to do it  but I just want to know that when I m through  there is a place for me in the American Dream too    Becky  from Holyoke  Massachusetts is a junior in college and is already in  24 000 of debt  She s alarmed at how high it will be when she graduates  especially if she loses her Pell grant aid on top of increasing tuition    She writes  We students are the future of the USA  By putting us at risk and in a financial crisis  Bush and his cronies are putting the future of the USA at risk    More than half of the students who receive Pell grants are working adults  independent students with a median income of  12 700  who are struggling to support themselves and in many cases their families while they attend college  Their numbers are growing because they know better education means better jobs  better wages and a better life for their families    The House bill moves in the opposite direction for these students  It actually increases costs for students by imposing new fees  taking away existing student benefits  and subjecting students to higher interest rates  At a time when college is more important than ever  and fewer and fewer talented young people can afford it  it s an outrage for Congress to even consider imposing higher barriers to a college degree    I urge my colleagues to join me in sending a strong message to the conferees that students need help now     Kennedy Motion to Instruct Conferees on Student Aid   Summary  The Kennedy motion to instruct instructs conferees to retain the Senate provisions providing new need based student aid and reject the House provisions that impose new fees and costs on students    Senate Bill Helps Students with New Need Based Aid      The Senate bill provides more than  8 billion over the next 5 years in new aid for Pell eligible students  o The bill includes  6 billion to increase aid for 5 3 million students who receive Pell grants  o The funding will increase the maximum annual grant for the neediest students  4 050 to  4 500 immediately  o It also includes  2 billion to reduce the critical shortage of graduates in math and science  o Through this new grant program  Pell eligible juniors and seniors who choose to study math and science will be eligible for an additional  1 500 grant per year    In Contrast  House Bill Imposes New Costs on Students     The House bill raises interest rate caps to 8 25   At that rate  the typical borrower would pay as much as  2 600 more on loans    It raises origination fees on Direct Loans in the short term  which will cost the typical borrower  400    The House bill imposes a new 1  fee on all students who consolidate their loans    It jeopardizes billions of dollars in funding currently dedicated to administering student aid programs    A College Degree is More Important Now than Ever     A college degree significantly increases lifetime earning potential  Full time male workers with a college degree in 1972 earned 22  more than their peers with only a high school diploma  in 2002 a college degree meant earning 65  more than a peer with only a high school diploma    For women working full time that difference is even greater  In 1972 the earning differential for women with college degrees compared to their peers with high school diplomas was 42   in 2002 that differential grew to 71     Education makes a difference over the course of a lifetime  Poverty rates for adults with even some college are 2 3 lower than adults who have just a high school diploma and unemployment rates are 50  lower     LABOR HHS APPROPRIATIONS BILL  AMERICANS DESERVE BETTER   Education     Smallest increase in Head Start funding since 1986  o Head Start will increase only  11 million  leaving over 750 000 eligible preschool children without services  o In Massachusetts  15 000 eligible children will not be served      Even Start funding is slashed by more than half  from  225 million to  99 million  o Over 30 250 children will be dropped from the program      As requirements under the No Child Left Behind Act are more demanding than ever  the Republican proposed bill cuts  780 million in funds for these programs       Title I funding for disadvantaged students  the law s key program  is  9 9 billion lower than the amount promised in the law  o Nationally  3 1 million children would be left behind  o Over 52 000 Massachusetts children would be left behind  o If enacted  Massachusetts schools would see cuts of over  4 million in Title I funding       Includes no new funding for after school programs   o Funding in the bill   991 million  is less than half the amount promised under NCLB   o At this funding level  1 65 million children would be left out of afterschool programs      Cuts funding to keep our schools safe and drug free    o Funding for Massachusetts schools will be cut from  6 1 million to  4 9 million      Minimal increases in math and science funding while our students fall farther and farther behind   o The bill increases funding for Math and Science Partnerships by only  5 million       Pell Grants are frozen for the fourth year in a row   o The maximum Pell grant remains at  4 050 despite tuition rising 45  at four year public colleges since 2001     Labor     Job training programs cut     o The bill cuts funding for adult and youth training programs by more than  60 million  This would mean a cut of  3 million in Massachusetts       Funding cuts for Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services  even in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and with 8 million Americans unemployed      This bill prohibits OSHA from enforcing respiratory safety standards to protect health care workers from deadly infectious diseases      Workplace safety programs failed to receive adequate funding as workplace deaths rise    Health     NIH received the lowest funding in 35 years       8 billion dollars needed to prepare the U S  for an avian flu outbreak was cut  leaving Americans unprepared    TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST      Ironically    and sadly    these cuts to the budget come as Republicans will try this week to secure over  90 billion in new tax breaks for the wealthiest       Bush and House Republicans want a  90 billion package that will extend the president s dividend and capital gains tax cuts for investors   The Senate Republicans approved a  58 billion alternative  without Bush s priority of extending capital gains and dividend cuts past their 2008 expiration date        According to the Tax Policy Center  the capital gains and dividend tax cuts in the House Republican bill alone will save the average millionaire over  32 000 per year   above and beyond the enormous cuts they ve gotten already from this Administration       Most of the benefits of this extension would flow to taxpayers who make more than  1 million per year  which the New York Times calls morally reprehensible at a time when so much is being cut from domestic programs       Estimates based on data from the Urban Institute    Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center show that if all of the Bush tax cuts are made permanent  the richest 1  of taxpayers will receive an average tax benefit of  58 200 each year  This represents a 7 3  change in their after tax income  By contrast  middle income taxpayers will receive an average annual tax cut of just  655  This would represent only a 2 5  change in their after tax income      The Bush tax cuts already enacted cost nearly two trillion dollars  plus additional interest on the higher national debt        On top of those tax cuts already in place  the President is proposing another  1 5 trillion dollars of extended tax cuts between FY 2006 and 2015  with another  300 billion in additional interest   Even this understates the real cost of making the tax cuts permanent  because nearly all the cost occurs in the five years after 2010  Thus  the real ten year cost  FY 2011    2020  would be nearly  3 0 trillion dollars       In January 2002  Senator Kennedy was the first major Democratic official to call for a rollback of those Bush tax cuts that benefited only wealthy taxpayers  specifically    1  restoring the rates of the top three brackets    39 6   36   and 31  to their 2001 levels    2  maintaining the partial phase out of exemptions and deductions for high income taxpayers contained in the 2001 tax code    3  maintaining the estate tax on estates over  3 5 million   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
