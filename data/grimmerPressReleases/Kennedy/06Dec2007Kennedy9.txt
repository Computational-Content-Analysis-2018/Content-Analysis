         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senators Edward M  Kennedy and Carl Levin released the following statement in response to the United States House of Representatives failure to vote on the Conference Report of the Defense bill  due to the hate crimes provision being included  Senator Kennedy is the author of the hate crimes legislation that was passed in the Senate  and Senator Levin is the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee      We are deeply disappointed that the House has decided not even to have a vote on the Conference Report on the Defense bill if it contains the hate crimes provision  With this decision  we ve lost the best opportunity to enact hate crimes legislation in this Congress  This provision was adopted by the Senate with a vote of 60 39 during debate on the bill      The inclusion of the hate crimes provision in the Defense bill was appropriate  Our military stands for America s ideals and fights for America s ideals  At a time when our ideals are under attack by terrorists in other lands  it is more important than ever to demonstrate that we practice what we preach  and that we are doing all we can to root out the bigotry and prejudice in our own country that leads to similar violence here at home  Now more than ever  we need to send a strong message here at home and around the world that we will strengthen our laws against hate crimes      The hate crimes bill would have advanced those values and goals  and we re committed to getting it enacted  It s long past time for this measure to become law          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
