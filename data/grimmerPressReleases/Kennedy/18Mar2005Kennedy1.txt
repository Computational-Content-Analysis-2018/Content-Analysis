         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I welcome GAO s recommendations on Head Start  We need to be sure that it provides the best possible services to needy children and their families    It would be a huge mistake  however  for the Administration or Congress to misuse this report as a pretext for changes that would undermine the program  As numerous reports make clear  the majority of local Head Start programs are operating effectively  We should focus on identifying and delivering specific extra help to the local programs that need the most improvement     Head Start today offers a balanced range of services to young children that includes educational and social development  visits to doctors and dentists  and immunization against childhood diseases  and we should strive to improve them  The last thing we need is a switch to block grants that would turn these indispensable services into slow start or no start for millions of children who are getting a head start today   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
