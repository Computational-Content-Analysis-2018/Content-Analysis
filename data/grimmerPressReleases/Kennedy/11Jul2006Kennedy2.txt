         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Almost five years ago  the Administration set off on a disastrous course that has made America less secure at home and more hated in the world   It failed to recognize that Americas strength and even our security depend on respect for the rule of law and the founding principles of the Constitution   And it found a Republican Congress all too willing to rubber stamp its arrogance   Finally  in no uncertain terms two weeks ago  the Supreme Court delivered a well deserved rebuke for the Administrations abuses at Guantanamo    The tribunals and commissions at Guantanamo are fundamentally unfair and do not give the detainees a genuine opportunity to have the validity of their detention decided   Weve locked people away for years  without creating an adequate process to distinguish who belongs in detention and who should be released   Detainees have been held for year after year under inhumane conditions  and weve failed to provide an effective way to determine whether theyre guilty of anything   Those the Administration sought to convict of particular offenses were subjected to trial by kangaroo courts that the Supreme Court rightly rejected as an unconstitutional abuse of power   The Administration sought to create a place that was literally beyond the law  beyond judicial review  beyond the Geneva Conventions  beyond our sense of right and wrong     Perhaps now  endless detention without safeguards will finally be corrected  We can end the abuses but it will be far more difficult to restore our reputation in the world   The use of torture at Abu Ghraib and the operation of secret prisons have cost us dearly in loss of international respect  All of us are proud of the courage and commitment of the men and women of our armed forces  But they tell us that the abuses and torture we have committed are making their mission far more difficult to accomplish    The United States should treat detainees as we would want captured Americans to be treated   Yet  over the past five years  the Administration has taken us down a different path  violating the well established checks and balances of the Constitution   On June 29th  in Hamdan v  Rumsfeld  the Supreme Court said the President had gone too far  As Justice Breyer wrote Congress has not issued the executive a blank check       The Courts decision is a victory for the rule of law  Following this landmark decision  we have the opportunity to shed more light into the legal black hole at Guantanamo Bay  But  at the outset  we should make a few things clear   The decision is not a get out of Guantanamo free card for any of the detainees   No one suggests that any person engaging in terrorism should not be held accountable as a result of this decision     The Supreme Court made it clear that the President can prosecute terrorists   The President already has all the necessary authority to proceed with trials of war criminals if he does it in accord with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions     But instead of using that well established authority to prosecute detainees quickly and fairly  the Administration created a system of ad hoc military commissions that led to extended litigation and the Supreme Courts ruling   As a result  more than 4 years later we have not yet successfully prosecuted a single detainee  and Guantanamo has become an international embarrassment    Under traditional laws of war  POWs may be held until the end of the conflict  Certainly none of us wants to impose a standard that would free dangerous detainees to return to acts of terror  That will be one of the major challenges we face as we move forward          The path ahead will speak volumes about our dedication to the rule of law and the Constitution  and it will have significant consequences for our national security   If our future actions are consistent with our nations long held values  then perhaps this outrageous chapter will finally come to an end     As we deliberate about these serious matters  we should take heed of the courageous words of Alberto Mora  the former Navy General Counsel   He urged us to care about the fate of these detainees because a tolerance of cruelty will corrode our values and our rights and degrade the world in which we live   It will corrupt our heritage  cheapen the valor of the soldiers upon whose past and present sacrifices our freedoms depend  and debase the legacy we will leave to our sons and daughters    Congress should work with the Administration to ensure a realistic process for treating detainees that meets the requirements of the rule of law    As Justice Kennedy wrote in his concurring opinion in Hamdan  a case that may be of extraordinary importance is resolved by ordinary rules   There is no question that the treatment of terrorists is of extraordinary importance  and the obvious starting point is the ordinary rules of our long standing military justice system     I welcome this hearing as an opportunity to consider how we should move forward  and what we in Congress can do to make sure that there is accountability and swift justice for terrorists   I commend the Chairman for calling this hearing   Its a step forward for Congress to reclaim its constitutional responsibilities and to assert greater Congressional oversight over these serious matters          Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
