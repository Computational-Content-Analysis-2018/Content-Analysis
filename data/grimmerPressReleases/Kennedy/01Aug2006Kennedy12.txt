         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner August 1  2006                                       202  224 2633    GAO REPORT ON WORKERS LACKING CRITICAL PROTECTIONS INCLUDED   Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy spoke out against the nomination of Paul DeCamp as Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division at the Department of Labor and released a new GAO report finding millions of workers are currently lacking key workplace protections    Mr  DeCamp  an attorney who has represented Wal Mart  has a long and troubling record on workers rights  DeCamp has proposed overtime rollbacks for millions of workers  and has expressed his view that most claims for unpaid overtime are spurious   He now serves in a temporary position at the Department of Labor where he has been heavily involved in the Departments disastrous failure to protect workers from abuses of wage laws and overtime protections in the Gulf Coast region   Choosing Mr  DeCamp to enforce laws he doesnt believe in and protections he doesnt support seems to be a flagrant example of the fox guarding the henhouse   The safeguards of our nations wage and hour laws protect employees basic rights  Senator Kennedy said   We need strong leadership at the Wage and Hour division to make these rights a reality for all Americans      On DeCamps work related to the Gulf Coast Kennedy added    He has been deeply involved in the Departments abysmal failure to protect the rights of workers in the Gulf Coast   Senator Kennedy said  An alarming number of those men and women are not being paid at all for their work  or are not being paid the wages required by law  or are being forced to work overtime without overtime pay   Yet the Department of Labor is AWOL from the region  and has made it almost impossible for workers to file claims when their rights are violated      If confirmed  DeCamp would be responsible for enforcing critical worker protections such as minimum wage  overtime pay  and the child labor protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act   Senator Kennedy strongly believes that he is the wrong person for the job     Senator Kennedy also released a GAO report revealing a significant portion of the American workforce lacks critical workplace protections because they are classified as contingent workers with fewer rights   Currently  42 6 million workers are classified as contingent workers where they are less likely to have health insurance or pension benefits and are often not covered by key workplace protection laws    In response to the GAO report  Senator Kennedy said  I am deeply disturbed by the findings of this report  which reveal the Bush Administrations cavalier approach to protecting workers rights   The misclassification of employees as independent contractors is a serious problem that cheats workers out of hard earned pay and threatens their health and safety   The Department of Labor must do much more to educate workers about their rights  and it must undertake vigilant enforcement efforts to detect and remedy worker misclassification    A summary of the report follows Senator Kennedys statement    Below is his prepared statement     STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON NOMINATION OF PAUL DeCAMP   AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY   Today we also have the opportunity to consider another important nomination  that of Paul DeCamp to be Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division at the Department of Labor   This vital position is charged with enforcing many of our most critical worker protections  including the minimum wage  overtime pay  the child labor protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act  the leave requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act  and the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis Bacon Act and the Service Contract Act     The actions of the Wage and Hour Administrator affect the lives of every worker in America   He ensures that men and women who work overtime will be able to rely on overtime pay to make ends meet   He protects working teenagers from being forced to use dangerous equipment that could threaten their health or safety   He ensures that parents who need to care for sick children can meet their family needs and still return to their jobs   He defends vulnerable employees such as migrant workers and day laborers when they are exploited by unscrupulous employers     Unfortunately  the Bush Administration has shown a troubling lack of commitment to protecting workers rights in these areas   They have adopted regulations that could deny overtime rights from as many as 6 million workers   Theyve made sweetheart deals that let repeat offenders like Wal Mart off the hook for violating child labor laws year after year   Theyve refused to raise the minimum wage for hardworking people living below the poverty line   Theyve failed to protect the rights of the hard working men and women rebuilding the Gulf Coast   The nomination of Mr  DeCamp raises troubling questions   His record clearly demonstrates that he does not have the commitment to workers rights that is necessary to fulfill the goals of these important laws   His extensive record of publications shows that he does not support the goals of the statutes he will be responsible for enforcing   Hes advocated changes in current law to drastically reduce the number of employees entitled to overtime pay  and hes suggested that those who work overtime but are denied overtime pay by their employers do not deserve the remedies these laws provide   His record in private practice is equally disturbing   He has a long history of representing employers with strong anti labor agendas   His ties to Wal Mart  one of the industrys most notorious  offending employers  calls into question whether he can carry out his responsibilities with the perspective necessary to protect the rights of workers       Since joining the Department of Labor in an advisory capacity last year  he has been deeply involved in the Departments abysmal failure to protect the rights of workers in the Gulf Coast   An alarming number of those men and women are not being paid at all for their work  or are not being paid the wages required by law  or are being forced to work overtime without overtime pay   Yet the Department of Labor is AWOL from the region  and has made it almost impossible for workers to file claims when their rights are violated      Choosing Mr  DeCamp to enforce laws he doesnt believe in and protections he doesnt support seems to be a flagrant example of the fox guarding the henhouse   The safeguards of our nations wage and hour laws protect employees basic rights   Hardworking men and women have a right to a fair days pay for a fair days work   They have a right to overtime pay if the law provides it  They have a right to keep their jobs if they become ill or have to care for a sick family member   We need strong leadership at the Wage and Hour Division to make these rights a reality for all Americans       Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for this hearing and I look forward to the testimony of our nominees   SENATOR KENNEDY RELEASES NEW GAO REPORT   CONTINGENT WORKERS LOSE CRITICAL WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS   A Government Accountability Office report released today by Senator Edward M  Kennedy reveals that a significant portion of the American workforce lacks critical workplace protections because they are classified as contingent workers and do not receive the same rights as other employees     The report  entitled Employment Arrangements   Improved Outreach Could Help Ensure Proper Worker Classification  finds that about 42 6 million U S  workers are currently employed in contingent work arrangements  where they do not receive the benefits of the traditional employment relationship   These workers are far less likely to have health insurance or pension benefits  and they are often not covered by key workplace protection laws like antidiscrimination laws  overtime and minimum wage laws  or workplace health and safety laws       Only 13 percent of contingent workers receive healthcare through their workplace  compared to 73 percent of regular full time workers      Only 38 percent of contingent workers receive pensions  compared to 76 percent of other full time workers     The report further finds that too many employers are intentionally misclassifying their workers as independent contractors  As a result of such misclassification  an employee who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year for the same employer  follows that employers instructions  and receives their paycheck from that employer can be denied basic benefits and basic rights  like the right to family and medical leave or the right to be free from discrimination  because their employer is engaging in legal trickery        A class action lawsuit is currently pending against Wal Mart Stores alleging that the retail giant misclassified thousands of janitorial workers as independent contractors and refused to pay them minimum wages or overtime pay to which they were lawfully entitled   Wal Mart is alleging that these workers are independent contractors despite the fact that the store had the power to hire and fire them  controlled their wages  hours and working conditions  and directed them in the day to day tasks of their work   Such misclassification cheats these workers out of protections they lawfully deserve and have rightfully earned  while cheating the government out of needed tax revenues       According to the most recent data from the Internal Revenue Service  15 percent of employers have misclassified employees as independent contractors      These misclassifications result in a loss to the federal government of about  2 7 billion per year in tax revenue  Unfortunately the Department of Labors efforts to detect and prevent these abuses are seriously deficient  and workers are left without the assistance they need to protect their rights   The Department is not undertaking any effort to detect employee misclassification   And while the Department relies on workers to report violations of the law  it is not even attempting to educate workers about their rights         The Departments standard poster informing workers about their rights in the workplace does not contain any information on employee misclassification  or inform employees how to register a complaint that they have been misclassified        While the Departments procedures require officials to share information with other federal and state agencies when they uncover a misclassification problem that may violate other laws  such as tax laws or unemployment insurance laws  the GAO found that the Department does not consistently follow this directive   In response to the GAO report  Senator Kennedy said  I am deeply disturbed by the findings of this report  which reveal the Bush Administrations cavalier approach to protecting workers rights   The misclassification of employees as independent contractors is a serious problem that cheats workers out of hard earned pay and threatens their health and safety   The Department of Labor must do much more to educate workers about their rights  and it must undertake vigilant enforcement efforts to detect and remedy worker misclassification
