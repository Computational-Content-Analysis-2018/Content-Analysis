         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The President seems to be saying full speed ahead for our current failed policy in Iraq  when it is abundantly clear that staying the course is the wrong course for America  It s time for the President to admit mistakes  talk with candor and honesty  and outline a winning strategy for Iraq     The Administration s policy has made Iraq a breeding ground for terrorism  which it was not before the war and the American people know it  His policy has isolated America in the world  created more recruits for Al Qaeda  and made it harder    not easier    to win the war on terror     It also seems foolish for the president to brag openly about disrupting Al Qaeda plots to attack us  His bring it on attitude hasn t worked  and such statements can only goad Al Qaeda into trying harder    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
