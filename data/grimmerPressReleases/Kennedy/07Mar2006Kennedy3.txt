         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today s Senate action adding  1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program for this winter was a step in the right direction  It was the best we could do  and it deserved to pass  But no one should be under the illusion that we ve now provided adequate assistance to millions of struggling families around the country  many of whom are elderly and disabled  The additional  1 billion is less than half what is needed to fully fund LIHEAP and guarantee the assistance these families need and deserve  A small step is better than no step  but it s still far from meeting the obvious need  Countless citizens in communities throughout America live year round in constant fear of power shut offs because they can t pay their energy bills  and they have no confidence that either Congress or the President is on their side  According to a report by the National Energy Assistance Directors  Association  since the winter of 2001 2002  the average yearly cost of heating oil has soared from  627 to  1474  natural gas from  465 to  1000 and propane from  736 to  1286  Yet  the Republican Congress and the Bush Administration continue to ignore the fact that millions of Americans can t afford these steep increases  Democrats have pressed for months to fund LIHEAP at the authorized level of  5 1 billion for the current fiscal year  We ve urged Congress to act  but the Republican majority has blocked our efforts at every turn  and they continued to try to block our efforts to obtain an additional  1 billion for the program today  Families are paying a steep price for this neglect  The average LIHEAP grant has decreased by almost 10 percent since 2002  and is now only  288 In Massachusetts  the state government has provided  20 million in additional funds for LIHEAP this year Low income families are more fortunate in our state than in most other states on this issue  but we have exhausted all federal funds  and need is still great  Even the poorest households with the highest bills will get no more than  840  less than half what is needed to get through the winter As Self Help  a community action program in Avon  Massachusetts states  Many of our clients have exhausted their benefits   The bottom line is that we need some kind of relief  as quickly as possible  ABCD  a community action agency in Boston  reports that as of January 17th  the number of applicants applying for fuel assistance for the first time increased by 26 percent  Its clients are currently exhausting all of their fuel assistance benefits  Even a benefit of  765 buys only one tank of oil at today s price of  2 40 per gallon  when at least two or three tankfuls are needed to get through the winter  and no other source of funding is available  These aren t just numbers  They represent real people facing real hardships  For example  an elderly couple lives in a modest home on the outskirts of Haverhill and both receive social security benefits  Their home is heated with oil and they use an old woodstove in the basement to supplement their steam boiler  Their  525 LIHEAP grant covered one delivery of 256 gallons of oil in late November  Attempting to cut wood for the woodstove  the husband fell from a ladder and was injured  If LIHEAP had been funded fairly  his injury could have been prevented  With this bill  the chances are 50 50 that his injury could have been prevented  We could have done better  and we should have done better  It s wrong to let people like this suffer   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
