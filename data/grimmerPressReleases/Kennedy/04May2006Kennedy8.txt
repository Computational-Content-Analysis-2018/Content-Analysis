         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C  Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Senators Tom Harkin and Dianne Feinstein  D CA  called upon Majority Leader Bill Frist to immediately take up the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  H R  810  in the Senate for a vote  The legislationdesigned to expand federal funding for stem cell researchpassed the House of Representatives with a broad bipartisan majority on May 24  2005  Despite bipartisan support for the measure in the Senate  the bill has never been allowed to come to the floor for a vote  The Senators released a letter signed by over 40 members of the Democratic caucus urging Frist to bring the bill up during his Health Week next week The dreams of millions of patients for a better life have been denied by the Bush Administration s needless restrictions on stem cell research  Senator Kennedy said  We call on the Senate leadership  in the name of the millions of patients who cannot be here to speak for themselves  to schedule a vote on the House passed bill on stem cell research  We re here today to say  The time for delay is over The bipartisan Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act would allow federal funding for stem cell research using stem cell lines derived under strict ethical requirements from excess in vitro fertilization embryos  regardless of the date they were derived Below is the text of the letter signed by over 40 Democrats as well as Senator Kennedy s prepared remarks at the press event and his prepared floor remarks delivered today REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY STEM CELL PRESS CONFERENCE  As prepared for delivery  MAY 4  2006It s an honor to join my Senate colleagues  and I commend their leadership on this very important issue of medical research America is a nation founded on hope and the constant quest for a better tomorrow Scientific discovery has always been a central part of that quest  Scientific miracles have improved countless lives over the years  and it makes no sense to erect ideological roadblocks to the miracles of the future In this new century  the new frontier of discovery is the life sciences  and no aspect of those sciences has greater promise than stem cell research  Physicians can use stem cells to find new ways to deliver insulin to patients with diabetes  new methods to calm the tremors of Parkinson s Disease  and new therapies to reverse the paralysis of spinal injury But the dreams of millions of patients for a better life have been denied by the Bush Administration s needless restrictions on stem cell research In a triumph of principle over politics  the House of Representatives rejected those restrictions  and voted to approve bipartisan legislation to free this research from the shackles of ideology That vote was almost a year ago  on May 24  2005 The bill would have passed by a wide margin if put to a vote in the Senate  but the Senate leadership refused to allow a vote  They found time for tax breaks for the wealthy and for all kinds of favors for special interests at the expense of working families  But month after month  in all those hours of debate  they couldn t find a way to bring hope and help to the millions of patients and their families who could benefit from this highly promising research We re here today to say  The time for delay is over We call on the Senate leadership  in the name of the millions of patients who cannot be here to speak for themselves  to schedule a vote on the House passed bill on stem cell research  The Senate is about to have a Health Week  It would be a travesty to let that week go by without a vote on stem cell research We appeal to the humanitarian side of the Republican Senate leader  surely he understands the basic principle  First  do no harm  We say  Dr  Frist  let us vote on stem cell research May 4  2006The Honorable William Frist  M D  Majority Leader United States Senate Washington  DC 20510Dear Dr  Frist Nearly a year ago  the House of Representatives approved important legislation to end the restrictions that have kept stem cell research from fulfilling its potential to save lives and alleviate suffering  We understand that you are planning a week of Senate debate on legislation related to health  We urge you to bring the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005  H R  810  to the Senate floor for consideration during this Health Week Stem cell research has vast potential for curing diseases and saving lives  We know you recognize the enormous potential of this research for discovering new cures and therapies for diseases such as diabetes  Parkinson s disease and spinal cord injuries  and we commend the strong support you have expressed for approval of the Housepassed bill  By allowing H R  810 to be brought to a vote  you can bring hope and help to millions of American patients and families suffering from these and other serious illnesses The House passed H R  810 in May 2005   yet the Senate has failed to take action for nearly a year  Further delay will mean more lost opportunities for new cures and new treatments  The Senate should not mark the anniversary of the House vote with action not more inaction  We therefore urge you to bring H R  810 to the Senate floor for debate and a vote during Health Week  Millions of patients and their families across the nation cannot afford to wait any longer for enactment of this urgently needed legislation Sincerely Harry Reid Tom Harkin Dianne Feinstein Ted

Senate floor to speak briefly about stem cell research and the hope it holds for millions of Americans in the years ahead Hope is one of the qualities of spirit that make us human  Hope allows us to dream of a better life for our children  our community  and our world    especially for loved ones now suffering or in pain Hope is what stem cell research holds for the parents of children with diabetes  who dream of a day when their constant fears for their children s well being are things of the past Hope is what stem cell research brings to those with Parkinson s Disease  who think of the time when the tremors of that disease are banished forever Hope is what stem cell research brings to millions of Americans who seek better treatments and better drugs for cancer  diabetes  spinal injury  and many other serious conditions Hope cannot be extinguished or destroyed    but it can be frozen  And it has now been frozen for five long years    ever since President Bush shut down the stem cell research program begun in the Clinton Administration  and imposed arbitrary and unwarranted restrictions on this life saving research  based on ideology  instead of science For five years  we have watched as America has abdicated its global leadership in this important new field  by keeping our best scientists on the sidelines In those five years  we ve squandered the opportunity to set strong ethical guidelines for this research through the oversight that NIH funding can bring  Through NIH  we have made progress consistent with our values in new fields of inquiry  such as recombinant DNA research  which once also seemed strange and controversial  We can do the same for stem cell research    but only if NIH is allowed to become a leader in this new field Hope soared anew a year ago  when the House of Representatives set aside partisan differences and courageously approved legislation to end those restrictions  and give our scientists the tools they need to make progress in the fight against disease The same strong bipartisan support exists in the Senate for ending the unwarranted restrictions on stem cell research There is no one in the Senate with stronger pro life credentials than Senator Hatch    but he knows that supporting stem cell research is the pro life position to take There is no greater supporter of medical research in the Senate than Senator Specter    and he feels strongly that stem cell research is one of the great breakthroughs of modern medicine There is no one with a greater depth of conscience than Senator Smith    and he has searched his heart and prayerfully decided that support for stem cell research is the moral choice Bipartisan legislation was passed by a vote of 238 to 194 in the House of Representatives on May 24  2005  a year ago this month  It was ordered placed on the Senate calendar on June 6  where it has remained stalled ever since  If the House bill was put to a Senate vote today  or tomorrow  or next week  it would pass by a solid bipartisan majority in the Senate too Why  Because the Republican Senate leadership stands in the way  Summer came and went with no action in the Senate  then the winter  then the spring  and now we are about to reach an anniversary none of us ever wanted to see  On May 24th  it will be one year since the House acted  and the Senate still refuses to act Let us vow that we will not mark this anniversary with yet more inaction and indifference The Senate has had a busy schedule    but in that schedule we have found time for all manner of giveaways to those who already have much in the way of wealth and power Now  it is time to turn our attention to those who need our help the most  And that includes the millions of Americans who have seen their hopes blocked by the Administration s cruel policies and the Senate s shameful inaction The Senate leadership has scheduled a Health Week for later this month  Will we use this opportunity to debate the flawed Medicare drug program  Or the searing number of the uninsured  Will we do what we need to do to unlock the vast potential of stem cell research  Sadly  the answer to each of these questions is probably no  These and many other major priorities for the nation will remain unaddressed I urge my colleagues to join me in asking the Senate leadership to schedule a vote on HR 810  the House passed stem cell research bill  during the coming Health Weekand to do so before May 24th  the first year anniversary of its approval by the House of Representatives Millions of patients and their families look with hope to stem cell research  and they should not have to tolerate any greater delay or any further failures      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
