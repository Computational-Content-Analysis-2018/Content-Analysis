         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington DC  Today at a press conference with bipartisan and bicameral sponsors of stem cell legislation  Senator Edward M  Kennedy urged the President to reconsider his veto threat and make a real difference in the lives of millions of Americans  The legislation passed the House of Representatives yesterday in a 238 to 194 vote with 50 Republicans breaking ranks with President Bush and top House leaders  The six original co sponsors  Senators Specter  Harkin  Hatch  Feinstein  Smith and Kennedy sent Senator Frist a letter yesterday asking that the House bill be brought up immediately for a vote  without amendment     This week  the American people are saying loud and clear that they want the President and Congress to focus on what really matters to them  Yesterday  the House of Representatives took a giant step toward unlocking the potential of lifesaving research  A bipartisan majority    from red states and blue states  from different faiths  and with divergent political views    all came together to recognize that the restrictions imposed by the Bush Administration are denying hope and new cure to millions of patients  Senator Kennedy said  The House voted for hope  for science  and for a true culture of life     The legislation would allow federal funding for stem cell research using stem cell lines derived under strict ethical requirements from excess in vitro fertilization embryos  regardless of the date they were derived    The legislation sets additional ethical requirements for stem cell lines to be eligible for funding  1  they are derived from embryos originally created for fertility treatment and were in excess of clinical need  2  it was determined that the embryos would never be implanted in a woman and would be discarded  and 3  the embryos were donated with the written informed consent of the individuals seeking fertility treatment without financial or other inducements    Below are Senator Kennedy s remarks   as prepared for delivery    Statement by Senator Edward M  Kennedy on Stem Cell Legislation      as prepared for delivery     This week  the American people are saying loud and clear that they want the President and Congress to focus on what really matters to them    They said they want mainstream judges on our courts    And they said they want to remove the barriers to responsible stem cell research so new hope can come to millions of sick and injured Americans    As yesterday s House vote amply demonstrates  there is broad bipartisan support for responsible embryonic stem cell research  It is supported in red states and blue states  by Republicans and Democrats  and by supporters and opponents of Roe v  Wade  This is because they see the lifesaving potential of this research  They believe that embryonic stem cells offer an unparalleled promise of life and hope for their family members and friends who are afflicted with diabetes  Alzheimer s  spinal cord injuries  Parkinson s Disease  and a host of other debilitating and often fatal conditions  They understand that  unlike stem cells obtained from adults or umbilical cords  embryonic stem cells provide the hope for treating and possibly curing virtually all diseases and conditions     In short  they believe that embryonic stem cells can promote a true culture of life by enabling fuller  longer lives for millions of our citizens    The real question is this  Are the White House and Congress listening  Will the Senate leadership bring up this lifesaving bill right away and will the President sign it    Few issues are more fundamental to the nation s families than life and good health  That is why this legislation on stem cell research is so important  We should be doing all we can to enable our nation s top scientists at the National Institutes of Health to explore the full potential of such cells to develop breakthrough new cures  Sadly  the Administration has severely restricted their research by limiting it to a small number of cells  all of which we now know are contaminated with material from mouse cells    Yesterday  the House of Representatives took a giant step toward unlocking the potential of this lifesaving research  A bipartisan majority recognized that the restrictions imposed by the Bush Administration are denying hope and new cures to millions of patients  The House voted for hope  for science  and for life    Legislation should be an expression of our best values and highest ethical standards  We believe that this legislation meets that test  But failure to pass this bill quickly could result in unethical actions by those who may abuse this promising research  instead of delivering its lifesaving potential to all who need it  Strong support by our government is the only way to assure that the highest ethical standards are followed and that lifesaving breakthroughs will be passed on to those who need them    Yesterday  President Bush appeared with joyous families who have adopted embryos and brought new children into the world  We all share in their joy and hope that even more families will pursue this wonderful possibility    But we must also acknowledge the reality that for every embryo adoption  there are thousands of embryos that are simply thrown away  They are not the result of a pregnancy  They are not the product of an abortion or a miscarriage  The only way they can become a baby is to be implanted in a woman  and these embryos that we propose to save for research have not been and will not be  We believe that it is better to save these embryos that would otherwise be destroyed so that they can give life     Instead of joining the House in approving this critical legislation  the Republican leadership in the Senate is refusing to give it an up or down vote  and the President has said he will veto it    We urge them to reconsider  We have an historic opportunity to make a very real difference in the lives of millions of Americans and to promote ethical research  Let s not deny hope to patients any longer  I urge my colleagues to support responsible stem cell research and the vast promise it holds for modern medicine and so many of our fellow citizens   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
