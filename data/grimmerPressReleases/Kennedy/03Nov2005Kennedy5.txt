         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy praised Secretary Spellings  decision regarding tutoring and supplemental services under the No Child Left Behind Act  The Department of Education will now allow the Boston Public Schools to continue on its course to provide quality tutoring and other help to its students  despite the Department s own rule under the No Child Left Behind Act that prohibits schools from being direct providers of these services to the students if the school district fails to meet district wide targets for academic achievement  Senator Kennedy has opposed the Department s NCLB regulation and introduced legislation in September of last year to correct the policy     Senator Kennedy said  I m pleased that Boston was granted this special consideration  This change will make an enormous difference to Boston s school children and parents seeking good tutors in school  and I commend Secretary Spellings for taking this action  If a high performing school in the district is ready and able to offer quality services to students struggling to meet standards  we should not stand in their way    Last school year  BPS served over half of all students that participated in supplemental services  1 173 out of a total of 2 190 children   The district s programs offered more hours of tutoring than did the private providers  92 hours versus 30 50 hours in private programs   Moreover  BPS programs served students at under half the price of those operated by the private companies  approximately  1 000 per student  versus  2 332 in the private sector     In 2002  the U S  Department of Education issued rules under the No Child Left Behind Act to prohibit all schools in a district from serving as tutoring providers under the law  if the school district fails to meet state targets for progress for two consecutive years  The No Child Left Behind Act requires states to select eligible tutoring providers and monitor programs for quality  and the law allows schools to act as tutoring providers  But under the Department s regulation  even a high performing school in a low performing district was barred from providing tutoring services    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
