         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Mr  President  this amendment is a much needed improvement to our nation s policy for the treatment of detainees     Nearly two years ago  American soldiers at Abu Ghraib  were struggling to figure out how to handle the hundreds of detainees that were pouring into that facility  They had no guidance  they had no regulations to regulate that treatment  And in the absence of that guidance  their treatment of detainees deteriorated into cruel  inhumane and degrading treatment     They documented their cruelty  and images of are still horrifying  An Iraqi prisoner in a dark hood and cape  standing on a cardboard box with electrodes attached to his body  Naked men forced to simulate sex acts on each other  The corpse of a man who had been beaten to death  lying in ice  next to soldiers smiling and giving a thumbs up sign  A pool of blood from the wounds of a naked  defenseless prisoner attacked by a military dog    The reports of widespread abuse by U S  personnel were initially met with disbelief  then incomprehension  But the reports are too numerous to ignore  We had reports of detainees in Afghanistan shackled to the floor  left out to the elements to freeze to death  We ve had reports of detainees in Guantanamo who were subjected to sexual humiliation    Human Rights Watch recently released a report based on the statements of three soldiers  one officer and two non commissioned officers  in the 82d Airborne who described how their battalions routinely used physical and mental torture as means of intelligence gathering and stress relief    torture as sport     They stand in sharp contrast to the values America has always stood forour belief in the dignity and worth of all peopleour unequivocal stance against torture and abuse    our commitment to the rule of law  The images horrified us and severely damaged our reputation in the Middle East and around the world    Instead of taking responsibility for what happened  the generals and senior administration officials tried to minimize the abuse as the work of a few bad applesall conveniently lower rank soldiersin a desperate effort to emphasize the role of senior military officials in exposing the scandal and insulate the civilian leadership from responsibility    It s clear what the results were   Captain Ian Fishback  a West Point Graduate  and officer in the 82nd Airborne  wrote    Despite my efforts  I have been unable to get clear  consistent answers from my leadership about what constitutes lawful and humane treatment of detainees  I am certain that this confusion contributed to a wide range of abuses including death threats  beatings  broken bones  murder  exposure to elements  extreme forced physical exertion  hostage taking  stripping  sleep deprivation and degrading treatment    For nearly two and a half years    from August 2002 until December 2004    the Executive Branch of our government operated under the assumption that it was not bound by the law that prohibits torture  The Office of Legal Counsel promulgated an official opinion stating that the President and everyone acting under his Commander in Chief authority was free to ignore this law  It states  Any effort to apply  the anti torture statute  in a manner that interferes with the       detention and interrogation of enemy combatants       would be unconstitutional  This opinion was adopted and implemented by the C I A  and the Department of Defense  Harold Koh    a leading scholar of international law and Dean of Yale Law School who served in both the Reagan and Clinton Administrations    called it the most clearly legally erroneous opinion he has ever read     Our political leaders made deliberate decisions to throw out the well established legal framework that has long made America the gold standard for human rights throughout the world  The Administration left our soldiers  case officers  and intelligence agents in a fog of ambiguity  They were told to take the gloves off without knowing what the limits were and the consequences were foreseeable    In rewriting our human rights laws  the Administration consistently overruled the objections of experienced military personnel and diplomats  As Secretary of State Colin Powell warned the White House  It will reverse over a century of U S  policy and practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine the protections of the law of war for our troops  Senior Defense officials were warned that changing the rules could lead to so called force drift  in which  without clearer guidance  the level of force applied to an uncooperative detainee might well result in torture    William Taft  the State Department Legal Advisor in President Bush s first term  recently called it a source of amazement and disappointment that the Justice Department severely limited the applicability of the Geneva Conventions to the detainees  In an address at American University  he said that the decision to do so unhinged those responsible for the treatment of the detainees       from the legal guidelines for interrogation       embodied in the Army Field Manual for decades  Set adrift in uncharted waters and under pressure from their leaders to develop information on the plans and practices of al Qaeda  it was predictable that those managing the interrogation would eventually go too far     The Judge Advocates General echoed the Mr  Taft s concerns  On July 14  2005  the JAGS appeared before the Senate Armed Service Committee s subcommittee on Personnel  In response to questioning by my friend  Senator Graham  the witnesses acknowledged that the Justice Department s policy embodied in the Bybee Torture Memorandum s definition of torture was a violation of international and domestic law and alarmed the judge advocate generals who reviewed it     Their alarm was well founded because their concerns were overruled by General Counsel William Haynes who issued the Defense Department s April 2003 Working Group Report  The report twisted and diluted the definition of torture  claimed that military personnel who commit torture may invoke the defenses of necessity and superior orders  and advised military personnel that they aren t obligated to comply with the federal prohibition on torture    Senator Graham himself accurately assessed the impact of the civilian authorities when he told the JAG officers at the hearing     I think it is fair to say that the Department of Defense was secondary to the Department of Justice in a political sense  and that was your problem  If they had listened to you from the onset  we wouldn t have a lot of the problems that we have deal with in the past    The President is not an emperor or a king  His Administration is not above the law or accountability and he is certainly not infallible     The single greatest criticism of this Administration s detention and interrogation policies is that it failed to respect history  the collective wisdom of our career military and State department officials  and that it holds far too expansive a view of Executive Authority  In short  the White House suffers from the arrogance of thinking they knew best and abandoning the long standing rules    I urge all of my colleagues to support Senator McCain s amendment  It will bring back the regularity  the predictability  and the sanity to our detention operations  It will protect our service men and women  and it will send a message to the world that  above all else  the United States respects the rule of law
