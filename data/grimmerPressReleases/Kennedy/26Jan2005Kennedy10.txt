         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON    Sen  Chuck Grassley  chairman of the Committee on Finance  and Sen  Edward Kennedy  ranking member of the Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  today re introduced their bipartisan legislation to help children with disabilities and their families  The senators won Senate approval of this long time priority measure last May  but negotiations with the House to find a budgetary offset broke down  and the bill never received final approval  Medicaid works well for a lot of people  Grassley said  The problem is some families fall through the cracks  Many parents of disabled children have to drop out of the workforce or keep themselves in a low paying job just to remain eligible for Medicaid  In effect  the government is forcing parents to choose between near poverty and their children s health care  We need to fix that  We came close last year  but time ran out  I hope we ll succeed in this Congress Kennedy said  The Family Opportunity Act may be the most important legislation we pass this Congress  It will close the health care gap for the nation s most vulnerable children  and enable families of disabled children to be equal partners in the American dream The Family Opportunity Act allows states to create options for families with disabled children to buy into Medicaid while continuing to work  Parents would pay for Medicaid coverage on a sliding scale  Medicaid is critical to the well being of children with multiple medical needs because it covers many services that these children need  including physical therapy and medical equipment  the senators said  Private health plans often are much more limited in what they cover  And many parents can t afford needed services or multiple co payments out of pocket Grassley and Kennedy said the Family Opportunity Act is pro work because it lets parents work without losing their children s health coverage  pro family because it encourages parents to work and build a better life for their children  and it s pro taxpayer because it means more parents continue to earn money  pay taxes and pay their own way for Medicaid coverage for their children Parents want to provide the best they can for their children  Grassley said  Congress should give states the flexibility to give families options without the federal government getting in the way Kennedy said  These families deserve better     continuing to force families into poverty or having families give up their disabled children to secure health care is a tragedy we have an obligation to prevent  Medicaid is a medical assistance program jointly financed by the federal government and state governments for eligible low income individuals  It also covers health care expenses for the needy elderly  the blind and the disabled receiving cash assistance under the Supplemental Security Income Program The Family Opportunity Act has attracted widespread bipartisan support in each Congress since Grassley and Kennedy authored it in 1999  with co sponsors numbering 70 or more  A House version of the measure sponsored by Reps  Pete Sessions and Henry Waxman also enjoyed strong support with more than 235 cosponsors  The Senate Finance Committee first approved the measure in 2002  on a voice vote  without controversy  The full Senate first passed the Family Opportunity Act in May 2004   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633
