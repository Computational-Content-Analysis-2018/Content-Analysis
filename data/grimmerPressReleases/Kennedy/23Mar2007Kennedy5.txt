         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      REPORT AVAILABLE AT www help senate gov   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Congressman George Miller addressed the  flawed implementation of the Reading First program and the urgent need to end  the Department of Educations track record of bias and abuse in administering  the program  Todays GAO report once again shows us that  the Administration is more interested in handing out political favors than in  trying to find the best way to teach children to read  said Senator Edward M   Kennedy  The GAO report confirms that the Department failed to take appropriate  steps to give States clear guidance and impartial assistance in implementing  Reading First  Our students and teachers deserve  better The GAO report highlights  once again  the  mismanagement of the multi billion dollar Reading First program  said Miller   the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee  The Education  Department has vowed to prevent future mistakes by taking remedial actions  but  the only way we can be sure of the Departments commitment is by conducting  vigilant oversight of Reading First  According to GAO  officials from  ten states reported that Department officials advised eliminating specific  programs or assessments  Officials from four states also reported  recommendations to adopt specific programs or assessments from Department  officials  The No Child Left Behind Act explicitly prohibits the endorsement   approval  or sanction of any curriculum by the U S Department of Education  GAO  found that the Department has no policies or internal controls to ensure their  employees are complying with these provisions Placing this  multi billion dollar program in the hands of a small group of people with ties  to specific reading programs and publishers was totally irresponsible  said  Miller  We must continue to investigate how Reading First was implemented to  learn from past mistakes and prevent future abuses  The program should be run in  the best interests of children  not the interests of a handful of publishers  that happen to be connected to the right people As part of his  investigation into the conflicts of interest issue in Reading First  today   Senator Kennedy is issuing formal document requests to the RMC Research  Corporation  the contractor hired to administer  monitor and help states  implement the Reading First program  Today s GAO report found that RMC  officials were improperly involved in the review of state reading programs  This  latest request is in addition to the eight document requests Senator Kennedy  sent out earlier this month to various Reading First contractors and  consultants  More information is needed to determine why specific  programs or assessments were eliminated under the Reading First program  said  Kennedy  The program was created to support and enhance the teaching and  learning of reading so all students can become proficient readers  That should  continue to be the goal  Im committed to making any changes needed to  safeguard the program from abuse  The Reading First program was  created in 2002 as part of the No Child Left Behind Act to improve reading  instruction in kindergarten through third grade  The Department provides formula  grants to states with approved and applications and then states award sub grants  competitively within the state  The Department and its contractors support  states and districts with technical assistance in implementing the programs   Chairmen Kennedy and Miller requested the study on Reading First  along  with Senators Enzi  Bingaman and Lugar  Miller and Kennedy plan a follow up  request to GAO to further study the decisions made by states and schools in  selecting curriculum under the Reading First program  and to gain additional  insights on how the Departments interpretation of scientifically based research  comports with the statutory provisions in the No Child Left Behind  Act Chairmen Kennedy and Miller Release New GAO  ReportBetter Oversight and Guidance Needed in Implementing Reading  FirstA Government Accountability Office report released today  by Senator Edward M  Kennedy shows that reading instruction has improved in many  states under the Reading First program  but the U S  Department of Education has  not adequately or properly worked with states in implementing the programs  The  report recommends the Department develop policies and control procedures to  ensure its employees comply with statutory provisions regarding their  interaction with states  The No Child Left Behind Act mandates  that states adopt reading programs supported by scientifically based research  that contain the five essential components of effective reading instruction   1   phonemic awareness   2  phonics   3  vocabulary development   4  reading  fluency  including oral reading skills  and  5  reading comprehension  strategies  The Department provides formula grants to states and oversees  states implementation of their plans and compliance with the No Child Left  Behind Act  Under the Act  the Department cannot control or endorse any  curriculum used in schools  The Department is further barred from directing or  supervising curricular and instruction decisions under the Department of  Education Organizing Act  Nearly 2 100 of the eligible  districts applied and Almost 1 200 districts receive Reading First funding   representing 34 percent of districts eligible under the program  These school  districts represent 7 percent of all districts nationwide The  GAO report  entitled Reading First  States Report Improvements in Reading  Instruction  but Additional Procedures Would Clarify Educations Role in  Ensuring Proper Implementation by States  finds that officials from 10 states  reported receiving direction from the Department that they eliminate specific  programs or assessments  Officials in 4 states reported receiving suggestions  that they adopt specific programs or assessments  One state official reported  that officials in the Department recommended eliminating a specific reading  program because it was not aligned with scientifically based reading research   Another state official reported that the Department notified them that an expert  reviewer objected to a specific reading program  which the state was considering  using  GAO also found that states struggled to implement some key  aspects of Reading First  22 states reported difficulty  in helping districts with reading scores that had not improved  sufficiently  17 states had difficulty assessing how districts  applied principles of scientifically based reading research in selecting a  program   7 states reported difficulty in implementing 4 or more  of six key components of Reading First  which GAO identified  The components are   1  determining whether districts applications met the agreed upon criteria to  receive funding   2  identifying reading programs based on scientifically based  reading research   3  creating professional development curricula   4  using  reading assessment   5  assessing how districts applied principles of  scientifically based reading research  and  6  helping districts with reading  scores that have not improved sufficiently  The GAO report also  included findings regarding states use of and satisfaction with the  Departments assistance  The findings include  Overall   48 states reported that the Department required them to modify their application  at least once  and 27 reported modifying them three or more times   33 states reported that the Department required them to address issues in  their application related to the use of instructional assessments  and 25 states  reported having to modify their application related to instructional strategies  and programs  Initially  the regional Technical Assistance  Centers reviewed some states pre Reading First programs to evaluate whether  they met the requirements under NCLB  The Department at first allowed this  practice  but after concerns were raised about officials expressing their  preference for specific programs  the Department advised all Centers not to  conduct such reviews  Most states reported using and being  satisfied with the primary guidance available  During  implementation  states were more likely to seek guidance and assistance from the  Centers than from the Department In addition  GAO found  improvements and changes under Reading First  Nearly 70  percent of states reported that reading instruction has improved greatly or very  greatly since the implementation of Reading First  At least 39  states reported that Reading First schools incorporated all five components of  effective reading instruction into curricula to a great or very great  degree  Most states reported that use of assessments has changed  and improved under Reading First  45 states have approved the Dynamic Indicators  of Basic Early Literacy Skills assessment  Every state reported  improvements in professional development because of Reading First  and at least  41 states reported that professional development improved greatly or very  greatly in five key instructional areas  Many states also reported increased  resources for professional development  In selecting reading  programs  22 states have created a state approved list of programs  The other 29  states require districts to choose programs and determine that they meet the  laws requirements  Of these 29 states  25 provided guidance to districts and  schools to identify core reading programs The GAO report is  intended as a complement to the investigations being conducted by the Department  of Educations Inspector General  In September  the Inspector General reported  that the Department has used Reading First to promote preferred reading programs  and to block states efforts to use other research based programs with proven  track records  The Inspector Generals report found that the  Department   Developed an application package and guidance that  obscured Reading Firsts statutory requirements    Took actions to throw the  balance of the expert panel mandated by Congress for review of Reading First  program applications    Intervened to influence how State s selection of  reading programs  and   Intervened to influence reading programs being used  by school districts  after the Reading First application process was completed   Chairmen Kennedy and Miller requested the study on Reading First  along  with Senators Bingaman and Lugar  Miller and Kennedy plan a follow up request  to GAO to further study the decisions made by states and schools in selecting  curriculum under the Reading First program  and to gain additional insights on  how the Departments interpretation of scientifically based research comports  with the statutory provisions in the No Child Left Behind Act   Laura Capps
