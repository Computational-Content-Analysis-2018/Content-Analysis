President Bush s focus on his competitiveness initiative  Also below are fact sheets on the President s proposed budget cuts to education and research The President s remarks indicate a willingness to do more to keep America competitive in this changing world economy  but his actions need to catch up with his rhetoric  His recent budget proposes the largest cuts ever in the Department of Education  and he cuts other critical programs as well  such as basic research and NSF teacher training programs in math and science  China  India and the rest of the world are playing for keeps  and we need more than half measures to keep up BUSH EDUCATION BUDGET JEOPARDIZES AMERICA S FUTURE Proposes Largest Cut to Education in the History of the Department of EducationPresident Bush s Fiscal Year 2007 budget proposes the largest cut to federal education funding in the 26 year history of the Education Department    a  2 2 billion reduction  a nearly 4  cut below last year  His budget proposal  Underfunds the No Child Left Behind Act by  15 4 billion  o Leaves behind 3 7 million children by freezing Title I grants to school districts at  12 7 billion  As a result  29 states  including Massachusetts  are projected to lose funding  In Massachusetts  54 478 children would be left behind  o Leaves behind 2 million students who are eligible to receive after school services  by flat funding the program at  981 million  o Flat funds the NCLB Math and Science Partnership teacher training program  Provides  100 million for a new voucher program for students in schools identified for restructuring under NCLB  After 5 years of being starved of the  2 5 billion in school improvement grants they were promised  public schools would receive  200 million in grants to help them meet the goals of NCLB and avoid the need for restructuring  Retreats on the government s commitment to students with disabilities  by providing a smaller share of States  total costs for special education for the second year in a row  o IDEA funding would increase by only  100 million  for a total of  10 7 billion o This would provide 17  of the average per pupil cost  less than half of the federal government s commitment  and down from 18  last year and 19  in FY 2005  Eliminates the Perkins Loan program  and freezes the Pell grant at  4 050 for the fifth year in a row  despite the fact that tuition has increased 46  since 2001  In 1975  the Pell Grant covered 80  of the cost of a four year public education  today it covers only 40   Cuts the Math and Science Partnership teacher training program at the National Science Foundation by 27   funding the program at  46 million     354 million below the program s authorized level President Bush s modest proposed increases in funding for the No Child Left Behind Act  IDEA  math and science instruction  and new funding for another run at his high school initiative are paid for by eliminating 42 programs   3 5 billion   many of which the President proposed eliminating last year  including vocational and technical education  education technology state grants  safe and drug free schools state grants  and programs to improve college access and retention including GEAR UP  TRIO Talent Search and Upward Bound  Once again robbing Peter to pay Paul The President s FY 2007 Education Budget Continues his Track Record of Broken Promises  In 2001  President Bush said he would leave no child behind  But since the No Child Left Behind Act passed  the President and the Republican Congress have shortchanged funding for the law to the tune of  55 7 billion  The Republican budget bill passed in December cuts funding to  1 billion below last year s level  This is the second year in a row that President Bush called to end federal funding for key programs that support family literacy  classroom technology  dropout prevention  and smaller learning communities  For the fifth year in a row  the maximum Pell grant remains a thousand dollars lower than the President promised in 2000  This is the second year in a row that the President called to end the Perkins Loan program and eliminate federal funding for vocational education and programs that support college access and retention  In December the Senate passed a bill that would have leveled the playing field for needy college students  by adding an additional  6 billion to help all Pell grant recipients  but the program was rejected in the final Republican budget  The President s budget includes no increase in the maximum Pell grant If President Bush were truly committed to helping America meet the challenge of global competition he would  Fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act at  39 4 billion  as promised  His proposed  529 million increase is one fifth the  2 6 billion increase promised in the law  o Fully fund Title I at  25 billion  as promised  o Fully fund after school programs at  2 5 billion  as promised  o Fully fund the math and science teacher training programs at the Department of Education at  450 million  as promised  o Fully fund education technology grants at  1 billion  as promised  o Fully fund school improvement grants at  500 million  as promised  Stay on track to meeting the federal government s commitment to fully fund its share of special education services by 2011  by providing  6 3 billion to meet the FY07 funding level promised in the law  Provide  1 3 billion for key NSF programs to improve K 12 and postsecondary math and science education  including  400 million for the Math and Science Partnership program that trains teachers in cutting edge instruction  Raise the maximum Pell grant to  5 100 as he promised in his 2000 election  and increase funding for vocational education and programs that improve college access and retention Basic Research Fact Sheet The President would have you believe that his American Competitiveness Initiative  ACI  is making a significant investment in innovative research when overall federal RD would increase slightly less than projected inflation under his proposal     He makes no new serious commitments to invest in RD  The President s American Competitiveness Initiative underfunds basic research  Even where an agency s overall RD budgets are set to increase  basic research programs would see cuts     At the Department of Defense  overall RD funding will increase by 2 2   but basic research will be cut by 16 3  Yet  it was basic research at the Department of Defense that led to the creation of the Internet  a vehicle that has only fueled more innovation and created millions of jobs  While NASA s budget increases by 8     most of which is to be used for new space vehicles    it cuts Solar System Research  Earth and Sun Systems Research  Exploration Technology  Human Systems  Aeronautics and Cross Agency and Education RD  At the Department of Commerce  although the National Institute for Standards and Technology saw a 6 5  increase in its RD budget  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research budget is cut 6 3   the Advanced Technology Program is zeroed out  and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership is cut by 55 7   Even DOE which is the hallmark of the President s ACI  makes cuts to critical research programs like biological and environmental research  And the President s Initiative keeps the National Institute s of Health funding flat  even after its budget for this year fell for the first time in 36 years  We must invest in basic research that helps us attract the best and the brightest to these scientific fields  and that leads to the innovation that creates jobs and moves our economy forward  America has long been the world s leader in developing innovative  new technologies and treatments  but we have been losing our edge in recent years   Countries like Japan  Ireland and South Korea increasingly recognize the immense potential of basic research for economic growth  China doubled its investment in RD over the last 10 years    but we increased it by only a third  Our investment in federal research investment is shrinking as a share of the U S  economy   federal RD investment has plateaued at 1 1 percent of U S  GDP  We can t let this trend continue  To compete and win in this global economy we must strengthen our federal commitment to basic research   Laura Capps Melissa
