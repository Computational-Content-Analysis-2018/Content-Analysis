         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  President Bush and members of the Senate will soon have the duty of appointing a new justice to the Supreme Court  In recent days  there have been differences of opinion over whether we should consider the judicial philosophy of nominees to the Supreme Court as part of the appointment process  I hope the President s remarks yesterday make clear once and for all that judicial philosophy is an important part of a nominee s qualifications  President Bush said that judicial philosophy would be one of the criteria he used to choose a nominee  along with character  integrity  and the ability to do the job    I agree with President Bush that these qualities    including judicial philosophy    are important to whether a nominee is fit to serve on the Court  Many times in recent months  and during his campaign for re election  President Bush has said that nominees to the federal courts must interpret the law  not make the law  He has said that we should appoint persons who would not try to legislate from the bench  This view has been echoed by members of the Senate  both Republican and Democrat  myself included  Senators of both parties agree with the President that we should not appoint judicial activists who would decide cases based on personal ideology  rather than the law    The only way to know whether nominees have an activist judicial philosophy is to find out what their judicial philosophy is  That s the only way to know whether nominees will follow the law or attempt to rewrite it  We certainly can t tell judicial philosophy from nominees  resumes  where they went to school  or where they worked  These issues are relevant  and should be considered as part of a nominee s qualifications for the Supreme Court  But a resume is no substitute for answering questions about whether the nominee respects the basic rights and freedoms on which the nation was founded    The American people deserve to know if a nominee would favor corporate or other special interests  rather than giving everyone the same fair hearing in deciding cases  They deserve to know whether nominees would respect the Constitutional power of Congress to enact environmental protections  or if nominees are so opposed to such protections that they would bend or distort the law to strike them down     The American people deserve to know whether nominees would roll back civil rights laws  or uphold the rights of the disabled  the elderly  and minorities  The American people are entitled to know if a nominee respects women s right to equal treatment in our society and to privacy in making reproductive decisions    This does not mean every nominee should promise to rule a particular way in each of the cases on the Supreme Court s docket for the next term  It doesn t mean that nominees must state how they would rule in any specific case  But it does mean that the Senate should expect the nominee to answer questions about important legal principles    such as the constitutional power of Congress to protect Americans against corporate abuses  the right to equal treatment  Americans  right to privacy in making personal decisions about medical care  the principle of non discrimination  and the right to be free from unwarranted government intrusion    The American people deserve to know the answers to those questions  and the Senate s review is the only way that they can get those answers  The nominee will need to say more than Trust me  in response to these important questions  because so much hangs in the balance     The importance of judicial philosophy in deciding whether to confirm a Supreme Court justice is nothing new  During the first 100 years after ratification of the Constitution  21 of 81 Supreme Court nominations    one out of four    were rejected  withdrawn  or not acted on     Since 1968  a third of all nominees to the Supreme Court have failed  During these confirmation debates  ideology often mattered  John Rutledge  nominated by George Washington  failed to win confirmation as Chief Justice in 1795  when Alexander Hamilton and other Federalists opposed him because of his position on the Jay Treaty     In 1811  James Madison s nominee  Alexander Wolcott  was defeated because of his enforcement of the Embargo and other trade laws opposed by Federalists in the Senate    A nominee of President Polk was rejected because of his anti immigration position  A nominee of President Hoover was not confirmed because of his anti labor view  The Senate failed to elevate Justice Abe Fortas to Chief Justice in 1968  when Senate Republicans filibustered his nomination  because they objected to his decisions on free speech and defendants  rights     Chief Justice Rehnquist himself has stated that it is appropriate for the Senate to ask about a Supreme Court nominee s judicial philosophy  stating that this has always seemed       entirely consistent with our  C onstitution and serves as a way of reconciling judicial independence with majority rule   November 19  1987 address to Columbia Law School    As our colleague from Mississippi  Senator Trent Lott  stated in 1996   w e should look not only at their education  background  and qualifications  but also       what is their philosophy with regard to the judiciary and how they may be ruling  In Senator Lott s words  if we do not ask questions  then we will be shirking our responsibilities    Earlier this month  the Senator from Texas  Senator Cornyn  stated that while nominees should not be asked to promise how they will vote in a specific case  it s an appropriate question to ask what their views are on cases that have been decided and judicial opinions that have been written     We should all agree that it s appropriate for the Senate to ask nominees questions about the issues most important to Americans  The American people expect and deserve to learn about a nominee s legal philosophy during the hearings on any Supreme Court nominee  We should do all we can to see that the process provides clear answers  so that the American people will have full confidence in the outcome     I yield the floor   Laura Capps
