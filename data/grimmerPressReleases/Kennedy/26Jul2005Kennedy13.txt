         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today in the first Judiciary Committee hearing on his bill  Senator Edward M  Kennedy discussed the need for comprehensive reform to secure our borders and strengthen our national security  The bipartisan McCain Kennedy bill  Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act is co sponsored by Senators Brownback  Lieberman  Graham  Salazar and Representatives Kolbe  Flake and Gutierrez and has broad support from both labor and business organizations  letters of support attached   Today s hearing was the first time that the committee heard testimony on the bill  which will be marked up after the August recess    Because of its common sense approach to fixing our broken immigration system  the McCain Kennedy legislation has received strong and diverse support since it was introduced on May 12  2005  Over 60 groups have endorsed it  ranging from the U S  Chamber of Commerce and the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition to UNITE HERE to the Service Employees International Union  The plan has received over 60 positive editorials from newspapers across the country  many touting its realistic approach of both strengthen border protection and enforcement while reflecting our best values as a nation    of fairness  equal opportunity  and respect for the law     The past debate has long been polarized between those who want more enforcement and those who want more visas  But to repair what is broken  we need to combine increased enforcement and increases legality  Better border control and better treatment of immigrants are not inconsistent    they are two sides of the same coin  Senator Kennedy said     The Wall Street Journal wrote that the McCain Kennedy bill is  a more promising reform  Their approach is a welcome acknowledgment of certain realities    namely  that enforcement only policies have failed repeatedly and that wiser uses of limited government manpower and tax dollars are in order  In short  the McCain Kennedy bill would enhance homeland security without harming the immigrant labor market so essential to the country s economic well being  And the New York Times concluded  President Bush  who has been promising action on immigration for years  should quickly join them  McCain Kennedy     Below is Senator Kennedy s full statement in today s hearing  a fact sheet  description of the bill  and the lists of groups and newspapers supporting   Editorials and Letters available upon request     Statement of Edward M  Kennedy Hearing by the Judiciary Committee  Comprehensive Immigration Reform   There is no question that the immigration system needs to be fixed  The evidence is all around us  exploited workers  divided families  deaths in the desert  fake documents  criminal smugglers  community tensions  and public frustration     The American people are demanding we mend this broken system once and for all  and we now have the best opportunity in many years to do so     For too long  the debate has been mired in the past  We need to deal with the growing complexity of the immigration challenge in this new century  The past debate has long been polarized between those who want more enforcement and those who want more visas  But to repair what s broken  we need to combine increased enforcement and increased legality  Better border control and better treatment of immigrants are not inconsistent    they are two sides of the same coin    The past debate pits national security against immigration reform as if they were inconsistent  But the best way for us to know who is here and who is coming here is to combine strict enforcement with realistic reforms in admissions     The past debate pits immigrant workers against native born workers  Today  we recognize that the best way to help all workers is to eliminate the culture of illegality that undermines the wages and working conditions of all workers     The past debate was over whether illegal workers should all be deported or all be legalized  The new debate recognizes the importance of assisting those who want to return to their home country  while also recognizing that many immigrants want to settle in America and become full members of the nation s family     We re both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws  They re not inconsistent    Senator McCain and I  along with Senators Brownback  Lieberman  Graham  and Salazar and Congressmen Kolbe  Flake  and Gutierrez  have recently introduced bi cameral  bi partisan legislation that offers practical solutions to deal with the basic problems we face  It combines tough  targeted enforcement with adequate legal channels and proper screening for workers and family members crossing the border     It s goals are clear    to bring immigrants out of the shadows and shut down the black markets  restore the rule of law at our borders  in our workplaces  and in our communities     Today an estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants have lived in the United States for many years  They care for our children and our elderly parents  They harvest crops for our farmers  They help to build and clean America s homes and office buildings     As a recent Wall Street Journal editorial stated   m ore enforcement is a slogan  not a solution  We ve tried more enforcement and it didn t work  We don t have the resources to deport the millions who are here  According to a report issued today by the Center for American Progress  to do so would cost at least  206 billion over the next five years  That s  41 billion a year    more than the entire budget of the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2006    Our plan offers a realistic alternative    not an amnesty  There is no free pass  no automatic pardon  no trip to the front of the line  But we do provide a sensible plan that will persuade people to come forward to receive work permits and earn legal status  They will pay a substantial fine and go through rigorous security and criminal background checks  Those who want permanent status must pay all their back taxes  learn English  maintain a strong work record  stay out of trouble  and wait their turn     A bipartisan effort is essential to get this done  Senator McCain and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact responsible and long overdue reforms to solve these difficult problems    Immigration Fact Sheet    The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that our economy requires some 485 000 full time  year round new immigrant workers each year  But current immigration laws provide just 5 000 visas for such workers annually     In the last 10 years  the federal government has spent more than  20 billion to enforce our immigration laws     In the last decade we have tripled the number of border patrol agents and quintupled the enforcement budget  Yet the number of undocumented immigrants living and working in the United States has steadily increased to 10 million     In terms of undocumented immigrants  the United States government does not have the resources to deport the millions who are here  The Center or American Progress tells us that this futile effort would cost at least  206 billion  That s  41 billion a year over five years  This exceeds the entire  34 billion DHS budget for FY 2006     Many sectors of our economy today rely heavily on the hard work and contributions of immigrants  Documented and undocumented immigrants comprise 40  of the jobs in farming  fishing  and forestry  33  in building and grounds maintenance  22  in food preparation and related occupations  and 22  in construction    SECURE AMERICA AND ORDERLY IMMIGRATION ACT  at a Glance 5 12 2005   Title I  Border
