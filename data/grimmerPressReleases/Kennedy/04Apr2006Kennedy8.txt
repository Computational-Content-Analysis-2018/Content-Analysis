         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  in the United States Senate Appropriations Committee  during a mark up of the Supplemental spending bill  20 million dollars was allocated to assist New England fishermen who were affected by last year s red tide outbreak that caused over ten million dollars worth of damages in Massachusetts alone  and millions more in the region    On March 27  2006  Senators Kennedy  Kerry  Snowe and Collins wrote Chairman Richard Shelby and Senator Barbara Mikulski of the Appropriations subcommittee which has responsibility for funding the National Marine Fisheries Service to ask that they include  20 million in the fiscal year 2006 supplemental spending bill to assist shellfishermen who experienced economic losses as a result of the 2005 red tide outbreak in New England     Senator Kennedy said  This is an important step in providing relief to those shellfishermen who were put out of work last year because of a massive red tide outbreak unlike any we ve had in New England for more than 30 years  I commend Senator Shelby for listening to the New England delegation s critical request by amending the supplemental budget to allow our shellfishermen to recover economic losses  We must work to ensure that these funds remain in the final bill  but this is a tremendous start    I am pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee today acted to help New England s fishing and coastal communities by including  20 million to help those who suffered from last year s devastating red tide  As anyone in Maine last summer can tell you  the impact on our state s economy was disastrous  I pledge to continue to work with my Senate colleagues from New England to ensure that this funding is maintained in the bill when it is considered by the full Senate  said Snowe     The historic red tide that devastated our coastlines last summer damaged not only the environment but also the local economy  said Senator Kerry  This new supplemental will have a lasting impact on the coastal communities and fishing industries of Massachusetts  Families are finally getting the help they need to get on the road to recovery    Senator Collins said  I am very pleased that the Appropriations Committee recognized this important need to assist New England s shellfish harvesters who were affected by last summer s red tide  The 2005 red tide outbreak was the worst in thirty years  hitting our harvesters at the peak of their season  This funding is vital to help our harvesters recover from this event    The letter requesting funding is included below    The Honorable Thad Cochran The Honorable Robert C  Byrd   Chairman                                                                            Ranking Member Senate Appropriations Committee                                       Senate Appropriations Committee   The Honorable Richard Shelby                               The Honorable Barbara A  Mikulski Chairman                                                                            Ranking Member Subcommittee on Commerce                                  Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice  Science  and Related Agencies                    Justice  Science  and Related Agencies Senate Appropriations Committee                                      Senate Appropriations Committee   Dear Chairmen Cochran and Shelby and Senators Byrd and Mikulski    As you prepare the supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006  we respectfully request that you include  20 million in emergency funding to assist shellfishermen in New England s coastal communities  who are suffering severe economic impacts from last year s disastrous red tide outbreak  greater than any the region has had in more than 30 years     The red tide    caused by toxic algae    led to the closure of shellfish beds along New England s coast for much of May through September 2005  In Massachusetts alone  1 3 million acres     77 percent     of its marine waters were closed to harvesting shellfish  such as mussels  oysters and clams     The red tide closures cost Massachusetts more than  10 million in shellfish landings and potentially much more in indirect costs to the fishing industry  Fisheries in Maine and New Hampshire also suffered significant losses from the closures  The coastal area from Gloucester  Massachusetts to Portland  Maine was closed to shellfishing beginning in the first week in May  and much of the remainder of Maine s coast was closed in subsequent weeks     The closing of these beds in state and federal waters was necessary to prevent human consumption of the red tide toxins  but it created enormous hardship for New England shellfishermen and the industry itself  and this hardship has still not been adequately remedied     In fact  on June 16  2005  the Department of Commerce declared New England s red tide outbreak a commercial fishery failure eligible for assistance under Section 312 a  of the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act  However  Section 312 a  assistance is contingent upon an appropriation     We believe that the red tide outbreak along the coast of New England is an issue of national concern  and we urge the Committee to include  20 million to help mitigate its impact on our fishing communities    With respect and appreciation  and we thank you for considering our request    Sincerely    Senator Edward M  Kennedy Senator John F  Kerry Senator Olympia Snowe Senator Susan Collins  Melissa Wagoner  Keith Maley  202  224 2633
