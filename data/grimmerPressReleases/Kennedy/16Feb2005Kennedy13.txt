         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     A major problem in the pending bankruptcy bill  S  256  is its harsh application to families driven to financial ruin by medical problems  The enclosed letter from Physicians for a National Health Program  signed by more than 1 700 physicians  emphasized that S  256 would make bankruptcy filing more difficult and punitive for millions of these Americans  since it increases the costs for all families filing for bankruptcy  regardless of their reason for filing  As a result  families already struggling to pay high medical costs  will find it more difficult to obtain the care they need    The physicians  letter cites the recent study by Harvard Law School and Harvard Medical School professors on medical costs and bankruptcy  which found that large medical expenses are an important factor for nearly half of all Americans who file for bankruptcy  Among other compelling findings  the physicians point out that 61  of these families tried to stave off bankruptcy by foregoing the medical treatments or prescriptions they couldn t afford     As the letter emphasizes  major improvements in health care and health insurance are needed to solve this problem  and it is a mistake to penalize the millions of sick and injured Americans who turn to bankruptcy for relief from their tragic plight     Until better solutions are found for the unaffordable medical costs that so many Americans are faced with  we should not punish these families twice by making filing for bankruptcy unfairly punitive and costly    Sincerely      Edward M  Kennedy       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
