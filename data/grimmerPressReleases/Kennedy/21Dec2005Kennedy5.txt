         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        Fact Sheet Included   The Christmas spirit was no where to be found tonight on the floor of the United States Senate as Republicans rushed through unconscionable cuts to the programs that American families deserve  This measure affects the lives of every single American  and it lets them down  It fails our commitments to the education of our children  to our health care  to the poor  and to our jobs  At a time when we should be moving forward  and helping families meet the challenges of higher costs  this conference report moves us backward    all for the sake of lining the pockets of the already wealthy with more tax cuts     Education   Parents know that education is a critical factor in making the American dream a reality for their children  An educated citizenry also makes a strong nation possible  We cannot compete in the world without skilled workers  We cannot maintain a strong defense without a skilled and educated military    Once again  the United States has been presented with a global challenge  as we were when the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1958  In order to face this challenge with confidence  we should invest in the transforming power of education  That s not what this conference report says  This conference report says that education is not a priority  It says global competitiveness is not a priority  It says basic fairness is not a priority  It says the American Dream is not a priority    In the face of this global challenge  this conference report does not invest more in education  In fact  for the first time in a decade  this conference report cuts the education budget  As we learn more about the critical importance of early education  as our elementary and secondary schools struggle to help our children meet higher standards  as a college degree is becoming an imperative  and as the cost of that degree is skyrocketing  the federal budget for education is actually going down    If our country is to remain strong in this rapidly changing world  our economy must work for everyone  and every American must have an equal opportunity to succeed  No Child Left Behind is not just a political slogan  It s a solemn pledge to every parent and every child in America    At a time when requirements under the law are more demanding than ever  this conference report cuts funding overall for No Child Left Behind programs by  1 billion  for a total that is  13 4 billion less than promised in the law  Over 3 2 million children will be left behind  Next year  schools have to raise the bar for adequate yearly progress  administer tests in reading and math on an annual basis  and ensure that all teachers are highly qualified  This conference report tells them they re on their own     Title I    the key NCLB program  which targets disadvantaged students    is cut for the first time in 13 years  Title I funds will be  28 million lower than last year  and 160 000 fewer children will be served  Funding to Massachusetts schools will be cut more than  4 3 million dollars    The conference report cuts Head Start funds by  68 5 million  leaving 750 000 eligible preschoolers without services  and dropping from the program 9 500 children who are currently enrolled in Head Start classrooms  It slashes the Even Start family literacy program  taking services away from nearly 35 000 children    The conference report cuts funds for after school programs  denying after school programs to 13 000 children currently enrolled  The conference report also cuts funds to keep our schools safe and drug free    With the first cut to special education funding in a decade  this conference report moves backwards on our commitment to disabled students  The federal share of the cost of educating students with disabilities actually drops from 18 6  last year to 17 8  this year  The funding in the report is more than  4 billion short of the amount promised just one year ago when we passed the IDEA Improvement Act    At a time when American students are performing below the international average in math and science  the conference report cuts  13 million in funds for the Math and Science Partnerships at the Department of Education  leaving funding well below half of the amount promised in No Child Left Behind    At a time when technology is more and more prevalent in our lives and in our economy  this conference report continues the bewildering downward trend in educational technology funding  In fiscal year 2004  the program was funded at almost  700 million  This conference report includes  248 million  a 50  cut since last year and just over a third of the 2004 funding     At a time when college costs have skyrocketed 46  since 2001  and almost 400 000 college ready students do not go to a four year college because of financial need  this conference report provides no increase in student aid  It leaves Pell grants frozen in place for the fourth year in a row    Jobs   Just as this conference report leaves millions of children behind  it also leaves millions of American workers behind        Close to 8 million Americans are unemployed  and most remain unemployed for 18 weeks or more  The picture is so bleak that many workers have given up hope of finding work altogether  The real unemployment rate is almost 9  when these discouraged workers are counted     Workers affected by the recent storms in the Gulf are particularly at risk  Hundreds of thousands of Gulf Coast workers continue to struggle to find work in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  25  of Katrina evacuees are unemployed  including 30  of those evacuees that have been relocated across the country  African American and Hispanic evacuees fare even worse  with an overall unemployment rate of about 43   Thus far  a total of 502 000 initial claims for unemployment benefits can be traced to the two storms     Yet  the conference report would cut funding for Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services offices that help jobless workers around the country  The conference report also cuts job training  as many workers struggle to improve their skills in order to secure good jobs  These illogical steps are an insult to those struggling to recover from our nation s greatest national disaster and those struggling to meet the challenges of a global economy     In addition  as we continue the long process of rebuilding the Gulf Coast  thousands of relief and recovery workers are facing toxic working conditions  Workers cleaning up in the aftermath of the storms are being exposed to hazardous chemicals  oil and sewage contaminated waters  mold  and other hazardous substances  Even outside of the Gulf Coast region  death rates among Hispanic and immigrant workers continue to be alarmingly high  Yet  our government will be doing less to protect the lives and health of our workers  The small  1 8  increase that the conference report provides for funding the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is more than eaten up by inflation  and won t be enough to maintain current levels of enforcement and training     The conference report also short sightedly ignores the future needs of health care workers  We are facing a looming threat of a pandemic flu epidemic  yet the conference report prohibits the Department of Labor from enforcing key safety standards to protect health care workers from Tuberculosis  These are very basic measures that would help protect healthcare workers from all deadly infectious diseases  and it is unconscionable to bow to special interests at the expense of those who will be on the front lines of our battle against this public health crisis    In addition to threatening the safety of American workers  the conference report also threatens their job security  It is hardly news to any of us that globalization is rapidly creating a single global workforce  Now more than ever  the jobs of American workers are at risk due to the poor wages and working conditions in other parts of the world  It s critical that we invest in efforts to improve working conditions around the world  for the sake of all workers  including our own  Yet  the conference report slashes the budget for the International Labor Affairs Bureau  ILAB  by 22     from  93 million to  72 5 million    threatening our ability to protect American jobs and protect the basic rights of workers and children across the globe    Health   The conference report also fails to protect American families from public health catastrophes    Congress has few higher priorities than protecting the American people from the deadly strain of influenza that is threatening the world and could take the lives of millions of Americans and damage the health of millions more    The threat from this deadly new disease has been compounded by our inattention and failure to prepare  For years  public health experts sounded warning after warning about the devastation that a flu pandemic would bring  but year after year  we failed to respond to this deadly threat in its earliest stages  Canada  Australia  Britain  Japan  and other nations released plans long ago  They re implementing their plans now  but the Bush Administration has put out a plan for only one federal agency  A response plan for the Department of Health and Human Services is a critical first step  but even that plan is incomplete  It s missing the actual operational plans for responding to a pandemic     The President has called  however  for a significant investment in preparedness  I attended his speech at NIH  where he urged that  7 billion be appropriated immediately for preparedness     We still have time to avert the serious consequences that a pandemic would bring  but only if we act now to begin improving our readiness  The Senate heeded the call to action by unanimously approving an amendment for  8 billion in preparedness funding offered by Senator Harkin     But the Republican leadership isn t on board  They stripped the  8 billion amendment out of this conference report  and provided only half that amount in the defense appropriations conference report  These irresponsible cuts will mean that critical programs will have to be delayed  Which parts of our response do our    Republican colleagues think we should delay  Production of new vaccines  Stockpiling of flu medicine  Support for hospitals and health agencies preparing for the pandemic  I d like to hear them explain to the American people which of these activities they think are unimportant  which of these priorities can wait  and which are not needed if disaster strikes    This conference report also means that we will fail to capitalize on the promise of this century of the life sciences  With the 1  across the board cut  funding for NIH will decrease  This has happened only 4 other times in NIH history  This is woefully inadequate to maintain our tradition of research excellence and breakthrough medical science  This is lowest NIH funding level in 35 years and the research and development budget fails to keep up with inflation  These budget cuts will mean that four of five innovative new ideas will be ignored  Over 500 new research grants will fall by the wayside  It s unbelievable that with the threat of a pandemic looming over America  the Republican Congress is denying the resources we need to discover new  life saving treatments and cures     Not only does the conference report not include funding for the avian flu preparedness  funding that would help to improve state and local preparedness against bioterrorist attacks for was cut by over  96 million     As we know  maintaining the health of our nation is not limited to emergency preparedness  Providing basic health services to the most vulnerable Americans and health promotion and disease prevention are also vitally important  But this conference report cuts critical health promotion and prevention programs at the CDC will be cut by  307 million and HRSA programs are slashed by  754 million     This conference report funds community health centers  that serve as a safety net of care for the most vulnerable  at less that half of the increase passed by the Senate  while eliminating the Healthy Communities Access Program which provides funds for health care providers  community based organizations and local government to coordinate and strengthen health services for the poor and uninsured members of their communities  Funding is also cut for critical health professions training programs that address the shortages of providers and train them to deliver care in underserved areas and to serve the 46 million Americans who lack health insurance   often in community health centers  Funding for critical health professions training programs that encourage diversity in the health professions and train health care providers to that will deliver care in underserved areas are cut 52  and training for geriatric medicine was cut by 100      With a 1  across the board cut  several programs  including family planning and HIV AIDS prevention programs  will now receive a decrease in funding  despite the growing need for these services    LIHEAP   The conference report leaves our poorest Americans out in the cold in a time of soaring energy prices  Households heating primarily with natural gas will pay an average of  281 more this winter for heatan increase of an incredible 38 percent over last year  Those relying primarily on oil for heat will pay  255 morean increase of 21 percent     This fall  the Senate voted against fully funding LIHEAP four times  and this conference report only provides flat funds  This is unacceptable  We know that heating costs are at record levels this year    Big oil profits are fatter than ever  Exxon Mobil    the largest oil company in the United States    reported 3rd quarter profits of almost  10 billion  a 75 percent increase over last year     Exxon Mobil alone made  10 billion in the last quarteryet the Republican leadership refuses to fund LIHEAP at its authorized level of  5 1 billion  The Republican leadership is Robin Hood in reverserobbing the poor to pay the rich     Conclusion   This bill leaves our children behind  American workers behind  and American families behind  It leaves America behind  It s unfortunate that Christmas comes this week  because this conference report is the Grinch that steals Christmas for so many  While the neediest Americans are struggling to find some hope this season  the special interests are sledding away with all the presents  Bah humbug    We should embrace the hopes and dreams of millions of Americans    not abandon them  as this conference report does  All parents want their children to have lives of fulfillment and opportunity  to raise strong and healthy families and afford to live comfortably in safe neighborhoods  Our actions in Congress should strengthen  not weaken America  We can do better  America can do better     House Reconciliation Bill Cuts Important Low Income Programs   Welfare Reauthorization  TANF   The legislation includes new work requirements in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  TANF  program   States would have to meet much higher work participation rates in 2007  starting just ten months from now  or else face fiscal penalties   The conference agreement would remove from states the flexibility they now have to apply different types of work related requirements to people receiving assistance funded entirely with state maintenance of effort dollars   29 states  not including Massachusetts  use state dollars in a separate program that counts towards maintenance of effort dollars  This is a critical option in the original TANF law that gives states the flexibility to serve populations that would not be able to participate for the hours and activities required to be countable under federal law  Both houses of the MA legislature have approved a bill that would direct Massachusetts to use separate state funds countable towards maintenance of effort dollars to serve families where the parent is disabled  caring for a disabled family member or has other major barriers to employment  If the option to use separate state dollars in this way is eliminated  there will be enormous pressure on Massachusetts and many other states to cut off assistance to vulnerable families who would otherwise count against the state s work rate   The conference report also imposes unrealistic work requirements on two parent families  In effect  this requirement means that any state that provides assistance to two parent families will almost certainly fail to meet the work participation requirements and will face fiscal penalties   CBO estimates that if states attempt to meet the work requirements in the conference report by placing more parents in welfare to work programs  rather than by reducing the number of poor families receiving assistance at all   the costs to states would be  8 4 billion over the next five years    Child Care  Despite this increase in required work  the bill fails to allow child care funding to keep pace with even inflation   The House bill provides only  1 billion for child care assistance  This is far less than the  6 billion in the Senate welfare reauthorization bill   Child care funding in the bill falls  11 billion short of the amount that CBO has estimated states need to meet the new work requirements and ensure that current child care funding keeps pace with inflation   An estimated 255 000 children in low income working families would lose child care assistance in 2010  States will shift resources away from child care subsidies for these families to help meet the costs of new work requirements   The bill will harm children in Massachusetts  There are already 13 500 children on waiting lists for child care in Massachusetts    Child Support  The conference agreement includes a provision in the House bill that would prohibit States from receiving federal matching dollars when they reinvest incentive funds into their child support systems  these funds are earned by States only when they achieve certain performance benchmarks in collecting child support    This change will cut federal child support funding by  1 5 billion over the next five years   4 9 billion over the next ten years   The cuts will result in a  2 9 billion reduction in the amount of child support collected over the next five years  and an  8 4 billion loss over the next ten years   In Massachusetts  over  58 million in child support payments will be lost over the next five yearsalmost  170 million will be lost over the next ten years    LIHEAP  The Reconciliation bill contains an additional  1 billion in FY 2007 dollars for LIHEAP   This one time obligation is split  250 million for formula funds and  750 million for contingency or emergency funds  Unfortunately this money is for next year and will do nothing to help keep low income families warm this winter  In addition  emergency funding is given out at the discretion of the President  It s possible that he could release little to no emergency funds in FY07   For FY06  LIHEAP is funded at  2 5 billion in regular funding and  1 683 billion in contingency funding  DOD and Labor HHS combined   However  with a 1 percent across the board cut to discretionary programs LIHEAP will receive  2 475 in regular funds and  1 666 billion in contingency  We are still far short of the programs authorized level of  5 1 billion   In Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves 134 000 needy families  Right now  these families receive a maximum benefit of  765 for the current heating season  This is enough for only one tank of oil  It takes at least two to four tanks to make it through the winter  Massachusetts may not see an increase over last years funding level in FY06  it all depends on when  if  and how the President releases the contingency or emergency funds    Medicaid  The House bill cuts Medicaid by  6 9 billion over the next five years and  28 4 billion over 10 years  Massachusetts could be cut by about  195 million over 5 years and  804 million over 10 years      17 million people would face higher Medicaid cost sharing  although the number could be as high as 30 million  including 13 children  The conference report lets states require co payments and deductibles on many Medicaid beneficiaries who do not pay cost sharing under current law  and increase cost sharing for beneficiaries who currently pay some cost sharing      Most of the savings from higher cost sharing would result because enrollees wouldn t access needed health care  CBO previously estimated that 80  of the projected savings results from decreased use of services  Health providers would be allowed to deny services if the enrollee doesn t pay the required cost sharing    resulting in higher spending in other areas like emergency room visits      States will be able to provide any child  regardless of how low their family income  with a lesser benefits package than current law requires  This could impact all 25 million children who receive health coverage through Medicaid    Education     The Conference report makes the biggest cuts to student loan programs in history   12 7 billion   and instead of putting those funds back into increased aid for all needy students  the bill will help fund tax giveaways for the rich     While this report includes some new aid for students studying math and science  the new program fails to prioritize the neediest students  and it imposes so many hurdles to getting the aid that it is sure to leave behind those who most need help to stay in school     Nearly 80 000 students at Massachusetts colleges and universities received over  180 million in Pell grants last year       While the Senate proposal would have delivered an estimated  120 million in additional aid for all Pell eligible students in Massachusetts over the next five years  the new grants in the Conference report will only go to about 10  of Pell grant recipients in Massachusetts     8 000 Massachusetts students will be eligible for the new grants  compared to 80 000 who would have received an increase in aid under the Senate bill      LABOR HHS APPROPRIATIONS BILL  AMERICANS DESERVE BETTER   Education    Head Start funding will be cut by  68 5 million o Biggest cut in the 40 year history of the program o Leaves behind over 750 000 eligible preschool children  o 9 400 preschoolers who currently receive services will be dropped from the program o In Massachusetts  over 15 000 eligible children would not be served    Even Start funding is slashed by more than half  from  225 million to  98 million  o Nearly 30 500 children will be dropped from the program     As requirements under the No Child Left Behind Act are more demanding than ever  the Republican bill cuts funding  1 billion below last year s level   13 4 billion below the level promised in the law      Title I funding for disadvantaged students  is cut by  28 million below last year s level    the first cut in 13 years    o Nationally  160 000 fewer kids will be served than last year    2 680 fewer in Massachusetts  o Massachusetts schools will see cuts of over  4 3 million in Title I funding   o Funding level is  10 billion lower than the amount promised in the law  o When compared to the funding promised in the law  3 25 million children will be left behind    over 54 000 in Massachusetts     Cuts after school programs by  10 million  o Cut will mean 13 000 children will lose after school services o In Massachusetts  230 children will be dropped from programs o Funding in the bill   892 million  is less than half the amount promised under NCLB  o Compared to the funding promised in NCLB  this bill leaves over 1 65 million children out of after school programs    31 700 in Massachusetts alone     Cuts federal share of costs of special education for the first time in a decade  o The federal contribution toward special education will decrease from 18 6  in FY05 to 17 8  in FY06  shifting a bigger burden to states and local districts      Pell Grants are frozen for the fourth year in a row   o The maximum Pell grant remains at  4 050 despite tuition rising 46  at four year public colleges since 2001     Labor    Job training programs cut     o The bill cuts funding for adult and youth training programs by more than  60 million  This would mean a cut of  3 million in Massachusetts     Funding cuts for Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services  even in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and with 8 million Americans unemployed  including more than 160 000 in Massachusetts     This bill prohibits OSHA from enforcing respiratory safety standards to protect health care workers from deadly infectious diseases     Workplace safety programs failed to receive adequate funding as workplace deaths rise    Health NIH  If the Republicans succeed in a government wide spending cut  NIH will lose money relative to last year  This has only happened four times in the entire history of NIH   This is the lowest NIH funding level in 35 years   NIH is the engine of discovery that fuels modern medicine and our biomedical economy  The tank has been low for the past two years and now the Administration and Republican Congress has us running on fumes   You can t buy a car and refuse to pay for the gas     CDC  Critical health promotion and prevention programs will be cut in the bill  CDC will be cut by  307 million and programs focused on health promotion activities are cut by over  50 million   Preventive health block grants that support a wide range of public health functions will be cut by 25  and grants to states for bioterriorism and emergency preparedness is cut 12      HRSA  There are 45 million Americans who lack health insurance  but this bill funds community health centers that serve as a safety net of care for the most vulnerable  at less that half of the levels passed by the Senate   This means that there will be no new community health centers in 2006   Overall  funding for critical health professions training programs that encourage diversity in the health professions and train health care providers to that will deliver care in underserved areas are cut 52    Several vital programs strive to encourage better health care for America s most vulnerable are eliminated in this bill including geriatric training grants and funding for rural emergency medical services   With a 1  across the board cut  several programs including family planning  HIV AIDS prevention programs will now receive a decrease in funding  despite the growing need for these services     TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST     Ironically    and sadly    these cuts to the budget come as Republicans will try this week to secure over  90 billion in new tax breaks for the wealthiest      Bush and House Republicans want a  90 billion package that will extend the president s dividend and capital gains tax cuts for investors   The Senate Republicans approved a  58 billion alternative  without Bush s priority of extending capital gains and dividend cuts past their 2008 expiration date       According to the Tax Policy Center  the capital gains and dividend tax cuts in the House Republican bill alone will save the average millionaire over  32 000 per year  above and beyond the enormous cuts they ve gotten already from this Administration      Most of the benefits of this extension would flow to taxpayers who make more than  1 million per year  which the New York Times calls morally reprehensible at a time when so much is being cut from domestic programs      Estimates based on data from the Urban Institute    Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center show that if all of the Bush tax cuts are made permanent  the richest 1  of taxpayers will receive an average tax benefit of  58 200 each year  This represents a 7 3  change in their after tax income  By contrast  middle income taxpayers will receive an average annual tax cut of just  655  This would represent only a 2 5  change in their after tax income     The Bush tax cuts already enacted cost nearly two trillion dollars  plus additional interest on the higher national debt       On top of those tax cuts already in place  the President is proposing another  1 5 trillion dollars of extended tax cuts between FY 2006 and 2015  with another  300 billion in additional interest   Even this understates the real cost of making the tax cuts permanent  because nearly all the cost occurs in the five years after 2010  Thus  the real ten year cost  FY 2011    2020  would be nearly  3 0 trillion dollars      In January 2002  Senator Kennedy was the first major Democratic official to call for a rollback of those Bush tax cuts that benefited only wealthy taxpayers  specifically    1  restoring the rates of the top three brackets    39 6   36   and 31  to their 2001 levels    2  maintaining the partial phase out of exemptions and deductions for high income taxpayers contained in the 2001 tax code    3  maintaining the estate tax on estates over  3 5 million
