         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Early this morning as the 109th Congress took its last votes  the Ryan White Reauthorization bill was passed by Congress  Earlier in the week  Senator Kennedy announced that his proposal for the Ryan White Modernization Act has been accepted by the bipartisan negotiators  clearing the way for final passage this year  Kennedys proposal    which has ended the stalemate    would take the current reauthorization bill and limit to a three year reauthorization  in order to leave stable the care delivery systems while the structure of the program is truly re vamped to reflect the disease of 2007  The bipartisan  bicameral bill reflects the balance of protecting our nations established systems of health care for those living with HIV and Aids and directing more resources to areas experiencing an increase in the disease  The bill passed the Senate on December 5th  2006  STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON THE HOUSE PASSAGE OF THE RYAN WHITE CARE ACT OF 2006 I commend the House on the passage of the Ryan White CARE Act today  This bill represents a working agreement among states  cities  community based organizations  hospitals and health providers  and persons living with HIV and AIDS their families and advocates  It responds to an evolving epidemic that continues to grow in the very cities and states that have long borne the greatest burden of disease  Its expanding into regions of the country that have been historically less affected  With this bill  we take a major step toward a more effective response    It preserves access to life saving medications  quality health care  and support services for persons living with HIV and AIDS who have come to depend on publicly funded systems    It extends this system of quality care to persons with HIV and AIDS who have faced long waiting lists for medications and severe limits on their access to specialty health care   It protects governmental and community based institutions charged with providing this care  all of whom face growing case loads and the greater challenges of an evolving population of persons with HIV AIDS   It balances the needs of high prevalence cities and states with those facing rapidly growing epidemics   It ensures those who have been relying on their local system of care that it will continue to be there for them  and  It reassures persons seeking tests for HIV that comprehensive care and support will also be ready to serve them  And it authorizes the expenditure of  7 billion over the next 3 years to carry out this mission  At its best  America has the finest HIV AIDS care system  one we as a nation should be proud to hold up as the gold standard of care throughout the world  Our goal in this legislation is to make it also the fairest system of care  with equal access for all  high standards for quality  and guaranteed continuity of care  At last  access to all the benefits of medical science will no longer be the result of geography  This bill is a product of effective advocacy  creative thinking  a sense of shared responsibility  and a common commitment to getting it done  The nation is fulfilling the promise of the original Care Act  first created in an era of limited treatment options and uncertain prognosis  to bring hope to persons living with the infection that they may live healthy and productive lives  My hope is that as we continue to improve the Ryan White CARE Act to meet the needs of this disease  the remedies we adopt will continue to come from the bright lights of science  not the dark fears of bigotry  This is an important day for people living with HIV and AIDS  and for all Americans  We must do more to provide care and support for those caught in the epidemic  This legislation will give us the time and support we need to accomplish that goal     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
