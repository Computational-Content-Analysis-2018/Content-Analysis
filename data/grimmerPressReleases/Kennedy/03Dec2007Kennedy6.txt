         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to President Bushs remarks this morning      Instead of working together to confront the serious issues facing our nation here at home and abroad  this Administration and its Republican allies in Congress continue to play politics  The American people spoke loudly in the last election and Republicans have yet to receive the message  Its incomprehensible that while this Administration spends half a trillion dollars on a war in Iraq with no clear end in sight  President Bush says we cant afford the important programs that would provide health care coverage to poor children  money for our schools  and funding for important cancer research programs here at home  Americans are sick of political theater and want to see results        Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
