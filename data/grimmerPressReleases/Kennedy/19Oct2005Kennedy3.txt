         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today at 4 30 pm the Senate will vote on two proposals on minimum wage  Senator Kennedy s amendment and the Republican plan that contains anti worker poison pills  Last night  to ensure bipartisan support  Kennedy changed the amount of the increase to match the amount of the Republican plan  but without their poison pills  Kennedy reached across the aisle to ensure that a minimum wage increase has the best chance of success given dire and urgent circumstances facing the 37 million Americans living in poverty  The Republican amendment  offered by Senator Enzi  is loaded with anti worker provisions that would severely hurt millions and millions of workers  including those that a minimum wage increase is supposed to protect     Kennedy s new proposal    which he considers just a down payment    would raise the minimum wage to  6 25  currently the minimum wage is  5 15  In March  50 Senators supported Kennedy s initial plan to raise the minimum wage to  7 25 while an additional 35 supported the Republican plan to raise it to  6 25    so clearly there should be broad bipartisan support for raising it  1 10     The Bush Administration and Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have talked a lot about poverty in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  But actions speak louder than words  These two amendments will test whether we are truly serious about fighting poverty  Senator Kennedy said  If we are serious about helping hard working families  we will give a fair raise to America s low income workers without taking away essential protections or allowing special interests to trump states  rights  The Republican amendment will actually plunge more children into poverty  and that s simply unacceptable    The minimum wage hasn t been increased since 1997  yet during that time Americans increasingly feel the squeeze of the Bush economy  Americans are spending 74 percent more on gas than they did at the beginning of 2001  Heating oil prices are expected to rise by 56 percent this winter  Such rapid price increases will force consumers  especially the poor  to cut spending on clothing  health care and food just so they can get to work and keep warm this winter  Hurricane Katrina demonstrated in stark terms that so many Americans live every day on the brink of economic disaster and for them any setback becomes a major obstacle to survival     Below are two floor speeches  which Kennedy plans to give during today s debate      Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Against the Enzi Amendment October 18  2005   For eight long years  Democrats have been trying to pass an increase in the minimum wage from its current level of  5 15 an hour  For employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  that s  10 700 a year     5 000 below the poverty line for a family of three  That s why I ve offered the Kennedy amendment  which will raise the minimum wage to  6 25 an hour in two steps    by 55 cents 6 months after enactment  and by another 55 cents one year later  This increase is simply corrects for inflation since the last minimum wage increase in 1997  This is not an ideal increase    it s a down payment  Much more needs to be done  But we owe it to the millions of Americans suffering in poverty to make every effort to get a bill passed that will provide them with some assistance in their struggle to stay afloat in this difficult economy     My colleague  Senator Enzi  has also introduced a bill today that would increase the minimum wage by  1 10 per hour  over the same timeframe as my amendment  But my amendment is two pages  while the Enzi Amendment is 87 pages  That s right    87 pages  Friends  it just doesn t take 87 pages to raise the minimum wage  Why so long  Because increasing the minimum wage is not the real goal of the Enzi amendment  That proposal would increase the minimum wage with one hand  while taking away minimum wage  overtime  and equal pay rights from millions of workers with the other hand  The Senator from Wyoming has a record of opposing an increase in the minimum wage  He has voted against it  time and again  over the last 10 years  Today is no different  The Enzi amendment is loaded with anti worker poison pills that would severely hurt millions and millions of workers  including those that a minimum wage increase is supposed to protect  It s a wolf in sheep s clothing  and it s a threat to American workers  By ending the individual coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act and raising the threshold to  1 million a year  10 million workers currently protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act would no longer be eligible for the minimum wage  no longer eligible for overtime pay  and no longer eligible for equal pay rights  This dramatic change hurts the garment worker working 80 hours a week to provide for her family  It also hurts her husband  a janitor  who relies on overtime to pay for food  rent  and schoolbooks for their children  Both will lose their FLSA coverage under this amendment  and both will lose access to overtime pay  The Enzi amendment also prohibits states from providing stronger wage protections than the federal standard for tipped employees like waiters and waitresses  Thirty one states have elected to provide stronger protections for tipped employees than the federal law  Seven of these states require that tipped employees be paid the full minimum wage  The Enzi Amendment would preclude states from adopting more generous protections for workers  trampling upon states rights  This intrusion into states rights hurts the single mom with two kids working as a waitress in Minnesota  She will lose her guaranteed right to an employer paid minimum wage under the Enzi amendment  leaving her paycheck and her children less secure  The Enzi Amendment would be the death of the 40 hour workweek and the American weekend  After the Administration s denial last year of overtime protections for 6 million workers  this proposal would further undermine overtime by allowing employers to refuse to pay workers up to ten hours of earned overtime pay every two weeks  This hurts all workers who are eligible for overtime  not just those that make the minimum wage  It means a pay cut of  3 000 a year for a median income earner   44 000 year  and an  800 pay cut for minimum wage workers  Employers are already free to offer more flexible schedules under current lawthe only difference is that now they have to pay workers overtime when they work more than 40 hours in a week     The Enzi amendment gives a free pass to violators of a broad range of consumer  environmental  and labor protections by prohibiting federal agencies from assessing civil fines for most first time reporting violations  It also preempts states  ability to enforce these laws  This hurts all of us  It would tie the hands of federal and state agencies trying to enforce federal laws designed to protect families and children and communities  It would weaken gun safety protections under the Brady Act  which could lead to an increase in weapon sales to criminals  jeopardizing our neighborhoods and our children s safety  It would weaken environmental laws that require companies to disclose their toxic emissions  and undermine consumer protection laws that require companies to report on the safety of their food  These provisions put our children at risk of increased exposure to pollution and toxic substances and increase their chances of becoming seriously ill from unsafe foods  The Enzi Amendment also provides tax breaks for small businesses  While I question whether this is the right time for tax relief     I have no objection to this proposal in principle  But we can find many ways to help small businesses without denying rights to millions of Americans  We have worked together in the past to provide a reasonable small business tax package along with the minimum wage  and I am more than willing to do that again  Actions speak louder than words  The Bush Administration and Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have talked a lot about poverty in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  But these two amendments will test whether we are truly serious about fighting poverty  If we are serious about helping hard working families  we will give a fair raise to America s low income workers without taking away essential protections or allowing special interests to trump states  rights  The Enzi amendment will actually plunge more children into poverty  and that s simply unacceptable  It is shameful that in America today  the richest and most powerful nation on earth  nearly a fifth of all children go to bed hungry at night because their parents  many of whom are working full time at the minimum wage  still can t make ends meet  It s long past time for a fair increase in the minimum wage  I ve reached across the aisle to cooperate on this issue  I m offering a clean bill that s just a minimum wage increase with no special interest perks or hidden poison pills  My proposal is not radical    all it would do is correct for inflation since the last minimum wage increase  It just keeps minimum wage workers from slipping further behind when prices are spiraling out of control  That s the least we owe to hard working American families  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment  and improve the lives of millions of American families    Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy on  Raising the Minimum Wage October 19  2005   If the images that we saw on our television screens after the recent hurricanes have taught us anything  it is that a substantial part of America today is invisible and forgotten  It s a part of our country that we don t often see and don t often think about  and it s populated by families who live lives of hardship and quiet desperation because of poverty  The images are a shocking reminder that the American dream remains out of reach for millions of working families  These Americans work as hard as anyone else    often harder  But the minimum wage that many receive cannot cover their bills or support their families  They can t afford the rising cost of higher education  so they don t send their children to college  They can t afford the rising cost of prescription drugs  so they don t take the drugs they need  and often they don t go to the doctor either     Each paltry paycheck brings impossible decisions  Do I pay my rent  or pay for heat  or pay for food  or pay for my new child s clothes   In the current economy  these choices will only get more difficult  To anyone who has gone to the gas station or filled a prescription lately  it s no surprise to hear that costs of basic necessities are skyrocketing  Americans are spending 74 percent more on gas than they did at the beginning of 2001  Heating oil prices are expected to rise by 56 percent this winter  Consumer inflation is at its highest level in 25 years  Struggling families are being squeezed in every direction by the Bush economy  Many working families are balancing on a cliff of piling bills  just hoping they won t topple over  While these costs are rising rapidly  wages are stagnant  especially for those most vulnerable workers at the lowest end of the wage scale  The minimum wage hasn t changed in nine years    it s been  5 15 an hour since 1997     During this time  due to the effects of inflation  the real value of the minimum wage has declined by 17 percent  Thus  minimum wage workers are effectively  making 17 percent less than they used to  A minimum wage worker who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  makes about  10 700 each year  For a single parent with two children  that s  4 500 below the poverty line  People who work hard and play by the rules should not have to live in poverty  It is shameful that in America today  the richest and most powerful nation on earth  nearly a fifth of all children go to bed hungry at night because their parents  many of whom are working full time at the minimum wage  still can t make ends meet  As everyone in this body knows  I have pressed for years to secure an increase in the minimum wage for workers  The proposal I advance today is not an ideal increase    it s a down payment  Much more needs to be done  But we owe it to the millions of Americans suffering in poverty to make every effort to get a bill passed that will provide them with some assistance in their struggle to stay afloat in this difficult economy  It s long past time for a fair increase in the minimum wage  So today I have reached across the aisle to work with my Republican colleagues and find a minimum wage increase that everyone can agree upon  The Kennedy Amendment would increase the minimum wage to  6 25 an hour in two steps    by 55 cents 6 months after enactment  and by another 55 cents one year later  Fifty members of this body  from both sides of the aisle  supported my last minimum wage proposal that would have raised the minimum wage by  2 10  Thirty five more voted for an alternate proposal to increase the minimum wage by  1 10    the same increase that I propose today     There s just no reason why this Amendment should not pass with overwhelming bipartisan support  It s a clean bill that s just a minimum wage increase with no special interest perks or hidden poison pills All this increase does is adjust for inflation since the last minimum wage increase in 1997  It just keeps minimum wage workers from slipping further behind when prices are spiraling out of control  It ensures that minimum wage workers can afford to heat their homes  and drive to work  and put food on the table every day  That s the least we owe to hard working American families  In today s economy  millions of Americans are suffering  7 7 million are unemployed  37 million are living in poverty  including 13 million children  Almost 46 million are without health insurance  As the pictures of Katrina and Rita so powerfully demonstrated  real faces are behind these numbers  and real lives are being jeopardized day after day  year after year by our delay in Congress  We have the chance today to make a change that will help these people  That s what we re supposed to do  It s the least we owe to hard working American families  I urge my colleagues to support this Amendment   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
