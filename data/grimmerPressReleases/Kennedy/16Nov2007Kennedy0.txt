Robert F  Kennedy Human Rights Award  Mrs  Ethel Kennedy  Kerry Kennedy  and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Mia Farrow joined Senator Kennedy in presenting the award      Dr  Mohammed Ahmed is the Medical Treatment Director of the Amel Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture in Sudan  and is renowned for creating a network of health professionals in Darfur and working to ensure the human rights of the people of Darfur  In a conflict that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives  Dr  Mohammed Ahmed has worked both as a physician  treating the victims of torture and violence  and as a representative of the Fur tribe  a majority ethnic group in Darfur  with the aim of achieving peace in Sudan      Since 1998  Dr  Ahmed has served as a delegate in negotiating a peace agreement between his own Fur tribe and 32 Arab tribes in Darfur  Deeply committed to easing the suffering of his fellow citizens  Dr  Ahmeds work in ending the physical and political strife in Darfur is essential to ending the violence that has torn the region apart      The Robert F  Kennedy Human Rights Award was established in 1984 to honor courageous and innovative individuals striving for social justice throughout the world  The award is presented each year to an individual whose work and courage in the human rights movement embodies the spirit of Robert F  Kennedys vision and legacy      As Prepared for Delivery     Thank you so much  Kerry  for that gracious introduction  for your tireless support of human rights  and all you do for the Robert  Kennedy Center for Human Rights  I know Bobby would be very  very proud of you and so are all of us in the family     Its an honor to be here with distinguished members of the diplomatic corps and so many friends of Bobbys Memorial  My only regret is that our Laureates wife and eight children are unable to join us today      Were all very grateful to have Mia Farrow with us today  Her passion and advocacy has called world wide attention to the massive tragedy and suffering in Darfur  Shes an inspiration to each of us and she truly shows the power of an individual to make a difference in the world      For nearly a quarter century  this Human Rights Memorial has served as the continuing voice of Bobbys dedication to human rights      This morning  we pay tribute to the extraordinary work of a courageous man who bravely confronts injustice and oppression  and who powerfully reminds us of the immense importance everywhere of dedication to human rights  Time and time again  the heroic efforts of such men and women poignantly demonstrate how one persons vision of a better world can truly change the lives of countless others and sometimes change the world itself      Its a great privilege to present this years award to Dr  Mohammed Ahmed Abdallah  the medical treatment director of the Amel Center for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture in Sudan  His remarkable work has aided countless innocent victims of horrendous crimes and unspeakable atrocities in Darfur  His extraordinary and unrelenting pursuit of human rights for his fellow citizens has earned him the title voice of his people throughout the region     As my brother Bobby so eloquently stated  Few will have the greatness to bend history itself  but each of us can work to change a small portion of events  and in the total of those acts will be written the history of our generation      Our Laureate has earned a prominent place in the history of this generation     He was born in a small village in a remote region of western Darfur  He worked hard to obtain an education while spending countless hours farming his familys land      After years of work  he graduated from Khartoum University Medical  School in 1976    the first step in realizing his dream of helping others through the practice of medicine  He was the first person in his village to become a physician  and to this day he continues to lecture and treat village patients at the nearby hospital      Through his work at the Center  our Laureate quickly found himself on the front lines of the war that is ravaging the people of Darfur      A special focus of the Center is on women  Sudanese troops and militia use rape as part of their brutal campaign of genocide  Humiliated and stigmatized  these female victims are often ostracized from their families and their communities  and left to fend for themselves  Our Laureate and his staff at the Center provide basic support and services to help these and other victims recover from the vicious crimes  The Center is the only medical facility of its kind in Darfur offering free medical and legal services to these innocent victims  and it receives hundreds of cases each month      To his enormous credit  Our Laureate is a mentor to aspiring physicians and health care providers in Darfur  He has a created a network of like minded physicians who volunteer their time to provide desperately needed treatment and care across Darfur  No one should underestimate the impact of this good work  Thousands more have been treated because of his dedication and perseverance      Dr  Muhammad Ahmeds work has become so legendary in Darfur that his home is a haven for the oppressed  On any given day  no less than a hundred people gather in the early morning in front of his home seeking treatment      Its easy to understand why  In Darfur  it used to be that a torture survivor could not access medical treatment unless a special form was obtained from a police station confirming that the victim had been tortured  Doctors were prohibited from providing medical care without the form  Other doctors turned victims away  but Our Laureate defied the authorities and provided treatment to innocents in need  He and the Center pressured the Sudanese Government  and the forms are no longer required in Darfur     In addition to providing medical care  Our Laureate does his best to document cases of murder  torture  abuse  rape  assault  and mutilation  He and the Center have taken a leading role in bringing cases of such violence to court      Needless to say  his work is at great personal risk  He is monitored closely by the Government of Sudan  Authorities publicly criticize him and the work of the Center  He and his colleagues are frequently summoned for questioning  Last year  the police raided a public meeting of local leaders  sowing fear and terror in those who dare to listen to Our Laureate speak about the right of Darfurs people to live in peace  Sudanese authorities obviously fear the impact of his work in defending the rights of the people of Darfur      But Dr  Mohammad Ahmed refuses to be intimidated  He refuses to surrender his ideals and his goal of a better life for his fellow citizens  He continues to be deeply committed to peace  He was a delegate to negotiations which led to a peace agreement between his tribe and 32 Arab tribes in Darfur in 1989  He participated in discussions in 2003 between all major Arab and non Arab leaders on the crisis in Darfur  and he has met with government ministers  military officials and security officials to discuss peace proposals      Forty one years ago in another part of Africa at a different time in history  Bobby traveled to South Africa  His famous speech at the University of Capetown that year reflected his deep conviction that human rights are fundamental to every citizen everywhere on earth  and his work still speaks to us across the years  As he told the thousands who defied the forces of the government to hear him speak  It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped  Each time a man stands up for an ideal  or acts to improve the lot of others  or strikes out against injustice  he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope  and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring  those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance      Through his own heroic acts for humanity  Dr  Mohammad Ahmed has single handedly created thousands of ripples of hope for the innocent victims of the horrific genocide in Darfur  His work is a call to our own collective conscience to do more to reach an enduring peace for Darfur that is true to the fundamental principles of human rights       The genocide taking place is a shameful stain on all humanity  The systematic use of torture  rape  kidnapping  mutilation  and massacres haunts our planet  We as a nation have a moral imperative to work with the international community to end the unbearable anguish of the people of Darfur      Hundreds of thousands of men  women and children have been killed     A quarter of a million people are now refugees from Darfur     Over two million others have been driven from their homes by the vicious ethnic hatred       Surely  we and the international community can take more effective steps to halt this massive tragedy  As Dr  Mohammed Ahmed has said  We have to be one community  and we have to stand against this together     Urgent action is needed now  The entire world has a role to play in helping to alleviate the enormous suffering in Darfur      A peacekeeping force is absolutely essential to protect innocent civilians and bring an end to the chaos  and the United Nations peacekeepers should be quickly deployed as part of the joint mission with the African Union     The world community must work together to see that the UN arms embargo is fully enforced  There can be no exceptions      A No Fly Zone should be imposed over Darfur to prevent air attacks on civilians and on humanitarian workers providing food and medical assistance to the people of Darfur  Civilian and humanitarian aid workers must be able to do their life saving work      The world community must also unite in demanding that attacks on internally displaced persons residing in refugee camps and other innocent civilians in Darfur stop immediately  All parties in Sudan need to be held accountable for the safety and security of the conflicts innocent victims     In addition  Congress should pass the Sudan Divestment Act  which supports states that are enacting strong divestment laws  Twenty one states across America  including Massachusetts    deserve credit for already enacting their own divestment laws      Americans who do not want their pensions  annuities and endowments used to support the murderous acts of the government of Sudan should have the information and ability to divest if they choose to do so     Above all  the people of Darfur need a peace agreement  All the parties to the conflict  rebel leaders and government officials alike  must come to the table to attempt to reach a lasting agreement that will bring peace to those who have suffered so much     Dr  Mohammed Ahmed has shown the world the way  He is doing all he can to end the unspeakable cruelties in Darfur and improve the plight of the people in that troubled land  He is an extraordinary person  doing extraordinary work at an extraordinary time in history      The words of a well known Sudanese writer in a poem entitled Birth speak to the hope and promise he is searching for amid unspeakable evil      Can good combine with evil     Can it slay war and escape with peace     Will Earth return to love and joy     Our Laureate is doing all he can to return love and joy to the people of Darfur  He is an eloquent voice for countless victims who cannot speak to the world for themselves  Hes an inspiration to us all  and I know Bobby would be proud of him      It is an honor now to join Ethel in presenting this years Laureate  Dr  Mohammed Ahmed Abdallah  with the Robert F  Kennedy Human Rights Award             Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
