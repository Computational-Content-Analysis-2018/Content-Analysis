         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     As delivered   My heart goes out this morning to the families of the nine fallen firefighters in Charleston  and to my colleagues Senator Graham and DeMint and to the people of Charleston  These fallen heroes made the ultimate sacrifice to protect their fellow citizens  And today we remember them and all firefighters and their families for whom courageous service is a part of their service is a part of their everyday lives  My home state of Massachusetts endured similar disaster several years ago when six firefighters died in Worcester  Massachusetts  I read a poem at the funeral of those fallen heroes  and Id like to read it again now  And I hope it brings some small measure of comfort to those whose hearts are aching today for their brave husbands  fathers  brothers  and friends who perished so tragically  It s called May They Not be Forgotten  Brother  when you weep for me remember that it was meant to be lay me down and when you leave remember Ill be at your sleeve in every dark and choking hall  Ill be there as you slowly crawl on every roof in driving snow Ill hold your coat and you will know in cellars hot with searing heat at windows where a gate you meet in closets where young children hide  you know Ill be there at your side  the house from which I now respond is overstaffed with heroes gone men who answered one last bell did the job and did it well as firemen  we understand that death s a card dealt in our hand  a card we hope we never play but one we hold there anyway  be that card is something we ignore as we crawl across a weakened floor  before we know that we re the only prayer for anyone that might be there  so remember as you wipe your tears the joy I knew throughout the years as I did the job I loved to do  I pray that thought will see you through  Mr  President  I wish to address the Senate on a matter that we ll have an opportunity to vote on as this week goes on  and that is the Employee Free Choice Act  and I think to understand this issue  Mr  President  we have to understand really what has been happening to the middle class  the working families in this country over the period of these last 30 years and then what happened to the middle class in the 20 or 30 years before that and what happened after the turn of the century  as we came into the 20th century  In my own state of Massachusetts  at the turn of the century coming into the 19 hundred s  1900 s  we had the most extraordinary and excessive exploitation of American work earnings workers  and they weren t just American workers  they were children  all one has to do is travel on up to Lowell  Massachusetts  where we have a national park and travel through some of the areas we have preserved  some of the old textile mills  and you ll read encased in many of those wonderful viewing stands these letters of children that were 8 or 9 and 10 years old that worked 15 hours a day as they were paid very  very minimum salaries and they were required to work  We had the exploitation of women in those conditions  We had the exploitation of the conditions which were extraordinarily dangerous  And we had wages that were completely inadequate to provide a decent wage for people that were working long and hard  And then we saw the changes that took place in the 1940 s as work workers came together and demand demanded economic and social justice  And we saw the changes that took place in the workplace in terms of fairness and equity  And interestingly  we saw the vast increase in productivity  the American economy growing stronger  The middle class were the ones that brought us out of the Great Depression  the ones that fought in world war ii  the ones that put us back on the track after we had 13 million  15 million Americans that served in World War II and brought us back to a strong and an expanding economy where everyone moved along together  where everyone moved along together and we made enormous progress during the 1950 s and the 1960 s and during the early 1970 s  We made economic progress for workers and working means  and    and forking working families  We passed legislation that dealt with children that were left behind  a whole range of different kinds of programs to make this a fair and more justified just country  Strong opposition  but I don t hear any effort to try and repeal those marks for progress that we have made in terms of economic and social justice and the courts obviously filled an enormous responsibility  So  Mr  President  can Mr  President Mr  president  what happened during this period of time  We find that during this period of time    I put on here the    a chart  Mr  President  that shows from 1941 to 1961  And then I show this part of the chart where we have the    what we call the abuses in the labor    in the job markets today  And during this period of time  Mr  President  we have what we are talking about  the employee free choice act  We had it in effect during this period of time  interestingly enough  card check offs were in effect during this period of time from 1941 all the way up to 1961 and then through the national labor relations board and supreme court we found out that there was gradually the elimination that have kind of protection  And  look  we have found the various abuses that we have at this point  That is  firing workers that are interested in forming a union  if the union is actually accepted  even by voting by this  the refusal to accept the outcome    and we find a series of different kinds of abuses  to make it more and more difficult for people to be able to join the unions  but what I would had here  Mr  president  is    but what we had here  Mr  president  is the fact that we had labor and management disagreement agreements and we had progress and economic prosperity during this period of time  Look here  Mr  President  During that same period of time where we talked about peak union membership  wails and productivity rise together  Look from 1947  1952  1968  1962  Increasing in productivity  increasing in wages  America moved along together  Economic progress that moved a along together  And then as we find that the unions are going to decline  we naindz find that workers are falling further and further and further apart  Wages now are flattened and basically in terms of their purchasing power actually going down and we see the productivity grew more than 206  more than wages  So when you had the idea that we had workers that were able to get together  represent their views  the creeps increase in productivity and we saw the country making very important progress  This chart shows what s happening during this period of time  This shows what was happening in 1994  Here it is  1947  1957  1967  up to 1973  the lowest 20   virtually all the same in terms of real economic growth  During the same period that I just pointed out where you had the maximum union activity  increasing productivity  increasing wages and the nation  The United States of America  all growing  growing  and growing together  That was going on from 1947 through 1973  Now let s take a look at 1973 and the year 2000  We have the beginning of America beginning to grow apart  Look what s happening to the middle class hey and look at what s happened to the top  Growing two or three times higher during this period of time  This was the beginning of the Reagan revolution that was taking place  Reflecting it in how America was growing  Were we growing more together or are we growing more apart  And look what has happened now in the most recent times  The lowest 20   because of the rates of inflation  are actually going down  the second 20   And this top 1  is the one that is growing at this period of time  And what has happened  Mr  President  We at the same time we sea    at the same time  we see that the corporate profits have gone up at the same time  Workers  wages  and benefits now have basically stabilized  This country  the United States  grows together  works together  We are a united people and we see what happening has been happening as a result of economic problems and the fact that unions have been effectively attacked and diminished in this country  Mr  President  just before I retire  just this last Sunday we had Father s Day  Look at the difference between fathers and sons in 1964 and 1994  What we have seen is that the sons did better  the middle class was expanding expanding  Sons did can better than their fathers over this period of time in this growth  Look what s happening now in this 1974 to 2004  A decline of 12   The son is doing poorer than the father  the first time in the history of this country that that s happened  The first time in the history of this country  And we know the corresponding difference  Mr  President  when we re able to have workers that are able to get together  we find out that the corresponding increases  And when you diminish the unions in this kind of area  you diminish the power of working men and women  That happens to be the fact  Is the trade union asking  All they re asking what they had years ago during the period of 1947 to 1962  And it worked then  Mr  President  Look at the wages and productivity  And what happened in the United States of America  We all grew together  We all grew together  So why this emotional reaction and response on the other side  Employee free choice act    this is some crazy idea we can t think about or even tolerate  This is an idea that has been tried and tested  How few the times that we have in the United States Senate where we try to do something that has been tried and tested and successful  When we had that measure which was effectively the card check off during the period of wages and productivity grew together and we had the fact that America    America    the United States of America grow together  Thats the choice that we have in the employee free choice  That is the choice  Are we going to go back to this period of time where we are as a country and a society growing together  Or are we going to continue to grow apart  Thats the heart of the question  The Employee Free Choice is really the resolution and the solution  So  Mr  President  I look forward to other times  I see my friend and Ive taken the time now  Im thankful that our good colleague and friend from the state of Washington wishes to address this  This is very basic and fundamental about our country and about the kind of America  I come from a state that takes a pride in the fact that the Mayflower arrived on the coast off of Massachusetts  The captain of the crew came together after six weeks and they signed the Mayflower Compact  And that is a compact made Massachusetts a commonwealth  What does it mean  It is a common interest in all of the families and we are going to work together to make a better state  a better country  a better nation  a better world  That is what is at the base of it  what this legislation is all about and I hope the senate will give us a chance to vote in favor of it  Mr  President  my time has expired  I yield the floor       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
