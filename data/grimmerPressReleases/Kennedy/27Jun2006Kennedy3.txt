         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    June 27  2006              The Bill of Rights is our nations greatest accomplishment  It has been our great fortress against the passions and politics of every era  It has been our great beacon to the rest of the world  demonstrating that we value our liberty more deeply than power or riches  It has seen us through Civil War and two world wars  through expansion from sea to sea and from earth to the moon  And it is fitting that such a document  which describes the rights inherent to a free people  has not been amended  not once  in its entire 217 years     At the time the Bill of Rights was created  the greatest concern of the Founders was not that the Bill of Rights was too broad  but that it was not broad enough  In Federalist No  84  Alexander Hamilton argued against the very concept of a Bill of Rights  by explaining that there should be no need for the Constitution to state the specific freedoms protected from government encroachment  since the government inherently lacked the power to regulate such freedoms  He was not afraid of free speech  To the contrary  he feared that any description of the right to free speech would not be broad enough to keep Congress at bay      James Madison answered this concern by drafting a statement of rights that was so clear and absolute that it could not be misunderstood  The First Amendment met that test  It states  in part   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof  or abridging the freedom of speech         The First Congress knew these words would allow all manner of speech  including some speech that was contemptible  The Founders were no strangers to fiery rhetoric  Most of them began their public lives by arguing for armed rebellion  Nor were they strangers to the kind of conduct that is as expressive as speech  These were men who protested by hanging King Georges tax collectors in effigy  and by dumping tea into Boston Harbor  The breadth of the First Amendment is not an accident    it is an essential part of the Founders design    For two hundred and seventeen years  we have managed to preserve the full breadth of the liberties set forth by the Founders  No generation of Americans has ever reduced the scope of the Bill of Rights  although the temptation to do so has been great     In 1798  President John Adams faced insurrection and rumors of looming war with France  But President Adams still did not seek to amend the Bill of Rights  even with our new republic at stake     During the Civil War  President Lincoln also faced the grave danger that the entire nation would disintegrate  But he did not seek to amend the Bill of Rights in order to improve his chances of preserving the Union     During World War II  our greatest generation faced evil incarnate  But that generation understood that it was fighting for  not against  the freedoms set forth in the Bill of Rights     To be sure  in those desperate times  our leaders did take steps that cut back on our freedoms  John Adams signed the Alien and Sedition Acts  Lincoln suspended the right of habeas corpus  Franklin Roosevelt imprisoned thousands of American citizens merely because they were of Japanese descent  But even in those difficult times  our leaders did not have the audacity to try to amend the Bill of Rights  They considered the Bill of Rights to be sacred  and recognized that they could not claim to be protecting our freedoms by curtailing them    In this way  the generations before us passed on a Bill of Rights that is as whole and complete as it was the day it was signed in 1789  Because our ancestors preserved those rights through the greatest tests of our national history  there is a heavy burden on anyone who asserts that future generations deserve less freedom than we inherited     We are told today that we must amend the Bill of Rights in order to prevent flag burning  James Madison and the rest of our Founding Fathers would have laughed at this notion  They believed that the freedom to speak and protest was a God given  inalienable right  not a privilege that should give way to the passions of the time    The Founders had a strong faith that the nation they were creating could be based on bold principles and still survive the test of time  Today  we know it can  The past 217 years have proved that we can survive civil wars and world wars  fascism  communism  economic collapse and all manner of civil strife  all without diluting the Bill of Rights     So why are we addressing flag burning  I completely agree that flag burning is a contemptible act  calculated to outrage rather than persuade  But even if there was a nationwide epidemic of flag burning  it would not begin to rival the problems we have faced without amending the Bill of Rights  Furthermore  there is no such epidemic  Flag burning occurs infrequently  and can usually be punished under existing laws  We are being asked to undermine the foundation of our democracy in order to squash a gnat     We might be forgiven for focusing on this small problem if we were not inundated with great ones  If the Senate wants to improve our nation  why dont we turn today to legislation that would reduce the vast numbers of children who go to bed hungry each night  If the Senate wants to prevent despicable behavior  why dont we hold comprehensive hearings on the billions of tax dollars that have been stolen and squandered by companies hired to rebuild Iraq  If the Senate wants to keep faith with our veterans  why dont we leave the Constitution alone and work to improve our VA hospitals     The sad but inescapable answer is that our Republican leaders priorities are being driven by election year politics  Watering down the Bill of Rights will not address any real problem  This amendment is a purely symbolic act  designed to agitate and divide our nation  It is one more manifestation of the politics of fear  in which issues are raised and debated not in order to make progress for the American people  but to score partisan political points    This amendment not only breaks faith with the past  but it also yields an uncertain future  Hopefully  future generations will look at this amendment with the same puzzlement that we now give to the Prohibition era and the Eighteenth Amendment  But it is also possible that future generations will take us seriously  and decide that the Bill of Rights is now open for further revision  Because there are only a few flag burning incidents a year  they will learn from our example that the Bill of Rights may be amended to address even the smallest problem    Future irresponsible majorities in Congress may feel free  as the Republican majority does today  to treat the First Amendment as their plaything instead of their inheritance  We will be the generation that opened Pandoras box  We will have told those who dissent that there are some things they may not do  some things they may not say  If that day comes to pass  it will trace its heritage to this Senate    My hope is that in the coming vote  there will be more than a third of us who take a stand against this amendment  It is not lonely at all on this side of the debate  Standing with us are the nations Founders  They knew that some speech was hateful and hurtful  and they protected it anyway  With us as well are the Presidents and Members of Congress who led the nation through its darkest days  without changing our precious Bill of Rights  With us too are the many veterans of this war and past wars who have spoken out against this amendment  and who are proud that they fought for our flag because it represents a nation with liberty and justice for all    I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reflect on these principles and this history  and vote to leave the First Amendment alone  Fifty years ago  President Kennedy  then a Senator  wrote a book about Senators in history who took great risks in order to vote their consciences  even when it meant challenging a strong tide of popular opinion  As he wrote  only the very courageous will be able to keep alive the spirit of individualism and dissent which gave birth to this nation  nourished it as an infant  and carried it though its severest tests  I am confident that on this issue the Senate will again be blessed by profiles in courage    Let me end with the words of our national anthem  the Star Spangled Banner  As every schoolchild knows  the national anthem reflects the concern felt by Francis Scott Key over whether Fort McHenry would be captured after a long night of shelling by British troops  He closes his first stanza with these words   O say does that star spangled banner yet wave Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave    This amendment is intended to protect our star spangled banner  But if it succeeds  that proud banner will wave over a land that is a little less free and a little less brave  Never in American history has Congress amended the First Amendment  and now is no time to start  I urge this Senate to find the courage to leave the Bill of Rights intact         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
