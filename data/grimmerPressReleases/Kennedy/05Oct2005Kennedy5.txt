         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Sadly  the gap between rich and poor has been widening in our society  The number of persons living in poverty in the nation has increased from 31 million in 2000 to 37 million today  including 13 million children  Two main parts of the problem are that wages are stagnant  and the long term unemployment rate is at historic levels  After Hurricane Katrina revealed the plight of minorities  the silent slavery of poverty is not so silent any more  For many  the American dream has turned into a nightmare  Families stay awake at night worrying how to make ends meet  Parents wonder how they will feed their children and pay their bills  Significant numbers of Americans live year round with the constant threat of power shut offs because they can t pay their energy bills  and there s no relief in site  According to the Energy Information Administration  energy prices are likely to continue to increase  The outlook for the coming winter is bleak  Heating oil will probably cost a third more than the already high prices Americans paid last year  Families who use natural gas to heat their homes will also pay more  The average 2005 price for residential natural gas is estimated to be 21 percent higher than it was in 2004  These are not just abstract numbers  They represent real burdens on real people  Minorities  the elderly  and the disabled  and many others are forced to make painful choices between heating their homes and paying for food  healthcare  and rent  The good news is that a highly successful federal program is available to prevent the poorest of poor from making impossible tradeoffs  LIHEAP grants money to low income families who can t afford the steep cost of energy  The number of American households receiving LIHEAP assistance has increased from over 4 million in 2002 to 5 million this year  the highest level in ten years  94 percent of LIHEAP recipients have at least one member who is elderly  disabled  a child under the age of 18  or is a single parent with a young child  77 percent of LIHEAP recipients report an annual income at or below  20 000 and 61 percent of recipients have annual incomes at or below the federal poverty line  The bad news is that these fortunate recipients comprise only 18 percent of the eligible population  In Massachusetts  the participation rate is 22 percent  which is still unacceptably low  Last year in Worcester  the city s Community Action Council provided fuel assistance to 9 660 households  but it processed applications for almost 11 000 households before the funds ran out  Many of the un served households were made up of the working poor  the elderly  the disabled  and children  In Franklin and Hampshire counties in Massachusetts  over 6 000 LIHEAP applications were processed  The Franklin Community Action Corporation reported that emergency applications and payment requests increased this past winter  They told me that this was by far their most stressful year  Across the United States  families are suffering from high energy prices  There are far too many stories of families that were eligible to receive LIHEAP  but didn t because the money just wasn t there  Here are just a few examples  A single father just lost his job on June 15th and has 3 children  His electric bill was  117 33  but he is unable to pay it because he isn t receiving unemployment compensation  or any other income  He is looking for work every day  Even if he is hired soon  his electricity may be turned off before he gets his first paycheck  A grandmother taking care of three grandchildren  ages 14  11  5 had an electric bill for  195  Her monthly income is  904  The house is totally electric  so the bills will probably be going higher  The grandmother also has extra medical expenses  but she too was turned away  It s wrong to let people like this suffer  So how does the Republican leadership in Congress respond  By cutting or freezing funds for essential low income programs  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita upended the lives of millions of citizens in the Gulf region  and the Administration was right to release emergency energy funds for the areas that were devastated  But  their response to the looming energy crisis is far less  The Administration and the House of Representatives closed their eyes to the needs of the poor  The House sent the Senate a Continuing Resolution which froze funding for the LIHEAP program  The current funding obviously isn t enough  19 percent of current LIHEAP recipients say they keep their home at a temperature they feel is unsafe or unhealthy  8 percent of recipients report that their electricity or gas was shut off in the past year for nonpayment  The Continuing Resolution also cut the Community Services Block Grant by 50 percent  These funds are used by many community action agencies to administer the LIHEAP program     According to ABCD  a community action agency in Massachusetts  since the outreach and application process for LIHEAP is handled through the ABCD neighborhood network  funding cuts will mean that access to this critical survival resource will shrink by more than 70   Up to 10 500 householdsout of a current total of 15 000 recipients  may not get their benefits  Those in Congress who care about this issue sent an urgent request to the President to increase the funds  but our request has gone unanswered  In a news conference earlier this week  a reporter asked Energy Secretary Bodman if the Administration plans to ask Congress for more funds for assistance for low income families and seniors  Secretary Bodman replied  At least at this point in time  that s not on the agenda  The Administration may not think the needs of the poor deserve to be on their agenda  but the states do  They re trying to do their part  In Massachusetts  state legislators want to add  20 million in state funds to LIHEAP  to supplement federal funds  Governors are stepping forward to acknowledge the problem  A bi partisan group of 28 governors  led by Jennifer Granholm of Michigan  and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts  recently sent a letter to Congress urging additional emergency funds for LIHEAP  They know the importance of this issue first hand  and so should we  Congress needs to stand up for the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet  We have the ability to tell the elderly  and the disabled  and many others that we ve heard them  and that we won t leave them shivering in the cold this winter  LIHEAP provides a critical service to desperate families who have nowhere else to turn for basic energy help  and LIHEAP is indispensable in filling that need  I strongly support this amendment to increase these emergency funds  We can t shortchange LIHEAP and all the people who need our help the most  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
