         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC Congressman Barney Frank  Senator Edward Kennedy  Senator John Kerry and Congressman Jim McGovern reacted angrily over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission s  FERC  approval of a Liquefied Natural Gas  LNG  off load facility in Fall River This decision is a great disappointment  This facility should not be built in an area such as Fall River  where if there is a major accident or a terrorist attack thousands of people could be put at risk  said Congressman Frank  This bad decision is far from final  and my Congressional colleagues and I will use all means available to us at the federal level to stop this facility FERC s action is irresponsible  Its mission is to protect the public  The safety of large numbers of citizens in the Fall River area is at stake  yet the agency won t even hold a public hearing about the issue  Counterterrorism experts have called the Weaver s Cove site an invitation to terrorism  said Senator Kennedy  I urge FERC to reconsider its decision  This is energy policy at its worst  The LNG facility should not go forward This decision is beyond disappointing  The voices of our state and homeland security experts are being ignored  and that s unacceptable  It  s downright reckless to approve placement of an LNG facility in Fall River in an age of terrorism  This fight is just gearing up  and I m urging the FERC to reconsider today s decision  If they don t  there are additional steps I have no doubt our state will pursue  said Senator Kerry I am deeply disappointed with FERC s ill informed decision  said Congressman McGovern  Today s decision is not the end of the process and the Congressional delegation working with Mayor Lambert will continue to fight against a LNG facility in Fall River  In the end  I believe we will prevail   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
