         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement    Today  the President sent the Secretary of State out to defend his quest for absolute power  Unfortunately  she couldn t respond to exactly what authority gives the President    our chief executive    the right to break well established federal laws  Domestic spying is just the latest example of this Administration ignoring the law and constitutional protections  In this country  no one is above the law  not even the President     We all want to protect the American people from terrorism and will provide all tools necessary to do so  But  we can not allow the fear of terrorism to be used as an excuse to give one branch of government absolute power  Checks and balances do not mean having your own lawyers re interpret the laws and rewrite the Constitution to tell you what you might be able to get away with  It means respecting the power and authority of the other independent branches of government    both the Congress and the Judiciary    to check against abuses by the Executive Branch     If the Executive Branch can make its own rules for domestic surveillance  then this is big brother run amok  Nearly thirty years ago  I led the Congress in passing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act    precisely to prevent this kind of abuse  Enacted with strong bipartisan support  this law requires the federal government to go to court before spying on people on U S  soil and defines who can be the target of a secret investigation  Now  the President wants to create his own definitions    without telling Congress or the courts what he s doing     If this President believed that winning the war on terror required new surveillance capabilities  then he should have worked with Congress to improve our laws  Just as we did with the PATRIOT Act three years ago  Congress stands ready to do its part to fight terrorism  But  let s be clear  The courts and the Constitution didn t stand in the way of finding the terrorists on American soil  our intelligence failures did     In his speech to the nation tonight  the President must explain to the American people why he feels he s above the law  Whether its secret prisons  bending the rules on torture  or domestic spying without court orders  this Administration has unnecessarily played fast and loose with law and constitutional protections  We all want to win the war on terrorism  But  we don t need to give up our liberty to protect our security  How can we be credible in helping Iraq form its democratic government when our President acts in conflict to fundamental democratic ideals at home     The President must also explain why he s using fear tactics to get Congress to pass an inadequate law  Legitimate fears about terrorism should not be an excuse to short cut basic civil liberties  nor to mislead the American people  The President has said that the PATRIOT Act is vital to our national security  I agree  as does a bipartisan majority in both houses of Congress  That s why he should support bipartisan efforts for a brief extension  instead of issuing veto threats and allowing it to expire  Whether this week or in the next ninety days  the President should put politics aside and work with Congress to achieve a bipartisan consensus on the PATRIOT Act that protects both our security and our liberty    while restoring the public trust   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
