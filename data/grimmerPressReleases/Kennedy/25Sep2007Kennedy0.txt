         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Sometimes  the American people demand that Congress and the Administration enact initiatives to address fundamental national needs  During the Depression  we enacted Social Security to see that seniors could live their later years with dignity  In the 1940s  we opened the doors of education for returning veterans through the G I  Bill  In the 1960s  we took action to see that seniors had quality health care  and the result was Medicare  In the 1990s  Democrats and Republicans  Congress and the Administration  states and the federal government all worked together to help alleviate the crisis in childrens health by enacting CHIP  The success of each of these programs has echoed through the decades in the lives of millions of Americans       Today  we stand at a crossroads  faced with the choice between a path that will continue and strengthen the promise of good health and a strong start in life that CHIP brings to millions of children  or whether we will turn away from that promise  and curtail the help and the hope that CHIP brings      Many of the best ideas in public policy are the simplest  The Childrens Health Insurance Program is based on one simple and powerful idea  that all children deserve a healthy start in life  and that no parents should have to worry about whether they can afford to take their children to the doctor when they are sick  CHIP can make the difference between a child starting life burdened with disease  or a child who is healthy and ready to learn and grow      That is why CHIP has always enjoyed bipartisan support  This support goes back to 1996  when Massachusetts enacted a state program that became one of the models for CHIP  The Massachusetts legislature passed a bill to expand coverage for children and paid for it by increasing the tobacco tax in the state  When that program was vetoed by Governor Bill Weld  a majority of the Republicans in the state Senate stood with the Democrats to override the veto       I was proud to work closely with Senator Hatch to create the national Childrens Health Insurance Program  When CHIP went into effect across the country  among its greatest champions were Republican Governors who understood the importance of expanding health insurance for children in their states  Governor Leavitt in Utah and Governor Cellucci in Massachusetts were both champions of CHIP when they were governors       The question for President Bush today is why he would even consider rejecting a program that has long brought Republicans and Democrats together to help children      CHIP allows parents to choose insurance for their son or daughter from a private insurance company  That is one reason why Republicans have long supported the CHIP program  Indeed  CHIP uses the same private insurance model that President Bush supported in creating the Medicare prescription drug benefit  If Members of Congress and the Administration really feel strongly that its wrong for the federal government to support health care coverage  maybe they should start by giving up their own taxpayer subsidized health care through the federal employees program  If members can take their children to the attending physician of the Senate with all the benefits that affordsshouldnt all American children have access to quality healthcare too      President Bush has argued that CHIP costs too much  But I will tell you what costs more  treating children in emergency rooms after their conditions have become severe  CHIP saves money    and untold suffering    by getting health care to our nations children before they are seriously ill       CHIP is paid for by an increased tax on cigarettes    not by raiding the treasury  That tax will itself save us countless dollars and lives by discouraging smoking      The case for CHIP is stronger than ever  Today  six million children are enrolled in the program  children who otherwise would be without health care       But another 9 million children in America still have no health insurance at all  And once again  Democrats and Republicans in Congress have come together for the common good      CHIPs success is impressive  Since CHIP began  the percentage of uninsured for children has gone down even as more and more adults are losing their own insurance coverage  because employers reduce it or drop it entirely      In the past decade  the percentage of uninsured children has dropped from almost 23 percent in 1997 to 14 percent in 2005  That reduction is significant  but its obviously far from enough      Recently  the Census Bureau reported that in the past year 600 000 more children have become uninsured  The struggling economy is causing employers to drop family coverage and even the robust and successful CHIP program hasnt been able to stave off decreasing coverage for children     CHIP helps to improve childrens school performance  When children are receiving the health care they need  they do better academically  emotionally  physically and socially      And CHIP all but eliminates the distressing racial and ethnic health disparities for the minority children who disproportionately depend on it for their coverage     Thats why organizations representing children  or the health care professionals who serve them  agree that preserving and strengthening CHIP is essential to childrens health      The Bible tells us to open your hand wide to the poor  and the needy in your land  Congregations across the country act on that command every day  by providing needed help to those with medical needs in their communities  They are turning faith into works  but they know they cant do the job alone  Thats why religious leaders from all faiths have called upon Congress and the Administration to assist in this mission by renewing and improving CHIP     Today  we renew our bipartisan commitment to the job begun by Congress ten years ago  and to make sure that the lifeline of CHIP is strengthened and extended to many more children       Only the Bush Administration seems content with the inadequate status quo      First  the President proposed a plan for CHIP doesnt provide whats needed to cover children who are eligible but unenrolled  In fact  the Presidents proposal is  8 billion less than whats needed simply to keep children now enrolled in CHIP from losing their current coverage 8 billion short       Then  as Congress was negotiating the CHIP bill  the Administration issued a new guidance that would make it virtually impossible for states to expand coverage to children in their state with household incomes above 250  of the federal poverty level  This would cause 18 states and the District of Columbia to drop children from coverage      And what is most baffling is that the President has consistently threatened to veto this bill     This is all a matter of priorities  And we can see what the Presidents are  The senate bill provides  35 billion over 5 years for CHIP  Just one year of the presidents tax cuts is  72 6 billion  And we spend  120 billion on one year in Iraq      Each day we spend  333 million on Iraq  Thats over 23 times what we currently spend on children needing health care every day  For one day in Iraq  we could cover the healthcare of over 256 000 American children  For one month in Iraq  we could cover the total cost of CHIP for over a year     The children of America should not become the latest casualties of this Administration     The CHIP bill before us this week is genuine bipartisan agreement that will help children in communities across the nation  It provides coverage to about 4 million children who would otherwise be uninsured       This bill moves us forward together  Republicans and Democrats alike  to guarantee the children of America the health care they need and deserve     Quality health for children isn t just an interesting option or a nice idea  It s not just something we wish we could do  It s an obligation  It s something we have to do  And its something we can do today  I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
