Policy Statement of Senator Edward M  KennedyNCLB Roundtable  Strategies that Promote School Improvement    I welcome our participants this morning in the first of several roundtable discussions on the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act  Im especially grateful to Senator Enzi for his help and the help of his staff  as well as Senator Dodd and Senator Alexanders staff  in putting together this roundtable  We look forward to continuing the bipartisan partnership on these issues    Our public schools today are more indispensable than ever in giving all students the opportunity they need and deserve in life  We all agree upon the importance for the nations future of strengthening and supporting our schools  and reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act this year is a high priority for Congress and the American people  The law enacted five years ago was a defining moment in federal support for public education  and was intended to respond to the many challenges facing our schools in todays rapidly changing world   We know that schools have faced many difficulties in implementing the Act  the most serious of which has been the lack of adequate funding  But weve also learned a great deal over the past five years about whats working well in the law  and what needs to be changed  Our goal this year will be to work together across party lines to enact a strong reauthorization that builds on the positive aspects of the law  and answers the widespread concerns about implementation    Today  our focus is on ideas and strategies needed to turn around struggling schools identified by the laws accountability provisions   The Act appropriately ensures that accountability is guided by realistic data on every child in every state  No Child means no child  The Act is a promise to students and parents alike that regardless of their background  language  income  or disability  every student counts in school reform  The initial results of the Acts accountability provisions show that states have focused primarily on standards  assessments  and measurements in building their frameworks for accountability  But much more remains to be done after that essential first step  especially in schools that havent met the challenge and are wrestling with improvement  The federal role in assisting these schools may be our greatest challenge and its a top priority for this reauthorization   Over 9 000 low income schools have been identified by the Act for improvement  corrective action  or restructuring  Some of these schools are in the early stage of changing their curriculums or beginning tutoring  Others are in later stages of replacing staff or reforming their overall approach to teaching and learning  Thousands of schools are waiting for technical assistance and support to develop and implement their improvement plans as required by the law  in order to avoid the later stages required in restructuring  In fact  only 34 percent of schools needing improvement  one in three  have received outside help or support  Developing the ability to do so is a major challenge at all levels  Obviously  we must do better  Fortunately  we know we can  Today  well hear about some of the successful solutions that states  school districts  and individual schools have adopted to make their improvement efforts successful  Well hear how teachers and principals have concentrated on data on each child to produce results  Well hear how outside experts and coaches have made a substantial difference in improving the quality of teaching  Well hear how schools have partnered to learn from each other to achieve improvement   We know it can be done  and today is our opportunity to consider how best to shape policies and allocate federal resources to achieve the greatest impact in these high priority schools  We look forward to your insights  and were grateful to you for being part of this immensely important task   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner
