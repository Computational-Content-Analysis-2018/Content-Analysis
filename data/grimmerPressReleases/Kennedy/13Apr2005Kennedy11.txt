         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Thank you Mr  Chairman and thank you Senator Feingold    I thank the witnesses  particularly Dr  Kathleen Dahlia  originally from Massachusetts  Her willingness to share her family s compelling story helps us understand the very real financial hardship and the personal suffering that often results from prejudice against same sex couples  and I m grateful for her testimony     In many ways  today s hearing is covering ground we ve covered before  In fact  this is the fourth time since September 2003 that we ve convened to ask whether the sanctity of marriage is in jeopardy  whether activist judges are undermining moral ideals  and whether a federal law that has never been challenged in nine years    the Defense of Marriage Act    is suddenly about to fail     There s no evidence of any significant change in the issue since the last hearing on it in March 2004      Some  however  hope to use this issue as a wedge for partisan advantage to create divisions in our communities  Regrettably  the hearing notice describes it as an inquiry into activist judges  but  it would be more accurate to call it an attack on the entire system of an independent judiciary     The checks and balances so vital to our democracy are what make our constitutional scheme the envy of the world and such a potent and enduring foundation for our democracy  The recent drumbeat of harsh criticism of activist judges in the wake of the Schiavo case would be laughable if it weren t so ominous  since the judges in that case were being attacked for not being activists  Apparently  in right wing rhetoric  an activist judge is any judge who doesn t act the way they want     Congress needs to address the issues of same sex marriage  civil unions  and gay rights on the merits  It makes no sense to condemn judges for their interpretation of statutes and constitutions  That s what courts are created to do     The Defense of Marriage Act specifically makes clear that states have no obligation to recognize same sex marriages in other states  but can do so if they wish to do so  Besides  the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the constitution has never required one state to be bound by the marriage laws of another state  No state is required to recognize marriages of other states that violate a strong local policy  For over 200 years  states have been managing these issues well  No one has challenged these principles successfully    Within each state  the problem we are supposedly examining today is non existent  unless Congress wants to impose its view on the people of Massachusetts  Our state s high court held that the state constitution prohibits discrimination against same sex couples in the marriage laws  and the people of the state are now in the process of deciding whether to modify the constitution     Some called the state judges activists for their decision  but sometimes  as we all know  the courts are able to act to carry out the intent of the constitution when bigotry infects the political process in the legislature  Imagine what America might have endured if the Supreme Court had not outlawed racial separation in 1954 in the landmark case of Brown v  Board of Education     The magnificence of our federal system is on display  Individual states are managing the intricacies of their local preferences and political climates  There is absolutely no need for the federal government to step in and impose a one size fits all  anti federalism edict that will prohibit local preferences from being vindicated     It s fundamentally wrong to discriminate against gays and lesbians by denying them the many benefits and protections that the laws of the state provide for married couples  Being part of a family is a basic right  It means having loved ones with whom to build a future  to share life s joys and tears  It means having the right to be treated fairly by the tax code  to visit loved ones in the hospital  and to receive health benefits  family leave benefits  and survivor benefits  I urge my colleagues to reject efforts to write that kind of bigotry into federal law   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
