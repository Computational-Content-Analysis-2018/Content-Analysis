         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Thank you  Mr  Chairman  and I commend you for calling this hearing on the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act      In recent years  prescription drugs have revolutionized the practice of medicine  providing new treatments for heart disease  diabetes  and many other serious illnesses  Often these drugs can prevent such diseases from  spiraling out of control and from causing enormous suffering  Yet for millions of Americans  these breakthroughs are out of reach    Today  the respected medical journal  Health Affairs  published a major study showing that over a quarter of American seniors went without needed prescriptions or split pills due to the high cost of medicine  One in twenty illegally imported drugs are from Canada or other nations  This is a chilling indictment of the failure of the Bush Administration to provide a meaningful plan to help Americans afford the high cost of the medicines they need    Sadly  the Administration feels it s more important to protect drug company profits than to help Americans to afford the medical miracles that their tax dollars helped discover     It s tragic that the only way for millions of our fellow citizens to afford the prescriptions that their taxes paid to develop is to attempt to purchase them from Canada or other nations where their prices are more reasonable  It s legal for drug companies to bring their products into America from overseas    and it should be legal for patients to do so too  It s the responsibility of Congress to see that it can be done safely  just as it s the responsibility of Congress to see that U S  drug manufacturers do so safely when their products are manufactured overseas    Americans now pay almost double the price charged for the identical drugs in other developed nations  Year after year  the cost of drugs in the United States continues to skyrocket in a way that is unfair and unsustainable and year after year  the pharmaceutical industry is among the most highly profitable industries in America  In effect  the pharmaceutical industry is gouging American consumers by charging exorbitant prices that other governments have long refused to tolerate for their own citizens     With the enormous difference in price between a drug sold in the US and the same drug sold across the border in Canada  it s no surprise that innovative senior citizens discovered that an opportunity for instant relief was available in Canada  and began organizing bus trips across the border from many of our northern States to purchase the identical drugs for sale in every Canadian pharmacy at much more affordable prices    In Massachusetts  the City of Springfield began using Canadian pharmacies to provide prescription drugs for its city employees and retirees  Springfield s example led the way for other cities  such as Boston  to do the same  Whole States are now involved as well  The Internet revolution vastly expanded the opportunity  enabling patients across America to go to Canada on the Internetand save thousands of dollars a year on their prescriptions     The European Union has had parallel trade in drugs from one member nation to another for decades      The American experience with Canada and the European experience with parallel trade show us that we can import drugs safely and make them more affordable  Access to affordable drugs is critical to patients all across America    The legislation that Senators Dorgan  Snowe  Grassley  McCain  Stabenow  Jeffords  Clinton  Bingaman  and many other Senators and I have introduced will allow the importation of safe  FDA approved drugs manufactured in plants inspected by FDA  It will allow American patients to buy safe drugs at the fair prices that Canadians and Europeans pay  not the exorbitant prices that seniors and the uninsured are forced to pay in the United States  It also includes strong provisions to prevent drug companies from stopping the importation of drugs under this bill    Our bill requires FDA to review any differences in a drug  such as the source of ingredients  or the site of manufacturing  between a drug to be imported and the corresponding U S  drug  FDA will approve or disapprove these differences under the same safe and effective standard that it uses to review changes made in U S  drugs  Only if the differences are approved can the drug be imported  In this way  all imported drugs will be required to meet the same strict FDA standards applicable to drugs sold directly in the United States    Our bill requires a drug pedigree for each imported drug to document who had custody of the drug at every stage  FDA is required to inspect these pedigrees at least 12 times a year  and it is given the resources to do so  The importer is held responsible if the drug is not properly sourced  In this way  we can be assured that only drugs manufactured in FDA inspected plants are imported     The place of manufacture and the name of the importer will also appear on the label of imported drugs  as will differences in inactive ingredients  if any  that may affect patients  such as a person with particular allergies     In short  under our bill  large numbers of Americans who cannot afford their medicines today will have safe access to less expensive drugs     I welcome Senator Dorgan  Senator Snowe  Senator Stabenow  and Senator Vitter  former FDA Commissioner David Kessler  and our other witnesses today  and I look forward to their testimony    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202
