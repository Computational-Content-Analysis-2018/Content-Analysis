         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement   Attorney General Gonzales letter today was a welcome    though belated and half hearted    acknowledgement that electronic surveillance must occur within the framework established by Congress in FISA   However  the letter raises more questions than it answers   The Attorney Generals letter suggests that the FISA process has been  substantially changed  but it is unclear whether such a statutory scheme can be accomplished without an act of Congress   The Administration shouldnt be able to continue sweeping electronic surveillance without Congressional authorization and review  There are too many unanswered questions about the role of the FISA court under this new arrangement  and the Congress must pursue vigorous oversight over the legality  effectiveness and scope of any ongoing surveillance programs    We all agree on the need for law enforcement and intelligence officers to have strong powers to investigate terrorism  prevent future attacks  and improve information sharing between federal  state and local law enforcement   But its the role of Congress to set the legal standards for electronic surveillance    which the Administration and the courts must follow   When Congress passed FISA in 1978  we intentionally restricted the power of the executive to look into the lives of innocent  unsuspecting Americans  and this careful system of checks and balances must not be carelessly discarded   The Administration and the FISA Court owe Congress  and the American people  an answer to the basic question  How does this ongoing surveillance program comply with well established laws and the Constitution  If the President believes that winning the war on terror requires new surveillance capabilities  he needs to work with Congress to amend our existing laws   For two years  the Administration has refused to do so and today  more than ever  the President has demonstrate his continued disregard of well crafted  long standing procedures that require the President to follow the law of the land    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
