         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       Thank you  Niall ODowd  for that generous introduction and I commend you and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform for organizing this event   Its an honor to be here with all of you today  As an Irish American  its inspiring to be here and look out across the room and see the American dream in action  Thank you for your enthusiasm    Youve all done a tremendous job in making the voices of the Irish and Irish Americans heard on Capitol Hill throughout this ongoing debate on immigration reform   As you all know  million of undocumented immigrants are living and working today in communities across America  They live in constant fear of deportation and are easy targets for abuse and exploitation by unprincipled employers    Families are unjustly torn apart for years  even decades  Many of them refuse to endure the separation  and instead risk their future by living here together without legal status    Fifty thousand Irish immigrants live in the shadows in the United States  Were all united here today in our commitment to do the right thing  to bring them out of the shadows  break the shackles of exploitation and fear that bind them  and to bring them into the mainstream of American life   Theyre what this debate is about  It is about good people who come to America to work  to raise their families  to contribute to their communities  and to reach for the American dream   The debate goes to the very heart of who we are as Americans  It will decide who can earn the privilege of citizenship    It will determine our strength in separating those who would harm us from those who contribute to our ideals    It will determine our future progress as a nation and our economic growth in the years ahead   Some in Congress want to turn America away from its true spirit  They believe immigrants are criminals  Thats false    They say you should report to deport  I say report to become American citizens   Congress must act on immigration reform now  and the sooner the better  Each day we delay  more and more immigrants enter the underground economy    We cannot wait any longer for new immigration solutions to show themselves  The answer already exists  The Senate has already passed it  Were ready to move forward  and with your strong help  we can get it done   Thank you         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
