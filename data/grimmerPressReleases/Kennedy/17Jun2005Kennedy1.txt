         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I join in welcoming Barry Black as our Senate chaplain  I commend him for his outstanding career over the past quarter century as chaplain in the Navy  and I look forward very much to his service to the Senate family as our first black Chaplain  It s an extraordinary coincidence and especially moving that the chaplain now coming to the Senate is one of the Navy chaplains who presided four years ago at the service for the burial at sea of my nephew John  and I welcome the opportunity to build on that bond in the years ahead   Stephanie Cutter  202  224 2633
