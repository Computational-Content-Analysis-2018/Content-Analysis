         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I commend Chairman Enzi and Senator Alexander for their leadership and bipartisan work on our Head Start reauthorization bill    For 40 years  Head Start has given disadvantaged young children the assistance they need to arrive at school ready to learn  Its wide range of services guarantees nutritious meals for children  an effective learning environment  and the chance to see doctors and dentists and be immunized against childhood diseases     Thanks to the bipartisan cooperation of all the members of the Committee on this reauthorization  we have made significant progress on this lifeline for needy children    We have done more to enhance the skills and qualifications of Head Start teachers  by establishing the goal that all Head Start teachers should have their A A  degree and 50 percent should earn their B A  degree     The bill before us improves the educational aspects of Head Start  ensuring that its services are aligned with expectations for children in kindergarten  as accomplished by the effective Head Start Child Outcomes Framework     We ve also made an effort to increase accountability in Head Start  Most important  we ve kept our promise to give local programs the resources for training and technical assistance to improve their performance  When a particular Head Start program has serious deficiencies  we ve provided for timely action    including possible re competition    to see that children receive the highest quality of services     We ve given additional flexibility to the programs at the local level  We ve expanded eligibility requirements so that families up to 130  of poverty can participate  Often  these children are the neighbors of Head Start children but can t currently participate     We ve expanded Early Head Start  which serves zero to three year olds and has become especially effective since it was created in 1994  Our bill nearly doubles its funding so that over 50 000 more children will be able to participate     Fortunately  we ve agreed not to accept the President s proposal to block grant Head Start services  We preserve the community based local structure of the program to ensure that the needs of neighborhoods and their children have the priority they deserve     I look forward to continuing to work on certain other issues with my colleagues as the bill moves to the full Senate  My greatest concern is that the bill does not address the National Reporting System    the Administration s assessment for 4  and 5  year olds in Head Start  The Administration has proceeded with this assessment without sufficient authorization or oversight from Congress  and a GAO report released last week confirms many of our concerns  the assessment is flawed  and is not consistent with nationally recognized standards for testing and measurement  the purpose of the reporting system is unclear  and has little value  and the Administration has failed to give adequate training to those responsible for testing children     Obviously  dubious testing has no value in assessing the program or student performance      We did reach a consensus on the coordination of Head Start with other early learning programs  including a new Council for Early Care and Education and an expansion of the Head Start Collaboration Office in each state  But more needs to be done to improve the quality of early care and education    I also hope that once the bill is passed  we can work together to ensure that the teacher requirements we ve included reach as many Head Start classrooms as possible  That means needed funds for teacher training and adequate compensation of Head Start teachers     I commend my colleagues for the bipartisan progress we ve made so far  and I also commend the many staffers on both sides of the aisle for all their impressive work in preparing this bill so well     The Head Start Improvements for School Readiness Act Bill Highlights   Enables More Poor Children to Get a Head Start   Current funding for Head Start is  6 84 billion  The President requested an increase of  45 million for FY2006  not even enough to adjust

sums as necessary for FY2009 and FY2010   The set aside for Early Head Start would be increased from 10  currently to 18  by 2010   The migrant set aside would be increased from 4  to 5   the Indian set aside would be increased from 3  to 4    The bill increases program eligibility for children in families with income up to 130  of poverty   The current threshold is 100  of poverty     Strengthens the Head Start Workforce   The bill strengthens the Head Start workforce by raising the minimum educational requirements for Head Start teachers  By September 30  2010  all Head Start

BA plus meet state specialized training requirements for pre k teachers  Head Start agencies in states with higher standards for pre k teachers would have to meet the higher state standards  If a Head Start agency not meeting the teacher requirements receives a waiver  teachers not meeting the minimum educational requirements will need to be supervised by a teacher who meets or exceeds the requirements   All Head Start teachers would be required to have at least 15 hours of in service training every year   All Head Start staff working directly with children are required to have a professional development plan  Head Start agencies may use funds to provide assistance to current Head Start staff to complete college courses  including scholarships or tuition assistance or other

Secretary of HHS      Strengthens Head Start Coordination and Collaboration   State Head Start Collaboration offices would be strengthened and expanded to promote collaboration and coordination among programs serving young children  promote alignment of Head Start services with state school readiness standards  better coordinate professional development opportunities for Head Start staff such as assisting 2 and 4 year colleges to develop articulation agreements and awarding grants to colleges to develop model early childhood programs  and promote partnerships between Head Start agencies and other organizations to improve the Head Start curriculum to promote the inclusion of more books in Head Start classrooms     The bill authorizes funds for Centers of Excellence to model exemplary Head Start programs in every state    Helps Improve Outcomes for Children   States would be required to designate or create a state advisory council on early care and education from birth to school entry that would identify barriers to and opportunities for collaboration between federal and state programs  develop recommendations for establishing a unified data system  and develop a statewide professional development plan for early care and education in the state    Strengthens the Academic Portion of Head Start   The bill retains and strengthens the Head Start quality performance standards to ensure program quality and comprehensive services   The bill strengthens the academic component of Head Start and requires Head Start agencies to set program goals   To promote literature rich classrooms  every Head Start teacher would be required to receive on going literacy training  including training in methods to promote phonological and phonemic awareness and vocabulary

appropriate assessments for young children  and requires a report to the Secretary of HHS within 1 year presenting expert recommendations    Strengthens the Accountability of Head Start programs   The bill requires deficient Head Start programs to recompete their grants when their program contract expires  5 years    The bill strengthens the role of the Board in oversight of Head Start programs   The bill improves Head Start accountability and monitoring  and requires each Head Start agency to conduct an annual self assessment  Head Start agencies that find weaknesses in their self assessment reviews would be required to come up with a plan addressing those problems so that they can be resolved as quickly as possible   The bill improves community needs assessments and requires agencies to take quick action on underenrollment   The bill imposes a salary cap on Head Start top staff    The Bill Does Not Include     Block grants  State eligibility to run Head Start programs  Employment discrimination by federally funded religious organizations  Weakening of Head Start performance standards  Program defunding based on child testing  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
