         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    We all agree that  federal law enforcement and intelligence officers should have the techniques and  resources they need to investigate terrorism and prevent future attacks   They  also need to be able to share information with state and local law  enforcement  But the American people deserve to know whether this power  is being used properly   The PATRIOT ACT  which we reauthorized last year   includes controversial provisions which  if misused  have the potential to  undermine important civil liberties   These provisions gave the FBI significant  power to obtain private information on both foreign and American citizens   To  ensure these tools are being used appropriately  we required the Inspector  General of the Department of Justice to submit reports on the use of the two  most far reaching provisions    Section 215  which allows searches for business  records  and Section 505  which authorizes National Security Letters to collect  information in national security investigations  The Inspector General  determined that the FBI circumvented the laws governing the use of National  Security Letters by issuing exigent letters in non emergency circumstances  by  failing to ensure that there were duly authorized investigations and by  inaccurately representing that the FBI had requested subpoenas for the  information when  in fact  it had not    As the Inspector Generals  first report makes clear  our concerns were well founded   The FBIs misuse of  National Security Letters and exigent letters has been a gross invasion of  privacy   The Administrations excuse of fighting the war on terror does not  justify the violation of basic constitutional rights and civil liberties    The lack of instruction and supervision within the FBI is unacceptable    The Inspector General found that that the FBIs widespread and serious misuse  of these intrusive investigatory tools was the product of mistakes   carelessness  confusion  sloppiness  lack of training  lack of adequate guidance  and lack of adequate oversight   The FBI must take responsibility for these  mistakes and work to correct them immediately   The American people deserve  protection from such reckless and improper investigations and I look forward to  working with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to end these abuses as  soon as possible   No Administration is entitled to operate unchecked and  unaccountable  with such blatant disregard for the rule of law             Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
