 Kennedy The Price Rehabilitation Center Annual Recognition Luncheon Brookline  MA October 11  2006  As Prepared for Delivery     Thank you Peter for that kind introduction  and thank you for this wonderful opportunity to recognize those here today who do so much for Americans with disabilities  You know that people with developmental disabilities should be measured by what they can do  not by what they cant do  That was the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act and you are making that promise a reality each and every day    For generations  people with disabilities were seen as people who needed charity  not opportunity  Out of ignorance  the nation accepted discrimination for decades  and yielded to fear and prejudice  But thanks to you  America is beginning to widen the doors of opportunity and inclusion for all people with disabilities    We see the small things that help a person with a disability contribute their talents to our communities with greater independence and dignity  the sidewalks with curbs that allow for wheelchairs  the lifts on the buses for the disabled and the adjustments in the restrooms so that people with disabilities can use them  However  those improvements took years of struggle     Seventy four years ago  we elected a disabled American for the highest office in the land  He became one of our greatest Presidents  But Franklin Roosevelt felt compelled by the prevailing attitudes of his times to conceal his disability as much as possible  The World War II generation began to change all that    Disabled veterans from that war returned to an inaccessible society  And the Greatest Generation began a march for justice that has brought significant progress and change with each passing decade    In the 1960s  Congress responded with new architectural standards to ensure that the disabled would no longer be left to wait outside our public buildings     The 1970s convinced us that full participation in society was needed not only for disabled veterans  but for disabled children and family members  and for those injured in everyday accidents  Congress responded with a range of federally supported programs that improved the lives of people with mental retardation  supported the rights of children with disabilities to go to school  ensured the right of people with disabilities to vote  and gave people with disabilities greater access to cultural and recreational programs in their communities    The 1980s brought a new realization that solutions must be found not just in government buildings and services  but in the private sector as well  Congress again responded by guaranteeing fair housing opportunities for people with disabilities  by ensuring access to air travel  and making telecommunication advances available for people who are hard of hearing or deaf    And then the early 1990s brought us the Americans with Disabilities Act  which was a declaration of independence for all disabled citizens that they  too  had every right to contribute to our nation and to pursue the American dream    Its fitting that we ended the millennium with President Clinton signing a new disability bill into law  The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Act of 2000 promised new employment opportunities to disabled Americans without losing their health care and income support    That bill may have ended the millennium  but you and I know that our work and our progress has just begun  We still face many challenges  particularly with health care  education and employment  Home and community based services under Medicaid need to be expanded so people have choices about how they live their lives  Vocational training programs need to be supported and expanded     With each passing day  Americans are learning that disabled does not mean unable  They are beginning to see people with disabilities as valued co workers and neighbors  We are learning more and more that with proper support  Americans with disabilities can be a valuable part of the workplace  earn a living  be part of their communities  and should no longer be left out and left behind     As one very capable individual with a disability reflected  I do not wish to be a kept citizen  humbled and dulled by having the State look after me  I want to take the calculated risk  to dream and to build  to fail and to succeed  I want to enjoy the benefits of my creations and face the world boldly and say  this is what I have done     There is a saying that when people are excluded from the social fabric of a community  it creates a hole  and when there is a hole  the entire fabric is weakened  It lacks richness  texture  and strength    I think all of us can attest to the truth of these words  Our families  our students  our friends with disabilities have taught us  in ways no books can  that the inclusion of people with disabilities in our world does not burden our lives  but enriches it    This lesson for me began at home  My sister Rosemary was born with mental challenges  The response of my parents to her special needs was a wonderful example for me and my brothers and sisters     Rosemary thrived in our family  even though there were very few programs to help her at that time  Nobody tried harder  whether it was in school or in sports  Nobody was more loving or grateful  We learned that in almost every way  Rosemary was just like everybody else  My brother Jack would take Rosemary dancing and sailing and my sister Eunice would take her on trips  I was quite a bit younger  but I remember playing on the beach in New England with Rosemary and laughing together   My mother wrote many years later about those days in her book  She recalled how she worked every day to bring out the best in Rosemary and develop her capacities to the fullest  She recalled how services for people with disabilities were limited  and how she was encouraged to put Rosemary in an institution    She wrote  Much as I had begun to realize how very difficult it might be to keep her at home  everything about me and my feelings for her rebelled against that idea  In the inevitable atmosphere of such a place  she would soon realize and feel deeply her difference from her brothers and sisters  and that would remove the incentive for her to even try to be her best  We decided that care  understanding  and encouragement would be the best way to develop her capacities to their fullest  whatever they turned out to be    My brothers and sisters and I were fortunate to have parents who taught us to respect the dignity and beauty of all members of the human family  a lesson that you all know so very well  And were all so deeply grateful for all you do for our nations disabled citizens   Thank you for including me on this wonderful occasion and for all you do so well     Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
