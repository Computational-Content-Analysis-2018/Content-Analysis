         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the Iraq intelligence oversight hearing   Todays hearing on pre war intelligence goes to the heart of why we went to war in Iraq  As we now know all too well  Iraq was not an imminent threat  It had no nuclear weapons  no persuasive links to Al Qaeda  no connection to the terrorist attacks of September 11th  and no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction   Congress and the American people have a right to know how the President could have been so wrong on such critical facts that made all the difference between war and peace   Its essential to get the truth  because there are other threats on the horizon in Iran  North Korea  and elsewhere  America must get it right next time   Its long past the time for the Senate Intelligence Committee to complete its work on how the Administration used pre war intelligence   The stakes are high  and its unconscionable for the Administration to continue to stonewall by refusing to provide critical documents essential to that inquiry  including the Presidential Daily Briefs leading up to the war   I commend all on this panel for speaking truth to power  and I hope this hearing will help shed light on how the President could have been so wrong in sending our troops into battle       Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
