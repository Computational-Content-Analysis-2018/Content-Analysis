         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       We have heard the same theme echoed over and over again by opponents of comprehensive immigration reform  They call the Senate bill amnesty and compare it to the failed reform effort of 1986    This criticism is wrong on both counts  the Senate bills earned legalization program is not amnesty  and it is radically different from the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986  IRCA    First  as President Bush and others have emphasized time and again  earned legalization is not an amnesty  Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez made the point eloquently at a Senate hearing just last week   Amnesty  by definition  is an automatic pardon  or free pass  granted to a group of individuals without requiring any actions in return  IRCA was an amnesty    immigrants only had to prove their presence in the United States before a certain date to qualify for permanent residence  In contrast  the Senate bill requires immigrants to earn legal status  They must qualify and pay over  3 000 in fines to enter into the program  and then they must earn legal status by continuing to work for 6 years  learn English  pay taxes  and meet additional requirements before becoming eligible for a green card     Even after jumping through all these hoops  undocumented immigrants who qualify for a green card still dont cut in front of anyone in the line  None of the current undocumented will be eligible for green cards until all of those already waiting are processed through the system    Immigrants who have been in the country fewer than five years face an even more difficult path to legal status  They will be required to leave the country and re enter as temporary workers  and they will likely face an even longer timeline to earn their green cards    So no matter how you slice it  this bill doesnt include a pardon or free pass for anyone  But it provides for a fair chance for hard working men and women who have made a home and a life in this country to earn the chance to stay here legally   Many critics of the Senate bill focus on these earned legalization provisions  but few of them offer a realistic alternative for how to deal with the undocumented immigrants already in the United States  Shall we round up 12 million or so men  women  and children and drive them across the border  Seventy percent of the undocumented population has lived in the United States for five years or more  Many have U S  citizen families and careers here  Blunt force enforcement like that envisioned by the House bill will only serve to drive these hard working individuals deeper underground  harming US security and depressing US wages in the process   The second point I want to emphasize is that this bill does not repeat the mistakes from 1986  it corrects them  The IRCA failed because it did not create the tools or provide the muscle to enforce employer sanctions against those who hire undocumented immigrants  The Senate bill includes major changes to the worksite enforcement provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act which have been specifically designedin painstaking bipartisan negotiations with Senators Chuck Grassley and Jon Kylto address the flaws of the IRCA   These worksite enforcement provisions are incredibly robust  The Senate bill   Adds 11 000 new immigration inspectors and 2 000 new Department of Labor inspectors  There are currently only about 90 DHS inspectors doing worksite enforcement  The Senate bill increases that number to 11 000 to conduct inspections  worksite enforcement and investigate fraud  and also adds 2 000 new Department of Labor inspectors to enforce the tough temporary worker wage and standards guarantees   Limits I 9 documents to 4 secure options  One of the biggest problems with the current worksite enforcement system is that the I 9 form requires employers to make judgments about job applicants citizenship based on about 25 different identity documents  many of which are easily counterfeited  The Senate bill will limit documents acceptable for I 9 verification to just four documents  green cards  employment authorization documents  passports  and drivers licenses  All of these documents will contain cutting edge anti fraud technology   Imposes new penalties for lying on I 9 form  The current statute does not include penalty language  Under the Senate  immigrants who lie on an I 9 form could face a 3 year prison term    Expedited participation in electronic verification system for critical infrastructure and immigration violators  Perhaps the most important provision in the Senate bill is its electronic eligibility verification system  EVS   What this means is that employers will have to call in or use the internet to check the eligibility of new employees against DHS and Social Security databases  This will represent a significant improvement over a purely document based system like the one we have now  The Senate bill differs from the House version because it combines an electronic verification system with strong due process to ensure that US citizens are not wrongly denied workthese protections are essential for the system to achieve widespread compliance   Information sharing between the Department of Homeland Security  the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration  An additional contrast between the House and Senate bills is that the Senate bill provides for extensive information sharing between the Internal Revenue Service  the Social Security Administration  and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS will be able to draw on tax and Social Security records to identify likely cases of identity fraud and instances in which employers are failing to participate in the new electronic screening system  This interagency cooperation makes the Senates worksite enforcement provisions far stronger than the House language  and immeasurably more effective than the existing system  Every U S  employer will be required to participate in this system beginning 18 months after funds are appropriated to establish the EVS infrastructurethats the shortest possible timeline DHS has said it needs to make the system work  Critical infrastructure employers will be required to participate on an expedited schedule    Felony for misuse of EVS data for identity fraud  Any immigrant or employer convicted of using data from the electronic verification system to fraudulently obtain employment or otherwise misuses this data will be guilty of a felony   Doubles penalties for non compliance and creates graduated penalties for repeat offenders  All penalties for employment of undocumented immigrants are doubled compared to the existing system  These penalties will increase over time to keep pace with inflation   Denies federal contracts to repeat offenders  Repeat offenders will be denied federal contracts for up to five years   None of these tough worksite enforcement provisions were in IRCA  they are included in the Senate bill specifically because we have learned from the unsuccessful IRCA experience  Our border enforcement measures are also exponentially tougher than those put in place during the 1980s   So IRCA had an amnesty  this bill does not  IRCA had weak worksite and border enforcement  this bill has strong worksite and border enforcement    The third key difference between IRCA and the Senate bill is that IRCA was not a comprehensive reform effort because it was based on the assumption that there was no room in the labor force for immigrant workers  This premise has been proven false by the continued stream of undocumented workers who have joined the labor force successfully since IRCA  becoming a major force in the service and other sectors of the economy   In particular  IRCA failed to address the root cause of undocumented immigration  insufficient legal visas for future immigrants  IRCA did nothing to modernize the legal immigration system  and the same inadequacies in our legal visa system which contributed to undocumented immigration prior to 1986 continued to do so afterward    Heres the bottom line  the Senate bill has a three pronged strategy to fix our broken immigration system  IRCAlike the House billdid not   The Senate bill includes a fair earned legalization program which does not put immigrants at the front of the line and requires them to earn their green cards over the next six years or more   The Senate bill includes the toughest worksite enforcement measures Congress has ever imagined  and it greatly strengthens border enforcement   And the Senate bill provides legal visas for future immigrants  eliminating the remaining condition contributing to undocumented immigration in the past   Thats a real strategy to fix our broken immigration system  and people who repeatedly raise the specter of IRCA are simply trying to undermine this bill while avoiding an honest debate about its merits    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
