         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the selective declassification of the NIE   The American people deserve the full story  not those parts of it that the Bush Administration selects  President Bush should declassify the entire NIE as the Republican Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has suggested so the American people can read the plain facts for themselves   The last thing we need is another selective declassification of portions of the report in a desperate attempt by the Administration to avoid disclosing the truth   For more than three years  President Bush and the Republican Congress have repeatedly claimed the war in Iraq is making America safer  Now  we learn that the 16 agencies in the intelligence community concluded just the opposite last April  that the Iraq war has become a rallying cry for extremists against the United States and made the war on terror more difficult to win   In addition  the President and Vice President must explain statements they have made that are directly at odds with this National Intelligence Estimate   The American people deserve to know whether the President and Vice President are intentionally misleading us about our safety  or whether they are simply ignoring the intelligence community  Clearly  America deserves better from its leaders and a new direction in Iraq   Facts  On September 7  President Bush said  We ve learned the lessons of 9 11We ve gone on the offense against our enemies  and transformed former adversaries into allies  We have put in place the institutions needed to win this war  Five years after September the 11th  2001  America is safer    and America is winning the war on terror   On September 11  President Bush said  Saddam s regime posed a risk that the world could not afford to take  The world is safer because Saddam Hussein is no longer in power   Despite the conclusion of the intelligence community five months earlier that new threats are emerging because of the war in Iraq  Vice President Cheney said the exact opposite on September 10  He said  We are better off there because of what we ve done to date  We are less likely to have a threat emerge against the United States from that corner of the world than would have been the case if Saddam were still there     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
