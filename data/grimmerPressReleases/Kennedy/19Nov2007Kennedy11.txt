         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washington  D C The American Prospect today released an article in its December  2007 issue by Edward M  Kennedy  The Supreme Courts Wrong TurnAnd How to Correct It  in which Senator Kennedy suggests ways to improve the process for Senate consideration of nominations to the Supreme Court    Now in their third term together on the Supreme Court  Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito have already moved the Supreme Courtand United States lawdramatically to the right  Their judicial record belies the commitment to open mindedness  modesty  and compassion they professed during their confirmation hearings  In hindsight  it is clear that the hearings failed to reveal Robertss and Alitos legal views   Kennedy urges the Senate to insist on more from Supreme Court nominees  Because Supreme Court Justices wield the power of final judicial review with lifetime tenure  the confirmation process is the most significant opportunity to have an informed national conversation about the pressing legal issues likely to be decided by the Court  Senators should therefore insist on obtaining a detailed explanation of nominees legal views  When the nominees record is unclear  Senators should insist that the nominees answer questions about previously decided cases  While many procedural reforms could improve the Senates ability to elicit key information  Kennedy argues that the single most important change will require only a bit of honesty  It doesnt compromise the integrity or the impartiality of the judiciary to require nominees to tell the Senate what they think about specific legal issues  The text of the article follows   The Supreme Courts Wrong TurnAnd How To Correct It   Reprinted with permission of The American Prospect   After posing as moderates in their confirmation hearings  Justices Roberts and Alito have moved the Court radically to the right  Henceforth  we should compel nominees to state how they would have ruled on specific cases  and why   BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY  Last May  the Supreme Court faced a textbook case of pay discrimination  Lilly Ledbetter was one of a few women supervisors working at a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant in Gadsden  Alabama  and she remained at the plant despite her bosses bias against women  One even told her that the plant did not need women  that women caused problems  For almost two decades  the company systematically downgraded her performance evaluations to pay her less than male colleagues who performed the same duties  Her pay eventually fell 15 percent to 40 percent behind her male counterparts   In 2003 a jury found that Ms  Ledbetter was paid less because she is a woman  and she was awarded full damages to correct the injustice  But in a 5 4 opinion  the Supreme Court held that Ms  Ledbetter was entitled to nothing at all  The majority ruled that she should have filed her case within a few months after the employer decided to pay her less than her male coworkers  Never mind that she had no way of knowing what other workers made  or that the discrimination continued with each paycheck  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  the sole female justice  observed in dissent  The Court does not comprehend  or is indifferent to  the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay discrimination   Unfortunately  the Ledbetter case is just one example of the Supreme Courts dangerous new direction since the additions of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito  It is vital that Americans understand how profoundly the newest justices are affecting the Court  and how their confirmation hearings failed to anticipate these developments  Whether or not it was possible to prevent confirmation of the presidents Supreme Court nominees by a Republican controlled Senate  the confirmation hearings should  at the very least  have informed the public about the nominees views on the pressing legal issues of our time  Their failure to do so makes clear that the Senate needs to reform the process by which it considers Supreme Court nominees   LOOKING BACK  As we enter the third year of the lifetime appointments of Roberts and Alito to the Court  it is clear that their approach to judging mocks the commitment to open mindedness  modesty  and compassion that they professed during their confirmation hearings  President Bush had openly expressed his desire to select judges who would satisfy the most radical voices in his political base  We now know that the president got exactly what he wanted   For two judges who repeatedly proclaimed in their confirmation hearings that they would bring no ideological agenda to the job and would decide cases with an open mind  Roberts and Alito have turned out to be remarkably like minded  They voted together in 92 percent of non unanimous cases in the 20062007 termthe highest rate of agreement of any two justices  edging out Antonin Scalias and Clarence Thomas 91 percent rate  In the previous term  Roberts and Alito voted together 88 percent of the time in non unanimous cases   For two judges who repeatedly proclaimed the need for judicial modesty  Roberts and Alito have turned out to be remarkably aggressive in overturning doctrines and statutes  Their disdain for precedent led Justice Stephen Breyer to recently observe  It is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much  Justice Scalia appeared to share this view  When Roberts claimed that a recent opinion involved only a modest change in the law  Scalia responded  This faux judicial restraint is judicial obfuscation   And for two judges who repeatedly proclaimed a concern for the real world impact of their decisions  Alito and Roberts have turned out to be remarkably blinded to the plight of Americas most vulnerable  Over and over again  theyve voted to narrow core rights and freedoms of the American people  and to expand the power of corporations and the executive branch   A few examples from the previous Supreme Court term show how the confirmation hearings elicited only platitudes  and thereby allowed the nominees to evade consideration of their views on the concrete legal issues likely to come before the Court  In the case of Lilly Ledbetter  the votes by Roberts and Alito to deprive her of a remedy for pay discrimination seem surprising in light of their testimony  In response to questions about protecting minorities and the powerless  Roberts claimed that he had argued for broader protection of civil rights on many occasions  and stressed that as a litigator he had argued on both sides of  the affirmative action  issue  Alito told the Committee that the judicial process has to be attentive to the fact that discrimination exists and  today  a lot of its driven underground   At their confirmation hearings  Roberts and Alito were asked repeatedly by senators on both sides of the aisle about their views on abortion  They assured the committee that they would follow Supreme Court precedents  but they refused to discuss in any detail how such precedents ought to be applied  or even to say whether they believed that Roe v  Wade and later cases interpreting it had been correctly decided  Soon after joining the Court  both justices cast aside recent precedent  voting to uphold a federal law banning a procedure for late term abortions that was virtually identical to a law the Court had struck down in 2000  The opinion joined by Roberts and Alito adopted the assumptionwhich has been refuted by empirical evidencethat women should be prevented from making certain abortion decisions because they often come to regret those decisions later  This paternalistic argument has opened the door for further incursions into Roe v  Wade   The recurring statements by Roberts and Alito during their confirmation hearings that they would respect precedent also conflict with their votes in FEC v  Wisconsin Right to Life  a 5 4 decision that struck down a key provision of the McCain Feingold campaign finance law regulating issue ads  This ruling essentially reversed a precedent that was only four years old  The Courts sharp reversal significantly hinders the ability of Congress to rein in runaway political spending  which has left many Americans disillusioned about the state of our democracy   Roberts and Alito also provided the decisive votes in cases limiting the basic rights of criminal defendants  In Bowles v  Russell  the Court rejected as untimely the appeal of a man facing 15 years in prison  even though he had filed his claim late only because he had relied on the word of a federal judge  who had mistakenly provided an incorrect deadline  As Justice David Souter said of this display of bureaucratic inhumanity  It is intolerable for the judicial system to treat people this way  and there is not even a technical justification for condoning this bait and switch   Yet when Roberts was asked about criminal sentencing during the confirmation process  he said that no Americanand certainly no judgewelcomes the fact that among the more than one million criminal convictions handed down yearly in the United States  some are erroneous  adding that it is the role of judges in both the state and federal systems to be constantly vigilant in guarding against wrongful convictions  Likewise  Alito affirmed that preventing the conviction of an innocent person is one of the most fundamental rights protected by our Constitution  These statements are difficult to reconcile with both Roberts and Alitos refusal to consider the claim of a man whose appeal was filed late because of a federal trial judges mistake  and with their votes against defendants in every one of the 20062007 terms non unanimous criminal cases    Perhaps the clearest indication of the ideological bent of Roberts and Alito came in the final decision of the term  Parents Involved in Community Schools v  Seattle School District No  1  a case testing the constitutionality of the use of race in voluntary desegregation programs in Seattle  Washington  and Jefferson County  Kentucky  School boards in these districts had adopted voluntary integration plans to achieve diverse educational environments and prevent the harms of segregated schools  Turning Brown v  Board of Education on its head  the Court equated these racially inclusive plans with the racially oppressive policies of Jim Crow  declaring them unconstitutional  Even more troubling  although a majority of the Court recognized that school boards and communities may take race into account when necessary to achieve integration  Roberts and Alito disagreed   The views of Roberts and Alito in the desegregation case stand in stark contrast to their testimony at their confirmation hearings  When he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee  Roberts was asked whether he believed that the Supreme Court in Brown v  Board of Education properly based its decision on the real world consideration of the role of public education at the time of its decision  He responded that you have to look at the discrimination in the context in which it is occurring  He explained that Brown held that the act of separation is what constituted the discrimination  Roberts also heartily agreed with my statement that having a diverse society where everyone has an equal chance to participate is an American value and is fundamental to the strength of our society  Alito likewise praised Brown and the diversity of students in the law school classes he taught   Yet Roberts opinion in Parents Involved completely ignored these principles  There was no detailed discussion of the racially segregated housing patterns that made segregated schools inevitable without action by the school districts  Also lacking was any serious description of the harm to minority children in racially segregated schools  although that harm was described extensively in the record and in amicus briefs submitted to the Court  Indeed  the inability to distinguish between the evils of forced segregation and the benefits of voluntary integration makes Roberts pledge to consider the real world context of discrimination ring hollow   LOOKING FORWARD  While it is important to appreciate just how alarming the previous Supreme Court term was  it is more important to identify constructive steps that can be taken in the months ahead  Certainly  where the Court has misinterpreted the intent of congressional statutes  Congress can act to correct the problem  Thus  in response to the Ledbetter case  a number of us in the Senate are sponsoring the bipartisan Fair Pay Restoration Act  which will restore the ability of employees to challenge ongoing pay discrimination within a reasonable time after receiving a discriminatory paycheck  Similar legislation has already passed the House   What is needed most  though  is a longer term solution  reforming the Supreme Court confirmation process  If there is one central lesson to be learned from the Roberts and Alito hearings  it is that general platitudes are no substitute for concrete statements about a nominees constitutional views  The Senate should require more from Supreme Court nominees   The stakes could hardly be higher  Because every Supreme Court term raises profound and controversial legal questions  every appointment to the Court has immense consequences for our nationnot just on hot button social issues such as abortion and affirmative action  but also on issues of workers rights  civil rights and civil liberties  health care  the environment  consumer safety  and the limits of executive power  to name just a few   Because the stakes are so high  I believe it is a defect in our judicial confirmation system that nominees can be confirmed to the Court without ever telling Americans what they think about the most pressing legal issues of our time  By this standard  the Roberts and Alito confirmation hearings were a failure  The White House concealed information about its nominees and insisted that the Senate confine its inquiry to their personal qualities  Many Republican senators used their time to praise the nominees  rather than to probe their legal philosophies  When faced with more pointed questions  Roberts and Alito stonewalled  On several critical issues  they refused to answer except in the most general terms  stating that it would be improper for them to discuss issues that might come before them when on the bench   All of this is backward  The White House should be forthcoming about the beliefs of the candidates it puts forward  After all  those beliefs were the principal reason the president selected them  The Senate should ask tough questions about the nominees constitutional views  and the nominees should answer them  Senators on both sides of the aisle should agree that  at a minimum  nominees must give full and forthright responses when asked about their legal views   Supreme Court nominees like Roberts and Alito  however  have drawn a line in the sand and refused to answer these questions  To do so  they claim  would compromise their duty to decide every case with an open mind  This argument was designed to give an air of nobility to the nominees refusal to answer reasonable questions posed by the Judiciary Committee  The reality is that political convenience  not principle  motivated much of this rhetoric  Legal scholars increasingly agree that judicial nominees can be candid about their views on many issues without doing damage to the judicial system or the rights of future litigants  All nominees to the Supreme Court should have spent many years thinking deeply about legal issues  To keep the American people in the dark about that thinking is not noble  it is a violation of our constitutional design and our democratic principles  It prevents the Senate from carrying out its constitutional obligation to evaluate Supreme Court candidates   As former Chief Justice William Rehnquist once wrote  It would be not merely unusual  but extraordinary  if  Supreme Court nominees  had not at least given opinions as to constitutional issues in their previous legal careers  Proof that a Justices mind at the time he joined the Court was a complete tabula rasa in the area of constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification  not lack of bias  In fact  a recent decision by Scalia  in Republican Party of Minnesota v  White  affirmed that judges who run for office are free to announce their views on controversial legal and political issues  without prejudicing their role in deciding those issues from the bench   We know from their past decisions how all of the current justices interpret Roe v  Wade  yet they are not precluded from sitting on future cases involving abortion  Why shouldnt we also learn how Supreme Court nominees view that decision and other important cases  If all nominees were expected to answer these questions  the White House would no longer seek out stealth nominees whose views are largely unknown   To protect the independence and autonomy of the courts  questions addressed to specific pending or future cases should be avoided  But there is no good reason for nominees to refuse to state how they would have voted in cases the Supreme Court has already decided  The facts  briefs  and oral arguments from those cases are all a matter of public record  Questions about decided cases should be at the heart of confirmation hearings  because they provide the most concrete information available about what kind of justice the nominee will be  Judges decide real cases  To be able to evaluate nominees in a meaningful way  the Senate and the public need to know how a nominee is likely to decide them   Nor should nominees who previously served as high ranking government officials  as Roberts and Alito did  be able to get away with claiming they were just representing a client when asked about advice they gave as legal policy makers  It is fair to ask whether they personally agree with the legal positions they advocated in their prior roles   If senators can agree that obtaining a detailed explanation of nominees legal views is the goal of the confirmation process  it should be possible to adopt procedural reforms to support that goal  The Senate should insist on having the same access as the administration does to the nominees writings and other relevant documents  and it should receive those records before the confirmation hearing begins  Each member of the Judiciary Committee should have the right to submit a limited number of written questions to the nominee  which the nominee must answer in writing under oath before the confirmation hearings  The Judiciary Committee might also consider allowing longer rounds of questions at the hearings to permit more in depth dialogue  While many procedural reforms could improve the Senates ability to elicit the information so important to the public  the single most fundamental change will require only a bit of honesty  Everyone should acknowledge that it does not compromise the integrity or impartiality of the judiciary to require nominees to tell the Senate what they think about specific legal issues   It is no exaggeration to say that the next Supreme Court appointee will have a decisive role in shaping the law on abortion  affirmative action  campaign finance  federalism  and countless other matters  Regardless of the outcome  Americans have a right to learn how a nominee views the law before it is too late  After posing as moderates in their confirmation hearings  extremist justices have moved the Supreme Court far to the right of the American mainstream  I have participated in 23 hearings on nominations to the Court  and the Roberts and Alito hearings stand out for their failure to illuminate the substance of the nominees legal views   The next Supreme Court justice may well be nominated by a Democratic president and sent to a Democratic Senate for confirmation  But the need for reform transcends party politics  and nowwhen there is no nomination on the horizon and it is unclear who will make the next nominationis an opportune time for the parties to work together for reform   Democracy and the Constitution are poorly served by silence and secrecy  Many steps can be taken to repair our system for nominating and confirming Supreme Court justices  but the most basic step is to demand a more searching and honest process   Senator Edward M
