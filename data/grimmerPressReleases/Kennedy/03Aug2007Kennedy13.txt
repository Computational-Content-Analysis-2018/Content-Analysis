         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  put out the following statement regarding todays jobs numbers that reflect a notable increase in long term unemployment  More than 1 3 million Americans who are currently looking for work have been seeking a job for 26 weeks or more  an increase of nearly 200 000 since last month  Kennedy is the sponsor of legislation that will modernize the unemployment insurance system  S  1871  Below is his statement  Todays jobs numbers show the paradox of the modern economy  while the overall picture is good  many working families are facing tremendous insecurity  struggling for months to find a good  family supporting job  The numbers reflect that profound shifts in our national economy are leaving more and more working Americans behind  We need to focus national attention on helping these hardworking people recapture the American dream  I have recently introduced a bipartisan proposal to modernize our unemployment insurance system and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation The Unemployment Insurance Modernization ActThe Unemployment Insurance  UI  program must be reformed to address fundamental shifts in the economy  The UI system provides needed benefits to millions of U S  workers each year  But the system needs to be updated to better assist todays more highly mobile workforce and long term unemployed workers left behind by declining industries  Today  many unemployed workers do not qualify for benefits because their most recent work is not taken into account  Others exhaust their benefits before finding work  joining 1 1 million long term unemployed workers and an additional 1 5 million discouraged job seekers struggling to get by  For these reasons  only 35  of unemployed workers currently collect unemployment benefits  The UI Modernization Act uses  7 billion in incentive payments to encourage states to update their UI systems  The bill rewards states for   1  removing barriers that block coverage for low wage and part time workers   2  ensuring a more family friendly UI system  and  3  helping dislocated workers increase their skills  It also provides  500 million in funding to states to improve the administration of their unemployment compensation systems  The incentive and administrative payments are both fully paid for from the UI trust fund and through an extension of the existing FUTA surtax  assumed in the Presidents budget  The UI Modernization Act would give states the resources and flexibility they need to pass important reforms  Each state would have a chance to receive a share of the  7 billion set aside for incentive payments  To receive one third of its allotted funds  a state must adopt an alternative base period allowing workers to meet eligibility requirements by counting their most recent wages  This makes the system  which has traditionally relied on wage data that is up to six months old  more accurate and helps workers who have recently satisfied earnings requirements to collect the benefits they deserve  States that have already adopted such a system would also receive these incentive payments States that adopt or have adopted two of the following reforms benefiting workers will receive the additional two thirds of their share of funds  Family related needs  Providing unemployment compensation for workers who have voluntarily left their jobs due to the illness or disability of an immediate family member  the relocation of a spouse for employment  or domestic violence  Job training  Providing training benefits to unemployed workers laid off from a declining occupation who are enrolled in a state approved training program for entry into a high demand occupation  Part time work  Providing unemployment compensation benefits to individuals seeking part time work   Uniform 26 weeks  Raising maximum compensation caps so that all long term unemployed workers can receive a full 26 weeks of benefits  Child Assistance  Paying unemployed workers at least an extra  15 per week for each of the workers dependents
