         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Access to mental health services is one of the most important civil rights issues facing the nation  For too long  persons living with mental disorders have suffered discriminatory treatment at all levels of society  They have been forced to pay more for the services they need and to worry about their job security if their employer finds out about their condition  Sadly  in America today  patients with biochemical problems in their liver are treated with more compassion than those with biochemical problems in their brain   That kind of discriminatory treatment must end  No one questions the need for affordable treatment of physical illnesses  But those who suffer from mental illnesses face serious barriers in obtaining the services they need at prices they can afford  Like those suffering from physical illnesses  persons with mental disorders deserve the opportunity for quality care  The failure by a patient to obtain treatment can mean years of shattered dreams and unfulfilled potential  Americans with mental illness deserve health and happiness too  just as do those with physical illness   Almost eleven years ago  Congress passed the first Mental Health Parity Act  While that legislation was an important first step in bringing attention to discriminatory practices against the mentally ill  it did little to correct the injustices that so many Americans continue to face  The 1996 legislation required that annual and lifetime dollar limits for mental health coverage must be no less than the limits for medical and surgical coverage  But more steps are clearly needed to guarantee that Americans suffering from mental illnesses are not forced to pay more for the services they need  face harsher limitations on treatment  or be denied access to care   The bill in front of us today is our chance to take these needed actions to end the longstanding discrimination against Americans suffering from mental illness  The late Senator Paul Wellstone and Senator Pete Domenici deserve great credit for their bipartisan leadership on mental health parity  If it were not for them  we would not be here today   This bill we will vote on today  the Mental Health Parity Act of 2007  prohibits group health plans from imposing treatment limitations or financial requirements on the coverage of mental health conditions that do not also apply to physical conditions  That means no limits on days or treatment visits  and no exorbitant co payments or deductibles  The bill was negotiated by and has the support of the mental health community  the business community  and the insurance industry   The need is clear  One in five Americans will suffer some form of mental illness this year  but only one third of them will receive treatment  Millions of our fellow citizens are unnecessarily enduring the pain and sadness of seeing a family member  friend  or loved one battle illnesses that seize the mind and break the spirit   Battling mental illness is itself a painful process  but discrimination against persons with such illnesses is especially cruel  since the success rates for treatment often equal or surpass those for physical conditions  According to the National Institute of Mental Health  clinical depression treatment can be 70  successful  and treatment for schizophrenia can be 60  successful   Over the years we have heard compelling testimony from experts  activists  and patients about the need to equalize coverage of physical and mental illnesses  The Office of Personnel Management told us that providing full parity to 8 5 million federal employees has led to minimal premium increases  We heard dramatic testimony about the economic and social advantages of parity  including a healthier  more productive workforce   Some of the most compelling testimony came several years ago from Lisa Cohen  a hardworking American from New Jersey  Lisa suffers from both physical and mental illnesses  and is forced to pay exorbitant costs for treating her mental disorder  while paying little for her physical disorder  She is typical of millions of Americans who not only face the cruel burden of mental illness  but also the cruel burden of discriminatory treatment  No American should be denied equal treatment of an illness because it starts in the brain instead of the heart  lungs  or other parts of their body  No patient should be denied access to the treatment that can cure their illness because of where they live or work   A number of states have already enacted mental health parity laws  but we still have 86 million workers under ERISA that have no protection under state mental health   Mental health parity also is a good investment for the nation  The costs from lost worker productivity and extra physical care outweigh the costs of implementing parity for mental health treatment   Over the years study after study shows that parity makes good financial sense  A study of more than 46 000 workers at major companies shows that employees who report being depressed or under stress are likely to have substantially higher health costs than co workers without such conditions  Employees who reported being depressed had health bills 70  higher than those who did not suffer from depression  Those reporting high stress had 46  higher health costs  McDonnell Douglas found a 4 to 1 return on investment after accounting for lower medical claims  reduced absenteeism  and smaller turnover   Mental illness costs the nation  300 billion each year in treatment expenses  lost worker productivity  and crime  This country can afford mental health parity  What we cant afford is to continue denying persons with mental disorders the care they need  Today is a historic day  We are finally moving towards ending this most shameful form of discrimination in our society  discrimination against mental illness  This bill has been seven years in the making  and brings first class medicine to millions of Americans who have been second class patients for too long  Today  we will begin to right that wrong  by guaranteeing equal treatment to the 11 million people receiving mental health services today  and promising equal treatment to the remaining 100 million insured workers and their families who never know the day they may need to access their mental health benefit  The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 was an important step towards ending health insurance discrimination against mental illness  This bill will take another step forward by closing the loopholes that remain and ensuring that   The co payments  deductibles  coinsurance  out of pocket expenses and annual and lifetime limits that apply to mental health benefits are no different than those applied to medical and surgical benefits   The frequency of treatment  number of visits  days of coverage and other limits on scope and duration of treatment for mental health services are no different than those applied to medical and surgical benefits   This treatment and financial equity is also applied to substance abuse   The features of state law that require the coverage of mental disorders are protected to assure to those currently protected by state parity laws that their needs will be met   The medical management strategies needed to ensure access to  not denial of  medically needed services for patients remains intact   Finally  this bill is modeled on the parity that has been provided to the 8 5 million persons  including the Members of Congress through the Federal Employee Benefits Program   Equal treatment of those affected by mental illness is not just an insurance issue  it is a civil rights issue  At its heart  mental health parity is a question of simple justice   It is long past time to end insurance discrimination and guarantee all people with mental illness the coverage they deserve  I urge every member of this committee this important step forward in supporting todays effort towards meeting that goal  106 Organizations Supporting The Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 Domenici Kennedy Enzi  S  558  February 14  2007
