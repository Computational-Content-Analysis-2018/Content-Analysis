         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today during the second day of debate on his plan to raise the minimum wage  Senator Kennedy continued his push for a clean bill  He outlined the five top reasons that the bill should be free from extraneous measures  Below is Senator Kennedys statement  as prepared for delivery FIVE REASONS MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS DESERVE A CLEAN BILLMinimum wage workers have been waiting almost 10 years  longer than ever before in history  for a raise  During that time  the real value of the minimum wage has plummeted more than 20   and minimum wage workers continue to fall further and further behind each day  The first reason that this bill should remain clean is that adding a tax package to this bill creates procedural hurdles that will delay  perhaps significantly  the implementation of the increase  Minimum wage workers could wait months for the raise they so clearly deserve  Secondly  weve had bipartisan support for minimum wage increases in the past with no tax giveaways  Weve increased the minimum wage nine times since the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act  under both Republican and Democratic Administrations  Only once  in 1996  did we pair a minimum wage increase with tax cuts  Previous increases have seen strong bipartisan support  despite the lack of business giveaways  In 1989  a minimum wage raise with no tax cuts passed by a margin of 89 8  In 1977 an increase with no giveaways passed 63 24  Thirdly  businesses can afford to give workers a raise and employers can afford to increase wages in the current economy  Workers are producing more  but earning less  Productivity has increased by 29 percent since 1997  and corporate profits have increased by 45  yet minimum wage workers have not received a raise  The fourth reason that workers deserve a clean bill is that small businesses agree they are not impacted by a minimum wage increase  A recent Gallup poll found that 86  of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business  and three out of four small businesses said that an increase in the minimum wage would have no effect on their company  Many small businesses are already paying higher wages in order to recruit and retain quality workers  A higher minimum wage actually benefits them  because it levels the playing field and allows them to compete with bigger businesses Lastly  raising wages is actually good for business and good for the local economy Businesses benefit from a minimum wage increase because higher wages improve worker loyalty  increase employee tenure  and lower employee hiring and training costs Studies of Baltimore  Boston  Los Angeles  and San Francisco have shown that firms enjoy lower turnover among employees and improved productivity after a minimum wage increase  Turnover for home care workers in San Francisco fell by 57 percent after implementing living wage policies  After San Francisco raised its minimum wage to  8 40  the average job tenure of workers in fast food restaurants increased by 3 5 months  In Los Angeles  firms affected by a living wage ordinance had one third less turnover among low wage workers than firms not affected by the wage increase  Absenteeism also declined  Many communities are suffering in the current economy  especially low income communities  Increasing the minimum wage will give workers more money to meet the cost of their basic needs  They will spend it immediately  pumping money back into the local economy  creating jobs and benefiting local businesses  Business leaders across the country recognize that a wage raise is good for business  and good for America  Almost 300 large and small business owners across the country have joined Business for Shared Prosperity  an organization of business leaders fighting for a fair minimum wage Even Wal Mart CEO Lee Scott supports an increase  and has publicly called for Congress to raise the minimum wage  Hes observed first hand that many of his customers are struggling to get by  They simply don t have the money to buy basic necessities between pay checks  he says  Scott supports an increase because he knows its good for the working families that shop at his stores  and  ultimately  good for his business        Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
