         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS AND CASE DESCRIPTIONS INCLUDED   As prepared for delivery   Thank you  Melody  for that generous introduction  and thank you for your vision and effective leadership on so many issues of such paramount concern to the nation  Our Judiciary Committee in the Senate today just isn t the same without you    I m grateful to the Center for American Progress for hosting us here today  and I commend you for the difference you ve already begun to make  Keep up the great work   It s an honor to be here to address all of you on the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court  As you know so well  the stakes for our nation could not be higher  This is the vote of a generation  If confirmed  this nominee will have an enormous impact on our basic rights and liberties for years and even decades to come   The Alito hearings  as well as those for Chief Justice Roberts before them  show the need for change in the way we learn a nominee s views on our laws and the Constitution  Instead of a free and honest exchange of ideas  our hearings have become stylized and choreographed appearances in which nominees are coached to say as little as possible  When it comes to lifetime appointments to the highest court in the land  surely the American people deserve better    After all  the Supreme Court is the guardian of our most cherished rights and freedoms  They are protected by the most solemn promises of the Constitution  and symbolized in the four eloquent words inscribed above the entrance to the Supreme Court   Equal Justice Under Law   Those words are meant to guarantee that our courts will be an independent check against abuses of power by the other two branches of government  It is a commitment that our courts will always be a place where the poor  the powerless  and the underprivileged can stand on equal footing with the wealthy  the powerful  and the privileged  and the Senate has a constitutional duty to ensure that any person confirmed to the Court will uphold that clear ideal   The nomination of Judge Alito is particularly significant because it comes at a time of new challenges for the nation and for the Court       Suddenly  in this new century  we face unprecedented claims by the White House for sweeping expansions of Presidential power that are grave threats to the rule of law       Despite progress in recent decades  we continue to face serious inequalities and injustices in our society  as demonstrated so clearly by the immense tragedy a few months ago in the wake of Hurricane Katrina       We face new controversies over governmental intrusion into people s private lives    from the interference with personal medical decisions on how long a loved one should be kept on life support  to new attempts to limit or even deny a woman s reproductive decisions      We face new attacks on the progress we ve made in civil rights  The signs proclaiming  whites only  may be gone  but we know that discrimination and bigotry in countless other manifestations still blight our society and limit opportunity    One of the most important of all the responsibilities of the Supreme Court is to enforce the constitutional limitations on Presidential power  A Justice must have the courage and the wisdom to speak truth to power    to tell even the President that he has gone too far   Chief Justice John Marshall was that kind of Justice when he told President Jefferson that he had exceeded his war making powers under the Constitution  Justice Robert Jackson was that kind of Justice when he told President Truman that he could not misuse the Korean War as an excuse to take over the nation s steel mills  Chief Justice Warren Burger was that kind of Justice when he told President Nixon to turn over the White House tapes on Watergate  And Justice Sandra Day O Connor was that kind of Justice when she told President Bush that  a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the nation s citizens    We need that kind of Justice on the Court as much as ever  For today  we have a President who believes that torture can be an acceptable practice  despite laws and treaties that explicitly prohibit it  We have a President who claims the power to arrest American citizens on American soil and jail them for years  without the benefit of counsel or access to the courts  We have a President who claims he has the authority to spy on American citizens on American soil without a court order    The record of Judge Alito is clear and ominous  Examine his writings  Read the transcript of the hearings  Consider the cases he s decided  The record demonstrates that we cannot count on Judge Alito to blow the whistle when the President is out of bounds    Judge Alito is a longstanding advocate for expansion of executive power  even at the expense of individual liberty  His statements show that he favors a far greater role for the President than is currently recognized by the Supreme Court   In his now notorious job application to the Justice Department  he cast doubt on the role of the Court as well  He said   I believe very strongly   in the supremacy of the elected branches of government   He never explained his reason for advocating such an extraordinary departure from the basic understanding of the Constitution  that the Courts are intended to be co equal with the President and Congress  When asked about his extreme statement  he said only that it was  inapt   That s certainly true  but it does not begin to tell the American people why he would make a statement so at odds with the basic system of checks and balances that have guided our democracy for two centuries    Judge Alito  s testimony gave us no clue  but one thing is clear  If the elected branches become supreme  the Supreme Court will not be able to fulfill its historic role of enforcing constitutional limits on Presidential power  His statement may have been music to the ears of the Reagan Justice Department  but it was a shock of a thousand volts to all of us who care about our democracy and the rule of law   Judge Alito s consistent advocacy of what he called  the gospel  of the  unitary executive  is just as troubling  Professor Steven Calabresi  one of the originators of the unitary executive theory and a co founder of the Federalist Society  has acknowledged that  if the concept is implemented  it would produce a radical change in how the government operates  As he wrote in the Harvard Law Review in 1992   The practical consequence of this theory is dramatic  it renders unconstitutional independent agencies and counsels to the extent that they exercise discretionary executive power     Independent agencies such as the Federal Election Commission  created to see that our voting laws are properly enforced and interpreted  would be subject to the President s control  The same is true of the Securities and Exchange Commission  which is charged with preventing corporate abuses such as we recently saw in the case of Enron  with tragic consequences for American workers  It would compromise the historic independence of the Federal Reserve Board  giving the President unprecedented and dangerous power to manipulate the economy  It would compromise the mission of every agency created to protect hard working Americans from the exploitation of those who care only about profits  not the health and welfare and the very safety of their employees   Nor is the impact of this bizarre theory limited to the independence of administrative agencies  It has a major effect on other assertions of Presidential power as well  Discussing President Bush s aggressive claims for unprecedented executive power in the field of national security  even Professor Calabresi stated recently that without accepting such a theory   there would be no way the Bush Administration s anti terrorism policies could be constitutionally justified    During his confirmation hearing  Judge Alito attempted to downplay his extreme views of executive power  But he did not disavow them  He refused to candidly discuss his current view of the constitutional limits on Presidential power  Instead  he pointed to the Supreme Court s rejection of the unitary executive theory  He cited the Court s decision affirming that independent counsels who investigate executive branch abuses can be removed from presidential control   But a speech he gave in 2000 to the Federalist society provides insight into his real view  He stated that he believed that  the theory of the unitary executive best captures the meaning of the Constitution s text and structure   He went on to strongly criticize those rulings rejecting the theory of the unitary executive  He then outlined a strategy for bypassing the Court s precedents  including the same independent counsel case he claimed to support in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee last week   When Judge Alito made that speech  he was not applying for a job in the Justice Department  He d already been serving as an appellate judge for ten years  The timing of the speech to the Federalist Society may be significant  In November 2000  the Florida recount was on  and the right wing was salivating over the prospect that George Bush would prevail in that close election  Judge Alito may well have been submitting his application for a Supreme Court nomination    Judge Alito also failed to satisfactorily explain his controversial advice  as a Justice Department official  that  the President s understanding of a bill should be just as important as that of Congress   He recommended that when the President signs a bill passed by Congress  he should issue a signing statement announcing his own interpretation of the law  in the hope of influencing the way courts would construe the law  That proposal was clearly the recommendation of an activist seeking to reduce the power of Congress and expand Presidential power beyond its traditional boundary  The fundamental role of Congress is to pass laws and define what those laws mean in the text of the statutes themselves or in their legislative history  That power is exclusively for Congress  not the President  As Justice Hugo Black wrote in the steel seizure case   In the framework of our Constitution  the President s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker  The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad    Some years ago  the Supreme Court rejected the line item veto as unconstitutional  It reaffirmed Justice Black s view that Presidents may either veto or sign bills that Congress passes  They cannot pick and choose the provisions they will enact  But the kinds of signing statements that Judge Alito advocates amount to a back door line item veto of congressional actions    President Bush showed this with his recent signing statement on a bill that contained Senator McCain s ban on torture  In that statement  the President reserved the right to ignore the McCain requirements  and even asserted that in certain circumstances his actions are beyond the reach of the courts    These views exalting Presidential power are troubling enough on their own  But they are also reflected in Judge Alito s decisions as a judge  His record on the bench only reinforces the deep concerns raised by his broad expressions of support for executive power  His deference to executive power is especially clear in cases where persons claimed the government violated the privacy and security of their homes  He refuses to enforce core constitutional standards protecting individuals against low level government officials in routine situations  and there is no reason to believe he will say no to a President who violates individual rights under the cloak of national security   Time and again in cases involving claims of privacy  security  and freedom from unjustified searches and seizures under the Bill of Rights  he has accepted the government s defense  That was true in his dissent defending a strip search of a 10 year old girl without a warrant  Even now  when asked about the decision  Judge Alito repeatedly refuses to admit that he was wrong  Michael Chertoff  the former head of the Criminal Division in the Department of Justice  who is now President Bush s Secretary of Homeland Security  served with Judge Alito in that case  and he sharply criticized Judge Alito s view as threatening to turn the requirement of a search warrant into  little more than the clich     rubber stamp     In still another case  Judge Alito ruled that it was reasonable for marshals carrying out an unresisted civil eviction to pump a sawed off shotgun at a farming family sitting in their living room  The family had committed no crime  A fellow judge on the case dissented and called the marshals  conduct  Gestapo like   since  seven marshals had detained and terrorized a family and friends  and ransacked a home  while carrying out an unresisted civil eviction   Yet Judge Alito s decision meant that the family never got a trial before a jury of their peers    In another area of controversy  his views on issues of particular concern to women should give every woman pause    from his role in striking down key provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act  to his opposition to the privacy of women s reproductive decisions  He was unwilling to accept the constitutional right of privacy recognized by the current Supreme Court  Judge Alito s testimony failed to resolve the very serious concerns that he s itching to overturn Roe v  Wade  He said that he will keep an  open mind  on the issue    but that is no comfort to those who know his record   That record includes his 1985 memo to the Reagan Administration s Solicitor General  In that memo  he advised that the best way to undermine Roe was by gradually chipping away at its protections  and we have every reason to believe that he will do exactly that if confirmed to the Supreme Court  On the Court of Appeals  he was required to follow Supreme Court decisions  but as a member of the Supreme Court  he will be free to overrule those precedents with which he disagrees  no matter how well established and long standing   A third area of major concern is Judge Alito s record on civil rights  He has a 15 year record on the Court of Appeals  and the facts are inescapable  The weight of his record in job discrimination cases is against the victims of discrimination  Time and again  he voted to make it more difficult than the law intended for victims to prevail in court or uphold a verdict in their favor   His written opinions on racial discrimination in employment have consistently ruled against African Americans on the merits of claims alleging such discrimination  During the hearings  his supporters pointed out that he joined opinions by other judges supporting such claims in two cases  and issued procedural opinions in supporting such claims in several other cases  But on opinions he has authored  he has issued no less than 30 decisions dismissing job discrimination claims  In many of the cases where he voted against the victims  his fellow judges ruled that they had a valid claim of discrimination    In one case  a hotel worker claimed she was denied a promotion because she was an African American  The Third Circuit held she was entitled to a trial  because the employer had falsely stated that she was unqualified and had evaluated her qualifications differently compared to white applicants  But Judge Alito would have denied her the chance to prove her case  His colleagues on the court wrote that his dissent would have  eviscerated  the employee s statutory right to be free from job discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964    In another case in which a disabled person sought physical access to medical school under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973  the court s majority wrote that  few if any Rehabilitation Act cases would survive  if Judge Alito s view prevailed    In another case  a jury ruled that a woman had provided enough evidence to show she had wrongly lost her job because of sex discrimination  Ten members of the Third Circuit who heard the case on appeal agreed  and only Judge Alito argued that she hadn t provided adequate proof of discrimination    In still another dissent  Judge Alito voted to deny a mentally retarded young man the chance to challenge severe abuse  In his very first job out of high school  he had suffered vicious sexual harassment  He was held down in front of a group of workers  subjected to sexual touching  and he feared he would be raped  The employer did not dispute the facts  Yet Judge Alito would have denied him a trial   Judge Alito even dissented from a ruling prohibiting the removal of African American jurors because of their race  It s unbelievable in today s America  in a case involving a minority defendant  that he was willing to ignore overwhelming evidence that the government insisted on an all white jury   These cases are not isolated instances  It s all in the record  Law professors at Judge Alito s alma mater  Yale Law School  analyzed more than 400 of his published opinions and concluded    In the area of civil rights law  Judge Alito consistently has used procedural and evidentiary standards to rule against female  minority  age and disability claimants       In the context of these civil rights cases  Judge Alito seems relatively willing to defer to the claims of employers and the government  over those individuals advancing civil rights claims    Other objective observers who have examined Judge Alito s record have reached a similar conclusion  According to an analysis by the respected University of Chicago law professor  Cass Sunstein   when there is a conflict between institutions and individual rights  Judge Alito s dissenting opinions argued against individual rights 84  of the time  In almost all of the cases in which Judge Alito dissented in order to reject an individual rights claim  he was sitting on a court with a majority of Republican appointees     A comprehensive review of Judge Alito s published opinions by Knight Ridder similarly found that Judge Alito has  seldom sided  with  an employee alleging discrimination  and  almost never found a government search unconstitutional           An analysis published by the Washington Post found that  routinely  he defers to government officials and others in positions of authority  and has  very little sympathy for those asserting rights against the government    In sum  in case after case  Judge Alito s decisions demonstrate a systematic tilt toward powerful institutions  and against individuals attempting to vindicate their rights  He cites a few instances in which he has decided for the little guy  but they are few and far between   Justice Lewis Powell captured the spirit of America best when he said   Equal justice under law is not merely a caption on the fa  ade of the Supreme Court building  It is perhaps the most inspiring idea of our society  It is one of the ends for which our entire legal system exists    In evaluating Supreme Court nominees  there is no more important question than whether they are dedicated to equal justice under law  Judge Alito is a highly intelligent man  but his record does not show a judge who is willing to enforce the constitutional limitations on executive power when government officials intrude on individual rights   His record does not show a judge who is open to the claims of vulnerable individuals asking only justice against powerful institutions   His record does not show a judge who upholds the liberty and privacy of citizens seeking to protect their fundamental rights   His record just does not show a judge who is committed to equal justice under law   That is why I oppose his confirmation to the Supreme Court  and I fervently hope that the Senate will do so as well   SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS   PDF S AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST  Alito s 2000 Federalist Society Speech Alito s 1986 Memo on Presidential

DuPont de Nemours and Co  Glass v  Philadelphia Electric Co  Pirolli v  World Flavors  Inc  Riley v  Taylor  CASE SUMMARIES  Doe v  Groody Police officers searched a residence for drugs  pursuant to a search warrant  Inside the house  the officers met the suspect s wife and their ten year old daughter  The officers took the two females to an upstairs bathroom and stripped searched them  No drugs were found  The plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the police officers claiming that the officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights by performing the strip search  The parties conducted discovery and filed motions for summary judgment  The police officers argued  in part  that the lawsuit should be dismissed because they were entitled to qualified immunity  The trial court granted summary judgment to two officers  but denied qualified immunity to four others  who were directly involved in the strip search   The defendants appealed  the Government is allowed to appeal immediately an adverse ruling on qualified immunity   The Third Circuit majority affirmed the trial court and held that the four officers were not entitled to qualified immunity  Judge Alito dissented and argued that   1  the strip searches were authorized by the search warrant  and  2  even if the strip searches were not authorized  the officers were entitled to qualified immunity   Mellott v  Heemer A group of dairy farmers declared bankruptcy and their property was sold at public auction  They were ordered to vacate the premises  However  they refused to leave  In response  a team of five deputy marshals forcibly evicted the farmers from their former property  The farmers claimed that the marshals used excessive force in conducting the eviction  The dairy farmers sued the deputy U S  marshals  The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants violated their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures and their Fifth Amendment right to substantive due process  The defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity  The trial court denied the motion  and the defendants appealed  the Government is allowed to appeal immediately an adverse ruling on qualified immunity   Judge Alito reversed the trial court s order  He ruled that the marshals acted reasonably and therefore were entitled to qualified immunity  Judge Rendell dissented and argued that the jury should decide whether the marshals violated the plaintiffs  constitutional rights   Bray v  Marriott Hotels Marriott promoted a white employee instead of an African American employee  The African American employee sued Marriott  claiming racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  The parties conducted discovery  and Marriott moved for summary judgment  The trial court held that the plaintiff had established a prima facie case of discrimination  Marriott did not appeal the ruling   However  the court also ruled that Marriott had rebutted the plaintiff s prima facie case by offering evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason for its promotion decision  Therefore  the court granted Marriott summary judgment  The plaintiff appealed  The Third Circuit majority reversed the trial court and held that the jury should decide whether Marriott violated Title VII  Judge Alito dissented and argued that the plaintiff had not presented enough evidence to go to the jury    Nathanson v  Medical College of Pennsylvania Nathanson applied for and was granted admission to the Medical College of Pennsylvania  MCP   Nathanson had several discussions with school officials regarding injuries she sustained in a car accident and the barriers her injuries posed to pursuing studies at MCP  Nathanson claimed she had made clear to school officials that she would need certain accommodations  mainly a special chair  in order to participate in medical school training  School officials argued that Nathanson never made her requirements clear  Nathanson sued MCP alleging violations of the Rehabilitation Act and tortuous interference with contract  MCP moved for summary judgment and the District Court granted MCP summary judgment on all counts  Nathanson appealed  The majority affirmed the District Court s grant of summary judgment in favor of MCP on the tortious interference claim but reversed the District Court with regard to the Rehabilitation Act claim finding there were sufficient issues of fact requiring trial  Alito dissented and argued that Nathanson s Rehabilitation Act claim should be dismissed as well because she had not presented sufficient evidence to show that MCP failed to adequately accommodate her   Sheridan v  E I  DuPont de Nemours and Co  Sheridan was a  Head Captain  in a hotel owned by DuPont  She sued for sex discrimination after she was denied a promotion to  Manager of Restaurants  claiming her employer created an intolerable work environment which ultimately resulted in her constructive discharge  After discovery  DuPont moved for summary judgment  The District Court denied DuPont s motion and the case went to trial  The jury found in favor of Sheridan on her constructive discharge claim  DuPont then moved for judgment as a matter of law and the District Court granted this motion claiming Sheridan failed to present sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that DuPont s actions were taken because of Sheridan s sex  Sheridan appealed  The majority of the 3rd Circuit  sitting en banc  ruled in favor of Sheridan and determined that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury s verdict and that the question of constructive discharge was a question for the jury  Alito alone dissented and argued for a more restrictive standard for proving gender discrimination    Pirolli v  World Flavors  Inc  Plaintiff  a young man with an IQ of 75  claimed that other employees created a hostile work environment and disparate treatment based on sex and disability  According to the plaintiff  coworkers physically assaulted him  including a coworker rubbing his penis against Pirolli s behind and as coworkers watched as another coworker attempted to push a broom pole into the plaintiff s behind   The plaintiff stated that he reported the incidents to his supervisor  but the supervisor failed to hail the harassment  The trial court granted summary judgments  on all claims  to the defendants  The trial court dismissed the plaintiff s Title VII and ADA against his supervisor  on the grounds that individuals who are not employers cannot be held liable under those acts  The trial court granted summary judgment for the employer finding that the harassment was  macho horseplay and adolescent rough housing  that did not constitute discrimination  Pirolli appealed  joined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  which filed an amicus brief siding with him  The Third Circuit reversed the trial court  finding that what Pirolli experienced went beyond ordinary horseplay and constituted  persistent conduct that a reasonable jury could view as having occurred because of his sex and as severe and pervasive enough to create an abusive work environment   The majority concluded that a psychologist s report in conjunction with Pirillo s testimony raised a triable issue of fact  Judge Alito  however  agreed with the trial court not because Pirolli does not present triable issues but  because th e  argument is not adequately presented    Riley v  Taylor James Riley  an African American  was convicted and sentenced to death for felony murder by an all white jury  After several unsuccessful post conviction motions and appeals  Riley filed a motion in federal court to challenge his conviction  In the District Court Riley argued that  1  jurors were wrongly excluded based on their race  violating the 14th Amendment s Equal Protection Clause  and  2  that the jury had been misled about their responsibility in applying the death penalty  The District Court denied his motion on all grounds  and a divided three judge panel affirmed  with Alito authoring the majority opinion  Ultimately the 3rd Circuit agreed to hear Riley s appeal en banc  The en banc majority held that the lower court failed to evaluate the proferred race neutral reasons for excluding black jurors in the light of contradictory evidence about the high rate at which the same prosecutor s office had excluded blacks in the past  Alito dissented and minimized the majority s concerns by comparing the evidence of black juror exclusion to the tendency for President s to be left handed   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
