         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today Senator Kennedy issued a statement following the President s teleconference with troops and the Administration s latest report on the war  The report was required by a provision that Senators Kennedy and Durbin attached to the Iraq supplemental in May in order to hold the Administration accountable for making sure that the American people  and our soldiers    know the real progress we are making in training Iraqis and our ability to transfer responsibility for security over to Iraqis  Also required in the report is an estimate of the level of US troops that will be necessary in Iraq in the future  The law required the Administration to issue its first report on July 11 and then every 90 days thereafter  Today President Bush told the troops that we will never accept anything less than total victory  Accepting total victory does not mean a plan is in place to achieve it  Victory for the people of Iraq  our soldiers and the American people requires more than high tech photo ops  It requires a plan for success  For the last two and a half years  the President has operated on a make it up as we go along approach that pushed victory further from our reach     Even today  the Administration submitted a report to Congress on troop training that again failed to set out a plan  They won t tell American people what they want to know    when the Iraqi security forces will be fully capable of fighting on their own  That s the key to achieving victory     We are spending more than 188 million dollars a day  with almost 2 000 soldiers lives lost and no end in sight in terms our commitment in Iraq  Its time for accountability  each day that goes by without a plan is another day lost in terms of our own security at home and abroad   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
