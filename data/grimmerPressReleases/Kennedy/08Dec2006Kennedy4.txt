         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the outgoing  Republican  do nothing Congress  and below are his priorities for the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee next year  Sadly  as American families welcome the holiday season  there are few gifts they can be grateful for from this Republican Do Nothing Congress  The legislative year ends today with too many broken promises and too much work left undone as Congress leaves town having worked even fewer days than the infamous 1948 Do Nothing Congress  From unfinished appropriation bills to an agenda that hurts American families to a devastating lack of oversight on Katrina and Iraq  this Congress not only failed to deliver but in many ways put our nation on a perilous course  Fortunately  the new year will bring a new Congress and a new direction in this country  thanks to the American people who voted their hopes and dreams  They deserve a Congress that works for them and gets the job done  Democrats are ready work with our Republican colleagues to fight for good jobs and decent wages  affordable health care for all Americans  a fair immigration plan that secures our borders  affordable college tuition  and schools that serve all our children well  And clearly  were ready to fight to change our course on Iraq  As Democrats we are determined to not let the American people down and fight for solutions that will improve their everyday lives OVERVIEW OF HELP COMMITTEE ISSUES FOR THE 110th CONGRESS HEALTH 1  Expanding access to affordable healthcare  Medicare provides quality health care for more than 40 million Americans  Administrative costs are low and satisfaction is high  The most straightforward way to see that every American has affordable  quality health care is to extend Medicare to all citizens  Senator Kennedy and Representative Dingell introduced the Medicare for All legislation to do just that  This proposal should be the starting point for discussions on achieving universal coverage  In Massachusetts  all parts of the political spectrum came together to reach a solution that everyone could support  and that bipartisan spirit of compromise is a model for success in Washington too  2  Stem Cell Research  We are in the era of the life sciences  and no area of medical research has more promise than stem cell research to speed the search for new cures for diabetes  Parkinsons Disease  cancer  and many other serious illnesses  A broad bipartisan majority in both chambers of Congress approved legislation to tear down the barriers that have kept NIH scientists from realizing the full potential of this research  The President vetoed that bill last year  but Congress will keep working to overcome the Presidents opposition  3  Health IT  The Wired for Health Quality Act  sponsored by Frist  Enzi  Kennedy  and Clinton  improves the quality and efficiency of health care through better use of health information technology  which will reduce administrative costs and diminish medical errors 4  Medicare Part D  Senators Kennedy and Stabenow have introduced legislation to lower the cost of drugs by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate discounted prices directly with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of beneficiaries  Negotiating discounted prices will result in lower expenses for seniors and savings for Medicare that can be applied to improving the drug benefit by filling the gap in coverage known as the doughnut hole  5  CHIP reauthorization  CHIP has been one of the health care success stories of recent years  It provides quality care for 4 million children who would otherwise go without  It is essential to build on the promise of CHIP by not only extending the program  but strengthening it as well  We should finish the job that the original CHIP legislation started by covering all children  6  FDA Regulation of tobacco products  Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America  Empowering the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products is long overdue  Effective FDA regulation will help to deter young people from starting to smoke and to assist current smokers in quitting  Senator Kennedy authored FDA legislation to give the FDA this authority  It passed the Senate twice but was blocked by the House Republican leadership  Enacting this important public health legislation should be a top priority for the new Congress   EDUCATION 1  Enacting a higher education reauthorization that makes college affordable  Senator Kennedys proposals to help students and families include the STAR Act  Debt Relief Act and the Contract for Educational Opportunity Grants in the Right TRACK Act  Senator Kennedys top priorities for reauthorization are increasing student aid  making student loan debt more manageable and making sure our student loan programs work for students  not banks  He also will be looking to expand support for and improve teacher preparation programs  2   Funding and reauthorizing the No Child Left Behind Act  Democrats will make education funding a priority so NCLB can fulfill its promise  As Chairman  Senator Kennedy will advance an NCLB reauthorization agenda that seeks to strengthen key reforms  ensure the laws effectiveness  and promote solutions and strategies for schools to improve  Senator Kennedys priorities for reauthorization include ensuring that tests are used to improve instruction  not just labeling schools  and ensuring that students struggling to meet high standards have the best teachers and expanded learning opportunities  He also has a proposal to ensure that parents are given the information that they need to navigate the education system and help their children succeed   3   Ensuring that our students are competitive in the 21st Century global economy  Many of Senator Kennedys proposals on this theme are in the Right Track Act  They include increasing college student aid  greater support for math and science education  and creating incentives for high quality teachers    especially in high demand subjects such as math and science    to teach in high poverty schools  as well as assistance to states to raise standards and ensure that schools are internationally competitive  4   Reauthorizing the Head Start federal preschool program and enacting Senator Kennedys Early Care and Education Act  ECEA   so that all children can have access to high quality early childhood programs  ECEA would provide support to states to create a more cohesive system of early childhood education programs and improve standards for programs and educators in the early childhood arena  5   Reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act and provide additional funding for job training programs so workers can obtain the skills they need to succeed in todays global economy  6   Fully funding IDEA  LABOR AND PENSIONS 1  Raising the Minimum Wage  Senator Kennedys bill will raise the minimum wage to  7 25 per hour in three steps over a two year period  This increase will give nearly 15 million Americans a well earned raise  including the parents of more than seven million children  This increase will give a family with one minimum wage earner another  4 400 a year to spend on education  child care  paying the rent  or putting decent food on the table  2  Promoting paid sick days for workers  Over half of American workers do not have paid sick days  Senator Kennedys Healthy Families Act will guarantee working Americans seven paid sick days to care for their own and their families medical needs  Providing paid sick days will build strong families  protect our children  and safeguard our public health  3  Protecting Workers Right to Organize  In todays insecure economy  when too many working families are struggling just to make ends meet  it is more important than ever that workers have a voice at work  Senator Kennedys Employee Free Choice Act helps workers get their fair share of our nations economic growth by supporting the basic right of workers to choose their own representative  It puts real teeth in the law by strengthening the penalties for discrimination against workers who favor a union  And it will allow employees to choose a union when a majority of them sign an authorization designating a union as their bargaining representative  4  Strengthening Retirement Security  Workers deserve to retire in dignity  not in poverty  Senator Kennedys priorities include expanding retirement security for all American workers and finding ways to prevent corporations from using the bankruptcy courts to dump workers pensions while awarding big bonuses to executives  He will also continue the fight to protect Social Security  5  Strengthening Worker Safety  Too many American workers still face hazardous conditions at work  Senator Kennedy wants to make all workplaces safer by passing the Protecting Americas Workers Act to cover more workers  give families a role in safety investigations  strengthen protections for whistleblowers  and increase penalties for repeated safety violators  He will build on the MINER Act to make additional advances in mine safety legislation  Kennedy also plans to exercise close oversight over MSHA and OSHA to ensure that they vigorously enforce our safety laws and issue needed safety standards     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
