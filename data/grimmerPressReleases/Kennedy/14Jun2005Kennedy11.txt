         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  MASSACHUSETTS DELEGATION URGES BUSH TO RELEASE FEMA FUNDS FOR RED TIDE RELIEFWASHINGTON  DC  Today  the Massachusetts delegation  led by Senator Edward M  Kennedy  sent a letter to President George W  Bush seeking funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide relief for Massachusetts counties and fishermen affected by the outbreak The letter and reaction from the delegation is included below Kennedy said  Today  we asked the President to declare our coastal counties as a disaster area because of the economic impact of the red tide upon our shell fishing industry  The financial assistance that we seek will help these hard working people during this extraordinarily hard time  The shell fishermen are important to our local coastal economies and to our communities John Kerry said  Fishermen and their families are coping with a disaster and we need to step up and provide real economic relief as soon as possible  President Bush and the Department of Homeland Security can provide direct assistance right away by declaring coastal communities hardest hit by this red tide outbreak a major disaster  There s no time to wait The fishing industry  the heart of New England s traditional economy  has been devastated by this  New England tornado  said Rep  Markey  We must do everything we can to protect the fisherman  restaurateurs  small business owners and families that are feeling the blows of this disaster Rep  Frank said  Because of the growing likelihood that the effects of this Red Tide outbreak will be long lasting  it is crucial that we continue to push for additional federal help for the shell fishermen and others who are facing economic harm as a result  This disaster declaration will help pave the way for additional financial help  and I will continue working with my colleagues in seeking assistance for the affected parts of the state This year s red tide outbreak is a tremendous problem  Rep  McGovern said  It s vital to our economic well being that the federal government provide the necessary assistance  I hope FEMA will treat this issue with the attention it deserves Rep  Tierney said  As the red tide situation worsens  we continue to pursue a number of different avenues for disaster relief money for shell fishermen and their families  FEMA disaster relief funds would provide immediate relief for these shell fishermen and their families Rep  Delahunt said  Unless you depend on the ocean to make your living  it is hard to appreciate how disastrous this red tide bloom is  For fishermen and the entire tourism industry  this is very serious business for our region Rep  Lynch said  Fishermen  businesses and families are all affected by this devastating red tide outbreak  and we have a responsibility to help them weather this difficult economic time  The entire Massachusetts Delegation is committed to ensuring that President Bush understands the magnitude of this situation and its impact on the entire region  and that emergency assistance funds are delivered as soon as possible Massachusetts is currently enduring the worst outbreak of red tide in decades and scientists are concerned that this outbreak could last for weeks  severely impacting the shellfishing industry for the duration of the critical summer season  The economic impact of this red tide outbreak is being felt  not just by the shellfishing industry  but by seafood buyers  restaurants and the tourism industry  I urge you to quickly approve this disaster declaration as a way to provide some measure of economic relief  stated Congressman Capuano June 14  2005The Honorable George W  Bush President of the United States The White House Washington  DC 20500Through  Mr  Kenneth Horak  Acting Regional Director FEMA  Region 1 99 High Street Boston  MA 02110Dear Mr  President Under the provisions of the Robert T  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act  we are writing to urge you to declare a major disaster for the counties of Barnstable  Bristol  Dukes  Essex  Nantucket  Norfolk  Plymouth  and Suffolk as a result of the current massive outbreak of Red Tide  These coastal counties have been hurt by the worst tide outbreak in Massachusetts in over thirty years  The outbreak has shut down the shell fishing industry  and there are few signs of improvement The red tide is a result of an unusually severe combination of environmental conditions that have caused toxic algae to cover these entire coastal areas  The tide has shut down over 1 700 commercial shell fishermen and kept them from harvesting at the peak of the shell fishing and tourism season  According to state experts  these closures are costing the shell fishing industry over  600 000 a week  This represents a potential weekly loss of  2 700 000 to the local economy  If the red tide outbreak continues for eight to ten weeks  which seems a realistic prediction  then the fishermen are expected to lose almost half of their entire income for the year  Related industries are being affected as well  including seafood buyers  processors  restaurants  bait providers  and tourism The Governor of Massachusetts has determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments and has implemented the State Emergency Operations Plan  We appreciate your prompt attention to this important issue of vital importance to the hard working men and women of the shell fishing industry and the other businesses affected by this environmental disaster With respect and appreciation Sincerely Edward M  Kennedy John F  Kerry United States Senate United States SenateEdward J  Markey Barney Frank
