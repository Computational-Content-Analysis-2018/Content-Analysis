         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     In the wake of the tragic events of September 11th  Congress  the Administration and the country faced the obvious urgent need to do all we can to strengthen our national security and our counterterrorism strategy  Six weeks after those attacks  Congress moved swiftly to enact new intelligence and law enforcement powers for the federal government     Even at that time  we had the foresight to ensure that we would review the powers granted under the PATRIOT Act at a later date  That s why we put sunset provisions in the original legislation    to require the Administration and Congress to work together to assess these difficult issues in light of these new powers     We recognized the need to monitor the implementation of the new powers carefully  to make sure we achieve the right balance between counterterrorism and civil liberties     The 9 11 Commission put it plainly in its report      The burden of proof for retaining a particular governmental power should be on the executive  to explain that the power actually materially enhances security and that there is adequate supervision of the executive s use of the powers to ensure protection of civil liberties    If the power is granted  there must be adequate guidelines and oversight to properly confine its use       That should be our guiding principle as we try to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate bills      On the whole  many of the powers granted under the PATRIOT Act have proven to be effective and legitimate  In the past four years  the FBI tells us that the PATRIOT Act has been instrumental in helping the government to apprehend terrorists  uncover terrorism plans  and dismantle terrorist cells  As a result there is now wide  bipartisan agreement that many of the expiring provisions should be reauthorized with minor modifications    However  it has been a constant struggle for Congress and the American people to obtain adequate information on the implementation of the most controversial provisions of the original PATRIOT Act  Seven states and nearly 400 communities have passed resolutions to protect the civil liberties of their citizens  Libraries and bookstores have campaigns for reform  and thousands of Americans have signed petitions calling for reform     That s why sunsets are such an important part of the Act  Congress committed itself to re examining the Act this year  a non election year  and to assess which powers should be retained  which should be revised  and which should be repealed  I strongly support the inclusion of sunset provisions and increased reporting in this reauthorization  Without it  Congressional oversight will be weakened and made meaningless    Based on information declassified during our oversight hearings  we know how many times two of the expansive powers under the bill were used  Section 215 and Section 206 have been used less than 50 times  With this information  we can confidently add meaningful safeguards to require a proper nexus between the information sought and a foreign intelligence investigation     Senator Durbin and many others have repeatedly asked for the use of the National Security Letters to be declassified  But  these efforts have been unsuccessful and so the public is left to rely on unverified accounts in the press  In light of recent reports  this conference should consider carefully whether reporting on National Security Letters should be available to the public  As in the case of other PATRIOT Act powers  public access could be given to this information without jeopardizing our security     We should also consider a sunset on the use of National Security Letters  and a requirement for federal agencies to report to Congress on data mining activities  Dragnet sweeps through vast fields of personal information collected on innocent Americans is an inefficient and over reaching counterterrorism tactic     We can reasonably minimize the amount of data collected  and protect unsuspecting citizens from intrusions into their personal privacy  I hope the conference will retain the provisions  supported by Chairman Sensenbrenner that require federal agencies to report to Congress on data mining programs that involve the civil liberties and privacy of all Americans     There is also great concern about government access to medical records  tax records and library records in cases where there is no individualized suspicion or even a plausible link to terrorism  The Senate passed bill requires the government to convince a judge that persons are connected to terrorism or espionage before obtaining their library records  their medical records  or other sensitive personal information  Our Senate bill contains fundamental protections in accord with the Bill of Rights  It had the unanimous approval of the entire Senate and the heightened standard added to Section 215 should be preserved by the conference     Four years ago  Members of Congress came together on both sides of the aisle  united by grief and patriotism  Under the leadership of Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers  the House Judiciary Committee voted out a bill with unanimous support among the thirty six members of the committee     This time  the Senate has enacted a proposal that won unanimous  bipartisan support of the Senate  because we reached a consensus on all sides of the political spectrum  We agreed on the need to give law enforcement and intelligence officers stronger powers to investigate and prevent terrorism  to prevent terrorists from entering the country  and to achieve better coordination between the law enforcement and the intelligence communities  We recognized that protection of our civil rights and civil liberties is an essential part of our democracy    In retaining the expanded powers of the PATRIOT Act  the conference has the responsibility to protect the constitutional safeguards that are indispensable to our democracy  Both the House and Senate bills contain provisions that would improve the original legislation  None of these changes will impede the ability of law enforcement and intelligence officials to investigate and prevent terrorism     We all have expectations that this final bill will contain reasonable limits to prevent gross abuses of federal power  It s important  for example  that the House and Senate bills don t expand administrative subpoenas  and we should continue to oppose any attempt to allow these sweeping searches without court approval     Hopefully  we can achieve our goal of reviewing and reauthorizing the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act  without making the conference bill a vessel for other controversial provisions that have not been given adequate consideration     The House bill contains changes in death penalty sentencing that go far beyond terrorism and would jeopardize all federal capital prosecutions    not just those cases brought against terrorists  These controversial provisions are opposed by the Conference of Catholic Bishops  Human Rights Watch  the American Bar Association  former federal prosecutors and other religious organizations     Any such major change in capital cases needs to be carefully considered by the full Congress  rather than uncritically endorsed in conference  and I strongly oppose including such sweeping changes in criminal procedure in this bill     The entire country    really  the entire world    is watching to see how we strike the balance between national security and the Constitution     None of us will ever forget where we were and what we were doing on 9 11  We will never forget the lives that were lost and the heroes who were the first to respond  We will continue to honor all those working so hard to prevent future terrorist attacks  Hopefully  we can all work together here in that spirit of unity to protect our country and our ideals    Laura
