         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today  Senators Patrick Leahy and Edward M  Kennedy introduced legislation to create new privacy safeguards to better protect Americans health information in the Information Age  by ensuring the right of all Americans to privacy  confidentiality and security with respect to their health information and imposing criminal and civil sanctions for the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive health information  It would correct the longstanding errors in the ways in which confidential patient information is currently handled and distributed and would require the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to revise the HIPAA Privacy Rules  It would give each citizen the power to decide when  and to whom  their health information is disclosed In America today  if you have a health record  you have a health privacy problem  said Senator Leahy  who along with Kennedy has worked on this legislation for more than a decade  The ability to easily access health information electronically  often by the click of a mouse  or a few key strokes on a computer  can be useful in providing more cost effective health care  but it can also lead to a loss of personal privacy  Without adequate safeguards to protect health privacy  many Americans will simply not seek the medical treatment that they need  Americans deserve stronger guarantees of patient privacy  more helpful guidelines for security implementation  and more dependable enforcement and penalties for the misuse of protected health information  Senator Kennedy said  Overall  a delicate balance must be struck  On one hand  we must allow the sharing of information necessary for effective health care  At the same time  however  we must protect Americans right to have their health records and individual health information kept private  For too long  the balance has been tilted too far against patient privacy  and our bill is a needed effort to correct that imbalance  Below is a summary of the bill The Health Information Privacy and Security Act of 2007Section by Section SummaryThe Health Information Privacy and Security Act creates new privacy
