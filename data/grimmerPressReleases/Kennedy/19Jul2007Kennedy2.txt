         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The most important single thing we can do to improve college access and completion in this country is to increase grant aid for our neediest students We know that the cost of college has tripled in the last 20 years  While the costs of going to college have skyrocketed  grant aid has not kept up Twenty years ago  the maximum Pell Grant covered 55 percent of costs at a public four year college  Today  it covers only a third of those costs  The gap between the maximum Pell grant and cost of attendance at 4 year public colleges has increased almost  3 500 since 2001 2002  Today the gap is  8 746  Under years of Republican control  the Pell grant maximum has been stuck near  4 000  Earlier this year  Democrats increased the maximum grant to  4 310  But that is not enough Increasing costs and stagnant grant aid are closing the doors to college for many middle income and low income students and families The lowest income students on average have an unmet need of  5 800  Each year  400 000 students dont attend a 4 year college because they cant afford to do so  Its shameful that today low income students  even those who have worked hard and done well in high school  are less likely to attend and complete college than high income students Less than half of low income eighth grade students will graduate from high school ready to attend college  Compare this to the nearly 90 percent of high income students who will be college qualified when they complete high school The outlook is even bleaker for low income students to earn a Bachelors degree  Just one fifth of low income eighth graders will graduate from college  But 68 percent of high income students will do so Thats unacceptable To help close these gaps  this bill increases the maximum Pell grant immediately next year to  5 100 and by 2011  it will be  5 400  Who will this bill help  It will help students like Sara  who was a first generation college student  She graduated from Norfolk State University and earned her Masters degree with the help of Pell and other aid programs  Sara says that Pell helped her family know that a better day was coming for them This bill will help students like Natalie  from my home state of Massachusetts  is a single mother enrolled in college for the first time  She says that without Pell grants  she would be stuck in this way of life  with no light to look forward toknowledge is power and education is key  Over 5 million students rely on the Pell grant  5 million  This bill recognizes just how important this aid is to students and families across the nation Our Senate proposal provides the biggest boost to student aid since the passage of the G I  Bill  providing  14 billion in additional grant aid to students and  3 billion in debt relief   17 billion in college aid overall This bill provides the support and aid that millions of Americans need in order to access and afford a college education  This increase in aid is long overdue  But we need not stop there  We should allocate all available funds to continue adding to need based aid  beyond the increases we make in the next five years The amendment we will vote on this morning would allow us to do that  It allocates billions of additional dollars to extend the maximum need based grant between 2014 and 2017  continuing our promise to help millions of needy students pay for college What a reversal this will be from the last five years  prior to this Congress  when the Administration broke its promise to increase the maximum Pell Grant year after year  What a commitment to our students for years to come We know what the stakes are when students are not able to afford college  And we know that years of stagnant grant aid has made the problem worse and worse With this amendment  we can reverse those troubling trends and make serious progress in helping millions of American students I thank my colleagues on the education committee for all their efforts on this legislation  and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to provide hope and opportunity to millions of middle income and low income students and families      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
