         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  This is  a defining moment   The American people are watching    The world is watching     The issue is clear   will we stand with our soldiers by changing their mission  and beginning to bring them home    Or will we stand with the President and keep  our soldiers in Iraqs civil war  History will judge us   We can either  continue down the Presidents perilous path  or embrace a new direction   If we  dont change course  we know what lies ahead  more American casualties  more  death  and more destruction    A new strategy that makes the Iraqis less  reliant on our military offers is the best way forward  More of the same  misguided policy will result in more of the same tragedy for our military    Lets try a new course  and lets try it now   We must proceed because  Iraq is the overarching issue of our time  We are being told that we  need to be patient We are being told we have to give the latest escalation a  chance to succeed  But weve heard it all before  Weve heard  for years that this administration has a plan for success  Weve heard  for years that progress is just a few months away  Weve heard for years  that weve turned a corner  But the plans for success keep getting  tossed aside for new plans   The timelines for progress keep getting  extended  And weve turned so many corners that weve ended up back where we  started  trying to control Baghdad    It is time to change direction    There are too many parents who have buried their children Too many  children left without their father or a mother Too many soldiers missing  arms  legs  eyes and ears  Its time to change course  let the Iraqis  step up to the plate and take responsibility for their own future  and begin to  redeploy our troops out of Iraq    Those of us who opposed the war are  used to the Administrations attacks  They have questioned our  patriotism and called us defeatist   When we challenged the Presidents  misguided policy  they accused us of having political motives and being  partisan  They were wrong then  and they are wrong now  Our  motives have always been clear   to protect the lives of our soldiers The  American people are far ahead of the Administration  We have an  obligation to stand up for our troops and stand up to our President when he  stubbornly refuses to change course in Iraq     We are meeting our  responsibilities by changing the mission of our military  not micromanaging the  war   The recent hearings on Walter Reed should instruct us here today    They tell us how little faith we can put in this administration The  very people who hide behind the troops when their policies are questioned have  failed to keep faith with our wounded soldiers  But just as importantly   the hearings on Walter Reed remind all of us of the human costs of the war     This administration has done all it can to hide them from us    They have forbidden photographs of the coffins flown back from Iraq    The President has avoided attending the funerals of the fallen    And the tours of Walter Reed never included Building 18    But  the hearings on Walter Reed swept away all the spin and camouflage  and they put  our wounded soldiers back where they belong  at the heart of our debates about  the war  At the end of those hearings  everyone agreed that the Army had  failed these brave soldiers   But we failed them long before they arrived at an  Army hospital    This administration failed them when it trumped up the  intelligence in order to make a case for war   It failed them when it sent  too few troops with too little armor It failed them when it turned the  reconstruction of Iraq into a political science project    And we in the  Senate will fail them today if we do not vote to change course and begin to  bring our soldiers home    At the end of this debate  the American  people will know where each of us stands  On our side of the aisle  we  stand with the American people  They voters told us in November to change course  and begin to bring our troops home  and that whats were going to do  We  stand for our constitutional system  in which the Congress speaks for the people  in matters of war and peace  and can require that the President listen to them     And finally  we stand with our troops   We alone are insisting on  a policy worthy of their courage and sacrifice  Peace and progress in  Iraq must be earned by Iraqis and her neighbors  We must no longer send  our brave soldiers to an uncertain fate on the streets of Baghdad    We  must begin to bring them back home  and to the heros welcome they have earned      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202 224 2633
