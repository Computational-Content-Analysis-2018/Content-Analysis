         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the defeat of the Federal Marriage Amendment in the Senate today   In 2004  we defeated attempts to force this extreme agenda into the Constitution  Now  weve done it again and its time for the U S  Senate to get back to the real business of the nation  Its disappointing and frustrating that the Senate allowed this agenda to come ahead of so many other higher priorities that need to be addressed    The American people are looking to all of us in Congress for help on the enormous challenges we face as a nation  the war in Iraq  threats to our national security  skyrocketing gas prices  soaring health care costs  preparations for the new hurricane season  and so many other urgent issues  They want Congress to concentrate on these real threats facing American families today  With the defeat of this so called Federal Marriage Amendment  the Senate can turn back to the urgent priorities facing America today   Im proud that Massachusetts continues to be a leader on marriage equality  Being part of a family is a basic right  and I look forward to the day when every state accepts this basic principle of fairness  Marriage is a solemn commitment to plan a future together  to share in lifes celebrations  to be there as a source of comfort and support to ease lifes burdens and pains  This weeks debate in the Senate affects real families with real life struggles  When the citizens of a state have decided to recognize those families    through their state constitution or state laws    the Senate has no business undermining their personal  private decisions    Its wrong to try to turn back the clock on the progress weve made in guaranteeing civil rights for all our people  That progress has been achieved at great cost and sacrifice  and we must not retreat  The Constitution has never been amended to discriminate any American  and now is no time to start     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633
