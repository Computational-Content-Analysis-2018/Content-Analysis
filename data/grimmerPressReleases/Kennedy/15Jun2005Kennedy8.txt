         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington DC  Today Senator Kennedy and his colleagues sent a letter to the Attorney General urging him to not enter into a settlement at this time on the tobacco case  based on the investigation that political interference played a role in the Administration s decision to reduce by more 90  what the government is seeking from the tobacco industry Below is the statement from Senator Kennedy and the text of the letter What is happening with this case is political interference at its worst because literally millions of lives are at stake  The worst thing would be for the Justice Department to settle with the tobacco companies based upon the weak and inadequate demand that DOJ made to the Court last week  At this point  we have far more confidence that the Court will do the right thing than that the Justice Department will do the right thing  The Court has the authority to look beyond the DOJ recommendations and to order strong remedies based on the evidence presented at trial  We should let the Court decide June 15  2005Honorable Alberto Gonzales Attorney General Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW Washington  DC 20530Dear Attorney General Gonzales We are writing to express our serious concern over the direction of the government s case in United States of America vs  Philip Morris USA Inc  et al  currently before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia  Because of the extraordinary importance of this case for the health of the American people  we believe it is essential that we  as Members of Congress who have followed this issue closely  communicate these concerns directly to you Every dollar spent on smoking cessation and prevention    to cure addicted smokers and to stop our children from beginning to smoke    saves lives  The Department of Justice s last minute decision to abandon evidence and testimony and sharply reduce its demand in the case from a  130 billion program that would have substantially advanced the public health to a  10 billion program is inexplicable  The decision to suddenly reduce the government s demand in this case by more than 90 percent cannot credibly be blamed on the D C  Circuit s ruling regarding the unrelated remedy of disgorgement  as some in the Justice Department have attempted to claim  In fact  the Department s trial team presented evidence supporting a  130 billion smoking cessation program three months after the Court of Appeals decision was issued As you know  the Department of Justice has been asked to investigate the circumstances surrounding this complete reversal  Whatever the ultimate findings as to the reasons behind your Department s surprising actions  it is imperative that the Department not cause further damage by settling the case for insufficient relief  It is our understanding that settlement discussions may be pursued in the coming weeks We strongly urge you not to enter into a settlement at this time based on the unreasonably weak demands made by the government last week  Such a settlement would be contrary to the goal of exposing the tobacco companies  past misconduct and preventing future misconduct by the industry We also urge you to file a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court regarding the D C  Circuit s February 4  2005 decision on interlocutory appeal on this case  If allowed to stand  that D C  Circuit decision will greatly undermine the ability of the government to battle corporate misconduct and corruption  By prohibiting the government from disgorging the profits of proven unlawful conduct  the D C  Circuit s decision is inconsistent with the law of other circuits and strips prosecutors of an essential enforcement tool needed to root out illegal activity in criminal conspiracies and corporate board rooms As Senators and Representatives in Congress  we represent the interests of the people of the United States  On their behalf  on behalf of the 45 million Americans who deserve smoking cessation assistance  and especially on behalf of our nation s children  we urge you to put the health of the American people ahead of other interests in this case   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
