         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C  In the midst of a Senate budget battle over Bush s detrimental cuts to education  Senator Edward M  Kennedy offered two measures today to give America s students the resources they need to compete in a global economy  Senator Kennedy reached across the aisle and joined Senator Gordon Smith  R OR  and Representatives Thomas Petri  R WI  and George Miller  D CA  to unveil the only bipartisan  bicameral legislation that will increase college scholarships by  17 2 billion without costing taxpayers a dime  Students and educations leaders joined the lawmakers today to support the student loan legislation  called the Student Aid Reward Act  and kicked off a national campaign on college campuses to promote the bill s passage  Kennedy also convened a conference call with students across the country to explain his student loan plan and listen to their feedback  In conjunction with today s bill introduction  Senator Kennedy will offer an education amendment to the budget that would help middle class families pay for college and help all Americans by ensuring that our citizens are equipped for the jobs of the global economy  The amendment takes into account the many challenges we face as we witness the massive transformation of our industries and our workforce in this global economy  Since 1975  we have fallen from 3rd to 15th in producing scientists and engineers and within ten years 3 4 million jobs are at risk of being shipped overseas  Kennedy s amendment would strengthen math and science education  boost college loan funding  and restore cuts to critical job training programs  The president has proposed actual cuts in discretionary spending on education of over half a billion   the first such cuts proposed in over a decade   At the press conference Senator Kennedy said  We have to make sure every American is prepared to be as productive as possible in the global economy  We cannot allow 400 000 college ready students to be held back from going to college full time and 200 000 students to be shut out of college completely every year  because they can t afford the cost  Senator Kennedy added  We waste billions of dollars in corporate welfare every year on student loans  and we cannot afford it any longer  We should use scarce tax dollars to help students  not banks   The Student Aid Reward Act encourages colleges to utilize the less expensive of the two federal government student loan plans  Loans issued by the U S  Treasury funds with private companies are contracted to service and college student collect loan payments and are much less expensive than the alternative program that includes subsidizes middlemen like banks and private lenders Sallie Mae with guaranteed profits and zero risk of default  The Congressional Budget Office estimates the Kennedy plan will produce 17 2 billion in grant aid at zero taxpayer costs   Senator Kennedy also addressed the ongoing 9 5  student loan scandal  citing new data from the Department of Education released today that concludes that taxpayers are still paying the burden for bank and lender profitsmoney that could be used to send more American students to college  The 9 5  rate of guaranteed loan subsidies that banks receive was a loophole discovered by Senator Kennedy last year  Kennedy said that new Education Department data indicate that  1 billion will be paid to banks this year to guarantee them a 9 5  rate of return on student loans already guaranteed against default  Following today s press conference  Senator Kennedy spoke with college students from across the United States to kick off a national campaign to promote the STAR Act  College students asked Kennedy questions about the legislation and what they could do to help the bill gain Senate passage  This conference call was in addition to a letter from Kennedy sent to thousands of students and alumni in Massachusetts warning them that their ability to consolidate student loans will expire in June because of President Bush s change in policy       STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON THE STUDENT AID REWARD ACT OF 2005  Mr  President  one of the challenges facing our economy today is the phenomenon of globalization  Already  in the early years of this new century  we are witnessing a major transformation of our industries and our workforce  We have to prepare America to compete effectively in the global economy  and an essential aspect of doing so is to make genuine educational opportunity much more widely available to all our people   In 1950  when I graduated from high school  only 15 percent of jobs required some post secondary training  Today  it is 60 percent  Of the 10 occupations with the greatest rates of growth  6 require a college degree   Yet  it is estimated that over the next two decades  despite massive and increasing demand  the proportion of college educated workers will grow at only a third of the current pace  We cannot let that slowdown take place  Already  China and India are producing 10 times as many engineers as America produces each year  America now ranks 29th in the industrialized world in math and science education   We have to strengthen math and science instruction in our public schools and colleges and universities  We have to ensure that the reforms of the No Child Left Behind Act are not just abstract goals in elementary and secondary education  We have to eliminate the achievement gap between minority and non minority youth  It is not acceptable that the reading and math skills of 17 year old Latino and African American students are equal to those of 13 year old whites  President Bush calls it the soft bigotry of low expectations  and he s right   Our colleges and universities have to produce more and better teachers  and they need to be supported and treated like the professionals they are  Students in high poverty secondary schools are 77 percent more likely    77 percent more likely    to be taught by teachers with no academic background in the subject they are teaching than students in other schools  Surely  we can do better   We cannot allow 400 000 college ready students to be held back from going to college full time and 200 000 students to be shut out of college completely every year  because they can t afford to pay the cost  We have to make sure every American is prepared to be as productive as possible in the global economy   We have made some worthwhile progress in elementary and secondary education since passage of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002 but we still have much work to do as well  We also need to do much more in early childhood education   Today  to deal with the issue of college education  Senator Gordon Smith  R OR   Congressmen Tom Petri  R WI  and George Miller  D CA  and I are proposing a bipartisan plan to increase student financial aid by squeezing billions of dollars in corporate welfare out of the student loan program   Our plan  the Student Aid Reward Act of 2005  will provide colleges and universities with grant aid to increase federal Pell scholarships by as much as  1 000 each    completely paid for by increasing efficiency in our system of delivering student loans  The independent  non partisan Congressional Budget Office reports that our plan will generate more than  17 billion in additional college scholarship aid at no additional cost to taxpayers   We waste billions of dollars in corporate welfare every year on student loans  and we cannot afford it any longer  We should use scarce tax dollars to help students  not banks   Under current law  there are two parallel federal student loan programs that provide essentially the same loans and interest rates to students  but one costs billions of dollars more each year than the other   In the first program  the Federal Family Education Loan program  the federal government guarantees and subsidizes loans issued to students by Sallie Mae and other lenders  These loans bear virtually no risk for the lenders  who are guaranteed against default and receive a very profitable rate of return  In fact  some of these lenders are guaranteed a 9 point 5 percent subsidized rate of return on loans that are already guaranteed against default   In the second program  the Direct Loan program  loans are issued directly from the United States Treasury  The loans are serviced and collected through contracts with private companies  but there is no middleman making the loans   The Direct Loan program is much  much less expensive for taxpayers  because it provides loan capital at a lower rate  eliminates middlemen as lenders  and avoids billions of dollars in unnecessary subsidies to lenders   According to President Bush s 2006 education budget  student loans made through the more expensive program cost  11 more for every  100 in loans than the same loans made with U S  Treasury funds  Yet  colleges and students have no incentive to use the more efficient program  In fact  lenders from the less efficient program often offer rewards to colleges to persuade them to use the less efficient  more expensive program program   Our Student Aid Reward Act encourages colleges to choose the less expensive of the government s student loan programs   It requires the Secretary of Education to determine every year which loan program is more efficient  Schools are rewarded with additional scholarship funds for using the more efficient of the two programs  Competition will encourage both programs to improve the efficiency of their operations  Schools  students  and taxpayers will all benefit   Estimates based on the most recent Bush Administration budget indicate that under our bipartisan plan  colleges that use the more efficient student loan program will receive an incentive reward payment equal to 5 and a half percent of the total amount borrowed by students at any individual school   In Massachusetts   Students at Boston University would receive  7 million a year for financial aid   Students at UMASS Amherst would receive  3 3 million a year for financial aid   Students at Stonehill College would receive over half a million dollars a year for financial aid   Students at Western New England College would receive a million dollars a year for financial aid   For colleges nationwide  Student Aid Reward funds would be enough to increase federal Pell Scholarships by  1 000 each  making college more affordable for millions of students at no additional taxpayer cost   Our bipartisan plan is endorsed by every major student organization in America  It is time for us to make higher education a greater priority than higher profits for private lenders   We can open new doors and new avenues for all students to make the most of their God given talents and rekindle the fires of innovation in our society   We have a choice  We can continue to be buffeted by the harsh winds of a shrinking world  Or we can face the challenge of globalization and prepare our citizens more effectively for the future   Let s make the right choice  and turn this era of globalization into a new era of opportunity for every American          LETTERS FROM SUPPORTING EDUCATION GROUPS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST    FOLLOWING FACT SHEETS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST  STAR Fact Sheet CBO Scores The Institute for
