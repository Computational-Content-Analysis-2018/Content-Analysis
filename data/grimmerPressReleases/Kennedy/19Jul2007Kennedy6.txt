         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   The patent system is vital to innovation in our economy  Under the Constitution  Congress has the responsibility to protect the rights of inventors in order to encourage progress in the science and the arts   The legislation that we consider today represents perhaps the most sweeping reform of the patent system since the 19th century  Its provisions would have a broad impact on the procedures and incentives that underlie the protection of intellectual property   Companies  universities  non profit organizations  and individual inventors all depend on laws that protect their discoveries  and Congress must continue to ensure that clear laws exist to adequately protect  and enforce  patent rights  I represent a state with diverse industries whose economy is driven by the very innovation we seek to protect and encourage with this bill  Patents are critical to the continued success of our biotechnology  pharmaceutical  life sciences  high tech and manufacturing industries  Im proud that Massachusetts is a leader in innovation in all of these main fields   Its home to large high tech companies such as EMC which employs 8 700 workers in our state  Global companies such as Microsoft  Intel  and Verizon have a strong presence as well  We also have a vibrant high tech community supported by universities like MIT  In 2006 alone  MIT obtained 121 patents and announced 523 new inventions  Such ingenuity is a driving force in the local  national and world economy today  Were also home to life sciences  biological  and pharmaceutical leaders such as Boston Scientific  Alkermes  Athena  Genzyme  the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council and Biogen  all of whom drive innovation  employ our workers  and are leaders in their fields  We also have the strongest financial sector in New England  with the highest concentration of Financial Services Roundtable member companies  including the headquarters for Affiliated Managers Group  Fidelity Investments  John Hancock Financial Services  MassMutual Financial Group  and State Street Corporation  Historically  our state encourages innovators of all sizes  from some of the biggest players to some of the newest companies  As we all know  individual inventors and innovators provide some of the most important advances in the field  Obviously  such diversity among innovators and across industries means that there will be differing perspectives on this bill  Legitimate concerns have been raised on all sides  but we also have to recognize that reforms are needed to modernize our patent laws  Simpler procedures  greater transparency and greater efficiency in protecting and encouraging innovation  and reducing the costs of litigation are essential for our economy and for individual inventors and large companies alike We certainly do not want to pass legislation that will weaken patent protection or make patent litigation more costly and unpredictable  Reform should be consistent with individual entrepreneurship and innovation that have been a hallmark of our economy and the engine of our unprecedented growth I commend Chairman Leahy for his leadership in trying to strike the right balance on these issues  The proposed legislation implements a first to file provision that reduces uncertainty in protecting property and aligns our regulations with the rest of our major trading partners  It includes a provision for extra assistance for small or micro entities  Overall it means a level playing field and greater efficiency in patenting  while preserving our commitment to individual inventors  An amazing example is the four year old girl from Houston Texas who invented a mechanism to help the disabled open doors and drawers  Shes the youngest patent holder in the nation  but she has the spirit of ingenuity that our founders believed in when they wrote the Constitution  As we reform the patent system  we need to be sure that first time inventors can deal with the system and obtain a patent for their inventions  Ive introduced an amendment to ensure that the Patent Office has the flexibility and autonomy to provide more efficient and fair treatment for patent applicants  It will help small inventors who are not as knowledgeable as large companies about the patent process  Unfortunately human error causes some to unintentionally miss an occasional deadline  Hundreds of thousands of applications are filed every year  The Director needs the authority to accept late filings in some circumstances  but they still have to file within 30 days of the missed deadline Numerous deadlines must be met throughout the patent process  They occur not only while an application is pending  but even after a patent has issued  and the patent office needs the discretion to waive them The legislation also modifies damage awards  to reduce instances of overcompensation to patent holders while still protecting the real value of the innovation  This provision is particularly relevant to our high tech constituents whose products are packed with a number of patented individual components all of which contribute to the overall value of the product  Ive heard from a number of Massachusetts companies that have concerns about this section of the bill and further compromise may be necessary to accommodate these concerns This is especially important for industries whose products are generally driven by a single patent  Im not persuaded that we should take away the ability of the courts to apply a flexible set of factors  such as the 15 outlined in the Georgia Pacific case to determine what the appropriate remedy should be for the facts of a specific case   Im also concerned about the views expressed about the new second window established in the Chairmans bill  to reduce the costs of litigation and uncertainty for patent holders  Perhaps the establishment of a new post grant review process for patents will provide an opportunity to hear challenges to the patent without the expensive cost of litigating in court  I hope that the intent of this new regime will be accomplished in a manner that will provide a fair and efficient process both for patent owners  and for those challenging the patent  An effective new procedure could reduce uncertainty in patent rights and improve the quality of patents issued the administrative procedures to accomplish this goal must be up to the task  We shouldnt create perverse incentives for parties to avoid this process in favor of courts or allow time consuming and frivolous challenges that would otherwise be dismissed by courts  The Chairman has made significant steps to improve this key provision in the bill  and I hope that he will continue to work with us as we move forward    Looking ahead  the difficulty to achieve consensus on this legislation illustrates the challenge we face in enacting legislation that serves the primary goal of encouraging innovation for all of our constituents  and diverse industries  As Ive said its a tall order  but we need a bill that is good for both small and large inventors  and that improves innovation through greater efficiency and reduced litigation costs in all our cherished industries      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
