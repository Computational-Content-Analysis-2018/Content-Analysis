legislation for action by the Senate today  The Pension Security and Transparency Act has been an impressive bipartisan effort  and I thank my colleaguesSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus of the Finance Committee and Senator Enzi  Senator DeWine  and Senator Mikulski from the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committeefor working to produce a bill that will provide tens of millions of Americans with greater retirement security    The retirement security of millions of hard working Americans is at risk  Millions of our fellow citizens have worked hard all their lives  played by the rules  they ve been dedicated and loyal workers  only to find that the pensions they were promised disappear when they retire  They worked faithfully  assuming their retirements would actually be golden years  But then  suddenly  it all disappears  The pension plan is in financial trouble  and their retirement dreams are wiped away    This is exactly what has happened to millions of loyal American workers  In the past five years  700 pension plans have gone into crisis and millions of workers have lost  8 billion in pension benefits that they had been promised    It s a crisis  We see it with our airline workers  We see it with workers in manufacturing industries  We see it with construction workers and sales clerks at the store and so many of our neighbors  It s a crisis  and this bill responds to it by saving their pensions    Large numbers of Americans are increasingly concerned about their retirement security  and rightly so  Each leg of the three legged stool of retirementprivate pensions  private savings  and Social Securityis in jeopardy     Many Americans find they are unable to save anything toward their retirement  In fact  the personal savings rate has now fallen below zeroAmericans are spending more than they earn  And it s no wonder  when wages are stagnant  costs are soaring for basic necessities such as energy  housing  healthcare and education     The Bush Administration continues to propose to privatize Social Security which would put the reliability of future benefits in that landmark and highly successful program in jeopardy     Many workers have no private pension at allonly half of American workers have a pension through their job  and 2 7 million fewer private sector workers have a pension today than in 2000     Most workers who do have a pension today have only a 401 k  account as their pension  but many have nothing saved in these accounts  Even those who are saving do not have enough to live on in retirement more than half of workers approaching retirement have less than  43 000 in their 401 k   and workers who rely on these accounts face the constant risk of investments that perform poorly     These problems make pensions with defined benefits more critical then ever because they re secure  They provide a known monthly retirement benefit for life  They re insured by the federal government but they re becoming much rarer today as businesses shift away from them  In the early 1980 s  almost 40  of American workers were covered by a secure pension  today that number is below 20      Yet while workers  pensions are being cut  executives  pensions are increasingly generous  A recent study found that 25  of the CEOs of 500 large companies had been promised retirement benefits of more than  1 million per year  Why should Ken Lay of Enron and Bernie Ebbers of WorldCom walk away with millions of dollars in guaranteed pensions after driving their employees  pensions into the ground     When a major pension plan fails  it places a strain on the entire system  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  which insures these pension plans  has moved from a surplus in 2001 to a deficit of  23 billion today  Our pension insurance system protects the retirement earnings of over 40 million Americans  and we must do what it takes to see that it is there for the years to come     These are serious problems that require immediate action by Congress  The pending bill adopts a broad approach  with stronger rules for funding  expanded disclosure  and other new protections for America s workers  It strengthens existing pension plans by requiring companies to fund the pensions that workers have earned  It takes steps to prevent future pension failures  and it recognizes that workers who are increasingly in charge of investing their own retirement savings need additional help     The reforms in this bill allow troubled pension plans the leeway they need to get back on their feet  Current rules would require companies to pay large amounts into their troubled pension plans right away  That s unrealistic and could force many companies to drop their pension plans altogether  That would hurt workers  Our reforms allow companies to save their troubled plans by increasing payments gradually over a longer period of time     We provide this realistic payment schedule  but strengthen the current rules for single employer pension plans over time by requiring companies to fund 100  of their pension promises to workers  These workers have earned their pensions over a lifetime of hard work  foregoing raises and other benefits  Yet current law allows many companies to lag behind in paying for them  Our legislation solves this problem by requiring companies to put more into their pensions in a fair and predictable way     Our legislation also recognizes the power of public disclosure  and the urgent need for more effective oversight of pension plans  Under current law  workers receive little financial information about their pensions  and what they do receive is often years out of date  They ve earned these pensions  and they deserve to know whether the funds are there to pay them     Our bill ensures that workers and retirees receive up to date information each year about the status of their pensions  By opening up the books of pension funds  they will be able to monitor the true health of their retirement     The bill also provides incentives to keep pensions financially healthy by tying executive compensation to pension health  Executives should not be able to feather their own retirement nests  while workers lose their nest eggs  Our legislation prohibits corporate executives from putting company funds into their own retirement trusts when the pensions of rank and file workers are underfunded     Recent headlines show that many companies are using bankruptcy courts to abandon their pension plans  Hundreds of thousands of workers and retirees at companies like United Airlines and US Airways  Bethlehem Steel  and LTV Steel  are now without the pensions they worked so hard to earn  Such failures strain the entire pension system  too  A critical component of the bill is its provisions to prevent these future crises  It gives companies  the government  and workers the means to develop extended payment plans  so that companies and workers will maintain their pensions     The bill also contains specific provisions to save airline pensions  by offering companies a specialized payment program and transition to adjust to the new rules  These jobs have typically provided good wages and good benefits to hundreds of thousands of workers  But carriers today are under immense pressure  They suffered heavily after 9 11  and the recent catastrophes of Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina have also reduced travel     The industry is also suffering from increased jet fuel prices  These high costs are driving companies into bankruptcy and putting the retirement of hundreds of thousands of workers and retirees at risk     In addition  our legislation addresses the needs of nearly 10 million workers and retirees who receive pensions through multiemployer plans  These are the workers who clean our office buildings and hotel rooms  sell us our groceries  build our homes and schools and highways  and deliver goods across the country  Many of them are in industries where they have to move from job to job and would not be able to earn a pension at all without these multiemployer plans since their employers  particularly small businesses  could not afford to offer a pension plan on their own     The majority of these plans are in strong financial shape  But the recent economic downturn and weak stock market have put some of these plans in financial difficulties similar to those facing single employer plans  We owe it to these employees to protect their pensions now  instead of acting only when they are about to fail     Our legislation requires employers and employees to work together and agree on a plan to restore these plans to financial health  The bill also helps to protect employers from unforeseen payment increases and new excise taxes  which could cost many workers their jobs     Hybrid pension plans  including cash balance plans  have a growing role in our retirement system  They have a number of advantages  They provide a secure guaranteed pension  Their benefits are very attractive to younger workers and to those such as parents caring for children who move in and out of the workforce     Older workers  however  can lose out when their companies switch to these plans because they lose a large portion of the benefits they were promised  Our legislation requires companies that are going to switch to these plans to protect the benefits that workers have already earned  They must also provide transition benefits for the oldest workers  who stand to lose the most  The bill would also make these pensions more portable  so that they better serve a mobile workforce     In addition to these key protections for workers in guaranteed pensions  our legislation also protects persons in defined contribution pension plans  which have a growing role in our retirement system  Today over 40  of workers participate in a defined contribution plan  and for many of them this is their only pension plan    This legislation will encourage workers to save more through these pension plans through automatically enrolling them in these pensions and automatically increasing the amount that workers save over time  As employees make greater use of these types of pensions they need the best information possible about the investment options available for their retirement plans  Workers deserve independent investment advice in building their retirement savings  and this legislation will see that they get it     As we learned from the Enron  WorldCom and other corporate scandals  employees forced to invest in company stock are at huge risk  Despite all the publicity  many pensions are still at risk because workers continue to overinvest in company stock  All their eggs are in one basket  and both their job and their retirement depend on the fate of their company  Our bill protects them by preventing employers from overloading 401 k  plans with company stock  It also warns employees when they place too much of their retirement funds in one investment    The legislation also includes important provisions from the Women s Pension Protection Act that I introduced with Senator Snowe  Retirement security is essential for all Americans  but too often we fail to meet the needs of women on this basic issue  Women live longer than men  but they continue to earn far less in wages over their lifetimes  They are also much less likely to earn a pension  These factors translate into seriously inadequate retirement income for vast numbers of women     The realities of this injustice are grim  According to the most recent data  only 28  of women age 65 and over are receiving private pension income  and for those who do  the average is only  3 816 per year compared with  8 148 for men  Minority women are in even more desperate straits    only 20 percent of African American women and 9 percent of Hispanic women receive a pension  These disparities are a major reason why nearly one in five elderly single women lives in poverty     Our legislation gives them greater retirement security  Widows will receive more generous survivor benefits  Divorced women will have a greater ability to receive a share of their former husband s pension after a divorce  These are long overdue improvements in the private pension system  so that retirement savings programs will be more responsive to the realities of women s lives and careers     American workers and their families rightly expect Congress to protect their hard earned pensions  This legislation is an important start to meeting this basic challenge in our 21st century society  I urge my colleagues to support the Pension Security and Transparency Act      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
