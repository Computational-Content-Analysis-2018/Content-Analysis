         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  DC    The scandal over the use of covert propaganda by the Bush Administration widened today  as four United States Senators urged Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to launch an immediate criminal investigation into whether the Department of Education  DoE  paid columnist Armstrong Williams for services he never performed    Senators Edward M  Kennedy  D MA   Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   John F  Kerry  D MA  and Byron Dorgan  D ND  cited information revealed in Friday s GAO report on propaganda that raised the separate issue of possible contract fraud  Specifically  the GAO revealed that the Department of Education could not produce evidence that Mr  Williams completed 167 activities he claimed to have performed under the contract  The GAO  conducting its own search on the Internet  was also unable to locate evidence that these activities were performed  Three days after these issues were exposed in the GAO report  an article in Monday s edition of USA TODAY revealed that Mr  Williams is now seeking to repay some of the  186 000 he received under the contract because he didn t promote the law or ask others to do so  as the contract required    The propaganda contract with Armstrong Williams is not only a sign of the culture of corruption within the White House  but also reveals the carelessness that the Administration took with funds intended to educate America s students  The money given to Williams to spread propaganda should be returned to the Treasury immediately  as that amount could allow 58 more students get the extra help they need under No Child Left Behind  Fraud and propaganda should have no place in our democracy  the American people deserve better  said Senator Kennedy    Over the past few days  information has come to light that raises questions about possible criminal violations surrounding the Department of Education s contractual relationship with Mr  Armstrong Williams  We strongly urge you to open an immediate investigation  wrote the lawmakers    Taking taxpayer dollars for work you didn t do is fraud    period  said Senator Lautenberg  Americans are already upset that the Bush Administration paid off a columnist to write glowing reviews of the President s education agenda  The notion that he may not have even done the work only makes it worse  Did the Administration knowingly enter into a  no show  contract      A copy of the letter citing the laws that may have been violated is attached to this release                                                 30    October 6  2005   Honorable Alberto Gonzales Attorney General Department of Justice Washington  DC  20530   Dear Attorney General Gonzales    As you may be aware  on Friday the Government Accountability Office  GAO  ruled that the Department of Education illegally used taxpayer dollars to conduct covert propaganda activities  in part through a contract entered into with journalist Armstrong Williams to promote the President s education programs  In light of the GAO s findings we have urged the Secretary of Education to seek recovery of the misspent funds     Over the past few days  information has come to light that raises questions about possible criminal violations surrounding the Department of Education s contractual relationship with Mr  Armstrong Williams  We strongly urge you to open an immediate investigation    The Department of Education first entered into a contractual relationship with Mr  Armstrong Williams through his company  the Graham Williams Group  GWG  in 2003  Information gathered by the Department of Education Inspector General  IG  and the GAO  released in a GAO legal decision on Friday  suggest that GWG claimed to have performed activities under the contract that were not actually performed  In addition  Mr  Williams has made statements to the press this week admitting that the work was not performed as reported    In April  the Department of Education IG found that GWG claimed in its reports that Mr  Williams engaged in 168 activities promoting the No Child Left Behind program over the course of the year the contract covered  However  the GAO  during its investigation saw only one column evidencing such activities  and the Department of Education was unable to provide any documentation that any of the other activities Mr  Armstrong cited were ever performed  The GAO attempted to locate evidence of the other 167 activities on the Internet  but only found a handful of random columns and no other documents during the relevant period     The contract in question was entered into  performed and paid in 2003 and 2004  After the release of last week s GAO report  USA Today reported on Monday that Mr  Williams is discussing returning some of his fees because he didn t promote the law or ask others to do so  as the contract required  It is unclear under what procedure Mr  Williams is attempting to return the funds at this time    These developments warrant scrutiny under two statutes  18 U S C   1001 and 18 U S C   287  We believe it is critical to commence an investigation as soon as possible  as Mr  Williams is claiming that he is currently in discussions with the Department of Education about disposition of the funds his company received under the contract      Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to your reply         Sincerely     FRANK LAUTENBERG   EDWARD M  KENNEDY   JOHN F  KERRY   BYRON L  DORGAN     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
