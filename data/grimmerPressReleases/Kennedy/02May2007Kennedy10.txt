         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     As prepared for delivery    I thank my colleagues for being ready with their amendments so the Senate can make progress on this important legislation  Today  we will deal with several major issues First  our colleague from Michigan  Senator Stabenow  and our colleague on the HELP committee  Senator Brown  will offer an important proposal to end the abuse of what are known as citizens petitions  They are joined in this bipartisan proposal by Senator Lott and Senator Thune FDA has a common sense policy to allow ordinary citizens or medical experts to submit comments and petitions to the agency about drugs that it is considering approving  This procedure should be used to protect public health  but too often  it is subverted by those who seek only to delay the entry onto the market of generic drugs At the 11th hour  drug companies suddenly discovered a range of supposed safety problems with a generic competitor  These alleged concerns might have been known for months preceding the filing of the petition  but they are delayed and delayed until the very day or week that the generic is to be approved  Only then is a mountain of paper delivered to the FDA with a demand that the agency review it before approving the generic With inadequate resources  it can take months for FDA to review the claims in the petition  even when they are patently false  Even if the petitions are found to be meritless  they will have accomplished their mission  delaying access for consumers to safe and lower cost medicines To be sure  some citizens petitions do present legitimate public health concerns  and FDA should not ignore them  but fewer than 1 in 10 of these petitions have been found to raise legitimate concerns  The critical test of any proposal on citizens petition is that it strike a balance so that the abuse of citizens petitions is prohibited  but those petitions that have genuine safety information are reviewed The proposal before the Senate today strikes that balance  It rightly states that the mere filing of a citizen petition should not be cause for delay  but  and this is crucial  it allows FDA to delay the approval of a generic application if it determines that doing so is necessary to protect public health This is the right approach  It prevents abuse  but protects health  I commend my colleagues for having struck the right balance on this major issue  and I urge the Senate to approve their proposal We will deal with another issue this morning  but this is an amendment I urge my colleagues to reject  One of the major elements of the FDA bill is a program to provide incentives for developing new drugs for children  Senator Dodd  Senator Clinton  Senator Alexander  and many others have been champions of this program  as was our former colleague  Senator DeWine  A reauthorization of an effective program is an opportunity to strengthen those aspects that work well and improve those that need adjustment  Senator Dodd took up this challenge  and reviewed the information about how the program had worked over the years since Congress last reviewed it  He found that companies were sometimes rewarded with billions of dollars in additional sales in return for doing studies that cost them only tens of millions  Clearly  we must provide incentives to develop new drugs for children  but we must be responsible in doing so  That is why Senator Dodd included in this reauthorization a proposal to adjust the period of market exclusivity for drugs that generate over  1 billion in sales  These blockbuster drugs will receive only three months of exclusivity instead of the six available to other drugs The Allard amendment would delete this sensible provision and give all drugs the full six months  That can be worth billions of dollars to a major medication  Those extra six months dont just apply to sales for use in children  they apply to all sales  A heart drug tested in children would get six months protection from competition  so it can rack up big returns The amendment we face embodies a policy that has no proportionality  It gives the same reward to a Lipitor or a Xanax as to a drug for specialty antibiotics that might be helpful in treating ear infections in children  Senator Dodds proposal has that sense of proportional reward  but the amendment overturns it  Thats the wrong approach and I hope the Senate will reject it Later today  I hope we will have an opportunity to consider an amendment to improve food safety that we have been working on with many colleagues  including Senator Durbin  Senator Enzi  Senator Allard  Senator Hatch and Senator Harkin  Our HELP committee will take a comprehensive approach to food safety in the days to come  but the current amendment is an important first step of measures we should take right away in terms of increased surveillance  better reporting of adverse events  especially from food importers  and stronger quality standards  We need to take steps both for the food we give our families and the food that our pets are fed I will speak in greater detail to this legislation at another time  but I wanted to alert my Senate colleagues that we plan to continue to work in this area      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
