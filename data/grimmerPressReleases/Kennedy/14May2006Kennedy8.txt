         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                          CONTACT  Melissa Wagoner  Keith Maley  617  565 4472    Thank you  Richard  for that generous introduction  and I commend you for your impressive leadership as President of the College  It s great to be with a President I agree with    Over the past seven years  the students  faculty and staff  the Greater Springfield community and the entire Commonwealth  have all benefited from your leadership and your vision for the future     I m grateful to the Class of 2006 for inviting me to be a part of this commencement  and I m very grateful for this honorary degree  I congratulate each of the new graduates and your families  Your good work and many sacrifices have made this day possible  and you deserve great credit     My brother Jack spoke at the commencement here 50 years ago  about to the day  He emphasized in 1956 that our country was  he said  embarking on a path to change  He was speaking during a time of dramatic transformation that would redefine how Americans saw each other and themselves  Television sets were selling at a rate of 7 million a year  making us all eye witnesses to history and expanding our common heritage in ways unimagined at the time  The Federal Government at the time was about to embark on what the Secretary of Commerce called the greatest public works program in the history of the world    an interstate highway system with 43 000 miles of new highways  Jonas Salk had just discovered the vaccine that ended the scourge of polio  IBM had introduced a computer that could play checkers and perform 230 000 operations a second     In a sense  that s the story of America    change and progress    and I m sure even Jack would be amazed at the massive transformation we re seeing all around us today  Miracles of medicine seem to be coming once a week instead of once a generation  Instead of building highways for people and products to travel throughout our country  we re building an information superhighway to move ideas instantly around the world  Computers can now perform a million times more operations per second than the IBM horse and buggy model of 1956  The seed of the idea that technology could evolve to meet the changing needs of society was planted firmly in the 1950 s  but it s in fuller bloom than ever today     These revolutions aren t just happening here  They are transforming the world and allowing peoples to communicate and share ideas instantly  regardless of nationality  race  income  or education     As in any era  the changes and advances have not all been positive  For many citizens  the American dream is in danger  with global forces causing the economy to shift against them  It s as true here in Springfield as it is in the rest of the nation  The Pioneer Valley has endured substantial hardships in recent years  But we have a great deal to be proud of  and an obligation to make sure that our strengths are widely known  And one of those great strengths is this wonderful institution that you graduate from today     As we face these new challenges  we have a choice  We can be driven by the harsh winds of the global economy  Or we can think anew  and guide the currents of globalization with a new vision that strengthens America and equips our people to meet the future with confidence  When Martin Luther King Jr  spoke at the Springfield College Commencement of 1964 he said  I would like to suggest that we are challenged more than ever before to achieve a world perspective  Anyone who seeks to live in isolation  or any nation that seeks to live in isolation  is sleeping through a revolution  To quell the revolution created by this shrinking world  we need to revitalize the American Dream  so that if people work hard and play by the rules  they can succeed in life  be better off than their parents  live in good neighborhoods  raise strong families in safe surroundings  work in decent jobs with decent pay and decent benefits  and have a decent retirement  But to do this  we must make a much greater commitment to education    to lifelong education  virtually from cradle to grave    It s a frequent joke in Democratic circles  as you may have heard  that for Republicans  life begins at conception and ends at birth  We know it s not true  and it s certainly not true for education     From our earliest days as a nation  education has been the engine of the American dream  Time and again  when we faced obstacles  our leaders looked to education to provide the means to overcome them  In the mid 1800s  with the Industrial Revolution in full swing  we created free and mandatory public schools long before most other nations did  At the end of that century  we established public high schools to keep pace with the new industrial revolution  When our soldiers returned home from World War II  we enacted the GI Bill of Rights and sent millions of veterans to college  That single step may have been the one that turned their generation into what we ve called The Greatest Generation    A year after my brother spoke to the graduating class of 1956  the Russians launched Sputnik  and with it a new level of the Cold War  In response  Republican President Dwight Eisenhower and a Democratic Congress enacted the National Defense Education Act  and almost overnight we doubled the federal investment in education  especially in math and science and engineering  It s a source of huge consternation to me that we have a White House and Congress today that are bent on reducing support for education to fund larger and larger tax breaks for the well off     From the beginning  Massachusetts has rejected that priority as wrong  We ve embraced education as essential to our democracy  John Adams wrote it into our State Constitution in 1780  saying education of the people is necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties  We re proud to have the oldest public high school in the nation  the oldest college in the nation and one of the first career and technical schools  Horace Mann led the effort to create the first public school system  and Massachusetts was the first state to enact a compulsory education law  Perhaps more than ever today  we need a renaissance in education  To stay competitive  we must invest in improving access to education at all levels    for the youngest children through all our working years     Each and every one of you graduating today will help shape America s destiny in your generation  The excellent education you ve received here at Springfield has supplied you with the skills and knowledge you ll need to help keep America strong and prosperous     But you ll need a federal government that does its part as well  by guaranteeing that all of America s talented youth have the opportunity to celebrate a college graduation as you are today  That means doing much more to enable students and families to afford the cost of college  so that graduates like you are free to turn your passions into careers    unburdened by concerns about paying off college loans     What happens at Springfield and on other campuses and communities throughout the country is of enduring importance for the well being and future of the nation  Those who will play the greatest role are the people like yourselves  rising to the challenges and opportunities waiting to be met  You did not make the world you live in  but you have the chance to change it  to help us face the global challenges head on and leave the world better than you found it  That s the true spirit of the American dream and the true purpose of education     E B  White put the choice beautifully and succinctly      It s hard to know when to respond to the seductiveness of the world  and when to respond to its challenge  If the world were merely seductive  that would be easy  If it were merely challenging  that would be no problem  But I arise every morning torn between the desire to improve the world and the desire to enjoy it  This makes it hard to plan the day     I urge you to realize that you can enjoy the world while changing it  You ve already begun that journey at Springfield College  From its earliest days as an institution educating YMCA professionals  the College has developed a mission to educate students in spirit  mind  and body for leadership in service to others  My brother spoke about that to the Class of 1956  and praised the commitment to community fostered here at the College  As he put it  the students graduating had surely derived a sense of inspiration and idealism    a desire to serve others  an urge to contribute to society  a deeply felt feeling that you could help make the world a better place in which man might live at peace  And if he were speaking today  he d have said in which men and women might live in peace    This idealism and commitment to community is the College s greatest strength  In education programs such as America Reads  or volunteering in the Springfield Public Schools  or neighborhood development programs like the Partnership for Renewal of Old Hill  or the thousands of students that participate in the Action Day  lending a hand to over 70 local schools  shelters  senior citizen facilities and community organizations  the College has been an example to us all over the years of the important role that higher education must have in the life of a community     I hope as many of you as possible will make this wonderful state your home  It s the best educated state in the nation  Household income is among the highest in the country  We re a leader in health care  high tech industry and the life sciences  Some of the most productive companies on Wall Street are located here  There is no state where it is easier to make a real difference in your community or that offers greater opportunity to pursue your dreams and improve the world around you  Massachusetts has something to offer everyone  whatever your dreams and goals may be     I m confident that the Commonwealth will continue to prosper and lead the nation in the years to come  But we need you  We need your optimism and enthusiasm  and your commitment to the Commonwealth  We need your skill and ability to restart the engines of growth     Wherever you reside  remember that it is the hard work of the past that has brought the opportunities of the present  and the future  Be thankful for your teachers and your families  especially for the sacrifices they have made to bring you safely to this threshold of the future    It is easy to find excuses to justify apathy and indifference in the face of opposition that seems too strong or issues that seem too complex  These impulses of frustration  futility and fear are only natural  But the times need your talent  You can be the voice for the voiceless  the help for the helpless  the home for the homeless    As my brother  Robert Kennedy  liked to say  it is the individual who makes the difference  He told the students at the University of Capetown in South Africa in 1966  Each time a person stands up for an ideal  or acts to improve the lot of others  or strikes out against injustice  he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope  and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring  these ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance     Congratulations for all that you ve accomplished here  and for the ripples of hope you will send out in the years ahead     Thank you very much   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
