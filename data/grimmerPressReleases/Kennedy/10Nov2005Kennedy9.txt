         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I m troubled to learn that Judge Alito does not stand by his 1990 promise to recuse himself from any cases involving the Vanguard companies  His letter raises serious factual questions as well as questions of law and judgment  The true independence of our judges could not be more important  especially today with our democracy in such disarray  This is now the latest in a series of varied explanations of Judge Alito s failure to recuse himself  His commitment under the law and his 1990 promise to the Senate to recuse himself from cases involving Vanguard will continue as long as he owns Vanguard funds  We still very much need answers to the questions we asked that this letter does not answer I m looking forward to discussing these issues with the judge in our meeting next week   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
