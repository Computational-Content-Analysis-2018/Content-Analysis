         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633    Americans continue to be moved by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and its toll on our fellow Americans from New Orleans and in the Gulf Coast region    particularly in Louisiana  Mississippi  Alabama    The human tragedy has brought out the generosity of the American spirit as people have opened their homes and pocketbooks to families uprooted by the storm     This is a disaster of biblical proportions  The dimensions of this tragedy almost are beyond human comprehension  And the failures by our government to prepare and to respond run deep and wide    Yesterday  the President and the White House spokesman proclaimed that the Administration would not play the blame game  Well Mr  President  this is not a game  This is not some school yard spat  It is about life and death  And most important  it s about getting it right the next time    We must be about the work of providing continuing relief to our citizens and rebuilding our communities  But we also cannot delay the important task of determining what went so gravely wrong  and holding accountable those responsible for the tragic failures that Americans have seen so clearly on their televisions and read in their newspapers    The next disaster could be tomorrow  It could be a devastating earthquake  It could be a deadly terrorist attack  It could be another destructive storm     We need an immediate and independent assessment of what went wrong and what we must do to fix it    Any corporation faced with such devastation and incompetence by its leadership would have its board and its shareholders demanding an independent assessment of the failures and demanding accountability for its leadership  It would not be business as usual     The same holds true for the people s government  The people have a right to candor and honesty about the state of their government s preparedness to protect them    The new Department of Homeland Security created by this Administration was supposed to protect us  It was supposed to do a better job of keeping us safe  Well it failed  More than a million people have been displaced from their homes  A treasured American city is a wasteland  Thousands have lost their lives  An economy has been shattered with ripple effects all over America    Candor  Honesty  Action  That s what we need  The people have a right to know that they will be better protected the next time    Another lesson of this tragedy is that America can ignore the disparities in our society no longer  The powerful winds of this storm have torn away the mask that has hidden from our debates the many Americans who are left out and left behind    We see now in stark relief that so many Americans live every day on the brink of economic disaster  For them  any setback becomes a major obstacle to survival  And a hurricane of this force leaves their lives in the balance    These disparities have emerged not out of malice  but out of indifference  But they are real  and we can neglect them no longer    In August  the Census Bureau reported that the poverty rate in America is up  and has risen for four consecutive years  It s now 12 7 percent with 37 million Americans surviving in poverty    A quarter of all African Americans live in poverty   For Latinos  it s 22 percent    One fifth of our children live in poverty and a tenth of our elderly    36 million Americans are hungry or malnourished    A third of our children are in families without health insurance   In fact  45 million Americans have no health coverage at all    And the disparity in incomes has never been greater  with the rich getting richer  and the rest of America    the poor and the middle class    falling behind    And now people in the middle class are having a hard time  too  Already  they were struggling to cope with rising gasoline prices  rising college tuition  and the rising cost of health care  And now  those affected by Katrina have lost everything    their homes  their cars  their family photos    everything    We cannot be an America of haves and have nots  We cannot be an America of 50 separate isolated states  As we rebuild the Gulf Coast  we must also come together to tackle these disparities  We must be a united America    one nation  under God  with liberty and justice for all  And when we say all  we mean all    To address this challenge  our government must respond in ways that are as good and compassionate as the American people  We can t just fix the hole in the roof  We need to rebuild the whole foundation    I propose that we create a New Orleans and Gulf Coast Redevelopment Authority modeled after the Tennessee Valley Authority in its heyday  We should invest at least  150 billion in its actions to work with governors and mayors and citizens and communities to plan  help fund  and coordinate for the reconstruction of that damaged region  And it should help hire workers to put people back to work rebuilding their own communities and help them get back on their feet again    This is a national responsibility  The tragedy affects us all  not only in our hearts  but it affects the national economy and our national security    That s the America we stand for    an America where we treat each other with respect    where we address our mistakes and meet our challenges with honesty and candor and immediate action    America deserves no less   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
