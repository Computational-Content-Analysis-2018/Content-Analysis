         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CSenators Edward M  Kennedy  D MA   Gordon H  Smith  R OR   Jay Rockefeller  D WV   and Olympia J  Snowe  R ME  released the following statements on the legislation introduced today that will prevent states from having to drastically restricting the number of children who can access care  The bill specifically prohibits the implementation of rules put in place by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that would essentially prohibit states from providing quality health coverage to children whose family income is above 250  of the federal poverty level  This revokes that policy and would allow states to cover children at income levels that are most appropriate for their state  Senator Kennedy said  Once again  the Bush Administration has shown itself to be out of touch and out of step with the priorities of working Americans  The Childrens Health Insurance Program was passed to provide health coverage to all of our nations children  not just those the Administration chooses  This bill allows states to continue to have the flexibility to make the right decision for their children and will help secure coverage for children across the country  Partisan politics have no place in safeguarding the health of our children and I urge the Administration to listen to the will of the American people  and to Congress  and to put the needs of our children first This is a disappointing attempt by the Administration that would inhibit states ability to cover more uninsured kids  said Senator Smith  SCHIP is a valuable and life saving program that gives Americas children a chance at a healthy future  We will do all we can to try to block this policy and deliver a sensible SCHIP package to states The President needs to know that we will not stand by and let his Administration pull the rug out from children and their families  Senator Rockefeller said  Decisions about cost of living and what constitutes poverty should be left to the states who can best determine who can afford health insurance and who cannot  These decisions should not be made by the President who is clearly trying to use bureaucratic hurdles to block children from receiving necessary health care Health coverage has grown so expensive that even above 250 percent of the Federal poverty line  many families simply cannot afford it  In my state of Maine  a family faced with purchasing a policy on the individual market could face a cost well in excess of  24 000 a year  Senator Snowe said  So it is no wonder that so many states are working to reach more children in families in which health care remains unaffordable  We in the Senate have achieved a bipartisan consensus to ensure continued progress to protect the health of every child  This legislation will rightfully block efforts to impose onerous and unreasonable restrictions on the states efforts to reach every child in need  and will focus us all on the essential task of completing the reauthorization of SCHIP      Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
