         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Remarks as prepared for delivery at the University of Virginia School of Law  Im very grateful to Mort Caplin for that generous introduction  Ive always had immense respect for Mort  Whether as law teacher or government official  private attorney or public benefactor  hes made his professional life a continuing tribute to public service and public interest law Mort has taken his genius for the law and chosen to use it wisely to make an enormous difference   Mort taught me tax when I was a student here  And Mort    no matter what anyone says    you did not teach me to be a tax and spend liberal  Its a little known fact that President Kennedy brought Mort to Washington not only to run the Internal Revenue Service  which was just down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Senate  but so that Mort could keep a close eye on me as well  So its a special honor to be here in the Caplin Auditorium as part of the work of the Public Service Center  named for Mort  Lets all do our best to follow his magnificent example of public service through the law  Thank you so much  Mort  we love you   Its always a privilege to come to UVA and see the law schools vibrant commitment to public service and public interest law  Working together  the faculty  the administration  the students  and the alumni of UVA Law have made it a 21st century model of how a law school can expand the vision of its students and prepare them effectively for a lifelong commitment to public service   Your Pro Bono program introduces students to the challenges and the very real rewards of using law to help those in need    Your loan assistance program enables students to avoid burdensome debt and afford to begin their legal careers in public interest jobs    Your many clinics and courses provide a hands on introduction to public interest law  including the newest advocacy programs on the elderly  on international human rights  and on immigration    Your Public Interest Law Fellowships offer exciting opportunities for experience in service to others through the law  One of the best lessons these programs teach is that there are countless ways to be a public interest lawyer  The example set by another famous son of Virginia  Lewis Powell  shows the difference that early experience in the field can make  As a young lawyer before World War II  he served in the Richmond Legal Aid Society  In 1964  as a leading private practitioner  he became President of the American Bar Association  and one of his first acts was to call for a major expansion of the nations legal services to the poor   To understand how revolutionary that idea was  you have to know that when my brother became President in 1961  there was no national legal services program  There had long been legal aid and public defender offices in many cities  and a few privately funded groups made poverty law a part of community development organizations  But hardly any taxpayer dollars supported them   In those days  poverty law programs were too controversial for the federal government to support openly  Instead  Robert Kennedy as Attorney General formed the Presidents Committee on Juvenile Delinquency  and made himself chairman  Under the banner of fighting urban youth crime  the Committee allocated funds in various federal departments to pay for Legal Service Offices in poor communities   In 1964  as part of President Johnsons Great Society  Congress enacted a genuine anti poverty program in the Office of Economic Opportunity  and  under Sargent Shriver  it became a source for legal services funding throughout the country   That program filled such an obvious need that 5 years later  when the incoming Nixon administration tried to abolish it  the bar and many of us on Capitol Hill were able not only to save the program but to create the Legal Services Corporation as an ongoing federally funded program   Ironically  President Nixon himself signed that bill into law as his last legislative act before resigning as President   The attacks on the program didnt stop however  and its budget and scope continue to be targets  Nevertheless  with the support of the organized bar  it has persisted and even flourished in this state and throughout the country  and a majority of us in Congress continue to support it  There is one other irony to the story  In 1971  when an embattled President Nixon sought a non controversial nominee to replace Justice Hugo Black on the Supreme Court  he chose that same Lewis Powell  and the nomination sailed through the Senate  in large part because Powell had proven his dedication to constitutional principles of equality and fairness by his lifelong devotion to the legal services movement  My own experience as a public interest lawyer was quite different from Morts or Justice Powells  I began as a political campaigner  Undoubtedly some of you will also begin your public service in an election campaign this year or in 2008  And perhaps youll be as fortunate as I was in 1960  and the campaign you join will be a successful campaign for President  I hope some of you will join a District Attorneys office  as I also did as a young lawyer  or perhaps youll be a public defender or a legal services lawyer  dealing directly with clients  Theyre all inspiring ways to become involved in public interest law  and effective ways to learn the practical art of good lawyering as well  I sincerely hope some of you will try for elected office yourselves  If you have the chance  I highly recommend the U S  Senate  UVA gives you a head start  There were two UVA law graduates in the Senate when I was elected in 1962  Hugh Scott from the class of 1922  and John Stennis from the class of 1927  both towering figures in the Senate  Ten more graduates of this school arrived after I did  and there are hundreds more UVAers in public office at every level of government   As Senators  we represent our constituents and answer to them on election day  But in a very real sense  we also answer directly to the founders who met in Philadelphia during that hot summer of 1787  and created the kind of government that enabled us  despite our many faults     to become the greatest nation in history  The founders were brilliant men who established a constitutional structure that has worked well through 220 years of time and change  war and peace  pain and progress  But that structure always has and always will rely upon citizens with the courage and commitment to fulfill its promise   They counted on each generation to elect members of Congress who would prevent the Executive from abusing its powers  In addition  as George Washington said  the Senate was to be the saucer that could cool the sometimes overheated legislation that might be produced by the House of Representatives   They counted as well on the advice and consent of the Senate to make sure that Presidential choices for the cabinet and judicial posts would serve the public interest and not just the Presidents personal or partisan interests   Rather than the two year terms of the House and the four year terms of the President  Senators were given the stability of six year terms  and the terms were staggered  so that only one third of the Senate would be chosen in any one election  as a way to resist what James Madison called the impulse of sudden and violent passions   The framers also felt the Senate would have the knowledge and skills to make sure the President pursued the national interest in dealing with foreign nations  Thus treaties  vital to a young maritime nation  could not be implemented by the President without our advice and consent   Finally  the framers entrusted the Senate with the ultimate responsibility of serving as the jury to decide whether an impeached President or judge should be removed from office   Its no wonder that many of us in the Senate always have copies of the Constitution readily at hand  Its no surprise that we keep going back to the Federalist papers to get new insights into what the Framers expected of us   For us  the Constitution is not just a historical document under glass in the National Archives Building in Washington  The status and responsibilities that the founders gave us are meant to be applied every hour of every day  We do not have the right to ignore or dilute or waive them  because they are not ours to dispose of  they belong permanently to the people we temporarily serve  They are the nations legacy  and we are the current trustees of that legacy   Our obligation is to see that the legacy is preserved and respected  used in the public interest  and handed on intact for the benefit of our successors and all future generations  From the very beginning of my service as Senator  the powerful force of constitutional principles has been at the heart of my own public service   In my very first year  resistance to the Supreme Courts school desegregation cases culminated in President Kennedys decision to federalize the National Guard to integrate the University of Alabama  Two months later  the historic Civil Rights March on Washington took place  and Martin Luther Kings I Have a Dream speech focused the nations attention on the fact that litigation alone could not meet the need for progress on basic rights  and that we in that Congress would have to act   In the summer of 1963  President Kennedy sent us legislation protecting those rights  not only in public schools but also in public accommodations  employment  and voting  Thus began many intense years of debating and testing the constitutional limits of our power to vindicate the basic rights of Americans of all races  Until then  the Senates record on civil rights had not been a proud one  The same powers and traditions  the same expectation of careful deliberation and evolutionary change that enabled the Senate to be a restraint on reckless government  also allowed opponents of civil rights to restrain the pace of needed change  The framers had given the Senate the right to make its own rules  and those rules  favoring lengthy debate  consensus  and caution  in the spirit of the Constitution  also allowed a minority of Senators to prevent or delay much needed change by filibustering basic reforms  The Senate became the critical battlefield in the fight for full civil rights and equality of opportunity for all President Kennedy did not live to see the results of his initiative  but I was privileged to be part of the debate as the Republican leader  Everett Dirksen of Illinois  and our Southern President  Lyndon Johnson  decided that the time had come for the long overdue application of the noble principles of our Constitution to all our people  71 Senators  including 26 Republicans  voted to end the filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  A year to the day after President Kennedy submitted his proposed legislation  the Senate passed it  and the path to full constitutional citizenship suddenly opened wide for millions of Americans  The strong support of the Senate ensured that this new national course would be accepted by the American people as the law of the land  But that historic vindication of the Constitution was not the only one in my first years as a Senator  One of my first speeches in the Senate was in support of Senate ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty negotiated by my brother with the Russians  As the framers foresaw  the nations strong support  for what he called this fresh start on the road to peace  was dramatized and amplified by the vote of 81 Senators for ratification of the treaty  Its been the same process  again and again since then  A Senate designed to be deliberative has proven it can be decisive when needed  and new generations of Senators have found ways to meet the challenges of their time within a structure that is hundreds of years old   I think especially of the battles earlier in my Senate career to abolish poll taxes  to preserve the Supreme Courts constitutional one person one vote decision on congressional districting  to lower the voting age to 18 and to abolish the shameful racism of our long standing restrictions on immigrants from the so called Asian Pacific Triangle  I also think of the passionate debates over nominations to the Supreme Court by President Nixon and President Reagan  and their rejection by the Senate  There was the intense confrontation with President Nixon over Watergate and his gross abuse of Presidential power that led to his resignation on the eve of the debate in the House of Representatives on his impeachment  followed a quarter century later by the Senates rejection of the partisan effort by the House of Representatives to remove President Clinton through impeachment  But I can remember no time in my life when it has been as important as it is today for the Senate to serve as a check on the Executive Branch  The administration has seized upon the 9 11 attacks and their aftermath to assert powers that no President has ever had  and take actions that the Senate must not leave unchallenged   President Bush opposed congressional efforts to investigate the governmental failures that contributed to the 9 11 tragedy   The Administration gave Congress faulty intelligence and incomplete and misleading information  when Congress voted to authorize the war in Iraq   The President continues to claim unlimited power to hold detainees indefinitely and incommunicado  and created military tribunals rather than deferring to the courts   He approved policies authorizing torture and inhumane treatment of detainees in violation of federal law and military rules and traditions  and he refused to come clean with the Congress when facts and documents began to show the actual abuses that occurred   Today were embroiled in the debate over the Presidents claimed powers as Commander in Chief of the armed forces to authorize massive warrantless electronic surveillance of American citizens here at home  without complying with the statutory requirement of judicial approval  Together  these and other actions demonstrate the Administrations clear rejection of the Constitutions demand for a balance of powers among the branches of government  They suggest an arrogance in the White House that betrays the rule of law that is central to our constitutional structure   The framers anticipated that there might be such abuses  and they expected the Senate to remedy them  As Madison wrote  the Senate must be in all cases a salutary check on the government  In the past 5 years  some of us in the Senate have tried to exercise this constitutional responsibility    sometimes with partial success  and sometimes in vain  The White House largely succeeded in preventing a serious inquiry on 9 11 by the Joint Senate and House Intelligence Committees  It refused to turn over relevant documents and provide key witnesses  and the inquiry finally reached its pre set deadline  But the Congressional and public demand  especially from the Senate  for a thorough investigation  continued  and we were able to obtain bipartisan support for a law creating an independent investigating commission  The 9 11 Commission held comprehensive public hearings and detailed a thorough report offering at least a partial accounting of the many errors and omissions that contributed to 9 11  That accounting will help us prevent future attacks if we have the will and wisdom to heed it  Weve made much less progress in the complex disputes over the scope of the Presidents power as Commander in Chief  The White House has taken the extreme position that  as long as terrorism is involved  the Presidents inherent powers trump specific statutes and treaties that are the law of the land  This has postured the President as a virtually perpetual war president  since the administration has also said that the war on terror may last for generations  In my judgment its a stunning arrogation of power that would make the founder of this great university  Thomas Jefferson  roll over in his grave  Senators on both sides of the aisle have complained about the White House assumption that it can detain suspects indefinitely without any judicial review  conduct interrogations using techniques that are classified as torture by U S  law and international treaties  and turn U S  detainees over to other nations for torture   In each of these cases we have asked for the relevant documents  We have urged comprehensive hearings  and called for independent investigations like the 9 11 Commission  But we have been effectively rebuffed by a Senate Republican majority that appears more concerned about protecting the President of their party than fulfilling the constitutional mandate to be a check against such abuses   I sit on two of the committees that should be involved in this effort  the Armed Services Committee and the Judiciary Committee  Even when the Republican Chairmen have been willing to hold hearings on some of these issues  the Administration witnesses have been uncooperative  Again and again  weve been stonewalled  slow walked  and misled on the real story of these practices  and denied meaningful access to the responsible officials and documents that could tell us what actually happened   On torture  the original disclosures made clear that top military legal officers in the Pentagon strongly resisted the civilian decisions to permit torture  but the civilians prevailed  We knew that the internal debate in the administration had escalated to the highest levels of the Justice Department  the State Department and the White House  Nevertheless  the administration provided us with witness after witness who portrayed the abuses as aberrations by a few bad apples at the lowest levels in the field    a view belied by everything we know   Military investigations and prosecutions likewise focused on those at the bottom of the chain of abuses involving detention and interrogation  Meanwhile  those at the policy making end of the chain have escaped responsibility for authorizing and justifying violations of longstanding military rules and statutes that prohibit torture   Many of those officials  rather than being investigated or disciplined  have been promoted and honored  At least two were nominated to federal appeals courts  and one was confirmed by the Senate before his role was disclosed    Another major player became Attorney General of the United States  He took the precaution  just before his confirmation hearing  of withdrawing the key memo at the heart of the torture scandal  But he did so only after it had been in force for over two years  After his confirmation hearing  despite his refusal to provide relevant documents and responsive answers  he was approved on a party line vote  Thankfully  the Senate has not been altogether silent  At John McCains initiative  we adopted an amendment making clear that torture is prohibited in the interrogation of detainees  After initially opposing the amendment  President Bush praised it and signed it  But when he did so  he hypocritically reserved the right to ignore it  claiming it might interfere with his powers as Commander in Chief   The same sorry pattern of abuse can be seen on warrantless surveillance  The administration has chosen to tell us very little about their spying program  the few facts they have shared with Congress make clear that the administration is flouting a specific law prohibiting such eavesdropping without court review  When we asked for the legal basis for the administrations program  we got answers  but they were rationalizations that would get a failing grade in any class at UVA law school   The pattern has been the same on detention practices and on the so called practice of rendition  the transfer of prisoners to other nations known to practice torture  There has been no meaningful oversight  either by Congress itself or through establishment of an independent 9 11 type commission  The necessary documents are in the files of the executive branch  but Congress refuses to issue subpoenas demanding them   These issues  of torture  detention  and surveillance  have rightly claimed major headlines of the past few years  But beneath the issues of the day is the issue of a lifetime  whether Congress will find the courage and conviction to perform its constitutional role  The framers counted on each generation to reinforce our constitutional structure  When we fail to hold the executive to account  that structure is weakened  perhaps permanently  This is a challenge that should concern every American  If the President does not give due respect to the constitutional role of the Congress  and the Congress will not stand up against him when he violates that principle  how can the Constitution be preserved  On such critical questions  it is always useful to consult the wisdom of the father of this University  Thomas Jefferson  A few years before he died  Jefferson reflected upon the democracy he helped create  and wrote  I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of  the society but the people themselves  and if we think  them not enlightened enough to exercise their control  with wholesome discretion  the remedy is not to take it  from them  but to inform their discretion by education   This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional  power Those words rightly place the ultimate responsibility to protect and preserve our constitutional system on all of us here today  As the lawyers and leaders and Senators of the future  you have a special obligation to educate the public on these issues by teaching and writing and speaking about them  and working with groups that care about these issues   So you have your assignment  Carry it out  and you will join in the great tradition of Thomas Jefferson  and Lewis Powell   and Mort Caplin  And you will make it possible for future generations  here and across the country  to confront modern challenges with the help of an unyielding constitutional framework that has never ceased to  and must always    protect us all   Thank you very much    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
