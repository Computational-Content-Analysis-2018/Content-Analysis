         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the delay in the Voting Rights Act vote   Yesterdays decision by the House leadership to delay a vote on reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act shouldnt affect our work on the bill in the Senate  The House Judiciary Committee approved the bill nearly unanimously in committee  and it is time for the Senate Judiciary Committee to act as well  Chairman Specter has said that we will act on the bill next week  so that the full Senate will have an opportunity to consider it after the July 4th recess   The House delay was caused by last minute concerns over the bilingual ballot provisions in Section 203 of the current Act  which enables all American citizens to participate fully in our democracy even if they have not yet mastered the English language   Its difficult to believe that House Republicans want to start penalizing Puerto Ricans  Native Americans  and Alaskan natives at the ballot box   We shouldnt penalize naturalized citizens whove come to this country to pursue opportunity and live the promise of democracy  and theyre no less worthy than any other citizen to exercise their right to vote  Naturalized Americans understand the importance of learning English  and all of them have done so on a basic level as part of the citizenship process    Understanding voting instructions and the often complex language of ballot provisions requires more than a basic grasp of English  Its wrong to punish American citizens by denying them full voting rights until they master the English language  If were sincere about the melting pot  theres no better way to achieve it than through the ballot box  and Section 203 helps make it possible          Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
