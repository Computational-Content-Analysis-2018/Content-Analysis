         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      WASHINGTON  D C   Today  Senator Edward Kennedy and Congressman Silvestre Reyes  D TX  held a conference call with members of the media to discuss the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform on the day that House Republicans are holding yet another unnecessary publicity stunt immigration hearing  Senator Kennedy  along with Senator McCain  is the lead sponsor of the comprehensive bipartisan bill that passed the Senate earlier this year  As the House Republican hearings continue to distort the Senate plan with todays hearing in Indiana  Kennedy set the record straight by outlining the labor provisions that protect workers in his legislation  described below    The Republican House immigration hearings are a cynical ploy undertaken at the taxpayers expense  Americans deserve a solution to our broken immigration system  not delay tactics and election year politics  The House Republicans have no comprehensive plan of their own  and so they have resorted to name calling  They have falsely labeled the McCain Kennedy plan being harmful to American workers  when in fact our plan will ensure that the jobs of American workers arent undercut and temporary workers arent abused by the companies that hire them  Senator Kennedy said  The American people  President Bush  and a bipartisan majority of the Senate support the comprehensive McCain  Kennedy plan because it will strengthen our national security  protect our borders  enforce our laws and provide a path to earned citizenship    Below are the worker provisions in the Senate bipartisan plan   PREVAILING WAGE AND WORKER PROTECTIONS IN THE SENATE IMMIGRATION BILL  SUMMARY  At their field hearings  House Republicans have claimed that the Senate bill will require companies to pay illegal immigrants more than domestic workers  This is simply false  and a scare tactic  First  the Senate bill would have no impact whatsoever on the wages of illegal immigrants  The wage provisions of the Senate bill apply only to legal immigrants who enter this country under a temporary worker program  Second  the bill will protect the jobs and wages of American workers by ensuring that companies cant undercut American workers by hiring guest workers and paying them lower wages  Under the bill  companies can only hire guest workers when there is a genuine shortage of workers in the United States  Companies must advertise a job to American workers at the prevailing wages in that occupation for at least 10 weeks  and can only seek to hire a guest worker if they cannot find an American worker to take the job  These companies would have to pay any guest workers that they lawfully bring into the country the prevailing wages for workers in that occupation  as defined by the Department of Labor under the Davis Bacon Act or Service Contract Act  This protects the wages of American workers by preventing companies from hiring guest workers at poverty wages  driving down wages for U S  workers   Removing these vital protections  as House Republicans have advocated  would undercut the wages of the American workers that they claim they want to protect    Below are the provisions included in the bill that protect workers    Recruiting American Workers is Prioritized  Employers are required to recruit U S  workers through appropriate channels beginning at least 90 days prior to petitioning for a temporary worker  They cannot lay off a similarly employed U S  worker three months prior to and after hiring a temporary worker  Employers are required to keep documentation indicating why they did not hire any U S  applicants    Temporary Workers May Not Be Employed in Areas of High Unemployment  No petitions for temporary workers may be approved from employers in areas where the unemployment rate for unskilled and low skilled workers is more than 11 percent   The Same Working Conditions  Temporary workers must receive the same wages  benefits  and working conditions as similarly employed U S  workers  Wage levels are defined as the actual wages of similarly employed individuals or prevailing wages in the area of employment based on union contracts  the Davis Bacon Act  or the Service Contract Act  If the position is not covered by workers compensation insurance  the employer must provide equivalent insurance   No Way Around It  The bill prohibits employers from treating temporary workers as independent contractors  this helps ensure they are paid the same wages and working conditions as U S  workers and are able to join unions   Monitoring Labor Recruiters  Every company involved in foreign labor recruiting activity and every foreign labor recruiter is required to disclose to every worker who is recruited accurate information about the job  They may not impose a fee on workers for their recruitment  if a transportation cost is imposed  it must be reasonable  Recruiters must post a bond to ensure that workers are adequately protected   The Worker is Not Tied to One Employer  The temporary worker visa is portable  That is  a worker is not required to stay with one employer if the worker feels he or she is not being treated fairly  and can move to another job with any employer who complies with the requirements of the temporary worker program    Whistleblower Protection  The bill provides whistleblower protections to encourage employees to come forward and report violations of the terms of the bill  including its labor protection provisions   Investigating Labor Violations  The Secretary of Labor must set up a process for handling complaints from aggrieved workers  including both US workers and temporary workers  who believe their rights have been violated  The Secretary of Labor is required to investigate complaints by temporary workers if there is reasonable cause  Penalties may include back wages  fringe benefits  and civil criminal monetary penalties  The Hagel Martinez compromise authorizes 2 000 additional DOL inspectors   Enhanced Penalties for Unfair Practices  The bill imposes increased penalties on employers who engage in unfair immigration related employment practicesincluding retaliation for reporting violations   Employers Who Break the Rules are Barred from the Program  Employers who violate the terms of the temporary worker program can be barred from the program for up to three years   Workers Who Want to Become Permanent Residents Are Not Dependent On Their Employers  Although an employer can sponsor a temporary worker for permanent residence  the temporary worker program provides an opportunity for temporary workers  after four years in the worker program  to petition on their own for permanent residence      Laura Capps Melissa
