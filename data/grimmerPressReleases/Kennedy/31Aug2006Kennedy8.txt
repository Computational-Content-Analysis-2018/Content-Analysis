         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to President Bushs speech at the American Legions national convention today   The President missed yet another opportunity on Iraq  At a time that calls for serious leadership  the President is offering yet another public relations campaign  His dire warnings of the cost of failure in Iraq do nothing to make success more likely  and his stubborn insistence on staying with a failed policy all but ensures continued violence and chaos  The President s speech was a cynical attempt to help his Republican enablers survive the November elections at a time when he should be spending all of his time working to chart a new course in Iraq    The politics of fear may have worked for the Bush Cheney campaign in 2004  but by 2006 the American people see through them  They will judge Bush and his Congressional allies by their record  rather than their rhetoric  Americans understand that staying the course is not a plan for victory   it is a political slogan and a recipe for disaster   The American people are also fed up with the administration s double talk  The President has no business expressing the hope that people wouldn t politicize these issues just a few days after unleashing Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney to viciously attack critics of the administration  The American people will see through these political games and demand accountability and change in November     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
