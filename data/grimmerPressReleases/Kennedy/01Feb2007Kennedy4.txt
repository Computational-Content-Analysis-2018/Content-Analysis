         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy  202  224 2633Sandra Abrevaya  Durbin  202  224 7115Today  U S  Senators Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Richard J  Durbin  D IL  introduced the Student Loan Sunshine Act  which aims to protect students and parents from exploitation by private lenders and lenders who offer gifts to colleges as a way to secure loan business  The introduction of the Sunshine Act follows recent reports detailing the aggressive and highly questionable tactics some lenders are using to market private loans and court the favor of colleges and universities to offer such loans to their students  It also responds to the rapid growth in the use of private loans in recent years    such as alternative loans that lenders offer through schools  and direct to consumer private educational loans  According to the College Board  the total volume of private student loans has grown at an average rate of 27 per year since 2001  and now totals  17 3 billion  or 20 percent of all student loan volume  Some private loans carry interest rates as high as 19 percent  compared to 6 8 percent for loans made through the governments loan programs  and often are marketed to students and families with poor or no credit histories  Going to college is hard enough  Students shouldnt have to worry about being exploited when they take out student loans  said Senator Kennedy  Its obvious that some lenders are pulling out all the stops to woo colleges into offering their loan products  These inducements may be legal  but theyre wrong  They get in the way of providing students and their families with the help they need to afford college  At a time when students and families are turning to private and alternative loans more than ever  we need to make sure theyre being offered under the best terms possible  not because a lender has sought to make a sweetheart deal with a school  We need to shine a bright light on the incentive based relationships that exist between some universities and lenders  We want college officials to look out for the interests of their students instead of looking forward to the next gift or all expenses paid exotic vacation  said Senator Durbin  who has called for an Inspector General investigation into potential conflict of interest between lenders and universities  Before signing on the dotted line  students and their families should have all the facts and should feel confident that they re receiving the best deal on their college loan  The first obligation of any college or university is to help its students  not the lenders The Sunshine Act  Requires full disclosure of special arrangements that lenders and institutions of higher education have to offer loan products at the institution  Bans lenders from offering gifts worth more than  10 to college employees  including travel  lodging  entertainment  and in kind services that lenders provide to college financial aid offices  Requires full disclosure of the reasons why an institution of higher education has selected a lender for its preferred lender list  including any special arrangements the lender has with the school  Encourages borrowers to maximize their borrowing through the governments loan programs before taking out alternative loans and direct to consumer loans with higher interest rates  The Sunshine Act applies to all lenders that make private educational loans through colleges and universities  as well as lenders of direct to consumer educational loans  The provisions of the Act also apply to all post secondary educational institutions that receive Federal funds   30 Student Loan Sunshine ActSenators Edward M  Kennedy and Richard J  DurbinThe Student Loan Sunshine Act protects students and parents from exploitation by private lenders and lenders who offer gifts to colleges as a way to secure loan business  It requires full disclosure of special arrangements that lenders and colleges have to offer loan products at the college  bans lenders from offering gifts over  10 to college employees  and encourages borrowers to maximize their borrowing through the governments loan programs before taking out private loans with higher interest rates The Student Loan Sunshine Act Protects Students and Families by Ending Inappropriate Lender Practices o The Act prohibits lenders from offering any gift worth more than  10 to a college employee  including free or discounted trips  meals  invitations to entertainment events or other form of hospitality  o It also prohibits lenders from offering services to financial aid offices that create a conflict of interest  such as lending staff during peak loan processing times o It prohibits lenders from entering arrangements with colleges that require the college to brand the lenders loan product with the colleges emblem or logo Giving Students and Families More Information About Special Arrangements Between Lenders and Colleges  and the Terms and Conditions of Loans  and Preferred Lender Lists o The Act requires lenders to report any special arrangements they have with colleges to make loans to the Secretary of Education  including the terms of the arrangement related to marketing  recommending  endorsing student loans  and any benefit  direct or indirect  provided to or paid to any party in connection with the loan arrangement o The Act requires the Secretary of Education  together with members of the higher education community and students  to develop a clear  easy to use model format for reporting the terms and conditions of student loans  similar to the APR disclosure required for other types of loans o The Act requires colleges preferred lender lists to  include at least three non affiliated lenders  clearly and fully disclose why the college has identified a lender as a preferred lender  and state that students do not have to borrow from the preferred lender list Encouraging Borrowing Through the Governments Loan Programs  and Discouraging Overborrowing through Direct to Consumer Education Loans o The Act requires all lenders of direct to consumer private educational loans to clearly and prominently state that borrowers may qualify for low interest loans through the Federal governments loan programs  It also requires these lenders to clearly disclose how the interest rate is determined  sample loan costs disaggregated by type  information on any and all fees  information on collection in the case of default  and information on Better Business and state consumer agency or state attorney general complaints against the lender and their resolution o Before a DTC lender can offer an education loan of more than  1000  the Act requires the lender to notify the borrowers college of the amount of the proposed loan  so the school can advise the borrower if the loan exceeds whats necessary to cover the students cost of attendance after other aid sources are factored in o The Act bars lenders from offering a private loan through a college  also known as an alternative loan  until the college has informed students and parents of all their options for borrowing under the governments Title IV loan programs    including information on any terms and conditions of Title IV loans that are more favorable than the private loan Facts about Private Loans  Lender Gifts  and Preferred Lender Lists Private Loans Private student loans now total  17 3 billion  and have grown at an average rate of 27 percent per year since 2001  In 2001 02  private loans accounted for 12 percent of total education borrowing  in 2005 06  they accounted for 20 percent  Unlike loans offered through the federal governments loan programs  private loans frequently carry much higher interest rates  especially for students without credit histories and families without strong credit ratings  Some lenders are increasingly using questionable methods to market private loans to students and their families and court the favor of colleges and universities  For example o The private loan company Loan to Learn invited college officials and their spouses to attend an all expenses paid education conference in the West Indies o The private loan company Student Loan Xpress has offered 100  loan approval at colleges if the college agrees to brand the private loan with the colleges name and emblem  making the loan appear to be offered by the college  not the private lender o Other private loan companies encourage borrowers not to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid  FAFSA     which allows borrowers to obtain loans at lower interest rates  while not prominently disclosing the fact that private loan interest rates are typically much higher Lender Giftso Lenders who participate in the governments Federal Family Education Loan  FFEL  program also engage in questionable tactics  like offering educational conferences at luxury hotels  and offering college officials free entertainment and tickets to sporting events  Many lenders offer their staff to work in financial aid offices during peak loan processing times  print materials for financial aid offices  and even e mail students on behalf of the financial aid office Preferred Lender Lists Most colleges maintain preferred lender lists and encourage students to borrow from the list  While some colleges use a rigorous process to ensure that these preferred lenders offer the best loan terms and conditions to students  others dont  and many preferred lender lists dont clearly state why the lenders has earned preferred status  Some preferred lender lists dont offer a real choice of lenders at all  because all the names on the list are subsidiaries of the same big lender
