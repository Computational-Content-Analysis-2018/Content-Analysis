SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON IMMIGRATION REFORM AT THE METROPOLITIAN AME CHURCH As prepared for delivery I commend the Center for Community Change and the Dreams For America tour for making your voices heard loud and clear  And thank you to the leaders of faith who are here for your dedication  your insight and your ability to motivate your congregations to support this historic effort for human dignity and respect  I very much look forward to our continuing work together  I am proud that families from Massachusetts are here and are part of this important journey   The urgent issue before us is about the future of America  It is about our pride for our immigrant past and in pride for our immigrant future In the New York harbor  the gateway to America  there stands a statue that represents the enduring virtue of what has made this nation great  a beacon on a hill  At her feet  on the pedestal on which she stands are inscribed these words Give me your tired  your poorYour huddled masses yearning to be freeThe wretched refuse of your teeming shores Send these  the homeless  tempest tost to me I lift my lamp beside the golden door  And at the heart of the issue of immigration is hope  Hope for a better life for hard working people and their families  Hope for the children  Most of all this issue is about our children  Thank you for making that clear today and for bringing that important message to the nations leaders It is the children our hearts go out to most when immigration raids tear families apart  One of these raids took place in March in New Bedford  Massachusetts  Hundreds of armed police and immigration officers raided a factory  creating panic among the workers  They handcuffed unarmed men and women who were already suffering gross indignities at the hands of their employer  We saw the appalling photographs of children left bewildered and crying by a government operation reeking of callousness In the hours that followed  children were left without their parents  pregnant women were detained  and family members sought desperately to locate their loved ones Soon after the raid  I visited some of the families whose lives had been turned upside down  We met in a small church basement  and I was deeply moved by the stories I heard  These are individuals who came to this country because they believe in the American Dream for themselves and their children  There are children here who are just beginning to learn their Bible  But because they are with us today  I know they will understand that our shared religion is  in many ways  the story of immigrants When they read about Noah  they will realize that he took a perilous journey from the land of his birth When they read about Moses  they will understand that he led his people to the promised land  even when it meant crossing borders And when they hear the parable of the Good Samaritan  they will recognize that human kindness does not require a green card From that story we learn the great truth that those who travel far from their lands of their birth  even at the risk of scorn and abuse  can become people who are uniquely able to understand and meet the needs of others The great humanity of our brothers and sisters in this struggle has never been more eloquently expressed than in the Prayer of the Farm Workers Struggle written by Cesar Chavez  He prayed  and I hope you will pray with me  Show me the suffering of the most miserable So I will know my people s plight Free me to pray for others For you are present in every person Help me take responsibility for my own life So that I can be free at last Grant me courage to serve others For in service there is true life Give me honesty and patience So that the Spirit will be alive among us Let the Spirit flourish and grow So that we will never tire of the struggle Let us remember those who have died for justice For they have given us life Help us love even those who hate us So we can change the worldAmen      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
