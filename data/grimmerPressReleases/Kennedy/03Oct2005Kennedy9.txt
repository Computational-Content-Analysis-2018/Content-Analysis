         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     President Bush has nominated his long time friend  adviser and current White House counsel Harriet Miers to replace Justice O Connor as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court  We look forward to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings to learn more about Ms  Miers  her qualifications  her ability to be independent from President Bush  and her views on the role of the Court in protecting fundamental rights and liberties     As far as we know at this point  Ms  Miers does not have a public record of writings or speeches that would give the Senators and the American people an insight into the kind of justice she would be  Therefore  we urge President Bush to make available to the Committee documents and information relating to Ms  Miers s service in the White House during both terms of the George W  Bush Presidential Administration and for Mr  Bush during his terms as Governor of the State of Texas  Although the Administration did not provide the Committee with files relating to John Roberts s service as Deputy Solicitor General of the United States  we were able to receive from the Reagan Library extensive memoranda and files relating to John Roberts s White House service in the Reagan Administration  The American people are entitled    at a minimum    to the same kind of memoranda and files relating to Ms  Miers    The record we have so far is simply insufficient to assess the qualifications of this nominee  While her resume lists impressive qualifications as a practicing attorney  it simply does not give the Senate    or the public    sufficient information to determine her qualifications to be a Supreme Court Justice and her commitment to core constitutional values     Under the Constitution  no Supreme Court appointment can be made until and unless the Senate gives its advice and consent and the Senate    and the American people    must have the same amount and quality of information in approving the nomination as the Executive had in making it  I look forward to meeting Ms  Miers and hearing from her at the Senate Judiciary hearings  and receiving the documents necessary for us meet our joint constitutional role with the President in the appointment of Supreme Court Justices   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
