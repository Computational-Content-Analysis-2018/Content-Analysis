         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     At a time when our ideals are under attack by terrorists in other lands  it is more important than ever to demonstrate that we practice what we preach  and that we are doing all we can to root out the bigotry and prejudice in our own country that leads to violence here at home     Crimes motivated by hate because of the victims race  religion  ethnic background  sexual orientation  disability  or gender are not confined to the geographical boundaries of our great nation  The current conflicts in the Middle East and Northern Ireland  the ethnic cleansing campaigns in Bosnia and Rwanda  or the Holocaust itself demonstrate that violence motivated by hate is a world wide danger  and we have a special responsibility to combat it here at home     This amendment will strengthen the Defense Authorization Act by protecting those who volunteer to serve in the military  The vast majority of our soldiers serve with honor and distinction  These men and women put their lives on the line to ensure our freedom and for that  we are truly grateful  Sadly  our military bases are not immune from the violence that comes from hatred      In 1992  Allen Schindler  a sailor in the Navy was viciously murdered by two fellow sailors because of his sexual orientation  Seven years later  PFC Barry Winchell  an infantry soldier in the Army  was brutally slain for being perceived as gay  These incidents prompted the military to implement guidelines to prevent this type of violence  but there is more that we can do  We have to send a message that these crimes wont be tolerated against any member of society      A disturbing trend has also been discovered in the military  Last year  the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that members of hate groups have been entering into the military  As recruiters struggle to fulfill their quotas  they are being forced to accept recruits who may be extremists  putting our soldiers at higher risk of hate motivated violence  This cant be tolerated  We must stem the tied of hatred and bigotry by sending a loud and clear message that hate crimes will be punished to the fullest extent of the law     Since the September 11th attacks  weve seen a shameful increase in the number of hate crimes committed against Muslims  Sikhs  and Americans of Middle Eastern descent  Congress has done much to respond to the vicious attacks of September 11th  We have authorized the use of force against terrorists and those who harbor them in other lands  We have enacted legislation to provide aid to victims and their families  to strengthen airport security  to improve the security of our borders  to strengthen our defenses against bioterrorism  and to give law enforcement and intelligence officials enhanced powers to investigate and prevent terrorism     Protecting the security of our homeland is a high priority  and there is more that we should do to strengthen our defenses against hate that comes from abroad  There is no reason why Congress should not act to strengthen our defenses against hate that occurs here at home     Hate crimes are a form of domestic terrorism  They send the poisonous message that some Americans deserve to be victimized solely because of who they are  Like other acts of terrorism  hate crimes have an impact far greater than the impact on the individual victims  They are crimes against entire communities  against the whole nation  and against the fundamental ideals on which America was founded  They are a violation of all our country stands for     Since the September 11th attacks  the nation has been united in our effort to root out the cells of hatred around the world  We should not turn a blind eye to acts of hatred and terrorism here at home     Attorney General Ashcroft put it well when he said  Just as the United States will pursue  prosecute  and punish terrorists who attack America out of hatred for what we believe  we will pursue  prosecute and punish those who attack law abiding Americans out of hatred for who they are  Hatred is the enemy of justice  regardless of its source     Now more than ever  we need to act against hate crimes and send a strong message here and around the world that we will not tolerate crimes fueled by hate     The Senate should not hesitate in condemning countries that tolerate crimes motivated by the victims race  religion  ethnic background  sexual orientation  disability  or gender  Hate is hate regardless of what nation it originates in  We can send a strong message about the need to eradicate hate crimes throughout the world by passing this hate crimes amendment to the Defense Department Authorization Bill      We should not shrink now from our role as the beacon of liberty to the rest of the world  The national interest in condemning bias motivated violence in the United   States is great  and so is our interest in condemning bias motivated violence occurring world wide      The hate crimes amendment we are offering today condemns the poisonous message that some human beings deserve to be victimized solely because of their race  religion  or sexual orientation and must not be ignored  This action is long overdue  When the Senate approves this amendment  we will send a message about freedom and equality that will resonate around the world          Melissa Wagoner
