         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The late Arthur Helton  perhaps our countrys greatest advocate for the rights of refugees wrote  Refugees matterfor a wide variety of reasonsRefugees are a product of humanitys worst instincts  the willingness of some persons to oppress others  as well as some of its best instincts  the willingness of many to assist and protect the helpless      A year later after he wrote those words  Arthur Helton was killed in Baghdad in 2003 when a bomb destroyed the UN headquarters in Iraq     His words still resonate today  especially when we consider the immense human cost of the war in Iraq  and its tragic effect on the millions of Iraqis  men  women  and children  who have fled their homes and their country to escape the violence of a nation at war with itself      These brave and heroic Iraqis work with the American military  staff our Embassy  and work with American organizations to support our mission in Iraq  They are among the four million Iraqi refugees who have been forced from their homes  They are the people we have an obligation to help      Instead of protection  we have offered them bureaucracy and doublespeak  false words and dubious hopes  Despite the overwhelming need  the U S  has resettled less than 2 000 Iraqis this fiscal year      Last night the Senate acted and stood up to help Iraqi refugees  I want to thank Senators Levin and Senators McCain for adopting my amendment  the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007  cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Senators  Senators Smith  Levin  Hagel  Biden  Brownback  Lieberman  Leahy  Snowe  Durbin  Voinovich  Feinstein  Collins  Obama  Dole  Menendez  Mikulski  and Clinton     The need is especially urgent for those whose work for the United   States has put them in danger  Because they supported us  insurgents have repeatedly threatened to kill them  Many have lost their homes  their property  and their livelihoods  They face ongoing threats every single day  Some have fled the country and are waiting in refugee camps  and others are in hiding  All of them hope that the United States will not forget their sacrifices     Still others have tried to flee  only to be stopped at the border  trapped in a country that cannot protect them  abandoned by a countryour countrythat they believed would set them free  Others continue their work  living in fear of the day that the insurgents punish them for working with Americans     They are women such as Sarah  whose husband worked as an interpreter for the Coalition Forces in a combat hospital  Although he kept his job secret  insurgents discovered his identity  They broke into the family home  kidnapped her and released her only after torturing and raping her  The family fled to a neighboring country where they have waited for almost a year in the hopes of qualifying for refugee status  Sarahs husband has been forced to return to Iraq  Each day that passes without assistance brings the rest of the family closer to an involuntary return to Iraq  She wrote  Dear gentlemen  I put my suffering between your hands as my hope in you is great that you will hear our calling      And they are men such as Sami  who worked for USAID  He received several death threats  one in the form of a blood soaked bullet sealed in an envelope  Sami pressed on  despite the threats  in order to help improve local governments and strengthen civil society  In June 2006  a group of men armed with machine guns  attempted to kidnap his pregnant wife and two year old son outside their home  The attack was thwarted  but his wife nearly miscarried and their son suffered from prolonged shock  Sami and his family fled to Jordan  where they live day to day  waiting for the labyrinthine process to rule on their refugee case     Our government owes these Iraqis an immense debt of gratitude  Many American employees owe their lives to these Iraqis     Despite the clear and present danger many Iraqis face based on their ties to the United States  their religious affiliation  or their work with media  nongovernmental and humanitarian organizations  the vast majority of Iraqi refugees must go through a long and complicated referral process of approximately eight to ten months  in which the United Nations serves as an intermediary  There are no provisions for conducting refugee screenings within Iraq  as there should be      In a recent cable  Ambassador Crocker asked the Administration to reconsider its practices  He estimates that under current practices  it would take more than two years to process the over 10 000 referrals made by the U N  As Ambassador Crocker noted  Clearly  this is too long  Refugees who have fled Iraq continue to be a vulnerable population while living in Jordan and Syria      Ambassador Crocker asked for the authority to process refugees in Iraq  He asked for the authority to provide special immigrant visas for those who have worked in good faith with our government in Iraq  He asked to expedite the processing of refugee claims to save lives  Surely  we can all agree with Ambassador Crocker that delay is unacceptable  We must clearly do better by these Iraqis who have sacrificed so much for the United   States      The amendment approved by the Senate last night will cut through the red tape  It requires the Secretary of State to establish a refugee processing program in Iraq and in countries in the region for Iraqis threatened because of their association with the United States Government  Those Iraqis who worked with our government will be able to apply directly to the United  States in Iraq  rather than going through the United Nations referral system outside Iraq     It authorizes 5 000 special immigrant visas yearly for five years for Iraqis who have worked for the U S  Government in Iraq and are threatened as a result  It also allows Iraqis in the United States who have been denied asylum because conditions in Iraq changed after Saddam Husseins government fell  to have their cases re heard      Surely  we cannot resettle all of Iraqs refugees in the United States  but we need to do our part  America has a special obligation to keep faith with the Iraqis who now have a bulls eye on their back because of their association with our government      Mr  President  I had the honor of meeting Sgt  Joseph Seemiller  a young man who is haunted by the military motto  Leave no man behind  Sgt  Seemiller is dedicated to helping the translator he was forced to leave behind in Iraq  On countless occasions  his translator helped to avoid several American and Iraqi casualties  He braved innumerable death threats and the horrific murder of his brother  finally fleeing to Syria where he has waited for more than two years for a chance to be resettled in the U S      Those words haunt us all  Im delighted that the Senate has taken this important step to honor our commitment to the brave men and women whose lives are at risk
