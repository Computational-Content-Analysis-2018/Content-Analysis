         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  the conference agreement includes a landmark provision which outlines a new way forward in Iraq   Rather than continuing our failed policy  it changes the mission of our troops  requires the President to begin to withdraw them from Iraq in October  and sets a goal of next March for the completion of the withdrawal I congratulate the Democratic leader for his bold and decisive leadership and his determination to bring our troops home from Iraq in an orderly  responsible  and safe way    Those Republicans who are disparaging him are engaged in nothing more than a ploy to change the focus of the debate   Harry Reid is an effective and capable leader    What the American people and our soldiers in Iraq need is new leadership from the White House and a new policy in Iraq that requires the Iraqis to take responsibility and our troops to begin to come home    A timeline for the withdrawal of our combat troops is the only realistic way to encourage the Iraqis to take responsibility for their future   The Bush Administration supported deadlines for three Iraqi elections and for the writing of the constitution as part of its strategy to ensure that the Iraqis would make essential decisions   Yet  the Administration remains emphatically opposed to any timeline for the withdrawal of our military   The Administration should follow the logic of its past actions and embrace  rather than reject  a timeline   And it should stop defying the will of the American people who want us to begin to bring our troops home to the heros welcome theyve earned The President is wrong to threaten to veto this legislation   He was wrong to get us into this war  wrong to conduct it so poorly  wrong to ignore the views of the American people  and wrong to accuse those of us who are working to change course as harming our troops   Now he is wrong to threaten to veto this bill  delaying funds and keeping our troops in a civil war with no end in sight to our commitment   Instead  President Bush should be listening to the American people and working with Congress to bring this tragic war to an end Instead of continuing to defy the will of the American people and Congress by threatening to veto this legislation  he should put the Iraqis on notice   He must make it clear to the Iraqi Government that its time for them to take responsibility for their country  and resolve their political differences   The American military will not police Iraqs civil war indefinitely It is time to end the loss of American lives and begin to bring our soldiers home   For the sake of our troops  we cannot repeat the mistakes of Vietnam and allow this war to drag on long after the American people know it is a mistake The Administration insists that we are making progress in Iraq and that its so called surge must continue In fact  the only thing surging is the violence More than 80 American soldiers were killed in each of the first four months this year  the longest period of such high casualty rates since the war began Sectarian violence in Baghdad continues unabated    despite the Administrations claims to the contrary   According to an April 25 report by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq  civilian casualties of the daily violence between January and March remained high concentrated in and around Baghdad  The violence is so bad that the Iraqi Government has refused to provide mortality figures to the UN It says  by late February  government officials announced that the number of such killings had decreased  which they attributed to the success of the Baghdad Security Plan   Despite this announced decrease  the number of victims was nevertheless high  with up to 25 bodies still being found on some days during this period in Baghdad  March again witnessed a rise in the number of casualties  with reports of large number of bodies found in Baghdad  al Ramadi  al Hilla  Kirkuk  Mosul  Khalis  Tikrit and Himreen  The report also states that  Despite reports from Iraqis in late February that security had somewhat improved  there were a series of indiscriminate attacks targeting civilians  and the rate of kidnappings remained high  According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  more than 200 000 Iraqis have been displaced since last December Attacks within the international zone are increasing    Violence is spreading out of Baghdad and spiking elsewhere in Iraq  such as in Diyala province  where 53 American soldiers have been killed this month          We know that insurgents are using new and deadlier bombs  including chlorine gas bombs We know that General Petraeus has proposed the segregation of Baghdad into gated communities drawn largely on sectarian lines We know that Sadr has withdrawn six members from Prime Minister Malikis cabinet and that the Prime Minister has made no progress on political reconciliation  despite the arrival of tens of thousands of additional American troops which the Administration argued were necessary for him to do so  Mr  President  no one in the Administration can tell the American people in good faith and in good conscience that we are making progress in Iraq    Iraq is sliding deeper into civil war  and our military cannot solve their problems Its time the President listened to the Iraq Study Group  the Congress  and the American people  and worked with us to bring our troops home   MINIMUM WAGEMr  President  I am very pleased that this conference report includes the minimum wage bill   After 10 long years  we will finally be able to send a minimum wage increase to the President   Its long overdue  and its yet another reason why the President should sign this important bill The minimum wage bill passed the House and Senate by overwhelming margins in January and February of this year   Under it  minimum wage workers will get a raise of  2 10 per hour   Those who work full time will earn an additional  4400 a year  Thats enough to pay for utilities that might otherwise be shut off   To put gas in the car so you can get to work   Or to pay for after school care for a son or daughter who might otherwise be left home alone In many ways  including the minimum wage increase in this bill on Iraq couldnt be more appropriate   The minimum wage represents the values our troops are fighting for  basic fairness   Its about what we stand for as a nation   Americans believe that hard work should help you build a better life for your family   They believe that a job should keep you out of poverty  not force you to live in poverty   Our troops are away fighting to provide a better future for the people of Iraq   Wed like to think that our men and women in uniform dont have to worry about the economic security of their families here at home   But many of our fighting forces have husbands or wives back at home who are struggling to make ends meet   10  of military spouses earn between  5 15 and  7 25 per hour  50 000 military families will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to  7 25 per hour   Our troops are overseas putting their lives on the line for their country  and we should provide fair opportunities for their spouses who are working hard here at home I hope we can provide these families  and all other struggling families across the country  with the fair wages they deserve as soon as possible   I hope the President will do the right thing for our troops and for Americas minimum wage workers by signing this important bill        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
