         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to President Bushs threat to veto the State Childrens Health Insurance Program      This is a cruel threat to needy children and I urge the President to reconsider  Its outrageous that there are nearly 9 million uninsured children in America and over 600 000 more since 2005  This Administration has failed on healthcare and our children are paying the price  Congress has been working in a bipartisan way to get a Childrens Health Insurance Program bill that will make quality health care available to children of working families  This bill will allow children to get the quality healthcare they deserve  and should be signed into law before the program expires next week  After watching hundreds of thousands of children lose their health coverage on his watch  it s incomprehensible that President Bush would veto the bill that fixes the problem  This is a cruel threat to needy children and I urge the President to reconsider
