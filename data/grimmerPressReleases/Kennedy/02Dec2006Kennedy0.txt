         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  JOHN F  KENNEDY LIBRARY AND MUSEUM  As Prepared for Delivery  Gerry lived a wonderful life of service and dedication to others  We miss him very much  and well never forget him  His leadership for so many years in Congress proves beyond any doubt that it matters very much whom we  the people  elect to represent us in Washington   Gerry was a Congressman of immense courage  vision  and compassion  and he was guided by the same fundamental principle that shaped the lives of my brothers Jack and Bobby  that each of us can make a difference and all of us should try   As Gerry never hesitated to make clear  Jack was the reason he was drawn into public service  When President Kennedy called on Americans to ask not what their country could do for them  but what they could do for their country  Gerrys life changed forever  Washington became a magnet for a new generation of young  brilliant  and committed Americans determined to help the nation live up to its ideals at home and abroad  It was a time of hope  possibility  and progress  and Gerry was present at the creation   He became a Foreign Service officer in the State Department  helping Sarge Shriver begin the Peace Corps  and then moved to Jacks White House to help plan a domestic Peace Corps as well  Like all of us  he was devastated when Jack left us  and he came to Capitol Hill where I first met him as a legislative aide to Senator Pete Williams of New Jersey   He left soon after that to teach at St  Pauls School in New Hampshire  But when the war in Vietnam began to tear the country apart  Gerry answered the call again  He signed on as State Coordinator for Gene McCarthys Presidential campaign in 1968  and won national renown for masterminding the strategy that led to McCarthys historic success in the New Hampshire Primary  Gerry inspired countless others that year by demonstrating what committed citizens can accomplish when they dedicate their hearts and minds to a great cause   Two years later  in 1970  he stepped up to the plate himself and ran an extraordinary campaign of his own for Congress  He built an unprecedented grassroots team and very nearly defeated the entrenched Republican pro war Congressman from Cape Cod  which hadnt elected a Democrat for half a century   I stood beside him at a major rally in New Bedford that year  when he pledged to the Portuguese fishing community that hed learn to speak their language in the next two years  so he could talk personally to every one of them   Two years later the grassroots army he assembled with MarDee Xifaras became the irresistible force that made the immoveable object move  Hed learned Portuguese  and that was the final straw  The incumbent Congressman decided not to run again  Gerry Studds was on his way to Capitol Hill  and Cape Cod had a brilliant new young Representative in Washington with an immensely appealing vision of a new future for the Cape in all its unique aspects   Gerry was a reformer from the outset  He never forgot that his mission was always to improve the lives of his constituents and the life of the Cape too  He never accepted things as they are  when the opportunity was there for lasting change   He also pushed for major overhauls of the way Congress does its work  I swallowed hard over one of his early proposals  to require term limits for members of the House and Senate   Many years later  a campaign opponent tried to attack him for abandoning his reformers zeal for term limits and succumbing to the old order on the Hill  Gerry responded immediately that his passion for the issue hadnt faded at all  In fact  he said  he intended to stay in Congress just long enough to enact that reform   His love for the Cape was obvious to all of us and constantly inspiring  One of his finest achievements was persuading Congress to start paying close attention to the health of our oceans  No one did more to conserve this magnificent part of Gods creation than Gerry Studds  and with global warming coming at us  we miss him more than ever now   His accomplishments were brilliant  The 200 mile limit to keep at bay the huge foreign trawlers that were destroying our magnificent coastal waters and fisheries  the creation of the Stellwagen National Marine Sanctuary  now named in honor of Gerry  the return of the Atlantic Striped Bass made possible by the Studds Act   He also inspired us all with his commitment to the creation of the Harbor Islands Trust  and his vision of opening up the beauty and magic of the sea to hundreds of thousands of children in the Greater Boston area   Above all  he loved the Cape and its wonders with all his heart and soul  the oceans and the marshes  the islands and the beaches  the fish and all the other water life  the bluebird  as Thoreau wrote  that carries the sky on his back  or as Stewart Udall said so eloquently at the dedication of the National Seashore on the Cape  We yearn for the long waves and beach grass  we see white wings on morning air  and in the afternoon  the shadows cast by the doorways of history   Gerry had no doubt  as a former teacher  that he could impart the same awe he felt about the sea and its treasures to every future generation of youth   He loved the idea that I was his Cape constituent  and we had countless discussions of how to persuade Congress to act  I was grateful for his frequent and thoughtful newsletters  and I cherished the times we spent together   There was no better way of understanding the awesome responsibility we have to protect our natural resources than spending time with Gerry Studds   Well never forget as well that Gerry did all this in a world that was too often hostile to him simply because of who he was  He was a lesson to each of us on how to handle adversity  and to persevere in the face of intense opposition  He knew that to reach our goals in life  we sometimes have to sail against the wind to reach the port of heaven   Inevitably  Gerry became a leader in the battle against AIDS  This year is the 25th Anniversary of the first report on the disease  and it still saddens me to remember the appalling indifference to the suffering of so many and the tragic consequences for tens of millions of families throughout the world   Gerry Studds stood against all that  He fought against the ignorance and indifference and bigotry at great personal cost  so that our country could move beyond that dark period in our recent history  In doing so  he brought hope to millions  and helped save thousands of lives    As the first openly gay member of Congress  he was a trailblazer for gay rights  and I admired him all the more  It was a great joy for all of us that  after so many years of fighting the good fight  our Commonwealth saw the light  and Gerry and Dean were able to affirm their love for each other in the full majesty of the law of our Commonwealth   Ill always miss Gerrys courage and compassion and leadership  Ill never forget our wonderful rallies on Cape Cod on Monday evenings before election day  and the good times we spent together sailing on the Capes waters on my boat Mya and his beloved Bacalhou   All of us who love the Cape owe an enormous debt to the incomparable Gerry Studds  As the poet wrote   I must go down to the seas again  to the  Lonely sea and the sky   And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer  Her by   And the wheels kick and the winds song and  The white sails shaking   And a grey mist on the seas face  and a grey  Dawn breaking   I must go down to the seas again  for the call  Of the running tide  Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be  Denied   And all I ask is a windy day with the white  Clouds flying   And the flung spray and the blown spume  and  The sea gulls crying   I must go down to the seas again  to the  Vagrant gypsy life   To the gulls way and the whales way  where  The winds like a whetted knife   And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing  Fellow rover   And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the  Long tricks over   May God grant you that quiet sleep and sweet dream youve earned so well  Gerry   Your Portuguese was a lot better than mine  Gerry  but Ill say it anyway   Muito Obrigado  thank you very much for everything  my friend  We love you    Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley   617  565 4472
