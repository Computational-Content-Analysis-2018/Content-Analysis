         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  Senators Collins  Dodd  McCain  Biden  Leahy and I are introducing a resolution expressing support for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement as the blueprint for lasting peace in Northern Ireland  All of us are hopeful that a constructive way forward will be found  and way to do so is by continuing to implement the Good Friday Agreement The1998 Agreement was endorsed in a referendum by the overwhelming majority of people in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland  The parties to the Good Friday Agreement made a clear commitment to partnership  equality  and mutual respect as the basis for moving forward to end the long standing conflict and achieve lasting peace for all the people of Northern Ireland  The parties to the Agreement affirmed their total and absolute commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means to achieve the goal of peace  Our resolution reiterates the support for the Agreement as the way forward in Northern Ireland  It rejects the statement of Democratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley  who said in May that the Good Friday Agreement should be given a reasonable burial  Inclusive power sharing based on the defining qualities of the Agreement is essential to the viability and success of the peace process  The resolution calls on the Irish Republican Army to immediately complete the process of decommissioning  cease to exist as a paramilitary organization  and end its involvement in any way in paramilitary and criminal activity  We know that discussion of the issue is underway within the IRA  and we all await a final  positive  and decisive action In addition  the resolution calls on the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland to share power with all the other parties  according to the democratic mandate of the Good Friday Agreement  and commit to work in good faith with all the institutions established under the Agreement  including the Executive and the North South Ministerial Council  to benefit all the people of Northern Ireland It calls on Sinn Fein to work in good faith with the Police Service of Northern Ireland It also calls for justice in the case of Robert McCartney  the Belfast citizen many who was brutally murdered there in January Finally  the resolution calls on the British Government to permanently restore the democratic institutions of Northern Ireland and complete the process of demilitarization in Northern Ireland and advance equality and human rights in Northern Ireland The United States Government continues to strongly support the peace process in Northern Ireland  The Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Ireland continue to strongly support the Good Friday Agreement as the way forward The Good Friday Agreement is the only way forward in Northern Ireland  and it deserves our strong support  I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
