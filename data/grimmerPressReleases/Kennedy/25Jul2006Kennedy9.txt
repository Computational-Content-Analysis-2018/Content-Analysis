         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                  The Senates exercise of its advice and consent power when it considers nominees to the federal bench is one of our most important constitutional responsibilities  We are conferring on men and women the power to interpret and apply our laws for the rest of their lives   It is the last opportunity that any of us have to sit in judgment of them     Our task is not to evaluate a nominee based on politics but rather to consider other important criteria   We start with the essential elements of professional excellence and personal integrity  but we must also evaluate the likelihood that nominees will be fair and open minded judges  who bring compassion and understanding of the history and fundamental values of America to the bench   In considering a nomination to our federal Courts of Appeals  we must exercise special care  The Supreme Court accepts few cases out of the thousands of cases it is asked to hear every year   The federal appellate courts are almost always litigants last hope for justice from our legal system  For those who seek relief from race and sex discrimination at work or school  for criminal defendants who have been wrongly deprived of their liberty or sentenced to death  and for those who seek to protect our libertiesthe Circuit Courts of Appeal are almost always their last hope for justice   The record of Jerome Holmes demonstrates that he is not a nominee we can afford to entrust with the judicial power of the United States   His professional qualifications are not in dispute  but he has taken extreme public stances on issues that regularly come before our courts  These stances suggest that he will not approach these issues with an open mind or fairly apply the law in these areas    Perhaps most troubling are Mr  Holmes strong and repeated statements denouncing affirmative action   Just last week  this body reauthorized the Voting Rights Act  one of Americas greatest achievements in the effort to overcome centuries of racial oppression   During that debate  numerous Senators had occasion to revisit the legacy of racially motivated violence  discrimination and disenfranchisement that oppressed so many in this country   And we had occasion to reflect on the need for strong and complete remedies for those centuries of discrimination that would eliminate it root and branch   Affirmative action is an effective and necessary remedy that must be available if we are to provide opportunity for all  by breaking down persisting barriers and making it possible for all Americans to demonstrate their abilities and fulfill their potential   Yet  Mr  Holmes has repeatedly denounced affirmative action as both immoral and unlawful     Shortly after the Supreme Court struck down the University of Michigans affirmative action program for undergraduates  but upheld the Law Schools program   Mr  Holmes wrote   The court did not go far enough   Affirmative action is still alive   He lamented that the Court missed an opportunity to drive the final nail in the coffin of affirmative action    He called affirmative action a quota system and accused it of perpetuating a society in which race unfortunately still matters   He referred to scholarships for minority students as constitutionally dubious and morally offensive   We know that race does still matter in our society  which is the very reason that lawful affirmative action programs are needed   They guarantee opportunity for minority students  who because of discrimination and its legacy might otherwise never be able to excel   We all hope for the day that individuals will not be denied opportunity because of race  But until we reach that day  affirmative action programs are part of the solution  not the problem    Mr  Holmes extreme statements make it impossible to believe that he will approach affirmative action cases with an open mind   He says he will fairly apply our nations affirmative action laws  which have helpedand continue to helpwomen and racial minorities overcome centuries of discrimination  but his bland assurances are far from sufficient to overcome his record   His views on our criminal justice system are also disturbing  He has put on a set of ideological blinders to ignore the invidious racial discrimination that persists in criminal trials and sentencing  When a defense lawyer in Oklahoma had the courage to suggest that African Americans accused of committing crimes against whites in Oklahoma City could not receive a fair trial  Mr  Holmes delivered a swift rebuke  Not only did he dismiss the effect of racial bias  he also chastised the defense lawyer for even raising the issue  contending that he had undermined the publics confidence in the judicial system   The problem of racial bias in juries is an important issue in the criminal justice system that merits discussion and recognition that we should be seeking effective remedies  not blaming the messenger   By approving this nominee  the Senate would send a message that we dont care about the racial disparities in our criminal justice system  If we confirm an appellate judge who ignores the reality of such disparities  we cant expect the public  especially minorities  to believe that they will get a fair day in court  The fact that Mr  Holmes stated these views while serving as deputy criminal chief of a U S  Attorneys office only reinforces my concern about his ability to separate his extreme personal ideology from his actions as a judge  if we confirm his nomination   Mr  Holmes aggressive support for the death penalty raises special concern  He said that the statement society sends through the death penalty is not materially diminished by the fact thatmistakes are made in imposing the death penalty  Unlike Mr  Holmes  most death penalty supporters appreciate the severity of a death sentence  It is an irreversible punishment  which means that we must do everything in our power to reduce the possibility of mistakes   Many death penalty advocates have supported expanded use of DNA testing and other tools to avoid mistakes in capital cases    Taking an extreme position yet again  Mr  Holmes has no respect for these concerns  He is more interested in the symbolism of the death penalty than the fact that an individual life will end  Because the Supreme Court hears so few death penalty cases  appellate courts often have the final word on the life or death of criminal defendants  We should not support the confirmation of a federal judge who has so little respect for this grave responsibility   The Senate has supported the overwhelming majority of the President Bushs judicial nominees  Ive voted for the confirmation of dozens of judges with whom I have ideological differences  However  the nomination of Jerome Holmes is different  I do not believe that he will serve on the federal bench with a fair and open mind  I therefore cannot support the confirmation of Jerome Holmes to the Tenth Circuit  and I urge the Senate to oppose him         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
