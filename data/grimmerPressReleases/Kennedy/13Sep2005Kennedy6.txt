         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FACT SHEET INCLUDED FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner                  202  224 2633    KENNEDY STATEMENT AT ROBERTS CONFIRMATION HEARING   The stark and tragic images of the human suffering in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina have reminded us    yet again    that civil rights and equal rights are still the great unfinished business of America  The suffering has been disproportionately borne by the weak  the poor  the elderly and the infirm    and largely by African Americans    who were forced by poverty  illness and unequal opportunity to stay behind and bear the brunt of the storm s winds and floods  I believe that kind of disparate impact is morally wrong in this  the richest country in the world     One question we must consider today is how we can take action to unify our nation  heal racial division  end poverty    and give real life meaning to the constitutional mandate that there be equal protection under the law  I believe that the Constitution is not hostile to the idea that national problems can be solved at the national level through the cooperative effort of the three co equal branches of our government    the Congress  the Executive and the Courts  But not every president  not every legislator  and not every judge agrees that the federal government has the power to address and try to remedy the twin national problems of poverty and access to equal opportunity  I am not talking about a hand out  but a hand up  to give all of our citizens a fair shot at the American dream    Judge Roberts  today we want to find out how you view the Constitution and our ability to protect the most vulnerable  Do you believe that Congress has the power to pass laws aimed at eliminating discrimination in our society  Or do you believe that our hands are tied  that the elected representatives of the people of the United States are without the power to pass laws aimed at righting wrongs  ending injustice and eliminating the inequalities that we have just witnessed so dramatically and tragically in New Orleans     The American people want to know where you stand  We want to find out your view of the rule of law and the role of the courts in our system  That is why it is so important    and I hope that we will receive    your frank  candid and complete responses to the questions we ask today    Judge Roberts  to start my inquiry today  I want to discuss with you Brown v  Board of Education  which you have already mentioned this morning  and which I believe is the most important civil rights decision of our lifetime  In Brown  decided in 1954  the year before you were born  the Supreme Court concluded unequivocally that black children have the constitutional right to be educated in the same classrooms as white students  The Court rejected the old doctrine of separate  but equal  finding that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment    In considering the issues raised by Brown  the court took a broad and real life view of the question before it   It asked    Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race  even though the physical facilities and other tangible factors may be equal  deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities     Do you agree with the Court s conclusion that the segregation of children in public schools  solely on the basis of race  was unconstitutional  Do you believe that the Court had the power to address segregation of public schools on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution  Judge Roberts  the Brown Court made some other very important determinations that I d like to get your reaction to  First  in reaching its decision  the Court concluded that it must consider public education in the light of its full development and its present place in American life throughout the Nation  That is  that it must consider the conditions and impact of its decision in the real  present day world  The Court specifically declined to rely on the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment or to consider the conditions that existed when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868  It looked instead to the facts and the situation as they existed in the case    and in the world    at the time of its decision  Judge Roberts  do you agree that the Court was correct in basing its decision on the real world consideration of the role of public education at the time of its decision  rather than on the role of public education in 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted  Judge Roberts  at the time of the passage of the 14th Amendment  many former slaves were illiterate and had no access to classrooms at all  The Brown court found that the movement toward free public schools supported by general taxation had not yet taken hold in the South  So how could the legislative history be relevant to the Brown case  Am I correct in assuming that you do believe that the determination of equality must be considered in light of real world conditions    as they relate to the actual facts and circumstances of the cases you consider    rather than as they relate to a world that may have existed many years ago  The Brown Court also held that it was important to look at the effects of segregation on public education  The Court determined that education was so vital to a child s development and opportunity for advancement in society that  where the state had undertaken to provide public education  it must be available to all on equal terms  Thus  it found that separate education was inherently unequal  And do you agree that it is important to look at the effects of segregation on public education        Senator Edward M  Kennedy Has Been a Longtime Champion of Individual Rights that John Roberts Frequently Opposed   For over four decades Senator Kennedy has been a champion of individual rights and liberties  while John Roberts has repeatedly sought to limit them throughout his career    Since entering the Senate in 1963  Senator Edward M  Kennedy has fought for the protection and enhancement of individual rights and fair treatment for all  His accomplishments have helped to define the American landscape  especially in the area of civil rights  where he has consistently championed the rights of minorities  women and people with disabilities to equal treatment under the law and equal access to the political process  to education  and to employment opportunities     Just as Senator Kennedy has sought to extend individual rights under the law  recently released documents show that John Roberts  as an advisor to two Republican Presidents  and as an advocate before the Courts  has actively worked to promote policies that would undermine long fought for civil rights and has helped formulate a right wing ideology which is grossly insensitive  and at time even hostile  to the rights of those struggling to obtain equal justice under the law     Civil Rights Act of 1964  this landmark Act was the culmination of decades of struggle and a major initiative of President Kennedy  The legislation expanded access to public accommodations  like hotels and restaurants  to African Americans and other minorities and required employers to provide equal opportunities  It broke down racial barriers across the nation and finally ended the bigotry of separate but equal     Where Senator Kennedy Stands    Senator Kennedy was a strong supporter of the 1964 legislation and has been a leading participant in Congressional efforts to expand the protections afforded by our civil rights laws and to make them more effective in overcoming the effects of discrimination throughout his career  He played a central role in enactment of legislation outlawing discrimination in housing  prohibiting gender discrimination  the Age Discrimination Act  and the Americans with Disability Act  He has also authored amendments strengthening enforcement of key provisions of the Civil Rights Act     Where John Roberts Stands    Throughout his years in the Reagan Administration  John Roberts  name appears frequently on documents urging a narrowing of the prevailing interpretation of civil rights laws  The desire to restrict the legal protections afforded by the civil rights laws is evident across the gamut of issues    from voting rights to equal educational opportunity  from employment to fair housing  from discrimination by federally funded institutions to affirmative action  From these documents a consistent pattern emerges  John Roberts opposes action by the federal government    whether legislative or judicial    to overcome discrimination  There is little in his later career to demonstrate that he has abandoned his earlier extreme views  Voting Rights Act of 1965  This landmark Act applied a nationwide prohibition against the denial or abridgment of the right to vote  banned literary tests  led to the end of the use of the poll tax  and targeted areas of the country with especially troubling voting rights records by giving the Attorney General broad discretion  later upheld by the Supreme Court  to monitor and police the laws of these areas     Where Senator Kennedy Stands    Senator Kennedy was a co sponsor of the original legislation and continues to work to strengthen and protect the law  He and Senator Specter will co sponsor the 2005 Reauthorization  He led the fight in 1970  1975 and particularly in1982 and drafted amendments which among other changes  extended the Attorney General s powers in the face of new evidence of systemic discrimination and provided additional protection to language minority voters under Section 2 of the Act  The legislation made clear that election rules which had a discriminatory effect should not be allowed  even if there was not sufficient proof of discriminatory intent  This year  on the Act s 40th anniversary he was a leading voice calling for its quick reauthorization and the extension of the temporary provisions  especially those targeting areas showing evidence of systemic discrimination     Where John Roberts Stands    John Roberts  as an attorney in the Reagan Justice Department  actively worked to undermine the Act  In 1982 he urged the Administration to take an aggressive stance against Section 2 which prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race  color  or membership in one of several listed language minority groups  And during the 1982 reauthorization  Roberts advocated that the law should bar only voting rules that discriminate intentionally  rather than those that have a discriminatory effect    a standard that would have seriously weakened the Act  Senator Kennedy waged a successful battle to strengthen the Act     Fair Housing Act of 1968  extended civil rights and anti discrimination laws to the provision of housing    Where Senator Kennedy Stands    Senator Kennedy was a co sponsor of the Fair Housing Civil Rights Act of 1968 and lead the subsequent efforts to strengthen the fair housing legislation in the 1980 s     Where John Roberts Stands    As Associate Counsel to President Reagan  he urged the Administration to go slow on housing legislation  In his memorandum  he argued against widely supported proposals to strengthen the Fair Housing laws  stating Government intrusion  quite literally  hits much closer to home in this area than in any other civil rights area     Title IX    Anti Gender Discrimination Act of 1972  this landmark Act prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs or activities  It sought to level the playing field for women with respect to admissions  scholarships  access to courses and athletics  It has led to a narrowing of the gender gap in education  employment and other areas     Where Senator Kennedy Stands    Senator Kennedy has been a leading supporter of Title IX  and was the leading author of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988  which overturned the Supreme Court s 1984 decision in Grove City v  Bell and required recipients of federal funds to comply with civil rights laws in all areas  not just in a particular program or activity that receives federal funding  He has continued to defend the law including most recently working with women colleagues in Congress in 2003 to organize support for Title IX in response to a controversial Department of Education decision to revisit the law s applicability to collegiate athletics     Where John Roberts Stands    In 1982  Roberts worked for the reversal of Title IX policy and urged the Attorney General not to back a Department of Education investigation of alleged sex discrimination in athletics at the University of Richmond  Roberts said that under Title IX  federal investigators cannot rummage willy nilly through institutions  but can only go as far as the federal funds go  The Reagan Administration later supported a dramatically scaled back version of the Civil Rights Restoration Act  The Administration supported an approach that only applied to educational institutions and Roberts highlighted in a memo the intuitive appeal of the Court s Grove City decision  As Deputy Solicitor General argued as amicus in a leading Title IX case  Franklin v  Gwinnett County  that Title IX does not permit monetary awards to victims of discrimination    a position rejected by the Court     Affirmative Action   Remedying the Effects of Past Discrimination    Where Senator Kennedy Stands    Senator Kennedy strongly believes that the law must not only prevent future discrimination but it must also remedy the effects of past discrimination  Throughout this career he has worked legislatively to ensure access to educational and employment opportunities necessary to overcome the legacy of past discrimination     Where Roberts Stands    As a Special Assistant to the Attorney General in the 1980 s  he opposed attempts by the Reagan Administration Labor Department to recognize affirmative action as a legitimate tool to overcome past discrimination  He referred to DOL regulations as offensive preferences based on race or sex  He also sharply criticized a report by the US Commission on Civil Rights that recognized that affirmative action programs are often the only effective means of eliminating the persistent effects of racial prejudice  In 1995 and again in 2001  John Roberts appeared before the Supreme Court arguing against affirmative action efforts applied to the construction industry  He referred to the extreme danger to society from the use of racial preferences and argued for an evidentiary threshold so high that it would as a practical matter preclude nearly all remedial efforts    Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  this landmark Act brought people with disabilities into the civil rights era  It expanded access to important public and private community institutions like schools  courthouses and stadiums and extended important employment non discrimination laws to cover disability     Where Senator Kennedy Stands    A leader on disability policy  Senator Kennedy was one of the primary authors of the ADA  working for years to secure protection from discrimination for the disabled  He played a major role in shaping the debate and galvanizing the grass root support for this landmark legislation  He joined with the first President Bush to push for enactment of the law  He has since filed numerous friend of the court briefs arguing for a broad and inclusive definition of disability under the law  in line with congressional intent    Where Roberts Stands    Roberts represented a major corporation in a Supreme Court case  Toyota Manufacturing v  Williams  2002   seeking to seriously limit the scope of the ADA  He urged the Court to take an extremely restrictive view of the ADA s requirement that an impairment must substantially limit a major life activity  The Court held that to qualify for ADA protection  plaintiffs must show significant impairment in activities of central importance to most people s daily lives  The result was a win win for employers like Toyota who assign work that causes severe pain and injury and then avoid the ADA requirement to provide accommodations by claiming that the employee is not disabled and therefore not covered by the ADA    Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975  the Act expanded the right to a quality education  the same as their non disabled peers  to all children with disabilities  Today it provides over 6 5 million children with disabilities the tools they need to succeed in school and in life  including medical care  technology  and good teachers    Where Senator Kennedy Stands    Senator Kennedy was a leading supporter of the Act and has led several reauthorizations of the Act and worked to expand funding for IDEA  Most recently  Senator Kennedy led the reauthorization of the Act in 2004 focusing on improving enforcement of the law and improving the integration of students with disabilities into the school environment     Where Roberts Stands    As a Reagan Administration lawyer  Roberts took a narrow view of a disabled student s right to a free and appropriate education    the bedrock of the IDEA  In a memo written during his tenure as special assistant to A G  W F  Smith in 1981 82 Roberts described as judicial activism a lower court s ruling that required a school board to provide a hearing impaired student with a sign language interpreter    Equal Rights for Women     Where Senator Kennedy Stands    Throughout his Senate career  Senator Kennedy has been a leader in the fight for equal rights for women  He co sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment  ERA  to the Constitution when it was proposed in the 1970 s  and continues to support it  re introducing the ERA in March of 2005  He has been a strong advocate of the principle of equal pay for equal work and worked legislatively to enact the Equal Pay Act  He was also a principle sponsor of the Family and Medical Leave Act which allows employees to balance work and family obligations    Where Roberts Stands    As an advisor in the Reagan Justice Department  Roberts actively urged defeat of the ERA  He also urged the Administration to not to intervene in a Kentucky case despite strong evidence that the state was discriminating against female prison inmates  denying them vocational training and work opportunities comparable to male inmates  He spoke disparagingly of the purported gender gap despite clear evidence that women at the time were earning only 60 to 65  as much as men  He wrote that it was difficult to exaggerate the perniciousness of a legal theory aimed at providing equity in wages between comparable jobs  His writings show a consistent insensitivity to the treatment of women in the workplace    Reproductive Rights Legislation    Where Senator Kennedy Stands    Senator Kennedy has been a long time supporter of a woman s right to choose  In 1992  he was a lead supporter of the Freedom of Choice Act which would put into law the tenets of the Supreme Court Roe v  Wade decision  The Act  which had 48 sponsors in the Senate  was developed on the eve of a pending Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v  Casey which threatened to overturn a woman s constitutionally protected right to choice  Senator Kennedy continues to fight for a woman s right to choose  most recently speaking out in opposition to Republican legislation to outlaw late term abortions which contained no exception for the health and safety of pregnant women  The law has since been found unconstitutional by numerous lower courts    Where Roberts Stands    In a December 11  1981 memo to the then Attorney General he dismissively wrote about the so called  right to privacy  and said that such an amorphous right is not to be found in the Constitution  And as Deputy Solicitor General in 1990  Roberts co authored a brief which said that Roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled and that the Court s conclusion that there is a fundamental right to an abortion  find s  no support in the text  structure  or history of the Constitution     Access to Women s Health Clinics    Where Senator Kennedy Stands    He was a lead sponsors of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances  FACE  Act  which was designed to ensure women access to family planning health clinics in response to escalating violence  including murder against abortion providers  The law seeks to prevent the harassment and obstruction of patients and health care workers by aggressive and sometimes violent anti abortion protestors  The law passed the Congress and has been instrumental in reducing violence at clinics    Where Roberts Stands    As Deputy Solicitor General  he signed an amicus brief siding with the militant anti abortion group Operation Rescue  and Roberts argued before the Court that abortion protestors who blocked access women s access to clinics did not violate civil rights laws     Violence Against Women Act  the Act established a series of grants and other programs to protect women against violence  especially domestic violence  and rewrote areas of federal criminal law  including by creating penalties for interstate stalking or domestic abuse     Where Senator Kennedy Stands    Senator Kennedy was a co author of the original Act and has continued to work to improve the law  including working on the 2000 reauthorization which increased funding levels and set up new programs with respect to sexual assault on college campuses  transitional housing and in other areas  In 2000  Senator Kennedy spoke against a May 15  2000 Supreme Court decision which struck down as unconstitutional provisions allowing for private damage suits in federal court by victims of gender motivated violence  Most recently in 2005 he has cosponsored a reauthorization of the Act and called for its swift passage     Where Roberts Stands    During a 1999 National Public Radio interview  he spoke disparagingly about the Violence Against Women Act  He apparently cited it as an example of a law he did not believe Congress should have passed saying we ve gotten to the point these days where we think the only way we can show we re serious about a problem is if we pass a federal law  whether it s the Violence Against Women Act or anything else   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
