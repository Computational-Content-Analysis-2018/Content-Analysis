         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Last night  Senator Edward M  Kennedy continued his fight on the war on poverty by offering an amendment H R  3058  the Transportation  Treasury  Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill  Today  to ensure bipartisan support  he changed the amount of the increase to match the amount of the Republican plan  but without their poison pills  Kennedy reached across the aisle to ensure that a minimum wage increase has the best chance of success given dire and urgent circumstances facing the 37 million Americans living in poverty  Kennedy s new proposal    which he considers just a down payment    would raise the minimum wage to  6 25  currently the minimum wage is  5 15  In March  50 Senators supported Kennedy s initial plan to raise the minimum wage to  7 25 while an additional 35 supported the Republican plan to raise it to  6 25    so clearly there should be broad bipartisan support for raising it  1 10     The minimum wage hasn t been increased since 1997  yet during that time Americans increasingly feel the squeeze of the Bush economy  Americans are spending 74 percent more on gas than they did at the beginning of 2001  Heating oil prices are expected to rise by 56 percent this winter  Such rapid price increases will force consumers  especially the poor  to cut spending on clothing  health care and food just so they can get to work and keep warm this winter  Hurricane Katrina demonstrated in stark terms that so many Americans live every day on the brink of economic disaster and for them any setback becomes a major obstacle to survival     The images of Katrina were a shocking reminder that the American dream remains our of reach for millions of working Americans  It s little wonder that so many in the Gulf Region were living in poverty when Katrina hit  These Americans work as hard as anyone else    often harder  But the minimum wage that many receive cannot cover their bills or support their families  Senator Kennedy said  These Americans can t afford the rising cost of higher education  so they don t send their children to college  They can t afford the rising cost of prescription drugs  so they don t take the medicine they need  and often they don t go to the doctor either  We know that America can do better and it is up to us to act now  Let me assure you  this increase of  1 10 is just a down payment and I will continue to fight for further increases    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
