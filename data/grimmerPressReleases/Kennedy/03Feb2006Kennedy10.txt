         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C   Senator Kennedy issued the following statement in anticipation of the President s Budget  expected on Monday    Americans want to raise healthy families in safe neighborhoods  and give their children full lives  But today  they re facing a perfect storm of soaring costs for health care  for home heating oil  for gasoline prices  and for college tuition  a prescription drug fiasco for their parents  generation  and the shadow of globalization hanging over the workplace    What they see in Washington is a spreading culture of corruption that puts special interests first and people s interests last  They see pharmaceutical companies  and insurance companies  dictation health policy  and 4 000 more Americans becoming uninsured every day  They see Big Oil dictating energy policy  and global warming relegated to the back burner  They endured a botched response to Hurricane Katrina when families in the Gulf Coast needed help the most  They see an endless war in Iraq that America never should have fought  We heard a lot of nice rhetoric on Tuesday  but the real test of the President s commitment to progress is the budget he ll release Monday  The gap between the President s words and deeds has grown by leaps and bounds each year as he fails to live up to his promises  instead leaving ordinary Americans behind  America s failure to guarantee the basic right to health care for all our citizens has been one of the great public policy failures in our history  and we must not allow that failure to continue in this new century  Our goal should be an America where no citizen of any age fears the cost of health care  and no employer stops creating jobs because of the high cost of providing health insurance  Sadly  it appears that the President s budget will offer gimmicks  rather than solutions on this issue  To make this country more competitive  I agree with the President that we must increase our focus on math and science education  and I welcome his interest  But it takes more than State of the Union rhetoric to meet this challenge  and that s where he falls short time and again  In his past two budgets  he called for absurd reductions in funding for math and science programs at the National Science Foundation  Last year he eliminated funding to support technology in the classroom  Unfortunately  his Administration continues to be the Administration of broken promises and nowhere is that truer than in education  where his No Child Left Behind Act has been starved for funds since he signed it into law in 2002  I hope the budget on Monday takes a different tact  but this seems unlikely    We must also ensure that globalization does not mean a race to the bottom for American workers  Since President Bush has been in office  his shortsighted economic policies and bad budgeting decisions have accelerated a race to the bottom  protecting profits  while ignoring the plight of working families  Below are fact sheets on Global Competition  Jobs  and Healthcare        THE BUSH BUDGET SHOULD RECOGNIZE EDUCATION  AS A KEY TO MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF GLOBAL COMPETITION Senator Edward Kennedy   Our ability to compete in the global economy hinges on providing a strong education from birth through adulthood  We must provide a top notch teacher in every elementary and secondary school classroom  We must provide incentives to bring high quality math and science teachers into high poverty schools  and make significant investments in state of the art technology for the classroom  To ensure our workforce is prepared to compete in the global economy  we must ensure our high school graduates are academically prepared and have the financial support they need to enter college or workforce training programs  Anything less than this will shortchange our competitiveness  shortchange our opportunity  and shortchange our future    If President Bush is truly committed to ensuring that America continues to lead the world in human talent and creativity  as he promised in the State of the Union  the budget he releases on Monday must     Fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act at the level he promised when the law passed so that  o 3 2 million more children can get the Title I services they need to succeed  o 1 6 million more children can enroll in high quality after school programs  o States can provide high quality training for math and science teachers  o Children have access to state of the art technology in the classroom  o Schools can stay safe and drug free  and o English language learners have the support they need to succeed     Provide  1 3 billion for key NSF programs to improve K 12 and postsecondary math and science education  including  400 million for the Math and Science Partnership program that trains teachers in cutting edge instruction      Raise the maximum Pell grant to  5 100 as he promised in his 2000 election  and increase funding for vocational education and programs that improve college access and retention     The President s Track Record on Education is One Broken Promise after the Next     In 2001  President Bush said he would leave no child behind  But since the No Child Left Behind Act passed  the President and the Republican Congress have shortchanged funding for the law to the tune of  40 billion  The Republican budget bill passed in December cuts funding to  1 billion below last year s level  Last year  President Bush called to end federal funding for key programs that support family literacy  classroom technology  dropout prevention  and smaller learning communities     Since FY 2004  President Bush s budgets have cut funding for NSF s math and science education programs by 22   his FY 2005 budget called to end funding for a program that trains math and science teachers in cutting edge practices     Today  the maximum Pell grant remains at  4 050    a thousand dollars lower than the President promised in 2000    and it s been frozen there for four years  Last year  the President called to end federal funding for vocational education and programs that support college access and retention     In December the Senate passed a bill that would have leveled the playing field for needy college students  by adding an additional  6 billion to help all Pell grant recipients  But the program was rejected in the final Republican budget    THE BUSH BUDGET SHOULD PRIORITIZE WORKING FAMILIES Senator Edward Kennedy   Working families are increasingly anxious about their future in the global economy  Americans once believed that if they worked hard and played by the rules they could live the American dream  They could earn more each year  provide safety and security for their families  and save for retirement  But today Americans are losing faith in that dream  Globalization is creating a race to the bottom where good jobs are being shipped overseas  and the wages and working conditions of hardworking Americans are suffering  Despite working harder and longer than ever before  working families just can t make ends meet  Since President Bush took office  his shortsighted economic policies and bad budgeting decisions have accelerated the race to the bottom  protecting profits while ignoring the plight of working families     This year  the President must do more than pay lip service to the serious challenges our economy is facing    he must prioritize the issues that matter to working families in preparing the federal budget  A responsible budget would     Increase funds for job training to improve existing job training programs   Expand Trade Adjustment Assistance to cover all countries and workers in all sectors of the economy  including service sector workers that are increasingly the victims of outsourcing   Modernize our Unemployment Insurance System by expanding its coverage to part time and low wage workers and extending benefits for the long term unemployed   Significantly increase funds to OSHA and MSHA  above and beyond the amount needed to keep up with inflation  This money should go to setting safety standards  increasing enforcement personnel  and requiring new safety technology   Target funds to address the immediate crisis in mine safety  by requiring mines to have up to date communications  rescue  and safety equipment  similar to that required in other developed countries   Help low and middle income workers to save by expanding the Savers  Credit and encouraging the growth of employer based retirement plans     The President s track record ignores the needs of American workers    Job training  Our workforce needs greater skills and better education to be competitive in the global economy  This starts with the workers that are losing their jobs today  But last year  the President s budget     Slashed federal funding of the Workforce Investment Programs   the single largest federal source for job training funds    by over  30 million   Cut funds for adult education by more 66    Eliminated the  1 3 billion Vocational Education Program   Cut funding for the Trade Adjustment Assistance program that provides training and income support to workers who lose their jobs because of trade  Unemployment Insurance  Workers that have lost their jobs are finding it harder than ever to find new employment  One in every six unemployed workers    1 2 million Americans    has been jobless for more than half a year  Yet our under funded unemployment offices don t have the resources they need to help these workers find new jobs  Last year  the President s budget     Cut funding for Unemployment Insurance offices by  141 million   Cut State Employment Service grants    used for programs that help workers find jobs    by more than  110 million  Worker Safety and Health  The safety of American workers cannot be sacrificed in our quest to remain competitive  Recent tragedies have shown us all too clearly the dangers of racing to the bottom by sacrificing safety  Yet  the President s last budget     Cut  6 7 million from OSHA   4 9 million from MSHA  and  5 1 from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  adjusting for inflation   Totally eliminated all grant funds for worker safety and health training  Retirement Security  The Bush Budget has repeatedly proposed the creation of Lifetime Savings Accounts and Retirement Savings Accounts to allow more tax free savings for the wealthy  This approach to retirement security does nothing to ease the retirement crisis for most middle income families  who would not be able to benefit from such a plan     REAL REFORM  NOT GIMMICKS ARE NEEDED IN THE BUSH BUDGET TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THE CENTURY OF THE LIFE SCIENCES Senator Edward Kennedy   We are in the century of the life sciences    a time of extraordinary promise for new medical miracles  But for too many Americans  quality affordable health care is a distant dream  46 million Americans have no health insurance  Since 2000  nearly six million more Americans have become uninsured    that s an increase of 4 000 people every day  The large and growing number of the uninsured is only part of the health care crisis  Costs are rising out of control  making health care coverage less affordable  and undercutting American industry in the global marketplace  This Administration s proposals on health care have been driven by ideology and pandering to special interests    not by common sense  The Medicare drug plan was turned over to the insurance industry  denying seniors the choice of remaining with the Medicare program they know and trust  Medicare was even blocked from negotiating discounts on drugs  The result has been a disaster as patients across the country have been denied the medicines they need or forced to pay exorbitant fees     Medicare for All   The real solution to the health care crisis is to make Medicare available to every American who wants to enroll in it  Administrative costs are low  patient satisfaction is high  and patients have the right to choose any doctor and hospital they think is best  Senator Kennedy has introduced legislation  S  2229  the Medicare for All Act  to extend Medicare to all Americans  Those who prefer private insurance can choose any plan offered to members of Congress and the President  To ease the transition  Medicare for All will be phased in by age group  starting with those 55 65 years old and children up to age 20     The President s Budget   The President has said that he wants to achieve bipartisan progress in health care  The budget is the true test of whether that desire is real  or simply election year rhetoric  Here are the questions to ask to see if the budget that the President will propose has adopted the path of cooperation or confrontation     Medicare  The path of cooperation would be to bring Democrats and Republicans together to fix the disastrous Medicare drug benefit  The path of cooperation would be to reduce Medicare spending only by cutting overpayments to HMOs and drug companies  The path of confrontation would be to propose Medicare cuts that worsen health care for seniors     Health care coverage  costs  A bipartisan approach would improve health care coverage through measures with broad support  such as expanding the Children s Health Insurance Program or restoring the cuts in Medicaid  and would address the soaring cost of drugs by allowing importation of safe medicines from Canada and other industrialized nations  A partisan budget would propose only gimmicks  like HSAs  that worsen the crisis     Public Health Priorities  A bipartisan budget will respect the nation s commitment to medical research by providing a meaningful increase in the NIH budget and restoring funds to essential health programs  like training of medical professionals  slashed in prior years  A partisan budget will continue to erode the nation s commitment to improving the public s health by decimating funding for critical health programs      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
