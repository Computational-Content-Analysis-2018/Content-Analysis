         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and his colleagues Senator Diane Feinstein of California  Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island  Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine have introduced an amendment to the Energy bill to address the siting of Liquefied Natural Gas facilities  Kennedy spoke on the Senate floor about the proposed site in Fall River  Massachusetts  Weaver s Cove at the mouth of the Taunton River  is nearing final approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a facility Kennedy  on the Senate floor  said  We should hold FERC accountable for the safety of people in the Commonwealth and elsewhere when choosing where to approve new facilities  The LNG facility in Fall River clearly fails the safety test  We can t allow FERC to rely on probability when making life and death decisions like that  We can t allow big energy companies like Exxon and British Petroleum to force the agency s hand In a series of meetings on this topic over the past months  Kennedy has expressed his concern that the siting of this proposed LNG terminal in densely populated Fall River is could be dangerous in the event of a terrorist attack  According to a Sandia Lab Report  released in December  an LNG tanker or facility could be a serious target for terrorist attacks and that were it to catch fire  the lives of residents within a mile radius could be endangered Kennedy and his colleagues have asked FERC to hold another hearing to allow residents of Fall River to voice their growing concern over the siting of the terminal in such a densely populated area  FERC has not responded to the lawmakers request  Secretary of Homeland Security  Michael Chertoff  has also been asked to see for himself the potential for terrorist attack    Statement on Amendment to the Senate Energy Legislation to Provide for Greater Local Input in the Siting of Highly Explosive Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities prepared for delivery Mr  President  this energy bill moves us forward on many issues  from new incentives for energy conservation to expanding our portfolio of renewable electricity  But it has no clear plan for energy independence  and it fails to provide needed relief from the high gas prices that are slowing our economy Millions of American households face a genuine energy crisis because gas prices are at their highest levels in years  The national average is now  2 13 a gallon  and in Massachusetts  the price of regular gasoline is 24  higher than in 2001  We should explore all options for lowering gas prices immediately  including a more rigorous investigation of price gouging at the pump Our dependence on foreign oil is an albatross around our neck  The technology is there to rapidly reduce imports of foreign oil  by making greater investments in solar  hydroelectric  and other renewable energy sources  Success is within our reach if we set a clear target  Senator Cantwell offered an amendment to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by 40 percent in 20 years  I m disappointed it did not receive the full support of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  Reducing our dependence on foreign oil is an important part of a comprehensive national security strategy Another important component of our energy security and national security is making sure that Liquefied Natural Gas facilities are protected from the threat of terrorism LNG production is sky rocketing  Gas in its liquid form takes up 1 600th of the space that conventional gas does  greatly reducing transportation and storage costs  Expanding our investment in LNG is the right thing to do  It saves important resources and we are moving forward with the idea  But safety has to come first  And LNG production  like nuclear power production  raises serious safety concerns which are not being adequately addressed LNG is a highly hazardous and explosive material  as its track record clearly shows  Of the 40 LNG facilities in the world  serious accidents have occurred at 13 of them since 1944  In 1944  an accident at an LNG facility in the United States killed 128 people  An accident at an Algerian LNG facility just last year killed or injured over 100 workers  A Sandia Lab Report  released last December  confirms our worst fears    if an LNG tanker or facility catches fire  the lives of residents within a mile radius would be endangered by the resulting explosion The Coast Guard has taken numerous steps since 9 11 to make the transportation and storage of LNG safer  I m grateful for the many actions they have taken to protect shipments to the Everett LNG facility in the Boston area  But unfortunately  security concerns are being neglected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  which has primary responsibility for deciding the location of new LNG facilities The U S  has not built an LNG facility in an urban area in more than 30 years  But there are now 32 such proposals under consideration    one of which is for a facility at Weaver s Cove  at the mouth of the Taunton River in Fall River in Massachusetts    a city of 100 000 people  And your city could be next In this era of terrorism  our domestic energy infrastructure is a prime target  The 9 11 Commission recognized that fact in calling for improved energy facility security  The Department of Homeland Security recognized it when they included LNG facilities in a 2003 terror alert  Former Counter Terrorism Czar to President Bush  Richard Clarke  recognized it when he testified that LNG facilities are an invitation to terrorism  In fact  he shut down LNG shipments to Everett in the days after September 11th These concerns are based on credible evidence from the FBI  which shows that Al Qaeda has attempted to put Algerian and Tunisian terrorists on LNG tankers that currently service Boston Harbor  In fact  the major exporters of LNG to the United States are breeding grounds for Al Qaeda  including Malaysia  Algeria  the United Arab Emirates  and Indonesia  Osama bin Laden himself has said Attack the American infrastructure  Attack oil and natural gas facilities But FERC is not evaluating the homeland security aspects of new LNG facilities adequately  Chairman Pat Wood recently said that an attack on an LNG tanker in an urban area had a low probability  FERC recently announced it will not unduly delay the approval of new LNG sites We can t allow FERC to rely on probability when making life and death decisions like that  We can t allow big energy companies like Exxon and British Petroleum to force the agency s hand  We should hold FERC accountable for the safety of people in the Commonwealth and elsewhere when choosing where to approve new facilities  The LNG facility in Fall River clearly fails the safety test An explosion at an LNG facility can trigger a firestorm    killing or injuring every person within a mile of the site  And the facility at Weaver s Cove in Fall River is a stone s throw from several thousand homes  as well as businesses  parks  hospitals and schools  Over 9 000 people live in within a mile Over 1 000 students attend Somerset High School  which is less than a mile away from the proposed site So is William J  Wiley School  which 165 students attend So is Saint Michael s School  Another 165 students attend Saint Michaels Transporting LNG to Weaver s Cove raises serious safety issues as well  A 33 million gallon tanker has to travel up 31 miles of coastline  through narrow waterways along some of our most pristine areas  including Narragansett Bay  one of our most populous estuaries in the United States and one of our premier recreational waterways  To reach the facility  the explosive liquefied gas will have to travel under five bridges    which are also likely targets for a terrorist attack Based on these facts there is overwhelming opposition to the new facility in Fall River The Mayor of Fall River opposes it  The City Council opposes it  The people of Fall River oppose it Despite their pleas  FERC is moving forward with approval of the site  It recently approved an environmental impact statement that seriously downplayed the risk of terrorism  It ignored repeated requests from the Mayor  from Senator Kerry and me to discuss the issue  We ve just appealed to Secretary Chertoff of the Homeland Security Department to visit the site  and we hope he will Massachusetts and other states deserve a voice in siting whenever a project will put residents at great risk The amendment I am offering with Senator Feinstein is a compromise that improves on the current bill    which gives blanket authority for siting to FERC  It makes clear the status quo is unacceptable It gives the Governor of a state where a site is proposed a voice in the process    allowing them to stop the approval of a site that clearly threatens the health and safety of people in their state and giving them an opportunity to recommend a new site It is based on a simple premise    when the safety of local residents is at state  local decision makers should be at the table It creates a true federal state partnership  That s how we regulate the siting of other hazardous facilities  That s how we should decide the placement of LNG facilities This new approach to siting will have the added benefit of expediting the approval process  by involving local communities before they resort to costly and time consuming litigation We need a responsible approach that makes sense in this new era where security must be our highest priority  and I hope this amendment will be accepted Fact Sheet on Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities  Kennedy Feinstein Snowe Reed Amendment to Senate Energy Legislation  and the Proposed Facility at Fall RiverBackground Currently the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  has lead authority for approving the siting of a Liquefied Natural Gas  LNG  facility  During the approval process proposed sites undergo evaluation including an environmental impact study  but local decision makers do not have a format input role to play in the process  The result has been inappropriate placing of LNG facilities at sites that generate intense local opposition  such as the proposed facility at Weaver s Cover in Fall River which is in a densely populated urban area Most alarming  since 9 11  the threat of terrorism against an LNG facility has been downplayed in the siting process  The Chairman of FERC  Pat Wood  said that an attack on an LNG tanker is a low probability  And FERC recently announced they will not unduly delay approval of sites  But the threat of terrorism is real  Terrorism expert Richard Clarke recently testified that LNG facilities are an invitation to terrorism and in fact  shut down shipments to the LNG facility at Everett in Boston Harbor in the weeks after 9 11 With demand for LNG on the rise  32 applications are now pending before FERC  the Kennedy Feinstein Snowe Reed amendment provides for local input into an emerging health and safety issue affecting communities across the country Feinstein Kennedy  Snowe Reed Kerry Amendment to Senate Energy Legislation The current energy bill being considered on the Senate floor gives exclusive authority for siting LNG facilities to FERC The bi partisan Feinstein Kennedy Snowe Reed amendment would 1  Give the Governor of a state where an LNG site is proposed the authority to determine whether the project is consistent with state laws with respect to environmental protection  land and water use  public health and safety  and coastal zone management  2  If a Governor finds the site to be inconsistent with such protections  they could block approval of the site or make recommendations to FERC that if complied with could allow for approval The Kennedy Feinstein Snowe Reed Kerry amendment includes both proposed and pending applications such as the facility proposed for Fall River Background on Proposed Fall River Site An LNG facility proposed at Weaver s Cover in Fall River by Amerada Hess is nearing approval  An environmental impact statement has been approved and final approval of the application is expected by the end of the month  However  the site clearly fails the safety test According to a 2004 Sandia Lab report  an explosion at an LNG facility can trigger a firestorm    killing or injuring every person within a mile of the site  The facility at Weaver s Cove in Fall River is less than a mile away from several thousand homes  as well as businesses  parks  hospitals and schools  Over 9 000 people live within a mile Over 1 000 students attend Somerset High School  which is less than a mile away from the proposed site  165 students attend William J  Wiley School  Another 165 students attend Saint Michael s School Transporting LNG to Weaver s Cove raises serious safety issues as well  A 33 million gallon tanker has to travel up 31 miles of coastline  through narrow waterways along some of our most pristine areas  including Narragansett Bay  To reach the facility  the explosive liquefied gas will have to travel under five bridges    which are also likely targets for a terrorist attack There is overwhelming opposition to the new facility in Fall River from Mayor Edward Lambert  the City Council  and the people of Fall River   Melissa Wagoner 202 224 2633
