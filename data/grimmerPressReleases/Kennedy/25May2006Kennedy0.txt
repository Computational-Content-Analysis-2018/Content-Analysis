         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  When Oscar Handlin  the Harvard historian  won the Pulitzer Prize in 1952 for his history of immigration The Uprooted  he said he had set out to write a history of immigrants in America  but discovered that the immigrants were America   With passage of this legislation  we reclaim that America  We lift once again the lamp beside the golden door   This is the most far reaching immigration reform in our history  It is a comprehensive and realistic attempt to solve the real world problems that have festered for too long in our broken immigration system   It strengthens our security and reflects our humanity  It is intended to keep out those who would harm us and welcome those who contribute to our country  It has the potential to build a stronger  better  fairer America for the 21st century   It protects our security through stricter enforcement  tamper proof immigration cards  and high tech border controls   It protects American jobs and wages by bringing immigrants out of the shadows and requiring employers to pay fair American wages   And it enables decent men and women who work hard and play by the rules to earn the privilege of American citizenship   That has been America s story  And it s a story we must live anew with each new generation if we hope to continue as a vibrant land of liberty  progress and opportunity    a land of people who want to do better  who love their families  embrace our nation  and are proud to be American citizens   Wisdom in immigration policy doesn t just happen  It is a choice between a future of progress as a nation of immigrants or a future defined by high walls and long fences   Clearly  we still have much to do before this legislation becomes the new law of the land  Some believe that enforcement is the only path to take   I would urge them to remember that from the beginning to the present day  immigrants helped build our country  and made us strong   They worked in our factories and toiled in our fields  and we are stronger for it   They built the railroads that took America to the West  Even today  it is said that under every railroad tie  an Irishman is buried   Immigrants have loved America and fought under our flag  and we are stronger for it   And if we enact this bipartisan comprehensive reform  we will be stronger for it too   As we close this debate  I commend our two leaders  Senator Frist and Senator Reid  for their skill in enabling this debate to take place  At a time of heated political division in Congress  the debate we have seen these past two weeks is unique in recent times  Senators of both parties have come together for the common good  This opportunity would not have been possible without our leaders  and I hope it is a precedent for other major issues in the weeks ahead   I commend President Bush for putting this issue before the country and for helping Americans understand the need for comprehensive reform   I commend the chairman and ranking member of our Judiciary Committee  Senator Specter and Senator Leahy  for their strong support throughout this process   I thank those of our bipartisan group who stood together to make this legislation possible    Senator Graham  Senator Salazar  Senator Martinez  Senator Hagel  Senator Durbin  Senator Lieberman  Senator Brownback  Senator Obama  and Senator DeWine   And most of all  I express my appreciation to my colleague  Senator McCain  who made all this possible from the start  He d probably prefer I didn t say this  but he s been a profile in courage once again  and I commend him for his leadership   Some say the easy part of this debate is over  and now we face the hard part    reconciling the Senate bill with the House bill  We ll do our best  and I m optimistic we can resolve our differences again   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
