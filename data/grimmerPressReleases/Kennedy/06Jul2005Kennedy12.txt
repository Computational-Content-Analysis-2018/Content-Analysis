         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       Remarks  Fact sheet included   SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY TESTIFIES ON BEHALF OF OTIS AIR NATIONAL GUARD BASE AT NEW ENGLAND BRAC COMMISSION HEARING   BOSTON  MASSACHUSETTS  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy led the Massachusetts delegation in testifying before the New England region s Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission Hearing on the importance of Otis Air National Guard Base to our national security    Kennedy said  On September 11th  fighters from Otis were the first to respond to attacks on the twin towers  Three months later  F 15s from Otis intercepted the plane with the shoe bomber and escorted it safely to Logan Airport  protecting us from that terrorist attack  Otis is the only base in the region on alert twenty four hours a day  seven days a week  Knowing all this  when the list came out  we thought the decision to close Otis must be a mistake    As a member of the Armed Services Committee for almost twenty years  Senator Kennedy has seen the BRAC process work  With regard to Otis  however  the Pentagon s criteria does not support its recommendation for closure  Highlighting the three key areas that the Pentagon inaccurately evaluated on Otis  Kennedy opened the hearing for the Massachusetts delegation that included testimony from Governor Romney  Congressman Delahunt  Senator Kerry  Congressman Lynch and a presentation by Colonel Paul Worcester  Commander the 102nd Fighter Wing    Senator Kennedy believes that the closure of Otis would undermine the entire Coast Guard Air Station on Cape Cod  which has flown over 900 search and rescue operations in the last three years alone     Testimony of Senator Edward M  Kennedy New England Regional BRAC Commission Hearing Boston Convention and Exposition Center     As prepared for delivery    Chairman Newton  Chairman Principi  Secretary Skinner  and General Turner  on behalf of Governor Romney and the Congressional delegation  welcome to Massachusetts  and thank you for being here today to discuss the BRAC proposals    I have served on the Armed Services Committee for nearly 20 years  and have been through the BRAC process four times before  The BRAC process is carefully designed to decide whether certain bases can be closed to increase efficiencies for the Department of Defense  while preserving the essential military value  Congress designed the process to be accurate  open  and free from political influence  In this BRAC  military value is especially important in light of our current national security needs  I have served as the Chairman of the Seapower subcommittee and our deliberations are guided by military value  We re proud of the role of our bases here in Massachusetts and for the most part  the current BRAC results show that     We re very pleased with the decision to leave Hanscom and Natick open  and to bring additional jobs to Hanscom  The increase is a tribute to the high quality work done at the base and the technology sector that supports it  Many from that sector are here to show their support  We are ready  willing  and able to perform that new mission  and will arrange a separate time to speak with you about these bases  Our biggest disagreement is with the Pentagon s proposal to close Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod  Otis has military value in spades and is essential to the defense of the entire New England region     The 102nd at Otis has an outstanding history of keeping the nation safe  Its planes have patrolled our skies 24 hours a day  365 days a year since 1972  In the Cold War  they intercepted Soviet planes within 250 nautical miles of the Long Island Coastline     We ve spoken with many former senior Air Force officials  and many were surprised that the BRAC list proposed closing Otis because of its strategic location  Planes here do not have to work in congested airspace  or wait to go supersonic  The base is the ideal place to prevent air attacks from Europe or across the pole against the many  many high value strategic targets throughout the Northeast     We ve seen this again and again  On September 11th  fighters from Otis were the first to respond to attacks on the twin towers  Three months later  F 15s from Otis intercepted the plane with the shoe bomber and escorted it safely to Logan Airport  protecting us from that terrorist attack  Otis is the only base in the region on alert twenty four hours a day  seven days a week  Knowing all this  when the list came out  we thought the decision to close Otis must be a mistake     We dug into the data  and found that we were right  The decision to close Otis was based on several mistakes  which were substantial deviations from the BRAC criteria  The Air Force miscalculated Otis  military value score  by not giving full credit for the high quality airspace  ramp space  and surge capacity  The military value formula did not adequately reflect the post 9 11 realities and left out homeland defense  Because of an erroneously low military value score  Otis was ignored when the Air Force decided it still needed a fighter presence in the Northeast    The BRAC proposal would leave Boston unprotected  with only 2 planes on alert in a 175 mile radius  After September 11th  Otis began flying combat air patrols around the clock  for the next six months  keeping two planes in the air at all times  with two more prepared to launch  and two others that had just landed undergoing any needed repairs  Clearly  two planes are not enough to fulfill the mission     Closing Otis will also undermine the Coast Guard Air Station on Cape Cod  In the last three years  the Coast Guard has flown over 900 search and rescue operations  A letter from the Commandant of the Coast Guard states that he faces a Hobson s choice   either find an additional  25 million or more  or close down his fixed wing operations  Even though they were required to do so by law  the Air Force never asked him what the impact would be if Otis is closed    Conceivably  that risk to homeland security might be offset if the Air Force could produce enough savings to meet our defense needs in other ways  but that s not the case  The Air Force also made errors in calculating the cost savings  As our presentation will show  the actual Air Force savings will be less than a tenth of what they claimeda mere  18 million over the next twenty years  That s a small price to pay to ensure the safety of New England and the nation    These facts lead to only one conclusion    Otis should stay open            FACT SHEET   The Case for Otis   1   The Air Force made a number of mistakes calculating Otis  military value     The current and future mission criteria focused on training ranges  air traffic control  and weather  Otis didn t get full credit for    o    Uncrowded training ranges to the east and south of the cape o    24 hour operations    The contingency and mobilization criteria focused on fuel dispensing and buildable acres  Otis didn t get full credit for    o    The number of parking spaces on the tarmac o    Its ability to surge        Neither category took in consideration Otis  mission    sitting alert 24 hours a day  seven days a week    Conclusion  If the Air Force had properly calculated the scoreeven without the homeland defense missionOtis would have been 28th  not 88th among fighter bases    2  The Air Force made mistakes calculating the cost savings from closing Otis  which they claim is  36 8 million annually  and total savings over the next 20 years as  336 million     The savings that the Air Force claims are not related to Otis  but are related to broader personnel reductions in the Air National Guard  You could close any base to get these savings  It doesn t have to be Otis     The savings model doesn t include the costs of training pilots at other bases to fly the F 15s  The Pentagon proposed moving the planes to Atlantic City  which currently flies F 16s  The cost of training the pilots to fly a new plane is  36 7 million more than the Air Force claims     The Air Force savings estimates don t include the costs that will shift to the Coast Guard so that it can continue to run the airfield  The Coast Guard has told us that if the Air Force leaves then  they will have to find an additional 100 people and  17 million annually to keep up operations  This is a cost that the taxpayers will have to bear    Conclusion  If the Air Force had properly calculated the cost savings  they would only save  33 million  not  336 million  over the next twenty years    3  The Air Force didn t include the effect on Homeland Security     The BRAC proposal would leave Boston unprotected with only 2 planes in a 175 mile radius  far too few to keep up a 24 hour patrol presence  Yet on September 11th  the hijacked planes took off from Boston      The BRAC proposal would leave only 2 planes available to patrol and intercept along the busiest air routes in the world  Fighters from Otis have been scrambled over 100 times since September 11th to intercept suspicious flights like the shoe bomber  Otis can get there faster  and stay on patrol over key intercept points longer than fighters from other bases     If Otis leaves  and the Coast Guard Air Station can t afford to run the airfield  the next closest search and rescue Air Station is in North Carolina  The entire East Coast will be unprotected  In the last three years  the Coast Guard on Cape Cod have performed over 900 search and rescue missions  The Coast Guard was never consulted about the impact of closing Otis    Conclusion  Closing Otis makes us less safe   Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
