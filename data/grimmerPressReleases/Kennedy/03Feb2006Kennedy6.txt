         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      We all share the goals of spreading freedom and democracy and ending tyranny around the globe  There s no disagreement about these goals  and the importance of these ideals  America has been a beacon of democracy  freedom  and human rights for more than two centuries     When America is at its best  our deeds match our words  But many of us feel we haven t done that in Iraq  We care about our country  Stephen Decatur famously said  My country  right our wrong  But others through the years have said it better our country right or wrong  When right  to be kept right  When wrong  to be set right    We ve paid a high price for the invasion of Iraq  Saddam is gone  but there were no weapons of mass destruction  The cakewalk they predicted became a quagmire instead  We shifted our focus away from the real threat to our national security Osama bin Laden  We shattered our alliances and lost our respect in the world  More than 1400 American soldiers have given their lives  150 000 of our soldiers are tied down in Iraq  Our military has been stretched to the breaking point  with other threats ever present  The families of our military  and our guard and reserves are suffering    We are all moved by the bravery of the Iraqi people who voted in Sunday s election  We honor the courageous men and women of our armed forces who continue to risk their lives for a better future for the Iraqi people     But the election is not a mandate for the Administration s current policy  It is not a cure for the intense violence and resentment caused by the American occupation that is clearly fueling the insurgency  But it is an opening  if we are wise enough to seize it  to demonstrate to the Iraqi people that we have no long term designs on their country    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
