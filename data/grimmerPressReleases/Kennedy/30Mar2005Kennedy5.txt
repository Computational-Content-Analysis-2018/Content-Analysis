         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Thank you Marc  for that generous introduction  It s an honor to be here with so many who have done so much in inspiring service to others in our state  Just looking at all of you makes me sure that the Campaign to Advance Citizen Service is off to an excellent start    Special thanks to Yvette Rodriguez for hosting us here  I m looking forward to the opportunity to spend some time with your students    Massachusetts has been a model for the nation in how to encourage people of all ages to serve their communities      City Year is the model for AmeriCorps      Thousands of our seniors tutor young people as Foster Grandparents  They help other seniors live independently through Senior Companions  They work in their communities in the Retired Senior Volunteer Corps     Thousands of students have served in 34 AmeriCorps programs in the Commonwealth   Over 100 schools and colleges participate in Learn and Serve    We re here today to discuss how we can build on our accomplishments  Senator Marc Pacheco has introduced a bill to take the state to a new level  It writes the Massachusetts Service Alliance into state law  giving it permanent status as the state sponsor of volunteerism and service  It also enables state employees to use their volunteer time with any community based organization  in addition to schools  It calls on our colleges to recognize the importance of service by encouraging students through work study  scholarships and awards     One of the most important parts of Marc s bill is its encouragement of service learning as a way to meet state education requirements  One of the most effective ways to learn about civics is to go into the field yourself and learn how to get things done in your own community     To achieve real change  we need to put the action back into community action  We re going to meet college students today at this Head Start center who participate in the Jumpstart program  They don t need to read about school readiness in books    they ve been on the front lines  helping children actually learn those skills  They don t have to read about the importance of children being well fed before they can learn well     They don t have to read about the difference a caring adult makes in a child s life  They see this everyday when they come here  They know they ve helped change the lives of these children    People who serve their community learn the immense power of active citizens  They know that true democracy requires each of us be involved in meeting the challenges that our communities face  As my brother Bobby liked to say  each time we act to improve the life of others  we send out a new ripple of hope     Today  we make a new commitment to find effective ways to send out more and more of those ripples    to make service a genuine part of more and more peoples  lives  We know that service can be full time or part time  an hour a day or an hour a month  The more  the better  We re building an army of active citizens who want to change lives and know how to do it  With the power in this audience  I know we can get it done   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
