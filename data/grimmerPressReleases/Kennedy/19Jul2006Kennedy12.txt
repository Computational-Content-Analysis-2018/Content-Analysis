         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       I commend Chairman Specter for calling this special session  It demonstrates his commitment to voting this bill out of committee and to the floor today or tomorrow  Chairman Specter announced yesterday that Majority Leader Frist is prepared to move the bill to the floor this week  so I hope we can vote this bill out today    The Fifteenth Amendment gave everyone the right to vote  but it was not until we passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965 that the right started to become reality in many parts of the country  Because there was still work to do  we renewed the special provisions of the Act in 1970  1975  and 1982  And in 1975  1982 and 1992  we amended the Act to strengthen its guarantees    Now after months of hearings in the House and Senate  we have built a strong record for a further extension  The record shows progress  but it also presents compelling evidence for the Acts renewal  It highlights both current acts of overt discrimination in voting and more subtle practices that have been used to block access to voting in recent years  The inescapable conclusion is that we must reauthorize the Act and we should do it now    The amendments offered would weaken the Acts protections for this most fundamental of all our rights  I urge my colleagues to defeat these amendments and pass a clean bill      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
