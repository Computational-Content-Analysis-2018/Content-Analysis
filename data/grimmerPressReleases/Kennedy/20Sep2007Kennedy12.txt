         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I support this amendment     As we continue debating how best to support Americas brave military forces in Iraq  we must be clear about where we stand on the war  I strongly support our troops  but I strongly oppose the war  The best way to protect our troops and our national security is to put the Iraqis on notice that they need to take responsibility for their future  so that we bring our troops back home to America      The Administrations policy has put our troops in an untenable and unwinnable situation  They are being held hostage to Iraqi politics  in which sectarian leaders are unable or unwilling to make the tough judgments need to lift Iraq out of its downward spiral  Were spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a failed policy that is making America more vulnerable and is putting our troops at greater risk      We have lost our focus on apprehending terrorists and on capturing those who seek to destroy America  Osama Bin Laden remains at large  The war in Iraq has enabled Al Qaeda to recruit terrorists more effectively to work against America      Our policy in Iraq continues to exact a devastating toll  Nearly 4 000 American troops have died  and 30 000 have been injured  The toll on Iraqis is immense  Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed or injured and more than four million Iraqis have been forced to flee their homes  Nearly a half trillion dollars have been spent fighting this war      Our generals have acknowledged over and over again that a military solution alone is not the answer to Iraqs problems  After more than four bloody years  political reconciliation remains elusive and Iraqi politicians are not being held accountable to any standard of progress or success  Yet  the President unacceptably continues to impose the enormous burden of Iraqs sectarian violence on the backs of American troops      Our military is stretched to its limits and is nearing its breaking point  The American public has lost confidence in the current direction of the war  They are tired of a war based upon a failed policy that has made America no safer and that is subjecting our military to Iraqs intractable civil war  They are tired of Administration promises that success is just around the corner      They want to know when the nightmare of Iraq will end     How much longer will President Bush insist that our troops be held hostage to the abysmal failure of the Iraqi government to make the political compromises essential to end the violence  especially when there is no indication  NO INDICATION  that they will do so anytime soon     How many more brave Americans must die     How many more billions of taxpayer dollars must we spend     How much more of a burden must we place on our military     We all know what is going on  President Bushs strategy is delay and delay  We never should have gone to war in the first place  and his misguided war has now gone on for more than four years  The situation is not improving    Its worsening  Its not showing signs of meaningful progress  Year after year  its failed to deliver political reconciliation  The President finally admitted to Congress and the American people last week that his successor  the next American President  will inherit the war in Iraq  He calls himself The Decider  but he refuses to make the decision to end the war      President Harry Truman said  The buck stops here  But the last thing President Bush wants is for the buck to stop on his desk  Hes desperately trying to buy time in order to pass the buck to his successor in the White House     The first President Bush went to war with Iraq after 52 Senators voted in favor of a resolution of approval      Now  53 Senators have voted for a timetable to end the war  but this President Bush vetoed the bill because he refuses to accept responsibility to end a war he never should have started      Its time to stop this madness     This amendment does that  It requires our combat troops to begin to come home in 90 days  It requires a change in mission for our military  It requires the vast majority of our combat troops to come home in nine months     Its up to us to end the open ended commitment of our troops that President has been making year after year  The Iraqis need to take responsibility for their own future  resolve their political differences  and enable our troops to come home      We need to tell the Iraqis now that we are going to leave and leave soon  Only such a step can add the urgency that is so clearly necessary to end their differences  We cant allow the President to drag this process out any longer     I urge my colleagues to support this amendment
