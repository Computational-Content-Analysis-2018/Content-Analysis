         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  For years  many of us have fought the same battle  the battle to give those suffering or injured every ethical option for new cures     For those speaking on the Senate floor  perhaps little changes from one years debate to the next   We still speak of hope   We still speak of dreams denied when those hopes are dashed   We still speak of our belief that medical research should be valued     But for those who listen to our debate  a year can make all the difference in the world   For a young man or woman bravely serving their country  a year can mean the difference between vigorous active service and life in a wheelchair or with a brain injury from a war wound     For someone fighting the long and lonely battle against Alzheimers Disease  a year can make the memory of a beloved spouse or child a little fainter and a little more distant For a patient battling against the tremors of Parkinsons Disease  a year can mean more and more life activities fade out of reach If overturning the Administrations unwarranted restrictions on stem cell research brings just one breakthrough  just one of the many that our best scientists believe are possible  that breakthrough can mean all the difference in the world for the patients who benefit   They cannot wait another year or another day for the help that stem cell research can bring  and we should not wait in aiding them We must take action here and now to end these unnecessary and harmful restrictions on lifesaving research       Continuing the Administrations restrictions means that the gap between what scientists could do and what they are allowed to do grows ever wider        Continuing the restrictions means that our nations best scientists will go on having to waste precious time on pointless red tape and bureaucratic obstacles  time that should be spent on the search for new cures Continuing the restrictions means having to tell the patients who are counting on the promise of stem cell research  Wait just a little longer   Dream just a little less   Hope just a little more faintly The Senate must act  just as the House has already done  to unlock the potential of stem cell research When the Congress has approved this needed legislation  we must turn our attention to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and urge the President of the United States not to veto the legislation that gives so much hope to so many   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
