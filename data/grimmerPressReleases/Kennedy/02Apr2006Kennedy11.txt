         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C     Today on CNN s Late Edition  Senator Frist said that amnesty means allowing undocumented workers to get in front of the line of the three million already waiting for citizenship  He said the McCain  Kennedy plan calls for that  In fact  the McCain Kennedy bill requires undocumented immigrants not only to earn the privilege of remaining  but also to get in the back of the line to obtain a green card  Below is a response from Senator Kennedy on Senator Frist s erroneous comments    Immigration reform is one of the most important issues before the nation  and it s disappointing to hear Senator Frist mischaracterize such an important matter  Sadly  Senator Frist is as wrong about immigration reform as he is about our bill  Contrary to Senator Frist s assertion  the McCain Kennedy plan puts undocumented immigrants who want to earn American citizenship at the back of the line   after they ve paid a big penalty  paid their back taxes  learned English and worked consistently for six years  Our bill says it clearly in black and white  Yet  Senator Frist wrongly claims that our bill is an amnesty and would allow immigrants to go to the front of the line  That couldn t be farther than the truth    As the Senate continues to debate comprehensive immigration reform we must be vigilant about keeping presidential politics and distortions out of the discussion  We have a historic opportunity to strengthen our national security  defend our values  and expand our economic prosperity by fixing this broken system once and for all   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
