         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     This is a time of great loss for our nation  Vicki and I join the nation in mourning the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist and we hold his family and friends in our thoughts and prayers     Chief Justice Rehnquist served this country with the greatest distinction  and I respected his leadership of the federal judiciary and his strong commitment to the integrity and independence of the courts     We are at a defining moment for the nation  In the midst of great loss and great tragedy  it is a time for America to come together  As we have so many times before  we will continue to move America forward  Our first priority must be to remain focused on relieving the suffering of the victims of Hurricane Katrina and rebuilding those lives  those cities and those communities  The nation s eyes and hearts and attention are and should be focused on the ongoing tragedy in the South     We must also recognize the importance of choosing two new Supreme Court justices at the same time  who will together help determine the direction of this country for generations to come  We should proceed carefully and appropriately in filling these important vacancies  With Justice O Connor committing to stay until her replacement is named  we can and should remain focused first on protecting our citizens who need help the most  while we prepare to do what is necessary to ensure that the Supreme Court remains strongly committed and able to protect the rights and freedoms of all Americans   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
