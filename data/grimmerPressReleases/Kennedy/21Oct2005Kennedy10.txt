         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     BOSTON  MASSACHUSETTS  Senator Edward M  Kennedy outlined his plan to prepare for a pandemic flu outbreak at the opening of the new UMASS Medical School Massachusettls Biologic Laboratories Facility in Mattapan  Senator Kennedy has introduced a bill in the United States Senate that calls for a national flu plan and sets forth a set of guidelines to combat a pandemic flu outbreak  The new facility will play a critical role in responding to new global health challenges  such as the worldwide threat of avian flu  Today  Kennedy was joined by Congressman Michael E  Capuano  University of Massachusetts President Jack M  Wilson  University of Massachusetts Medical School Chancellor and Dean  Dr  Aaron Lazare  Massachusetts Biologic Laboratories Director Dr  Donna Ambrosino and officials from the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health     Senator Kennedy said  We ll always have potential public health threats  and we have a new one on our hands with the avian flu  To respond  we ll need to develop and manufacture millions of doses of flu medication and make sure that we have the all the resources necessary to respond  With the devastation of Hurricane Katrina fresh in our minds  we cannot afford to be caught without a plan again    Kennedy s bill  the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act of 2005  addresses many of the weaknesses we suffer in preparedness  It requires the Secretary of HHS to take immediate action to finalize the national preparedness plan  to stockpile enough antiviral medications for 50  of the population  and to expand capacity for vaccine production  A summary of the bill is below  Experts estimate that if the current strain of avian flu mutates to a form that can more easily spread from human to human  millions of people will be sick and millions more will die  Currently there is no formal response plan  weak public health infrastructure  limited hospital capacity and low supplies of vaccine and antiviral drugs  The Massachusetts Biologic Laboratories  MBL  have provided public health services to the people of Massachusetts and around the world for over 100 years  most recently responding to the health needs of victims of Hurricane Katrina  MBL remains the only publicly owned  non profit FDA licensed manufacturer of vaccines and medications in the United States  The new facility will ensure that Massachusetts will continue to lead in the development of cutting edge technology  It will serve as a new biologics manufacturing and vaccine filling facility that will create over 320 high tech and research jobs for Massachusetts  It represents a resurgence of public health care and economic revitalization on the site of the old Boston State Hospital in Mattapan  This new facility will enable MBL  with the support of UMass Medical School  to respond to new global health challenges             Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act of 2005 Senators Reid  Obama  Bayh  Kennedy   Public health experts have warned that an avian influenza outbreak could ignite a worldwide pandemic that would threaten the lives of millions of Americans  The consequences of a pandemic could be far reaching    impacting virtually every sector of our society and our economy  Top Administration officials have admitted that our nation is dangerously unprepared for the serious threat of avian influenza  Action is urgently needed to protect the nation from the threat of pandemic flu  That is why Senate Democrats are introducing the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act of 2005  The bill will      Prepare for a pandemic by finalizing  implementing  and funding pandemic preparedness and response plans  We need a detailed plan outlining a coordinated national strategy to address a flu pandemic  The Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness Plan  which the World Health Organization deems essential to proper readiness  has yet to be finalized  despite having been released in draft form over a year ago  As a result  federal and state preparations for avian flu pandemic have been needlessly delayed  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Creates a Director of Pandemic Preparedness and Response within the Executive Office of the President who will be responsible for finalizing and making operational the National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan  The Director will coordinate the federal interagency preparation for and response to a pandemic   Ensures that  among other things  the National Pandemic Plan includes a specific focus on traditionally underserved populations  including low income  racial and ethnic minority  immigrant and uninsured populations   Establishes accountability for the national preparation for and response to a pandemic   Expands and coordinates State Pandemic Preparedness Activities  with emphasis on surveillance  preventive and medical care  workforce development  distribution plans for vaccines  antivirals and other treatments  communication and information networks  maintenance of core public health functions  security  and integration with national activities and existing bioterrorism preparedness activities      Improve surveillance and international partnerships so we may monitor the spread of avian influenza and detect the emergence of a flu strain with pandemic potential immediately  It will take several months to develop an effective vaccine against the avian flu once we have been able to identify the particular flu strain with pandemic potential  One of our best opportunities to limit the scope and consequences of any outbreak is to rapidly detect and contain the spread of a new strain that is capable of sustained human to human transmission  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Provides assistance for international pre pandemic surveillance and medical care   Establishes and implements a comprehensive diplomatic strategy targeted at nations in Southeast and East Asia most at risk for an epidemic of the avian influenza in order to strengthen our ability to detect  prevent and effectively respond to an outbreak of the avian flu   Creates an International Fund to support pre pandemic influenza control and relief activities in countries affected by avian influenza   Expands domestic and international efforts by the Department of Agriculture to prevent pandemic avian influenza   Improves state surveillance efforts      Protect Americans though the development  production  and distribution of an effective vaccine  Our existing stockpile of vaccines    assuming they are effective against a future  unidentified flu strain    may protect less than one percent of all Americans  We have only one domestic flu vaccine manufacturer located in the United States  If our capacity to produce vaccines is not improved  it could take 15 months just to vaccinate our first responders  medical personnel and other high risk groups    The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Expands Research at the NIH on influenza vaccines and treatment   Establishes a mass tracking and distribution system for antiviral medications and vaccines   Enhances vaccine production capacity by creating a guaranteed market for seasonal flu vaccine through a federal buyback program for a portion of unsold doses   Improves access to vaccinations during a pandemic by enhancing annual flu vaccination coverage for uninsured and underinsured adults and children     Plan ahead for a pandemic by stockpiling antivirals  vaccines  and other essential medications and supplies  Antiviral medication will be a crucial stopgap defense against a pandemic because it will take several months to develop  produce and distribute a vaccine  Other nations have ordered enough Tamiflu  an antiviral pill  to cover between twenty and forty percent of their populations  The United States only has enough antiviral pills in its stockpile to cover 2 percent of its population  We also need to ensure that we have an adequate supply of other medications and medical supplies  such as masks and gloves  in our national stockpile  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Requires procurement of antivirals to cover a minimum of 50 percent of the population for the Strategic National Stockpile   Requires procurement of a minimum level of vaccines  medications and other supplies for the Strategic National Stockpile   Protects Americans from price gouging of medications during a pandemic      Strengthen our public health infrastructure  The nation s public health infrastructure is weak  and our hospitals and health care providers lack adequate surge capacity to respond to a pandemic  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Improves surge capacity to ensure an adequate supply of health care providers and institutions to care for affected Americans in the event of a pandemic       Inform Americans by increasing awareness and education about pandemic flu  A pandemic could impact virtually every sector of our society and our economy  The medical community must be trained to distinguish between the annual flu and the avian flu so that an outbreak could be reported immediately  Businesses and the American public need to be educated about the steps they can take to prepare for and respond to an avian flu outbreak  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act   Expands research at the CDC for communication and behavioral strategies for the general public   Ensures that public education and awareness campaigns targeted to businesses  health care providers and the American public related to pandemic preparedness are conducted      Commit to protecting Americans by devoting adequate resources to pandemic preparedness  Many programs that will dramatically reduce the consequences of a future avian flu outbreak are unfunded or massively underfunded  The Senate approved a Democratic amendment to the Department of Defense appropriations bill to begin providing the resources needed to address this threat  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act will ensure that adequate resources are available to address this looming threat            STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY AT THE UMASS MEDICAL CENTER MASSACHUSETTS BIOLOGIC LABORATORIES    As prepared for delivery    Remarks  Massachusetts Biologic Laboratory Ribbon Cutting October 21  2005   Thank you so much  Jack  for that generous introduction  Jack s done a wonderful job for the University of Massachusetts system  and he s renowned for his dedication to good causes across the Commonwealth  He knows what higher education and innovation can do to strengthen economic development  And that s what today is all about     So it s an honor to be here to participate in the opening of this new facility  The Massachusetts Biologic Laboratory is a unique asset for our state  It s the only self sustaining  publicly operated vaccine research and manufacturing facility in the country     In fact  the Laboratory itself has been functioning for more than a century  its had an essential role in establishing the tradition of excellence and innovation in health care here in Massachusetts  As this new facility demonstrates  the Laboratory and UMass Medical School are committed to carrying on that tradition well into the future  The field of the life sciences will continue to be critical for the health of our people and the Commonwealth as a whole with this new state  of the art facility  Massachusetts will continue to have access to critical vaccines against diphtheria  tetanus and other illnesses  It will continue to do the research  and produce the orphan drugs for which there is an urgent need but only a small market  Not many companies out there have the flexibility to do that  So this facility is a tremendous asset not only for all of us in Massachusetts  but for the nation and for public health initiatives around the world    MBL was there to respond to the SARS outbreak a few years ago and within just six months  it produced a potential treatment for the disease  That is an impressive achievement by any standard and I commend Dr  Ambrosino  for her leadership in responding to these urgent public health challenges     We ll always have potential public health threats    we have a new one on our hands with the avian flu  Sadly  the steps have not been taken in recent years to see that we are prepared  Flu medicine has not been stockpiled  Funding for public health has been cut  and the nation lacks even a basic plan to deal with a pandemic  I hope Congress will act quickly to approve legislation I have introduced to strengthen public health preparedness  improve our stockpiles of flu medicine  and accelerate the development of new vaccines and treatments for the disease threats we face     Developing new vaccines is the most effective defense against a pandemic  As a publicly owned vaccine manufacturing facility  MBL has a unique role in helping make the vaccines that the nation so urgently needs  Providing incentives for industry to develop new medicines is a part of our response to health threats such as pandemic flu  but expanding the role of publicly operated facilities can help see that the nation has the capacity to produce essential vaccines in times of need    UMass and Massachusetts Biologic Laboratories are helping in another essential way to protect the future health of our communities  By expanding into the old Boston State Hospital  you re injecting new life into Mattapan and maintaining its presence in Jamaica Plain     The new laboratory means new jobs  new residents  and new commerce for the community  And these are good jobs for all    scientists and engineers  manufacturing associates  lab technicians and support staff     These are the jobs of the future and we need to find effective ways to encourage more of them  That means educating our youth in math and science and investing in research and development  If we do  we ll have continuing excellence in the life sciences for Massachusetts and the nation  We re grateful to MBL for all its done to make Massachusetts a leader in biotechnology  On this auspicious day  the future is bright and all of you are the reason why  We re very very proud of you and we thank you for all you do so well    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
