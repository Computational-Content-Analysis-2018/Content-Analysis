         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  with colleagues Senator John F  Kerry and Congressman William Delahunt  sent the following letter to Air Force Chief of Staff General James Jumper  The lawmakers are urging Jumper to take a close look at the role Otis plays in our national defense and to examine key proponents of the Pentagon s analysis to recommend its closure Kennedy said  The Air Force made several errors in assessing Otis  They miscalculated the base s military value  and they did not consult with the Coast Guard  as required by law  We learned that the Navy  unlike the Air Force  consulted with Coast Guard on other bases  and in at least one case  the harmful impact on the Coast Guard convinced the Navy to keep that base open Kennedy also said  Clearly  if the Coast Guard has to move or end its operations at Otis  the change will undermine safety in the coastal areas and harm our fishing industry Kerry said  It is disturbing to learn that the decision to close Otis Air Force Base was made without a consideration of how doing so would affect the other services  especially the Coast Guard  that also use the Massachusetts Military Reservation  As demonstrated on September 11th Otis remains a critical part of our homeland defense and we need to make sure we have a full  fair and coherent analysis from the Air Force as soon as possible Congressman Delahunt said  A coherent BRAC process   one that respects both economic realities and national security   must command public confidence  From Cape Cod to California  Americans need to know that this review is based on a thoughtful review of the facts and their consequences  30 June 27  2005General James Jumper Chief of Staff United States Air Force 4E924 The Pentagon Washington  DC 20301Dear General Jumper We are writing to express our deep concern about the Air Force proposal to close Otis Air National Guard Base as part of the BRAC process  Based on recent meetings with senior Air Guard Officers  we have learned that  1  the Air Guard did not consult with the Coast Guard on the impact of closing Otis  and  2  in its decision process the Air Guard  under the guise of military judgment  included factors not reflected in the Base Closure Executive Group Minutes  or anywhere else in the BRAC data Otis is located on the Massachusetts Military Reservation  and is home to the Air National Guard s 102nd Fighter Wing  which shares the airfield with the Coast Guard Air Station and the Army National Guard s aviation activities  Under the BRAC law  the Air Force is required to consult with other agencies about the leave behind costs We have learned  however  that the Air Force did not assess these consequences as the Defense Department prepared its BRAC recommendations  This omission may well have adversely influenced the decision to close the base by overstating the cost savings to the taxpayer  since the remaining tenants will have to increase their expenditures to keep the airfield running  Otis operates and maintains the base s infrastructure and utilities  and provide various support services to all tenants at the base  With specific respect to the Coast Guard  Otis currently provides base security  airport runway operations and maintenance  air traffic control  water supply  waste water treatment and distribution Because of current financial constraints  it is highly unlikely that the Coast Guard can afford to absorb the  15  25 million in infrastructure  maintenance and operational costs associated with closing Otis  As we prepare our testimony for the public proceedings of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission  it is critical to understand how this impact on the Coast Guard was taken into consideration We also learned at our meetings that the Air Force recommendations were based on other considerations referred to as military judgments  For example  we were informed that one of the military judgments used for Otis     but unaccounted for in the data      is a perceived recruitment and retention problem at the base  We are concerned that other similar military judgments were used based on inaccurate or erroneous information  Therefore  we are requesting your assistance in identifying any other military judgments used in the Otis decision  and the supporting documentation that backs them up We ask that you provide us with  1  a formal answer on the nature and degree of consultation with other agencies about the effect of the closure of Otis  and  2  any military judgments that were made that influenced the decision to close Otis but are not reflected in the BRAC data Thank you for your cooperation on this important issue  and we look forward to hearing from you Sincerely Edward M  Kennedy John F  Kerry William D  Delahunt Senator Senator Congressman   Kennedy  Melissa Wagoner 202 224 2633
