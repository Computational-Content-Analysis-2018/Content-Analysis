         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC Today  Senators Harry Reid  Edward Kennedy and Barbara Mikulski  joined by fellow Democratic members of the HELP Committee  sent the following letter in support of the renomination of Equal Employment Opportunity Commissioner Stuart Ishimaru  The White House has thus far failed to renominate Ishimaru  despite his groundbreaking work on discrimination  reputation of unimpeachable integrity  and strong track record on civil rights issues that have tremendously benefited the Commission  Stuart Ishimaru has been an invaluable asset to the EEOC  spearheading many bipartisan efforts to protect the rights of American workers  Senator Kennedy said  He has devoted his life to fighting for fairness and justice in the workplace  and his experience and expertise is unparalleled  I strongly urge the Administration to return this extraordinary leader to the Commission Stuart Ishimaru has been an effective advocate and an important voice on the EEOC  and he should be nominated for another term  said Senator Mikulski  We must make sure the EEOC is fighting to keep the playing field level and ending discrimination at the workplace and it s time for us to work together to fix this once proud agency  Renominating Mr  Ishimaru is the right place to start The letter was signed by Senators Reid  Kennedy  Mikulski  Dodd  Harkin  Bingaman  Murray  Reed  Clinton  Obama  Sanders and Brown  The text of the letter is below and a PDF version with signatures is available upon request        July 31  2007George W  Bush President of the United States 1600 Pennsylvania AvenueWashington  DC 20500Dear President Bush  We write to strongly urge you to nominate Stuart Ishimaru for another term on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission   For the past two decades Mr  Ishimaru has been a tireless advocate for civil rights while serving at the EEOC  the Department of Justice  and on Capitol Hill  His impressive record of accomplishments in public service and his reputation of unimpeachable integrity clearly demonstrate that he is an invaluable asset to the EEOC  and has much to contribute to the future of this important agency Even before his service on the EEOC  Mr  Ishimarus career exemplified his deep dedication to advancing civil rights for all Americans  As Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General  and  subsequently  Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice from 1994 through 2001  Ishimaru supervised cases involving employment discrimination  hate crimes  police misconduct prosecutions  and fair housing and fair lending  Before his tenure at the Department of Justice he worked in Congress providing oversight of the Civil Rights Division  the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988  the Americans with Disabilities Act  and the Civil Rights Act of 1991  These experiences have helped Mr  Ishimaru to develop an unparalleled expertise on civil rights issues that has tremendously benefited the Commission  Since joining the EEOC  Mr  Ishimaru has been one of the leading architects of the Commissions new bipartisan initiative on systemic employment discrimination  and has joined with Chairwoman Naomi Earp in refocusing the Commission on race discrimination  He also pushed the Commission to adopt groundbreaking rules on discrimination against parents and other workers who have caregiving responsibilities  and led efforts to improve the discrimination complaint process for federal employees  Throughout his tenure on the Commission  Mr  Ishimaru has undertaken extraordinary efforts to remain in close contact with the front line staff at the EEOCs field offices  and has conducted an unprecedented level of outreach to small and often under represented minority groups   Because of Mr  Ishimarus in depth knowledge and proven record of accomplishments while in office  we feel that the EEOC would be seriously weakened without his continued service  The EEOC has long benefited from its bi partisan structure  By renominating a Republican to fill the vacancy left by former Commissioner Dominguez without renominating Mr  Ishimaru  the Administration appears to be attempting to establish a Commission with three sitting Republicans but only one Democrat  This will seriously decrease the range of opinion represented on the Commission  and could result in less robust enforcement of our civil rights laws The EEOC is one of the Governments most important agencies and protects basic rights that preserve the American dream of equal opportunity  Mr  Ishimaru has been an integral part of the Commission efforts to protect these rights  and deserves to be renominated  Sincerely ________________ ________________
