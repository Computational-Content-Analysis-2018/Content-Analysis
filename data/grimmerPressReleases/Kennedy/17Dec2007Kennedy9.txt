         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I am troubled by the FISA bill that has come to the Senate floor  Since I introduced the original FISA legislation over 30 years ago  Ive worked to amend the FISA law many times  and I believe that this bill is not faithful to the traditional balance that FISA has struck  This bill gives the Executive Branch vast new authorities to spy on Americans  without adequate guidance or oversight  Americans deserve better     I voted yes on the motion to proceed to consideration of this bill  because I believe this legislation is too important to hold up any longer  The House has already passed a new FISA bill  and the Senate needs to do the same  But let me be clear  the Senate should reject the bill that we have before us  We need to pass the Judiciary Committee version instead      The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is one of our landmark statutes  For nearly three decades  it has regulated government surveillance in a way that protects both our national security and our civil liberties and prevents the government from abusing its powers  It is because FISA enhances both security and liberty that it has won such broad support over the years from presidents  members of Congress  and the public alike  It is important to remember that before this Administration  no Administration had ever resisted FISA  much less systematically violated it      When the Administration finally came to Congress to amend FISA after its warrantless wiretapping program was exposed  it did so not in the spirit of partnership  but to bully us into obeying its wishes  The Protect America Act was negotiated in secret at the last minute  The Administration issued dire threats that failure to enact a bill before the August recess could lead to disaster  Few  if any  knew what the language would actually do  The result of this flawed process was flawed legislation  which virtually everyone now acknowledges must be substantially revised     I commend the members of the Intelligence Committee for their diligent efforts to put together a new bill  Theyve taken their duties seriously  and theyve made some notable improvements over the Protect America Act      But their bill is deeply flawed  and I am strongly opposed to enacting it in its current form  This bill fails to protect Americans constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms  There are many problems with the bill                   Add it all up  and the takeaway is clear  this bill is inconsistent with the way FISA was meant to work  and its inconsistent with the way FISA has always worked     The Judiciary Committees FISA bill shows that there is a better way  The Judiciary Committees version is faithful to the traditional FISA balance  It shares the same basic structure  but it addresses all of the problems I listed above  The Judiciary bill was negotiated in public  which allowed outside groups and experts to give critical feedback  It was also negotiated later in time than the Intelligence Bill  meaning we had the benefit of reviewing their work      Like the Intelligence Committees bill  the Judiciary Committees version also gives the Executive Branch greater authority to conduct electronic surveillance than it has ever had before  Make no mistake  it too is a major grant of power to the intelligence community  But unlike the Intelligence Committees bill  the Judiciary Committees version sets some reasonable limits that protect innocent Americans from being spied on by their government without any justification whatever     No one should lose sight of how important Title I of FISA is  The rules governing electronic surveillance affect every American  They are the only thing that stands between the freedom of Americans to make a phone call  send an e mail  and search the Internet  and the ability of the government to listen in on that call  read that e mail  review that Google search  In our Information Age  Title I of FISA provides Americans a fundamental bulwark against government tyranny and abuse  If we enact the Title I that is now before us  we will undermine that bulwark      Unfortunately  the exact same thing would be true if we enact the Intelligence Committees Title II       Mr  President  the nation was shocked to learn earlier this month that the CIA had destroyed videotapes showing employees using severe interrogation techniques  The willful destruction of these tapes by the CIA obviously raises serious questions involving obstruction of justice     But this is not the only cover up that the Administration has been involved in lately  President Bush has been demanding that Congress grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that cooperated with the Administrations illegal surveillance program  He wants us to pretend that this whole episode never happened      I oppose granting any form of retroactive immunity to these companies  and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to strike Title II from the FISA bill  Amnesty for telecommunication companies may help the Administration conceal its illegal spying  but it will not serve our national security  and it will further undermine the rule of law       Lets not forget why we are even talking about this issue  At some point in 2001  the Bush Administration began a massive program of warrantless spying  New reports suggest that the Administration began its warrantless spying even before 9 11  The Administration never told Congress what it was doing  In clear violation of the FISA law and in complete disdain for the 4th Amendment  it also never told the FISA court what it was doing     Because the Bush Administration secretly ignored the law  we still do not know how deeply this program invaded the privacy of millions of innocent Americans  The push for immunity by this Administration is a push to avoid all accountability for a wiretapping program that was a massive violation of the law     FISA has been in force for 29 years  It was designed from the beginning to allow flexibility in pursuing our enemies  It was enacted with strong bipartisan support in 1978  and its been amended on a bipartisan basis some 30 times since then  Its enhanced Americans security and safeguarded our liberty  Every previous Administration has complied with FISA  But the Bush Administration apparently decided that FISA was an inconvenience  With the help of certain phone companies  it secretly spied on Americans for years  without any court orders or oversight      There is still a great deal we dont know about this secret spying  but what we do know is alarming  Numerous reports indicate that it covered not only international communications  but also Americans purely local calls with their friends  neighbors  and loved ones  A lawsuit in California has produced evidence that at the governments request  ATT installed a supercomputer in a San Francisco facility that copied every communication by its customers  and turned them over to the National Security Agency     Think about that  The National Security Agency of the Bush Administration may have been intercepting the phone calls and e mails of millions of ordinary Americans for years     The surveillance was so flagrantly illegal that even lawyers in the Administration tried to fight it  Nearly 30 Justice Department employees threatened to resign over it  The head of the Office of Legal Counsel  Jack Goldsmith  testified that it was the biggest legal mess I had ever encountered     Mr  Goldsmith himself acknowledged that top officials in the administration dealt with FISA the way they dealt with other laws they didnt like  they blew through them in secret based on flimsy legal opinions that they guarded closely so no one could question the legal basis of the operations      Think about that as well  The Presidents own head of the Office of Legal Counsel states that the Administrations policy has been to blow through laws it doesnt like  in secret  so that its actions cannot be challenged  The Bush White House has repeatedly failed to understand that our government is a government of laws  and not of men     The Administrations secret spying program has taken a heavy toll on our country  Its failure to follow the law has made it more difficult for prosecutors to put terrorists behind bars  for intelligence professionals to avoid civil and criminal lawsuits  and for the public to trust its government  In the name of making us safer  the Administrations reckless disregard for the law has made us less safe  and countless Americans fear their rights have been endangered  That sorry record demands accountabilitynot immunity      Heres another fact that no one should lose sight of  From the very beginning  telecommunications companies have always had immunity under FISA when they comply with lawful surveillance requests  In fact  the Senate Judiciary Committee worked closely with ATT  and the company played a major role in drafting FISAs immunity provisions in the 1970s      To be completely protected from any liability whatever  all a company needs under FISA is a court order or an appropriate certification from the Attorney General  Thats it  Just get one of those two documents  and youre off the hook      So in this debate  lets be clear that were not talking about protecting companies that complied with lawful surveillance requests  Were talking about protecting companies that complied with surveillance requests that they knew were illegal       Immunity for the phone companies would be bad policy on many levels  First  it is premature even to be talking about this subject  Even though the President is demanding immunity for companies that may have broken the law  he will not tell all Members of Congress which companies broke the law  how they broke the law  or why they broke the law  He is asking us to legislate in the dark      Immunity for the telecoms for warrantless wiretapping violates the basic structure and purpose of FISA  The industry helped draft FISA  and they perform a major role under it  Heres how this system was explained in the House Intelligence Committee report on the original legislation     Requiring the court order or certification to be presented  to the carrier  before the assistance is rendered serves two purposes  It places an additional obstacle in the path of unauthorized surveillance activity  and  coupled with the provision relieving the third party from liability if the order or certification is complied with  it provides full protection to such third parties     If phone companies can ignore these requirements  this system of checks and balances collapses  Thats exactly what happened here  The telecoms are supposed to provide an essential safeguard for protecting Americans private information  Because Congress and the courts usually dont know about wiretapping activities  this role of the telecoms is crucial  Immunity for the telecoms undermines the basic design of our surveillance laws     Instead of undermining those laws  we should apply them in a court of law to discover and punish illegal activities  The Administration has used the scare tactic of claiming that lawsuits will jeopardize national security by leaking sensitive information  That argument ignores the fact that the media have already exposed the existence of its warrantless surveillance program and the role of some telecoms in assisting this program  In addition  it would be foolish to assume that the terrorists dont already know that we are trying to intercept their phone calls and e mails      The Administrations argument also ignores the numerous safeguards used by courts to protect sensitive information  No one is advocating that the NSA disclose its specific methods or targets in open court  Even if someone did seek such disclosure  the federal courts have procedures that have protected government secrets for generations      The Administration has also suggested that allowing these lawsuits to proceed might jeopardize national security by deterring phone companies from future cooperation with surveillance requests  This too is sheer nonsense  Under FISA  companies already have absolute immunity for any lawful cooperation  Future companies will be deterred only from cooperating with illegal surveillance requestswhich is the whole point of the law  We dont want this shameful episode to happen again     The phone companies will suffer only the same harm that befalls any company that violates the law  The Administration contends that the telecoms may be bankrupted if the lawsuits continue  In other words  the Administration is telling us that these companies may have engaged in lawbreaking on a scale so massive that they could not afford the penalty if they are brought to justice  But massive lawbreaking is an argument against immunitynot for it  If the concern is the companies financial health  the answer is not to throw out the rule of law  but to legislate reasonable remedies  such as damage caps      Immunity for the telecoms would also violate basic principles of fairness and justice  The Administration repeatedly claims that immunity is a matter of basic fairness because the companies were just doing their patriotic duty  But thats a strange conception of fairness  Telecommunications companies have clear duties under the law  They also have highly sophisticated lawyers who deal with these issues all the time  If a company violated its clear duties and conducted illegal spying  fairness demands that it face the consequences      It is precisely because fairness and justice are so important to the American system of government that we ask an independent branchthe judiciaryto resolve such legal disputes  There is nothing fair or just about Congress stepping into ongoing lawsuits to decree victory for one side and deny injured parties their day in court       Frankly  the whole patriotic duty argument weve been hearing from the White House is hard to take seriously  If the allegations against the telecoms are true  then we are not talking here about ambiguous points of law  As a federal judge remarked in one of the leading cases  ATT cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal  We are not talking here about what happened in the frantic weeks and months immediately following 9 11  We are talking about alleged violations of Americans rights that went on for 5 years  in total secrecy  on a scale that has never been approached in our history      If the telecoms had followed the law instead of the Bush Administration  the Administration could have come to Congress and obtained any needed changes to the law  In a democracy  it is the job of the legislature to amend laws to fit new circumstances  It is not the job of the legislature to rubber stamp illegal conduct by the Executive      Some of the telecoms might have been doing what they thought was good for the country  Some of them might simply have been doing what they thought would preserve their lucrative government contracts  We simply dont know  But either way  it is not the role of telecommunications companies to decide which laws to follow and which to ignore  FISA is a law that was carefully developed over many years to give the Executive Branch the flexibility it needs  while protecting the rights of Americans  It is the companies legal dutyand their patriotic dutyto follow that law      Nothing could be more dangerous for Americans privacy and liberty than to weaken that law  which is precisely what retroactive immunity is meant to do  Yesterdays newspaper disclosed that in December of 2000  the National Security Agency sent the Bush Administration a report asserting that the Agency must become a powerful  permanent presence on Americas communications network  A powerful  permanent presence on Americas communications network  Under this Administration  that is exactly what the NSA has become  If the phone companies simply do the NSAs bidding in violation of the law  they create a world in which Americans can never feel confident that their e mails and phone calls arent being tapped by the government     Finally  amnesty would stamp a congressional seal of approval on the Administrations warrantless spying  If Congress immunizes the telecoms for past violations of the law  it will send the message that Congress approves what the Administration did  We would be aiding and abetting the President in his illegal actions  his contempt for the rule of law  and his attempt to hide his lawbreaking from the American people  Voting for amnesty would be a vote for silence  secrecy  and illegality  There would be no accountability  no justice  no lessons learned     The damage wont stop there  The telecommunications companies are not the only private entity enlisted by this Administration in its lawbreaking  Think about Blackwater and its brutal actions in Iraq  or the airlines that have flown CIA captives to be tortured in foreign countries  These companies may also be summoned to court one day to justify their actions   And when that day comes  the Administration may call yet again for retroactive immunity  claiming that the companies were only doing their patriotic duty as partners in fighting terrorism      The debate were having now about telecom amnesty is not likely to be the last round in the Administrations attempt to immunize its private partners  Its only an opening round  In America  we should be striving to make more entities subject to the rule of law  not fewer  Giving in to the Administration now will start us down a path to a very dark place     Think about what weve been hearing from the White House in this debate  The President has said that American lives will be sacrificed if Congress does not change FISA  But he has also said that he will veto any FISA bill that does not grant retroactive immunity  No immunity  no new FISA bill  So if we take the President at his word  he is willing to let Americans die to protect the phone companies  The Presidents insistence on immunity as a precondition for any FISA reform is yet another example of his disrespect for honest dialogue and for the rule of law     Its painfully clear what the Presidents request for retroactive immunity is really about  Its a self serving attempt to avoid legal and political accountability and keep the American public in the dark about this whole shameful episode  Like the CIAs destruction of videotapes showing potentially criminal conduct  its a desperate attempt to erase the past      The Senate should see this request for what it is  and reject it  We should pass this amendment to strike Title II from the FISA bill  Our focus should be on protecting national security  our fundamental liberties  and the rule of lawnot protecting phone companies that knew they were breaking the law          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
