         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      As Prepared for Delivery    Americans deserve laws that protect both their security and their civil liberties  and this conference report does not      After years of doubt about the PATRIOT Act    this morning  Americans are waking up to more startling reports  For the past three years  the Administration has been eavesdropping on hundreds of calls without warrants or oversight     Well  the Administration isn t responding to the article    but they tell us    trust us  we follow the law    Give me a break      Across the country    and across the political spectrum    no one is buying it anymore  This Administration feels it s above the law  and the American people    and our Constitution    pay the price  There is no accountability    and no oversight  This president continues to ignore history  In the 1970s  big brother spied on its citizens and the American people stood up and said no  President Nixon s program    COINTEL  PRO    allowed broad spying on law abiding American citizens     We stopped big brother then by establishing a FISA court to ensure proper oversight and protections  Now  this Administration believes it s above even those protections  This is big brother run amok     With these new developments  we must take a step back and not rush the PATRIOT Act    further risking our civil protections  The entire world is watching to see how we strike the balance between intelligence gathering and the Constitution  We can t protect our borders if we don t protect our ideals    We need a bipartisan consensus that protects both our security and our liberty    while restoring the public trust    Our country is at a new low    not since Watergate has there been such a lack of openness and honesty in our government  Americans deserve better     The leaking of a CIA agent s identity is prime example  The President promised that he would clean house of anyone in the White House who had anything to do with the leak in the Plame case or the cover up  Now it has been suggested that the President himself may know the identity of the source  I urge him to set the record straight     The President needs to answer three questions     One    What did you know    and when did you know it    Two    Did you tell Special Prosecutor Fitzgerald the whole story    Three    Who else knew the facts    Cheney   Gonzales   Ashcroft    If Novak knew and the President knew then the American people should know too   Mr  President  answer these questions   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
