         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     There are some debates in Washington that you need to be an expert to understand   And there are others that are as plain as the headlines in the morning paper      Heres the headline from the Washington Post from November 11th  Chinese Government Admits Toys Contained  Date Rape  Chemical      November 29th from the Post  Bad Pet Food May Have Killed Nearly 350      September 27th from the Associated Press  Hamburgers may be tainted with E  Coli     October 31st from the New York Times  Chinese Chemicals Flow Unchecked to Market      And heres one just from today      Stopping Deadly Bacteria  Meat processors look for ways to keep ground beef safe      Every family knows that theyre at risk   Unsafe food   Toys contaminated with lead paint and other toxins   Dangerous drugs that should have been pulled from the shelves but werent      A trip to the store has become a minefield of tough choices      And every family knows that the government ought to be doing more to protect them  but the need for action was brought home by a stunning new report that reads like an indictment of years of neglect and starvation budgets for the nations public health watchdogs      Just listen to the conclusions of the FDA Science Advisory Board      Finding  1   The FDA cannot fulfill its mission because its scientific base has eroded and its scientific organizational structure is weak      Finding  2  The FDA cannot fulfill its mission because its scientific workforce does not have sufficient capacity and capability       Finding  3  The FDA cannot fulfill its mission because its information technology infrastructure is inadequate      Let there be no doubt  these deficiencies put American families at risk   Here again  the language of the report could not be more plain nor its warning more dire      FDA does not have the capacity to ensure the safety of food for the nation      Were here to say that this must change      The first order of business is for the President to withdraw his threat to veto the very bill that funds FDA      FDA needs more resources  and more support to do the job that American families are counting on it to do       Senator Durbin and I call on the White House to submit a budget request this year that puts us on the path to double FDAs food safety resources over five years  and we call on our colleagues to provide the funding to meet that target      FDA also needs more authority to see that foods are safe        In our FDA reforms enacted earlier this year  we took strong action to give the FDA the tools it needs and greater resources to protect Americans from unsafe drugs  and we should do the same for food      We need comprehensive preventive measures  effective surveillance  and robust authority for FDA to take action where needed to protect lives       Theres no mystery to how to improve food safety    The Europeans have a strong system  and so do the Japanese   Americans sometimes get the foods that they reject   That has to change   And the change must start now      I am working with my colleagues on the health committee and throughout the Senate on comprehensive bipartisan legislation to protect the food supply  and this proposal ought to be the first order of business for the Senate in the new year           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
