         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE             CONTACT  Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633   Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy spoke on the floor of the United States Senate on the proposed Cape Wind project in Nantucket Sound  The project would be the first offshore wind farm in the United States    Kennedy has consistently opposed the project and called for a federal policy to be in place before a project of this magnitude is given approval  Cape Wind seeks to put 130 wind turbines in Nantucket Sound that reach 417 feet tall  The effects on Massachusetts  fishing and tourism industries  the Coast Guard  navigation and national security are unknown     Kennedy s floor speech is included below  as well as a fact sheet that highlights some of the most disturbing inaccuracies surrounding the Cape Wind project    STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON SECTION 414 OF THE COAST GUARD CONFERENCE REPORT   As prepared for delivery    Mr  President  rising energy costs are affecting every family in America  The high price of gasoline not only hits us at the pump  but it is forcing up prices at the grocery and department stores  on electric bills  on airline tickets  and in so many other parts of our lives    Obviously  we need to end our dependence on foreign oil  We need to practice serious energy conservation  And we need to invest in new  clean and efficient technologies to meet our energy needs in the future    One promising source of alternative energy is to use windmills to generate electricity  A number of wind farms have been erected on land in recent years  and we are now exploring offshore sites for them for the first time in the nation s history     I strongly support the development of offshore wind energy projects  But just like any energy project  there s a right way and a wrong way to proceed with offshore wind development    The right way is for scientists and the government to study the outer continental shelf and to decide which sites are appropriate for development     The right way would keep wind energy projects away from sensitive ocean preserves  and away from areas surrounding vital sea lanes that must remain open to traffic to sustain national and local economies     The right way is for companies to bid competitively for the right to develop public lands and waters    and to do our best to see that the American people are getting the best deal possible    That s why Congress decided in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that offshore wind farms should be developed in the right way  The Act establishes a process that makes sense for the environment  for the affected communities  and for the public interest     That process will include a comprehensive mapping of the outer continental shelf through which the Department of the Interior will identify the sites where development makes sense    But the bill does have one flagrant loophole  One private project    the Cape Wind project in Massachusetts    won key exemptions from this sensible national policy  Thanks to that sweetheart deal  the Cape Wind project will not be evaluated in the same way as every other offshore wind energy project  And that s the wrong way for a project to be built     Here s how the special exemption was created  Under Subsection 388 d  1   some of the polices and procedures that will apply to every single offshore wind energy project in the future will not apply to a project where     an offshore test facility has been constructed   And there is exactly one project in the entire country to which that language applies  the Cape Wind development  So this is special interest legislation  designed to benefit one developer at the cost of the public interest     But the sweetheart deal gets much worse  Under Subsection 388 a  3   a competitive bidding process will be established for every other offshore project except Cape Wind     That exemption raises the possibility that the Cape Wind developer will pay below market rates    or nothing at all    for the right to erect a massive development in federal waters     In this way  a few words    which never even identify Cape Wind by name    allow a private developer to lay claim to 24 square miles of the waters off the coast of Massachusetts  The people didn t choose the site  The Department of Interior didn t choose it  The developer    Energy Management Incorporated  or EMI    chose this site     EMI chose a site in the middle of a major local fishery  in the middle of navigation routes are essential to the economy of the entire Cape and Islands  But that didn t matter to EMI  and there was no government policy in place to protect the public interest     EMI also chose to make this project the biggest in the world with 130 towers  each standing 417 feet tall  spread over 24 square miles     A project of that size must be measured against the national policy that Interior is developing    But instead of waiting for that policy  and then adhering to it  EMI is claiming that its special exemption requires the Department of the Interior to review and approve its application to develop Nantucket Sound before choosing which sites warrant development  and before establishing a national offshore wind energy development policy    Every other developer must wait to see what sites are identified by the Department of Interior for development      But not Cape Wind      Every other developer must face a competitive bidding process    But not Cape Wind    Every other developer must wait for the policy to be finalized    But not Cape Wind    That s the wrong way to promote wind energy  We know sweetheart deals contracts harm our citizens  Halliburton got a no bid deal to support our troops in Iraq  and our troops have paid the price  The Bush Administration awarded no bid contracts to rebuild after Katrina  and the people of the Gulf Coast have paid the price  Now Cape Wind is turning the waters off of Cape Cod into an industrial park  and the people of Massachusetts are going to pay the price     Every Senator who voted for the Energy Policy Act of 2005 has already voted in favor of a comprehensive and thoughtful policy to govern all offshore wind energy projects  That process will be thwarted if we allow one developer to play by a different set of rules     That s why I support of Section 414 of the Coast Guard Reauthorization Bill  All that language does is give the Commandant of the Coast Guard and the Governor of Massachusetts the ability to ensure that the public interest is served and that serious environmental and safety issues with this project are addressed    This provision is the opposite of an earmark  It corrects  rather than creates  special interest legislation  If EMI had not obtained a sweetheart deal in the Energy Policy Act last year  there would be no need for this provision  But it is needed now to correct a badly flawed process that treats the Cape Wind proposal differently than every other offshore wind energy development     This provision is similar to other provisions we ve passed to give authority to governors over projects off their shores  The Deepwater Port Act of 1974 grants final authority over the siting of offshore LNG terminals to the governor of the adjacent coastal state     The Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Act of 1980 gives authority to the governor of a coastal state to disapprove of offshore thermal energy conversion projects if they find that such facilities conflict with the state s laws or regulatory programs    Similar authority makes sense here  because EMI is bypassing the federal process that will apply to all other offshore wind energy projects  The people of Massachusetts have protected Nantucket Sound for nearly 400 years  and they deserve more than a sweetheart deal to stick a massive project off their shores     What are the arguments we ve heard in support of Cape Wind s sweetheart deal    First  we have heard that stopping this deal will send a bad message to others interested in developing alternative energy sources     That s flatly untrue  Every other developer will have to comply with one uniform set of procedures  The Department of the Interior just announced Friday that it will hold public meetings for an environmental review needed to formulate the national offshore alternative energy policy authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005  On May 25th  they ll hold a hearing in Dedham  Massachusetts    That environmental review will help the Interior Department create a clear  transparent and uniform set of standards for evaluation and siting offshore wind energy proposals on our outer continental shelf  and devise a competitive bidding process in which developers compete for the right to lease public offshore lands    The environmental review will include an effort by the Department of Interior to map and zone the outer continental shelf area to determine which sites are appropriate for development  and which are not     The issue before us today is whether EMI is entitled to evade this comprehensive process by staking its claim to one specific site and pushing for approval before Interior can assess which of our outer continental shelf lands are appropriate for development    We send exactly the right message to other developers if we pass Section 414  because it tells them that Congress won t give sweetheart deals to particular developers    Second  we are being told that EMI has already passed a careful review process    That too is flatly untrue      EMI originally applied to the Army Corps for a construction permit under the limited authority of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899  At the time of the application  the Army Corps had no authority to lease outer continental shelf lands for energy development and no siting policy in place for such proposals    The Corps  review process ended in a draft environmental statement that the Environmental Protection Agency rated inadequate and the US Geological Survey described as incomplete  and too often inaccurate  and or misleading     The US Commission on Ocean Policy  in its September 2004 report to Congress and the President  described the Corps  review process as inadequate as well  and said that it stands  in stark contrast with the well established DOI regulatory program for onshore wind development  and in the marine setting  the robust regulatory program developed under OCSLA  the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act      This inadequate process    and EMI s incomplete  inaccurate and misleading draft environmental impact statement are plainly insufficient grounds on which to allow EMI to seek approval before Interior even creates the rules that should apply to everyone     Third  EMI claims that they have invested nearly  25 million in this project  and it would be unfair to force them to follow the rules    This argument reveals just how far EMI will go in insisting that its financial interests come before the public interest      The fact is that EMI will be eligible for more than  28 million in federal wind energy tax credits in its first year  That s more than the entire amount they claim to have invested so far     They ll be eligible for those same credits for each of the first ten years of the project s operation    for a total of  280 million in federal taxpayer subsidies     The project will also be eligible for between  37 million and  82 million in renewable energy electricity price support subsidies each year from the ratepayers through Massachusetts renewable energy certificate trading program    In addition  this massive project will be eligible for 5 year accelerated depreciation  which means the developer can write off the cost of this  900  million project on their federal taxes in just five years  even though the project may be in use for at least 20 years     Between the federal tax credits  the Massachusetts benefits and accelerated depreciation  this project may cost taxpayers and ratepayers more than  1 billion    There s no problem with a profit motive  But a corporation that wants to develop federal lands for profit should expect to comply with the same rules as every other developer  And they should not have the gall to complain when their sweetheart deal receives the scrutiny it deserves  EMI is entitled to seek profits  but we are required to put the public interest first     The real reason EMI can t afford to be governed by the same rules as every other offshore developer is that there are serious doubts as to whether this project would survive a careful and systematic review  In particular  this project has the potential to cause havoc with the fisheries  environment  marine navigation  and aviation in Nantucket Sound    all of which are essential to the economic well being of Cape Cod and the islands of Martha s Vineyard and Nantucket    Consideration of Massachusetts  interests here must begin with the basic fact that EMI chose a site that rests on a doughnut hole of federal jurisdiction completely surrounded by waters under the control of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts     Massachusetts is one of only two states in the country    Alaska is the other    with such a unique geography  In fact  Congress has already acknowledged that Massachusetts has an interest in these waters    the Magnuson Stevens Act gave Massachusetts jurisdiction over fisheries in these waters     Massachusetts has a long history of working to protect all of Nantucket Sound      From the first colonists in the 1620 s  Massachusetts has exercised stewardship over the waters of Nantucket Sound  In 1691  a charter was granted by the English monarchs William and Mary to the colonists of Massachusetts that included the waters of Nantucket Sound    When the Revolutionary War was won  the First Congress established a customs enforcement system in 1789 that expressly included  in the definition of the district of Edgartown    all the waters and shores within the county that held Martha s Vineyard  including Nantucket Sound    In 1970  in recognition of mounting development pressures on critical offshore marine resources  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts passed the Massachusetts Ocean Sanctuary Act    This legislation created the Cape and Islands Ocean Sanctuary granting heightened protections to the Sound and surrounding waters    In particular  Massachusetts prohibited projects that    like Cape Wind    would result in the construction or operation of offshore or floating energy generating stations     Nantucket Sound lost its state ocean sanctuary protections only after a bitter and protracted legal battle settled by the US Supreme Court in 1986    This created the hole in the middle of the state s protected waters that Cape Wind seeks to exploit today     To ensure that Nantucket Sound would not exploited by destructive development even if this doughnut hole were created  Massachusetts nominated Nantucket Sound for National Marine Sanctuary status and protections in 1980  Nantucket Sound was placed on the National Marine Sanctuary Site Evaluation List today  If National Marine Sanctuary status had been finalized  this project could not be built here  because the Energy Policy Act specifically prohibits construction of such projects in our 14 National Marine Sanctuaries     I think we should protect Monterey Bay in California  the Florida Keys  the Olympic Coast off Washington  the Monitor off Newport News  and the Northwest Hawaiian Islands    and I m not ashamed to say that Nantucket Sound deserves to be in that company    It is simply not appropriate to allow this proposal to go forward while Nantucket Sound remains on the Site Evaluation List      I ve been working my entire career to preserve and protect Massachusetts critical resources    from proposing the Nantucket Sound Island Trust  blocking drilling on Georges Bank  protecting the Cape Cod National Seashore  and championing the Stellwagen National Marine Sanctuary off the coast of Boston    And I don t fault Governor Jeb Bush  who was trying to do that same thing for Florida when he worked with the White House to block drilling 100 miles off Florida s coasts     The difficulty confronting Massachusetts with this project is that it s going to be nearly impossible to protect the integrity of the Cape and Islands Ocean Sanctuary  if Cape Wind keeps its sweetheart deal    In a recent meeting with editorial writers at the Cape Cod Times  Governor Romney commented on this very situation     It s absolutely outrageous that the federal government would allow a wind farm in an area completely surrounded by Ocean Sanctuary waters the state has fought to preserve and protect     Governor Romney asked  How could you do this to us    One reason Massachusetts needs a voice here is because the project threatens the livelihoods of Massachusetts  fishermen  Nantucket Sound has accounted for annual catches of over a million pounds of squid and fish  Nearly 50 to 60 percent of that catch is from the portion of the Nantucket Sound where EMI wants to place massive wind turbines     That is why the Massachusetts Fishermen s Partnership strongly opposes the Cape Wind project  and why the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries has stated that it remains greatly concerned that this project may have substantial       impacts to fisheries resources  habitat and harvest activities in Nantucket Sound    This project also has serious implications for the safety of navigation in and around Nantucket Sound    In its criticism of the Army Corps  draft environmental impact statement of the Cape Wind project  the Coast Guard noted that the report failed to consider a series of studies in Great Britain  which    unlike the United States    has extensive experience with offshore wind energy projects     These British studies raised serious issues concerning the impact of wind turbines on radar and navigation  The Great Britain site has only 30 towers standing 220 feet tall in an area of just 3 8 square miles  The Cape Wind project has four times as many towers  that are twice as tall  and cover over six times the area     The British reports found that Small vessels  buoys  etc  might not be detectable within or close to the wind farm  that the wind turbine generators blind and shadow areas  and that there was an inability to effect surface rescues within the wind farm in restricted visibility    Based on these studies  Britain now recommends a 1 5 nautical mile buffer between shipping channels and wind turbines  unless significant navigation control systems exist in the area  The Cape Wind project would be just a fifth of a mile from established shipping channels and only three quarters of a mile from established ferry routes    These concerns have been emphasized by the Passenger Vessel Association  the nation s largest trade association for US flagged vessel operators  which passed a unanimous resolution on April 25th  stating     The Passenger Vessel Association opposes the construction of a proposed offshore wind energy facility in Nantucket Sound  Massachusetts  because of its hazardous impact on navigation and safety of passengers      The location of 130 wind towers in close proximity to existing ferry routes to the islands of Nantucket and Martha s Vineyard poses unacceptable safety risks  including possible collision and interferences with navigational radar    If there were an accident involving a ferry  the wind energy project could turn it into a tragedy      Retired US Coast Guard Lt  Cmdr  William H  Rypka  a former Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter pilot who s performed numerous searches in this very area has written that the proposed wind farm is an extreme hazard to navigation that the potential for a collision with the windmills is huge     He wrote that he s performed helicopter searches at 100 feet above sea level  which will not be possible in the 24 square mile area once the 417 foot tall towers go up    There are similar concerns with the effect of the wind energy project on the safety of air travel  Studies by the British Ministry of Defence have prompted the FAA to begin looking into the radar effects of large scale wind turbines in close proximity to airports  In March  the FAA designated a wind energy project in Wisconsin a hazard to aviation  and informed Congressman William Delahunt that recent briefings with British Ministry of Defence representatives seem to confirm our concern of potential interference from wind turbines to our own traffic control radar systems    In a series of three studies published in 2005  the Royal Air Force found ample reason to believe that wind turbines affected radar performance as much as 24 000 feet above the wind farms  As a result of these British studies  Congress has asked the Department of Defense to lead an investigation into the possible effects of wind turbines on the nation s 59 different defensive radar systems  That investigation is underway    This kind of aviation radar interference is an enormous public safety concern for the Cape and Islands  which rely heavily on air and sea travel  Three major airports surround the project site  and more 400 000 flights a year criss cross the airspace over the proposed project site  This airspace is overseen by the Cape Cod Terminal Radar Approach Control located at Otis Air National Guard Base     Mike Suriano  the National Air Traffic Controllers Association Facility Representative at Cape Approach Control wrote the Army Corps in 2004 opposing the siting of this project  In his letter  Suriano wrote if you were to ask me  where is the worst place to construct a hazard to aviation and jeopardize safety in the Cape and Islands airspace  I couldn t have picked a better spot          Placing 170 of these wind driven turbines in this area  in our opinion  is a disaster waiting to happen    A disaster waiting to happen  And it doesn t have to happen if we do the right thing  In closing  I emphasize that this issue is not about wind energy  I strongly support wind energy  and Congress has passed a law that will establish a thoughtful and comprehensive process that will allow offshore wind farms to go forward whenever and wherever they are in the public interest  The sole question raised by Section 414 of the Coast Guard bill is whether a private developer will be allowed to win approval to build the world s largest offshore wind energy project before that thoughtful and careful process has been finalized  I believe we need to take a stand against the sweetheart deal obtained by EMI  and to place the final decision on the wisdom of this project into the hands of the Coast Guard and the State of Massachusetts  which will have to live with this project for decades to come  FACT SHEET    Concerns with Cape Wind Proposal Senator Kennedy has many concerns regarding the proposed Cape Wind project  which if permitted  would be the world s largest offshore wind energy facility  The Senator is concerned that Cape Wind s project will undermine the more than 30 year effort to protect the ecology of the Sound and will jeopardize the public interest  the environment and the safety of users of the Sound  The inadequate review the proposal has received    first  through the U S  Army Corps  insufficient environmental review  and second  through special interest exemptions Cape Wind enjoys under the Energy Policy Act of 2005    exacerbate the Senator s concerns  leading him to oppose the project     A  The Inadequacy of the Review Section 388 of the Energy Policy Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior  through the Minerals Management Service  to implement the offshore alternative energy program  Although the MMS is diligently establishing a framework for reviewing offshore energy projects  Cape Wind s  and LIPA s  proposed project will not undergo the same review required of all other projects because of the bill s special interest provisions  1  Special Review Process for Cape Wind Section 388 exempts Cape Wind from submitting any documents previously submitted to any federal agency before the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005  MMS has interpreted this provision to allow Cape Wind and LIPA to initiate the MMS review process before any other developer and before MMS has developed regulations to implement its offshore program and review processes  Thus  Cape Wind s project will be reviewed before a programmatic environmental review is conducted  before MMS can determine which areas are closed to development  before review standards are established  and before the cumulative impacts of multiple developments are assessed  In addition  Cape Wind has asserted that MMS should rely on the environmental impact statement prepared for the Corps for MMS s review  The Corps conducted its review under the century old 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act  which is not designed to permit massive offshore energy projects  but instead commonplace obstructions to navigation such as docks and bridges  As noted by the U S  Commission on Ocean Policy  the Corps  process stood        in stark contrast the well established DOI regulatory program for onshore wind energy development  and in the marine setting  the robust regulatory program developed under the OCSLA  Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Act   Using the Section 10 process as the primary regulatory vehicle for offshore wind energy development is inadequate         I t lacks the management comprehensiveness that is needed to take into account a broad range of issues  including other ocean uses in the proposed area and the consideration of a coherent policy and process to guide offshore management  It is therefore not surprising that the environmental review prepared by the Corps was declared by the EPA to be Category 3 Inadequate  Nonetheless  Cape Wind continues to argue that it is sufficient for MMS s review  and MMS is using that review as the basis for its own analysis  2  Competitive Bidding Provision Cape Wind  under Section 388  is also exempt from undergoing the competitive bidding process that will apply to all other offshore alternative energy developers  Thus  if approved  Cape Wind it will have acquired development rights to an immensely valuable and ecologically fragile area of the OCS  without having to compete with any other company for those rights  Given that Cape Wind also stands to enjoy approximately  28 million per year in federal subsidies and another  37 to  82 million in state renewable price supports  obtaining rights to Nantucket Sound without undergoing competitive bidding is a huge windfall for Cape Wind  The approximate 10 cents per household per month benefit that New Englanders are expected to enjoy as a result of Cape Wind s project does not compensate for the heavily subsidized profits Cape Wind will reap    B  The Ecological Values of the Sound 1  Sanctuary Status Nantucket Sound is a unique resource that the Commonwealth has sought to protect for more than 30 years  In 1970  Massachusetts passed the Massachusetts Ocean Sanctuaries Act and designated all of the Sound as part of the Cape and Islands Ocean Sanctuary  The Act protects the ecology of the Sound by barring energy development in sanctuary waters  Although the Commonwealth intended to include the entirety of the Sound as an ocean sanctuary  the center of the Sound was declared federal waters after a long  hard fought legal battle against the United States  While this legal battle was waging  the Commonwealth sought additional federal protection for the Sound by applying to have it declared a National Marine Sanctuary in 1980  It remains on the National Marine Sanctuary Site Evaluation List to today  As Cape Wind has long known  its project would be barred in state waters under a 30 year old law  The only reason that the project is even remotely possible is because the federal government claimed the center of the Sound as its own  Cape Wind s project is no less harmful simply because it plans to pitch the site just two miles outside of the Commonwealth s reach  2  Fishing Interests For area fishermen  the effects of this project may be particularly devastating  According the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries  1 162 529 pounds of squid and fish were harvested in 2000 by more than 123 commercial vessels working in Nantucket Sound  Nearly 50 to 60 percent of their catch is from the shallow Horseshoe Shoal area    the site of the proposed wind farm  If Cape Wind develops the property  these fishermen will likely no longer be able to fish in these waters because they may not be able to deploy their fishing gear in the midst of the 130 tower wind facility that may take up one third of the existing footprint area of the Horseshoe Shoal fishing grounds  In addition  there is serious concern that the construction of these towers will have permanent effects on critical shallow fish habitats  The project will require laying more than 100 miles of cable by plowing into the seabed  driving the bases of its 130 turbines deep into the seabed  and performing dredging in areas too shallow to currently accommodate the work boats needed for construction of the turbines  Destruction of fish habitat is unavoidable  C  Danger to the Public Safety 1  Maritime Concerns and Navigational Risks The project is proposed directly adjacent to a major shipping lane and a major passenger ferry route in the midst of one of the most heavily trafficked maritime environments in the country  Each year  nearly 3 million people travel through the area by ferry or private vessel  The proposed site is too close to shipping channels to be safe  with only a 1 200 ft separation from established shipping channels and a 4 500 foot separation from established ferry routes  not enough time is available to respond to a structure or possibly to avoid another vessel  Vessels traveling at just 6 nautical miles per hour will encounter a new 417 foot spinning turbine every 3 minutes  vessels traveling 20 nautical miles per hour will encounter a turbine approximately every 50 seconds  Factoring in that Nantucket Sound often experiences dense fog causing zero visibility conditions  John T  Griffin  Vice Chairman of the Barnstable Airport Commission  and Edward Barrett  of the Massachusetts Fishermen s Partnership  recently wrote that the Cape Wind proposal was utter recklessness  In Great Britain  research into wind farms and their effect on radar and collision avoidance systems has led the government to recommend a minimum separation distance between wind turbines and shipping lanes of 1 5 nautical miles  unless significant vessel navigation control systems exist in the area  The British Chamber of Shipping advocates the adoption of a precautionary separation zone of at least two nautical miles from recognized shipping lanes  Cape Wind has proposed far less  The danger to the public is real and substantial  2  Aviation Defense Implications The project previously received preliminary approval from the Federal Aviation Administration  but in recent months FAA has decided to take a more comprehensive look at the potential impacts on large scale wind turbines  FAA Administrator Marion Blakey has stated that after being briefed on several British Ministry of Defence studies  the British experience seems to confirm our concern of potential interference from wind turbines to our own air traffic control systems  This is an enormous concern for the Cape and Islands communities which rely heavily on air travel  Three airports operate within miles of the proposed Cape Wind project  and approximately 400 000 planes traverse the airspace over the proposed site each year  In addition  Otis Air Force Base and the Coast Guard s Air Station Cape Cod are located in close proximity to the site  Planes from Otis were the first in the air in response to the attacks of 9 11  Also located on Cape Cod is the Pentagon s PAVE PAWS radar system  which tracks intercontinental ballistic missiles and is one of only two such systems in the country   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
