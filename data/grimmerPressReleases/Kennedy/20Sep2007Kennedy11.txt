         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     This needed bill is a significant step toward modernizing our antitrust laws  A quarter century ago  bipartisan members of Congress came together to deregulate the airline and trucking industries  The result was good for consumers  good for employers and employees  and good for the economy  The time has come to ask the same level of competitiveness from the railroad industry     There are real costs to our current system of special railroad exemptions from antitrust rules and the special oversight process of the Surface Transportation Board  Studies have clearly shown that these policies have led to industry consolidation  anticompetitive practices  and higher prices  Four Class I railroadstwo in the East  and two in the Westnow provide more than 90 percent of the nations rail transportation  Many industries are served by only one carrier and face ever increasing rates     This legislation will ensure that the antitrust laws fully cover railroads just as they cover other industries  It will give more oversight power to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission  And it will expand the powers of State Attorneys General and private parties to bring actions for damages and injunctions  Leading antitrust scholars tell us that these reforms are long overdue     Many Americans will gain from this legislation  Farmers  manufacturers  and others with large amounts of rail shipping will be able to deliver their products at lower cost  Consumers will benefit from reduced prices  Electricity is just one of the many everyday items that will become more affordable  Railroad workers will gain greater bargaining power  and layoff generating mergers will become less likely  Its remarkable that so many different types of stakeholders have expressed support for this bill     The only group that stands to lose is the major railroad companies  Understandably  they do not want to give up the monopolies they currently enjoy  This legislation is not intended to hurt railroads  but to see that they play by the normal rules of our market economy  There is nothing in this legislation that will threaten the financial viability of the industry  Obviously  the many companies that rely on railroads have a strong interest in maintaining a healthy rail industry     This bill makes sense as public policy  It applies time tested principles of regulation to ensure that the railroad marketplace will be fair  open  and competitive  It is good for consumers  good for workers  good for producers  and good for our national prosperity  The vast majority of Americans support this bill  and the Senate should too
