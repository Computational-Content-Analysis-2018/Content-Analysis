         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FACT SHEETS INCLUDED  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on President Bushs budget This first budget that the President has presented to a Democratic Congress reveals the fundamental difference in priorities of this Administration and Congress  Budgets are moral documents and reflective of what we believe is important for our nation  Sadly  the President missed an important opportunity today to put forward a budget that demonstrated that he listened to the American people last November  This budget would continue us down the wrong path  but fortunately the new congress is determined to change course  and will  For the war in Iraq  the President is asking for nearly  270 billion for this year and next  yet has failed to define the mission or listen to widespread bipartisan opposition to his plan to escalate the war  On health care  rather than trying to solve the crisis by lowering costs and covering more people  the Presidents plan will make the crisis worse by raising costs and failing to cover those who need it most     our nations children The Presidents proposal to cut outrageous lender subsidies and redirect those funds into a long overdue increase in the Pell Grant shows how a Democratic Congress is changing the nations priorities  But as we work to reauthorize the landmark No Child Left Behind Act this year  I am particularly disappointed that the President has once again proposed inadequate funding for the laws important reforms and that he pays for his modest increases through cuts to other education programs In this age of economic insecurity  we need a budget that prioritizes working families  Just as the Bush economy has left so many working families struggling to get by  the Bush budget would take away their opportunities for the future Thirty seven million Americans live in poverty today  including almost 13 million children  No just society should tolerate this level of poverty  particularly here in the richest nation on the planet  The Presidents budget is not anti povertyit is anti poor Fact sheets on the effects of President Bushs budget are below BUSH EDUCATION BUDGET MIXED BAG FOR AMERICAS FAMILIESProposes Mandatory Pell Grant Increase to  4 600  Paid for by Lender ReformsBut Proposes  1 5 Billion Cut in Discretionary Education FundingSenator Edward Kennedy Today more than ever  a quality education is the gateway to achieving the American dream  It is the best guarantee of equal opportunity for all our people  good citizenship  and an economy capable of mastering modern global challenges  The Presidents proposal to cut outrageous lender subsidies and redirect those funds into a long overdue increase in the Pell Grant shows how a Democratic Congress is changing the nations priorities  For the past four years of Republican control  Congress failed to hold the President accountable for his broken promise to increase Pell grants  I hope the President will finally deliver on his campaign promise and provide real help for students and families I am disappointed that the President proposes no new investment to strengthen our nations public schools  His budget represents a  1 5 billion cut below the joint funding resolution pending in Congress  As we work to reauthorize the landmark No Child Left Behind Act this year  I am particularly concerned that the President has once again proposed inadequate funding for the laws important reforms  He used the same old tactics of robbing other education priorities to pay for his modest increases for school reform  Our schools and children deserve more than accounting gimmicks  they need new resources to make progress on reform  Our nations future and the future of our children depend on our strengthening these school reform and making them work better for all schools  But Democrats and Republicans in Congress should reject the Presidents NCLB budget proposal and provide new resources to carry out the law  President Bushs Fiscal Year 2008 budget proposes  56 billion in discretionary education funding   1 5 billion less than the joint funding resolution pending in Congress  or a 2 6  cut from the FY 2007 level of  57 5 billion  His budget proposal  Underfunds the No Child Left Behind Act by  14 8 billion  for a cumulative shortfall of  70 9 billion since enactment of the law o Under the Presidents budget  NCLB funding would rise by a net  993 million  for a total of  24 6 billion  but this increase is offset by cuts to other education programs o Increases funding for Title I grants to LEAs by  1 1 billion  an increase intended to boost funding for high schools  for a total of  13 9 billiono Despite the increase  the Title I shortfall from last years authorized level of  25 billion would be  11 1 billion  and the cumulative shortfall since enactment would rise to  54 7 billiono Leaves behind 3 2 million children who could be fully served by Title I if the program were funded at the level promised last year by NCLB  In Massachusetts  51 439 children would be left behind  o Flat funds after school programs at  981 million   1 5 billion below the  2 5 billion promised in the law  leaving behind 2 million students nationwide  In Massachusetts  28 300 would be left behind Provides  300 million for two new voucher programs   250 million for students in schools identified for restructuring under NCLB  and  50 million for a new competitive grant voucher program o After years of being starved of the school improvement grants they were promised  public schools would receive  500 million in School Improvement Grants to help them meet the goals of NCLB and avoid the need for restructuring  These grants are funded for the first time in the FY 2007 joint funding resolution at  125 million  Cuts funding for IDEA by  200 million compared to joint funding resolution  retreating on the governments commitment to students with disabilities  by providing a smaller share of States total costs for special education for the third year in a row o IDEA funding would decrease by  291 million  for a total of  10 5 billiono This would provide just 16 5  of the average per pupil cost  the lowest percentage level of support since FY 2002  down from 17 2  in FY 2007  and less than half of the federal governments commitment to fund 40 percent of the excess costs associated with educating students with disabilities  o The proposed level of  10 5 billion falls  8 7 billion short of the  19 2 billion authorized for FY 2008 when the law was reauthorized in 2004  The cumulative shortfall since the President signed the Act is  20 7 billion o In addition  the President plans to take administrative action to reduce Medicaid based reimbursements related to services for special education students by  615 million in FY 2008 and  3 645 billion over the next 5 years  Together with the proposed cut in IDEA state grants  this amounts to more than  900 million less in FY 2008 for schools to serve students with disabilities Cuts  687 million from in career and technical education programs despite the fact that Congress reauthorized and strengthened these programs last year and the President signed the reauthorization bill into law o Most states would see their funding reduced by almost half  and 5 million secondary students and 3 million postsecondary students participating in career and technical education programs  as well as more than 2 million students enrolled in Tech Prep programs  could see their courses reduced or eliminatedo Massachusetts would receive only  10 1 million  a cut of  9 9 million from the  20 million the Commonwealth is estimated to receive in 2007 Eliminates the Perkins Loan program  which over 500 000 students depend on each year President Bushs modest proposed increases in funding for the No Child Left Behind Act and a  300 million voucher program are more than offset by the elimination of 44 programs   2 2 billion   including Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants  campus based aid   Education Technology state grants  Even Start  Smaller Learning Communities  Arts in Education  and School Counseling  He also proposes large cuts to numerous other programs including Safe and Drug Free Schools state grants  Once again robbing Peter to pay Paul The Presidents proposal to cut outrageous lender subsidies and redirect those funds into a long overdue increase in the Pell Grant shows how a Democratic Congress is changing the nations priorities on student aid  However  we should reject his proposal to cut programs like SEOG and the Perkins Loan program  which low income students depend on  to help offset this increase  His budget proposal  Increases the Pell Grant  with mandatory funding  to  4 600 in FY 2008  a  290 increase over the  4 310 maximum grant in the joint funding resolution  and to  5 400 by 2012  Increases federal loan limits for college juniors and seniors by  2 000  Higher Education Reconciliation Act provided this increase for freshman  sophomore and graduate students  Increases funding for the Academic Competitiveness Grant program  Offsets the cost of the above proposals by  Cutting excessive lender special allowance payments by 50 basis points  five times the cut recently passed by the House in H R  5   Five Year Savings    12 4 billion Reducing guaranty agency collection allowance from 23  to equal the fee paid to collection agencies competitively contracted by the government loan program  approximately 16   passed by the House in H R  5   Five Year Savings    2 3 billion  Reducing lender default insurance rate from 97  to 95   passed by the House in H R  5   Five Year Savings    1 6 billion Increasing lender origination fee for consolidation loans from 0 5  to 1   House passed similar increase in lender origination fee for all loans in H R  5   Five Year Savings    850 million  Changing guaranty agency account maintenance fees to a unit cost basis  Five Year Savings   1 6 billion Recalling Perkins loans revolving funds from schools  which over 500 000 students depend on each year  Five Year Savings    3 2 billion  Eliminating the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program   771 million  to cover the increase in base discretionary funding for the Pell GrantTHE BUDGET HAS THE WRONG PRIORITIES ON HEALTH CARERather than trying to solve our health care crisis by lowering costs and covering more people  the Presidents plan will make the crisis worse by raising costs and failing to cover those who need it most     our nations children   Senator Edward M  KennedyMedicare for AllThe real solution to the health care crisis is to make Medicare available to every American who wants to enroll in it  Administrative costs are low  patient satisfaction is high  and patients have the right to choose any doctor and hospital they think is best  Senator Kennedy has introduced legislation to extend Medicare to all Americans  Those who prefer private insurance can choose any plan offered to members of Congress and the President  To ease the transition  Medicare for All will be phased in by age group  States around the nation are responding to the call for universal coverage  and Congress should encourage those efforts when they lead to quality  affordable care The Presidents BudgetCoverageThe budget includes a proposal to tax health care benefits provided by employers  the core of our health care system  then replace this assured coverage with a tax deduction that favors the wealthiest Americans  This is the reverse of the approach taken as part of successful reforms in Massachusetts and proposals in other states such as California  which have all directed the greatest assistance to those with the greatest financial need  The Presidents Budget would impose damaging cuts in important health programs  Childrens Health  The Childrens Health Insurance Program has been hugely successful in assuring health care for millions of lower income children  yet the budget fails to support this essential initiative  CHIP is facing a crisis  Unless new resources are provided  1 5 million children will lose the good coverage that they already have  The budget provides at least  8 billion less than is needed just to maintain current services  and would force children to lose the good coverage they already have  Medicare  The budget imposes cuts of  66 billion for Medicare over 5 years and  252 billion over 10 years  Major reductions are proposed in payments to doctors  hospitals  nursing homes  and home health agencies  Under the budget proposal  more and more Americans will be required to pay higher premiums for Medicare  The budget will impact Massachusettss hospitals by cutting  28 million in 2008 and  424 million over 5 years Public Health Priorities  The budget fails to respect the nations commitment to medical progress by cutting the NIH budget and slashing important public health programs  such as health professions training and preventive health care programs  THE BUSH BUDGET SHOULD PRIORITIZEWORKING FAMILIESIn this age of economic insecurity  we need a budget that prioritizes working families  Just as the Bush economy has left so many working families struggling to get by  the Bush budget would take away their opportunities for the future   Senator Edward M  KennedyThe Presidents budget ignores the needs of American workers Job training  Our workforce needs greater skills and better education to be competitive in the global economy  This starts with helping the workers that are losing their jobs today  In Massachusetts  there are more than 25 000 workers on waiting lists for job training slots  But the Presidents budget cuts funding for training and employment services by  1 billion  to  4 5 billion  a decrease of 19 percent  This includes   Requiring that 75  of all federal job training funds to be used for Career Advancement Accounts that would require workers to pay for job training that is currently offered for free   Combining adult worker  dislocated worker and youth funding under the Workforce Investment Act  WIA  and Employment Service  ES  programs into a single block grant  eliminating discrete programs that provide vital services to groups with special needs  like unemployed youth and Native Americans   Rescinding  335 million in state and local job training funds that the Administration claims is unexpended  even though state and local workforce agencies have obligated these funds to provide job training in the future   Cuts to the Job Corps program of  55 million  or 3 5 percent  A cut of  133 million  or 28 percent  to the Community Services Employment Program for Older Americans  which could reduce the number of employment opportunities for more than 25 000 low income older Americans  Eliminating the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker program  which helps farmworkers and their families achieve economic self sufficiency by offering supportive services and helping them to acquire new skills for jobs offering better pay Unemployment Insurance  Workers that have lost their jobs are finding it harder than ever to find new employment  One in every five unemployed workers  more than one million Americans  has been jobless for more than half a year  One in four workers in Massachusetts has been unemployed for 15 weeks or longer  There are almost twice as many unemployed workers as available jobs  Yet the Presidents budget  Cuts State Employment Service grants  used for programs that help workers find jobs  by  27 million Trade Adjustment Assistance  The Presidents Budget proposes to decrease funding for benefits  and training programs under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program  assuming that fewer workers will take advantage the program next year  However  since the President took office  increasing numbers of workers have used this critical program  which provides income support benefits and job training assistance to workers that lose their jobs because of trade  The number of new recipients of income support assistance has increased by 75  since Bush took office  and the number of new recipients of training services has increased by 52  in the same time period  Many states already run out of TAA funds before the end of the year  denying workers benefits to which they are lawfully entitled  The Presidents cuts will only exacerbate this problem Retirement Security  Instead of increasing retirement security for working Americans  the Administration has again proposed the creation of Lifetime Savings Accounts and Retirement Savings Accounts to allow more tax free savings for the wealthy  This approach to retirement security does nothing to ease the retirement crisis for most middle and low income families  who would not be able to benefit from such a plan  The Administrations plan also jeopardizes the small business pension plan system by eliminating incentives employers have to offer a pension  Employees of small businesses thus risk losing their pensions completely Preserving Workplace Rights  America remains competitive when we protect our most valuable asset  our workers  Yet  the Bush administration is ready to surrender workers basic rights and join the race to the bottom  The Presidents budget cuts inadequately funds the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  which enforces rights against discrimination in the workplace  and the National Labor Relations Board  which enforces the right of workers to organize and have a voice in the workplace  Worker Safety and Health  Repeated mine safety disasters last year showed us all too clearly the dangers of racing to the bottom by sacrificing safety  However  the Presidents budget does not demonstrate commitment to the safety of American workers   Since President Bush took office  he has repeatedly tried to slash money to train workers in safety practices and equipment  This budget again seeks to eliminate OSHA funds for worker safety and health training   Under President Bush  dozens of vital safety standards  including standards to require employers to pay for Personal Protective Equipment  and standards setting new Permissible Exposure Limits for chemicals and other toxic substances have languished without action for years  This budget provides insufficient funds to finalize and enforce these protective rules  Ending Abusive International Labor Practices  If American workers are going to compete on a level playing field in the global economy  we must work to raise labor standards around the world  The vital first step is to end abusive labor practices like child labor  Yet the Presidents Budget drastically cuts funding for the International Labor Affairs Bureaus global efforts to combat child labor by  58 4 million THE BUSH BUDGET SHOULD SUPPORT EFFECTIVE ANTI POVERTY PROGRAMSThirty seven million Americans live in poverty today  including almost 13 million children  No just society should tolerate this level of poverty  particularly here in the richest nation on the planet  The Presidents budget is not anti povertyit is anti poor   Senator Edward M  KennedyThe Presidents budget  Cuts the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   LIHEAP provides money to low income families who cant afford the steep cost of home heating  The Presidents FY08 Budget requests  1 5 billion for formula funds and  282 million for contingency funds  for a total of  1 782 billion for LIHEAP  This funding level is a 17  cut from the FY06 enacted amount of  2 161 billion  If you factor in the additional   1billion from the Budget Reconciliation Act it is a 53  cut  The full year Continuing Resolution for FY07 which passed the House last week includes  2 161billion for LIHEAP   1 98 billion for formula and  181 17 million for contingency  The Presidents budget would mean a  20 million cut for Massachusetts which would receive only  61 7 million as opposed to the  82 million it received in FY06  and the  81 million it is slotted to receive under the House passed Continuing Resolution for FY07   Eliminates the Community Services Block Grant which provides funding for over 1 000 community action agencies that fight poverty in low income communities  Massachusetts stands to loose over  15 million in FY 2008  Community Action Agencies across the country will be forced to limit the programs they offer and fire essential staff   Cuts the Social Services Block Grant by  500 000  The Social Services Block Grant funds programs for domestic violence  meals on wheels  child welfare services  services for disabled children and adults  child care  long term care  and many other services  Under the Presidents plan Massachusetts would loose almost  11 million    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
