         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  DC Senator Kennedy sent the following letter to Secretary Rumsfeld regarding his decision to decision to limit access to the UN Special Rapporteurs who sought to meet with detainees at Guantanamo Bay and his dismissive comments yesterday about the detainees at Guantanamo Bay    PDF versions of the letter are available upon request    November 1  2005   The Honorable Donald Rumsfeld Secretary of Defense 3E880 The Pentagon Washington  DC 20301   Dear Secretary Rumsfeld    I strongly oppose the Administration s decision to limit access to the UN Special Rapporteurs who sought to meet with detainees at Guantanamo Bay  and urge you to reconsider your support for it  The decision clearly jeopardizes America s leadership in enforcing basic standards of human rights against other countries  and undermines our efforts to persuade other nations to accept international inspectors to ensure compliance with other international agreements    The clear implication of the decision is that America has something to hide  An inspection by the UN group could demonstrate to the world our willingness to live by our principles  and could be a major step to improving America s standing in the eyes of the world     I am appalled as well by your cavalier and dismissive comments yesterday about the detainees at Guantanamo Bay  Such comments only serve to demonstrate the administration s continuing misjudgment of the gravity of the detainee situation and its harmful effect on America s standing in the world  The prolonged hunger strikes cannot be dismissed as simply a diet     America has long been a beacon of human rights and democracy in the world and our actions speak louder than our words  In the first Gulf War  our compliance with the Geneva Conventionsthe international gold standard for human rightswas called the best of any nation in any conflict in the history of the Conventions by the International Committee of the Red Cross  the organization charged with overseeing compliance with the conventions  but our treatment of detainees at Guantanamo and other prisons and detention centers has fallen far short of that standard     The detainees at Guantanamo have been held more than three years  without charge and without trial  The Department s continuing refusal to abide by basic standards of decency has resulted in predictable difficulties posed by indefinite detention  The longer the detainees are subjected to imprisonment without an end  the more we erode our system of liberty that has been a model for the rest of the world the more difficult it becomes for us to build and maintain a coalition to win the war on terror    The mistreatment of detainees also makes it far more difficult for us to guarantee the protections of the Geneva Conventions for our military if they are captured  and degrades the international consensus against such abuse     Sincerely    Edward M  Kennedy   John D  Rockefeller IV  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
