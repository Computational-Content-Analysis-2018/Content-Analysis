         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I commend our Chairman  Senator Enzi  for holding this important hearing on the issues we all must face as we consider our own lives  and the lives of those we love  This is a complex issue and I appreciate the responsible way he has approached this hearing    There are few things in life that tear at our hearts more than the thought of a beloved mother or father  spouse or child lying in a hospital bed after a serious injury or a major illness  In those painful circumstances  we may face the terrible choice of continuing treatment or allowing a loved one to pass away in dignity    There are few moments that test our faith  our humanity and our love more than that choice  The decision is made more difficult when patients have not left clear instructions on what they would want    All of us who followed the tragedy of Terri Schiavo have asked ourselves what we would do if she were part of our family  In addressing this question honestly  we may come to different judgments  But one thing is sure  families facing these painful decisions deserve better than political theatrics from the United States Congress  Republican leaders abused their positions of power to play politics with Terri Schiavo s life    These are solemn family decisions   They are times for deep prayer and wise counsel  not craven politics    Yet  Republicans sought to legislate based on a five year old videotape  They ignored the detailed findings of the neurologists who had extensively examined Ms  Schiavo in person  numerous experts  five different courts  and three legal guardians    one of whom was appointed by Governor Jeb Bush himself    And House Republican Leader Tom DeLay has even threatened the judges who acted in this case  just as extremists were threatening their lives  That s reckless and irresponsible  Now the Senator from Texas has joined the Tom DeLay chorus in tearing down our independent judiciary  Apparently  it s not enough for Republicans to rule the White House and the Congress  They want power over the independent judiciary  too  The checks and balances so vital to our democracy are for them merely an inconvenience    We owe it to our citizens to approach this issue compassionately  thoughtfully  and responsibly  No injury is so profound or disability so severe that we should diminish the fundamental dignity of a human being  There are hundreds of families every day who face the same decision as the Schindlers and the Schiavos  In fact  in almost half the cases of deaths in intensive care units involving decisions to end treatment  there is disagreement in the family  The role of Congress cannot be to intervene and interfere with their private lives in each and every case  Instead  our role in Congress should be to support families as they make end of life decisions    And if there is a dispute  it should be settled by impartial judges  not by a show of hands in the United States Congress    There is much we can do  however  to support families in this situation  And I look forward to hearing the ideas of our witnesses today    Of first importance is making certain that care is available for those with serious illnesses and disabilities  so that they can be assured of treatment and rehabilitation  Families facing end of life decisions need to know that this is the case    Shamefully  in the same month that Congress intervened in the case of Terri Schiavo  the House of Representatives approved a budget that would deny care to thousands of Americans who  like Terri Schiavo  rely on Medicaid for their health and hope     Many of our colleagues who led the effort to intervene are also urging Congress to impose arbitrary caps on the very kinds of medical malpractice awards that sustained her life    Clearly  we need to reverse the life threatening cuts in the President s budget and reject the arbitrary malpractice caps that jeopardize the most seriously injured patients  We should also consider three additional actions    In the short term  we need to improve ethical guidance to hospitals  doctors  and families on end of life care  Medical progress is constantly expanding the frontiers of medicine in sustaining life and saving lives  and our ethical guidelines must keep pace with these developments     We also know that needless additional anguish and heartbreak can be avoided if persons have shared clear and thoughtful instructions on their goals for medical care with those closest to them  if they have appointed a trusted person to speak for them  and if they have given their loved ones a chance to air their concerns     In addition  Congress must complete the long awaited legislation to provide affordable health insurance to families with disabled children  Senator Grassley and I introduced the Family Opportunity Act 5 years ago  It has 60 cosponsors  Yet  the Congressional leadership has delayed its enactment into law  The bill would be a lifeline to families unable to afford health coverage for their disabled children  some of whom today actually are forced to give up custody of their disabled children so they can get health care  How many more families will be forced to give up custody of their disabled children before this Congress will act    Citizens with disabilities also need more realistic ways to lead independent lives at home and in the community  I hope Congress can pass bipartisan legislation supporting a new insurance strategy for them    a strategy enables Americans with disabilities to afford the services and support they need to lead independent lives     Once again  I thank our Chairman for holding this thoughtful hearing  I thank our witnesses for appearing before the committee this morning  I look forward to their testimony  and to working with my colleagues to enact appropriate ways to meet these basic needs    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
