         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        Today s Senate action is a major victory for millions of Americans  and a significant advance for civil rights  Advances in genetic science can and do save lives and will save many more lives in the years ahead  But these advances should not cost Americans their jobs or their health insurance  Genetic information should be private  known only to a person s doctor    and not to an employer  a health insurance company  or anyone else     This unanimous  bipartisan vote in favor of the first civil rights bill of the century of the life sciences demonstrates a welcome consensus and also a sense of urgency     The legislation approved today will prevent abuses of genetic information  and I urge our colleagues in the House to approve it as well  The Bush Administration supports it  and I m optimistic that it will go to President Bush for his signature as soon as possible      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
