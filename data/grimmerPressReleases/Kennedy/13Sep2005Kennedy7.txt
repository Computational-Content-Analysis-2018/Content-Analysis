         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   MASSACHUSETTS DELEGATION REQUESTS EMERGENCY DECLARATION FOR MASSACHUSETTS TO AID EVACUEES FROM HURRICANE KATRINA       The Massachusetts delegation has sent the following letter to President Bush today to show support for Governor Romney s initial request to make an emergency declaration for Massachusetts  On September 9th  Governor Romney requested the President to make an emergency declaration under the Robert T  Stafford Act  Stafford Act  for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in response to Hurricane Katrina  Thus far  29 states have received a federal emergency declaration under the Stafford Act because of Hurricane Katrina  making those states eligible for disaster recovery assistance     Under the Stafford Act  a governor may seek an emergency declaration for his or her state from the President  An emergency declaration expedites a range of federal resources for disaster recovery  The aid is financed through the Department of Homeland Security s Disaster Relief Fund  DRF      Senator Kennedy said  Communities of Massachusetts are welcoming victims of Katrina with open arms  The emergency declaration is needed to enable them to receive the best care possible in the Commonwealth  and I hope the President will approve it as soon as possible as he has done in the case of other states receiving evacuees    The people of Massachusetts have opened their arms to Hurricane Katrina s victims  We are working to get this disaster declaration right away  so we can get help to those who need it without further delay  said Senator John Kerry     The Commonwealth s compassionate efforts to provide aid to those affected by Hurricane Katrina should be recognized by the President and appropriate assistance from the federal government should be forthcoming  said Congressman John F  Tierney    Congressman Delahunt said  The New England tradition of neighbor helping neighbor is alive and well  As we care for people whose lives were so disrupted by Hurricane Katrina  we ll continue to pursue reimbursement for communities that opened their hearts and homes    Massachusetts has open its door to help those in need  and now it is time for the federal government to do its part  said Congressman Frank    To adequately meet the needs of the Hurricane Katrina evacuees at Camp Edwards  it is essential that Massachusetts be granted this emergency declaration request  I join my colleagues in urging President Bush to act expeditiously on this matter  said Congressman Richard E  Neal     The people of Massachusetts have leapt to action to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina  Rep  McGovern said  I urge the Bush Administration to approve Massachusetts  request for an emergency declaration  It s the right thing to do    Congressman Olver said  So far  Massachusetts has been able to provide hundreds of evacuees with shelter and 30 day emergency benefit packages  but in order to offer continued assistance we need the support of the federal government and an emergency declaration from FEMA    We need to work fast to expedite assistance to the residents of Mississippi  Louisiana and Alabama whose lives were destroyed in Hurricane Katrina  The Commonwealth is already supporting more than 200 evacuees  We are ready to provide resources and shelter for more citizens in this time of need  but first we need the federal government to support us in helping these evacuees rebuild their lives immediately    Congressman Stephen F  Lynch said  It is imperative that the evacuees from hurricane Katrina receive the highest quality of services that our State can provide  It is my hope that this emergency declaration will ensure that those services will be directed to the displaced families that are here and for those that are on the way     In a time of crisis  Massachusetts has acted in the spirit of national unity  By taking in over 200 people from the Gulf and offering to accept as many as 2 500  we have risen without question to do our part  said Congressman Meehan  Now the federal government must do its part to ensure that evacuees receive the shelter  care  and services they need    The letter sent to President Bush today  signed by the entire Massachusetts delegation  is below    The President The White House Washington  DC 20500   Dear Mr  President    We are writing to express our strong support for the request by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for an emergency declaration under the Robert T  Stafford Disaster Relief Act  We understand that Governor Mitt Romney already has taken the actions under state law required for such a declaration  and it is urgent for Massachusetts to obtain this declaration as soon as possible  so that the Hurricane Katrina evacuees may continue to receive the level of care they need and deserve     A federal disaster declaration will provide much needed assistance to meet the immediate and longer term needs of the evacuees  including shelter and emergency care  Currently  more than 200 evacuees are being cared for with state and local resources at Camp Edwards  a Cape Cod military base  The Commonwealth has enacted a  25 million emergency budget to provide assistance to as many as 2500 evacuees who may arrive from the hurricane region     Massachusetts was among the first states in the nation to offer assistance to Katrina evacuees  We believe that the federal government should reciprocate with an immediate emergency declaration for the state                With respect and appreciation  and we thank you for considering our request                                                                Sincerely       The Massachusetts Delegation     Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
