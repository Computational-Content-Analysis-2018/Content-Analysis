         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     No challenge we face is more important than dealing effectively with the terrorist threat facing the nation  and reform of the FBI is an essential part of meeting that challenge We all agree on the need for strong powers for law enforcement and intelligence officers to investigate terrorism  prevent future attacks  and improve information sharing between federal  state and local law enforcement  In the wake of the tragic events on September 11th  Congress  the Administration and the country face the urgent need to do everything possible to strengthen our national security and our counterterrorism efforts On 9 11  we were united in our commitment to protect our country  to respond aggressively to terrorism  and to destroy Al Qaeda  This was not an issue of party or  partisan politics  We all worked together Unfortunately  however  we are now at an impasse where the Administration refuses to work with Congress and it is putting our national security and the public s trust at risk  There is a way to fight terrorism within the framework of our Constitution  As Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson wrote in 1941  the Constitution is not a suicide pact Thirty years ago  when the Cold War threatened our security  a Republican administration and a Democratic Congress worked together to pass the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  giving broad authority to the government in cases involving our national security Then  as now  the debate was driven by reports of watch lists and sweeping surveillance programs  Then  as now  the American people had questions about the proper scope of the President s authority Today  the politics of fear seems to be driving our national security policy  At the same time  there are fundamental questions about whether we are getting it right  There are new concerns that we may not be any safer now than we were four years ago  I hope you can address some of the concerns about the job the FBI is doing to get its house in order and meet the terrorist threat   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
