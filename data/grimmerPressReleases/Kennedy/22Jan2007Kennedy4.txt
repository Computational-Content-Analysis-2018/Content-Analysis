         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY ON SENATE FLOOR  If theres one thing you learn very quickly in public service  its that the American people have a sensitive moral compass   They may disagree on many issues  but fundamentally  they believe in fairness   They believe in the golden rule   They believe that everyone has a right to be treated with dignity   One of the best things we can do as elected officials is to listen  because if we do  the people will tell us the right thing to do   Americans spoke loud and clear in the election last November   They want a government that stands with them and their families as they look to the future   They want a government that is working for Main Street  not for Wall Street   They want a Congress that puts working families first   And they want a fair increase in the minimum wage   Eighty eight percent of the people in this country support an increase in the minimum wage   Eighty eight percent   My brother Robert Kennedy used to say that One fifth of the people are against everything all the time   When there is an issue of fundamental fairness  an issue that speaks to fundamental human dignity  the American people speak with only one voice  Despite this overwhelming public support  despite the fact that the vast majority of Americans have spoken with one voice on this issue year after year  Congress has refused to act to give minimum wage workers the raise they deserve   The minimum wage has been stuck at  5 15 an hour for almost 10 years   A minimum wage worker who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year still makes just  10 700 a year 6 000 below the poverty line for a family of three   In fact  for more than forty years  weve let the minimum wage fall farther and farther behind the cost of living  The purchasing power of the minimum wage today is more than  4 00 below what it was at its peak in 1968   In this time of skyrocketing costs  millions of hardworking Americans are forced to make impossible choicesbetween paying the rent or buying food  between paying for gas or paying the doctor   The American people know this isnt right   Employees who earn the minimum wage are being exploited  and thats wrong   Its wrong that the nations productivity soars  but hardworking people cannot afford to put food on the table or heat their homes   People who work hard and play by the rules should be able to support themselves by their work   Year after year  when Congress failed to act  more and more Americans took up the challenge themselves   They created a minimum wage movement that has now spread across the nation   Thousands of volunteers organized to support their hard working neighbors who were struggling to survive on poverty wages   They took the battle to the ballot box last November  and won minimum wage victories in six states  Arizona  Colorado  Missouri  Montana  Nevada  and Ohio   Voters went to the polls in droves to support these measures  and to vote for candidates who support fair wages   Red and blue states alike recognized that the federal minimum wage of  5 15 an hour is simply too low   Fair wages for American working families is a bipartisan issue   The people spoke  and Congress is listening   Two weeks ago  the House voted overwhelmingly to raise the minimum wage  with no strings attached   82 House Republicans crossed party lines to support the bill   They put partisan politics aside  and acknowledged the fundamental truth that no one who works for a living should have to live in poverty    I urge my Republican colleagues in the Senate to do the same   Put partisan politics aside   Dont load up this minimum wage bill with poison pills   Dont use procedural tactics to delay it   Listen to the voice of the American people   Minimum wage workers deserve no less   They serve in many of the most difficult and important jobs in our society   They care for children in day care centers  and for the elderly in nursing homes   They clean office buildings  hotel rooms  and restaurants across the country   They are men and women of dignity  and they deserve a fair wage that respects the dignity of their work   Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour  as our legislation proposes  will benefit almost 13 million Americans   It will help more than 6 million children whose parents will receive a raise   This increase will give a family with one minimum wage earner another  4 400 a year to spend on education  child care  rent  or food on the table   It will make a real difference in the lives of working families across the country  giving millions of hardworking people real security for their families and their future   Raising the minimum wage will help workers like Gina Walter from Columbus  Ohio  a 44 year old single mother who works at a retail job in a thrift store   She got on a plane for the first time in her adult life to come to Washington and tell us what a higher minimum wage means to her   She earns just over  12 000 per year   She has no car  and no health insurance   She hasnt taken a vacation in six years   It takes her two full days of work just to pay her gas bill every month   She cuts her own hair because she cant afford to get a haircut   She goes to work every day and she works hard  trying to build a better life for her family  A fair minimum wage ensures that people like Gina  who work hard and play by the rules  dont have to live in poverty   It will help her provide better opportunities for her daughter   It will help her pay her bill for food and gas   It may even help her finally take the vacation she so obviously deserves     Unfortunately  we cant bring Gina and all the other workers like her onto the Senate floor to tell their stores   But that doesnt mean we shouldnt listen to them  The American people have spoken   They are calling on us to do whats right   When you give the American people a chance  they will always stand up for fairness   Its time for the Senate to act on their example  and vote to raise the minimum wage  RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS  Senator Kennedys Fair Minimum Wage Act would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps               5 85 60 days after enactment              6 55 one year later                7 25 one year after that   The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office  37 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s   An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem   Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year earn  10 700 per year  almost  6 000 below the federal poverty guidelines of  16 600 for a family of three  Since then the minimum wage was last raised in 1997  its real value has eroded by 21 3 percent    Every day the minimum wage is not increased  it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind  Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase   Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  4 00 below what it was in 1968   To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  9 37 an hour today  not  5 15   Nearly fifteen million Americans will benefit from a minimum wage increase to  7 25 an hour  6 6 million directly  and another 8 3 million indirectly   Fifty nine percent of these workers are women  and forty percent are people of color   Eighty percent of those who would benefit are adult workers  not teenagers seeking pocket change  Fifty four percent of workers who will benefit are full time employees  and more than a third of these adults are sole breadwinners for their families    Increasing the minimum wage will help more than 7 3 million children whose parents would receive a raise     Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 400 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families   It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy   o      15 months of groceries o      19 months of utilities o      8 months of rent o      Over two years of health care o      20 months of child care o      30 months of college tuition at a public  2 year college   This year  the Senate raised its pay by  3 100 and is set to receive an additional  3 300 raise in 2007   It is shameful that Members of Congress received our eighth pay increase in nine years  yet we have not provided a single pay increase to the lowest paid workers    The salaries of lawmakers have gone up by  31 600 since 1997  while minimum wage workers continue to earn just  10 700 a year   History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation   In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades   Nearly 12 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 248 000 per month     In contrast  in the last four years  the minimum wage has held steady  but only 4 9 million jobs have been created   States across this country have raised their own minimum wages without adverse economic consequences   Study after study has shown that raising the minimum wage has not cost jobs in the states  An Economic Policy Institute study of Washington  Oregon  and Alaska showed that increases in the state minimum wage had no impact on the state unemployment rate   Similarly  the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center has found that after the last two minimum wage increases in Massachusetts in 2000 and 2001  employment grew more quickly in sectors with the most minimum wage workers  including leisure  hospitality  and the service sector   A recent Gallup poll found that 86  of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business  and three out of four small businesses said that a 10  increase in the minimum wage would have no effect on their company  Additionally  nearly half of small business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased  and only 16  of owners think the minimum wage should be reduced or eliminated entirely   Britain has the second largest economy in Europe  after Germany    They implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty   They raised their minimum wage to about  9 51 per hour last year  and they are planning to raise this rate to about  9 89 in October of this year   Ireland has an extremely robust economy  with impressive growth over the last decade  and the fourth largest GDP per capita in the world   The minimum wage rate in Ireland is 7 65  hour  about  9 65  and yet their unemployment rate is lower than the U S    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
