         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington   Jan 10th 2006     QA session between Ed Kennedy and Judge Alito  transcript    KENNEDY  Thank you very much  Mr  Chairman    There was one interesting omission between the exchange of yourself and Senator Hatch on the whole Vanguard issue in question  and that was the promise and pledge that you gave to this committee when you were up for the circuit court  I have it right here    It said  I do not believe that conflicts of interest relating to my financial interests are likely to arise  I would  however  disqualify myself from any cases involving the Vanguard companies  the brokerage firm of Smith Barney  or the First Federal Savings Loan of Rochester  New York    You remember that response  That was a pledge and promise to the committee that you would recuse yourself  Did you not    ALITO  Yes  it was  Senator    And as I said in answering Senator Hatch s question  if I had it to do over again  I would have handled this case differently  There were some oversights    KENNEDY  I m sure you might have  We ve had a number of different explanations for this    I d like to ask the clerk if they would take down and show the judge  if you d like to be refreshed about the number of times the name Vanguard appears on the brief and the number of times Vanguard appears on the opinion  which I believe you authored    Would you like to    if I could get a clerk to show those two documents    ALITO  Senator  I am familiar with that  I do not really need to see the document    KENNEDY  OK    ALITO  Senator  the name Vanguard certainly appears on the briefs  And it appeared in the draft opinion that was sent to us by the staff attorney s office    I just did not focus on the issue of recusal when it came up  That was an oversight on my part  because it didn t give me the opportunity to apply my personal policy of going beyond what the code requires    KENNEDY  So the individuals that responded on the ethical issues that were involved in this case  did they know that you had pledged and promised to this committee that you would recuse yourself    ALITO  I believe that they did  I believe that some of them at least addressed that specifically in      KENNEDY  Do you know specifically whether they did or not    ALITO  I believe they addressed it in their letters  so they must have been aware of it    KENNEDY  They understood that you had promised this committee that you would recuse yourself  Your testimony now is that those that made a comment upon your ethical behavior knew as a matter of fact that you had pledged to this committee that he would recuse yourself from the Vanguard cases    ALITO  Professor Hazard I know addressed that directly in his letter  I think Professor Rotunda addressed it in his letter  So  obviously  if the letters addressed the issue  they were aware of what was said on the Senate questionnaire    KENNEDY  And the final answer    we ll move on    is that you saw the name Vanguard on the briefs and you obviously saw them on the opinion  You re the author of the opinion  But your testimony here now is even though you saw the names on that  it did not come to mind at that moment that you had made the pledge and promised to this committee that you would recuse yourself    ALITO  I did not focus on the issue of recusal  I think  because 12 years had gone by and the issue of a Vanguard recusal hadn t come up    And one of the reasons why judges tend to invest in mutual funds is because they generally do not present recusal problems  And pro se cases in particular generally don t present recusal problems    ALITO  And so no light went off  That s all I can say  I didn t focus on the issue of recusal    KENNEDY  Well  this is important  when the lights do go on  and when the lights do go off  Because actually the accumulation of value of Vanguard had increased dramatically during this period of time  had it not    ALITO  It had  Senator  but I had nothing to gain financially by       CROSSTALK    KENNEDY  No  I m not asking to get on to the questions of gain or loss or whatever    I m just asking about the pledge to the committee which you had given and the fact that the Vanguard was so obvious both in the brief and in the opinion which you wrote  and the fact that during this period of time there had been a sizable increase in the total value of Vanguard  And as all of us know  if you re dealing with a case dealing with IBM  you can t have even a single share in that    The point about all of this is  is that so that interested parties that come before the courts are going to believe  not only in reality  but in appearance  that they re going to get a fair shake    And that  you have said  was certainly your desire  And I certainly commend you for at least that desire  But in this case  this was something we d recognize is extremely important    Judge  in just the past month  Americans have learned that the president instructed the National Security Agency to spy on them at home    KENNEDY  And they ve seen an intense public debate over when the FBI can look at their library records    And they ve heard the president announce that he has accepted the McCain amendment barring torture  But then just days later  as he signed it into law  the president s decided he still could order torture whenever he believed it was necessary  no check  no balance  no independent oversight    So  Judge  we all want to protect our communities from terrorists  But we don t want our children and grandchildren to live in an America that accepts torture and eavesdropping on American citizens as a way of life    We need an independent and vigilant Supreme Court to keep that from happening  to enforce the constitutional boundaries on presidential power and blow the whistle when the president goes too far    Congress passes laws  but this president says that he has the sole power to decide whether or not he has to obey those laws  Is that proper  I don t think so    But we need justices who can examine this issue objectively  independently and fairly  And that s what our founders intended and what the American people deserve    So  Judge  we must know whether you can be a justice who understands how to strike that proper balance between protecting our liberties and protecting our security  a justice who will check even the president of United States when he has gone too far    Chief Justice Marshall was that kind of justice when he told president Jefferson that he had exceed his war making powers under the Constitution    KENNEDY  Justice Jackson was that kind of president  sic  when he told President Truman that he could not use the Korean War as an excuse to take over the nation s steel mills    Chief Justice Warren Burger was that kind of justice when he told President Nixon to turn over the White House tapes  And Justice O Connor was that kind of justice when she told President Bush that a state of war is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nation s citizens    So I have serious doubts that you d be that kind of justice  The record shows time and again that you have been overly deferential to executive power  whether exercised by the president  the attorney general or law enforcement officials    And your record shows that  even over the strong objections of other federal judges    other federal judges    you bend over backward to find even the most aggressive exercise of executive power reasonable    But perhaps most disturbing is the almost total disregard in your record for the impact of these abuses of powers on the rights and liberties of individual citizens    And so  Judge Alito  we need to know whether the average citizen can get a fair shake from you when the government is a party  and whether you will stand up to a president    any president who ignores the Constitution and uses arguments of national security to expand executive power at the expense of individual liberty  whether you will ever be able to conclude that the president has gone too far    Now  in 1985  in your job application to the Justice Department  you wrote  I believe very strongly in the supremacy of the elected branches of government  Those are your words  am I right    ALITO  They are and that s a very inapt phrase    KENNEDY  Excuse me    ALITO  It s an inapt phrase  and I certainly didn t mean that literally at the time  and I wouldn t say that today    The branches of government are equal  They have different responsibilities  but they are all equal and no branch is supreme to the other branches    KENNEDY  So you ve changed your mind    ALITO  No  I haven t changed my mind  Senator  but the phrasing there is very misleading and incorrect    What I was getting at is the fact that our Constitution gives the judiciary a particular role and there are instances in which it can override the judgments that are made by Congress and by the executive  But for the most part  our Constitution leaves it to the elected branches of government to make the policy decisions for our country    KENNEDY  All right  I want to move on    Mr  Chairman  the clock is off  There are a number of points I want to cover and be timely  so I leave it up to the chair      SPECTER  Senator Kennedy  you re correct  We have a timer over here  We re trying to get the timer fixed    KENNEDY  If I would know when I have 10 minutes left      SPECTER  Let us see if we can t get that clock in the view of Senator Kennedy so he can see it when he s questioning the witness    KENNEDY  Thank you  Thank the chair    SPECTER  And give Senator Kennedy two more minutes    KENNEDY  There you go  There you go     LAUGHTER     UNKNOWN   Bravo    KENNEDY  Be quiet over there     LAUGHTER    Scurrilous dogs     LAUGHTER    Judge  quite frankly  your record shows you still believe in the supremacy of the executive branch  Judge Alito  I believe there is a larger pattern in your writings and speeches and cases that show an excess of almost single minded deference to the executive power without showing a balanced consideration of the individual rights of people    So let s discuss some of your opinions  These cases deal specifically with one form or another of executive power  the power of authorities to intrude in homes  search people who were not even suspected of committing a crime    KENNEDY  The Mellot v  Hemer  ph   where the U S  Marshal Service forcibly evicted a family of dairy farmers from their home and their farm  These farmers had no criminal record and were suspected of no crime    But after they fell on very hard times  the property was sold at a public auction  U S  marshals were sent to evict them    Remember  the marshals were sent to carry out a civil action  not a criminal action  a civil action  These farmers had committed no crime    Now  I respect the U S  marshals  They have a tough job and they do it with great professionalism  But in this case  the marshals entered the house with loaded guns  The family was unarmed  did not resist  but still the marshals pointed loaded guns at their heads  chests and backs    One marshal chambered a cartridge in his gun  Twice  they pushed the wife into her chair    The trial judge held there was enough evidence in this case to have a jury review the facts  hear the testimony and decide whether the marshals used too much force to evict these farmers    But that did not sit well with you  Judge Alito  You grabbed the case away from the jury  You wouldn t let them hear the testimony or make up their own mind about whether the marshals had gone too far    No  you simply substituted your judgment for the jury s and decided that the marshals  conduct was as a matter of all objectively reasonable  Judgment for the marshals  no jury of their peers for the farmers    Why  Judge Alito  Your colleague on the 3rd Circuit  Judge Rendell  called the marshals  conduct Gestapo like    Gestapo like  She said seven marshals detained  terrorized the family and friends  ransacked a home while carrying out an unresisted civil eviction  The trial judge thought the decision should be made by the jury  Why didn t you let the jury exercise an independent check on the marshals  actions    ALITO  There was some additional information regarding these people that was important  and that was that they had threatened other people  as I recall  And there was evidence about the possession of weapons and evidence that they would be dangerous  That was the basis on which the marshals acted the way they did    This was a case in which the marshals were sued for civil damages  And they asserted what s called the qualified immunity defense  and that means that if a reasonable person could have thought there was a basis for doing what they did  then they are entitled not to be tried  That is the law  I didn t make up that law    KENNEDY  Wait      SPECTER  Let him finish  Senator Kennedy    ALITO  That s not a legal standard that I made up  and that was the way I saw the case  and that s the way the other judge who was in the majority saw the case    Now  these cases involve difficult line drawing arguments at times  and I respect Judge Rendell s view of this very much  but reasonable people will view these things differently    KENNEDY  Well  the issue then was the actions of the marshals  whether it was reasonable    whether it was reasonable  And here you have a judge  Judge Rendell  saying it was Gestapo like to talk about terrorizing a family and ransacking a home while carrying out an unresisted civil eviction    Aren t juries there to make a judgment and determination whether it was reasonable or not reasonable  And didn t your action take that away because you ruled as a matter of law that their conduct was reasonable    ALITO  The Supreme Court has told us how we have to handle this issue  and it is for the judiciary to decide in the first place whether a reasonable officer could have thought that what the officer was doing was consistent with the Fourth Amendment  We have to make that decision    Now  if we decide that there s an issue of fact  if there s a dispute in the testimony about the evidence that the marshals had or about what these individuals were doing at the time when the search was taking place or what the marshals did  then certainly those factual issues have to be resolved by the jury    KENNEDY  That s  I think  certainly the view of Judge Rendell    Let me move on  if I could  to the Doe v  Groody  And I know that you have    Senator Leahy has talked about this and gone over the factual situation about the strip searching of a 10 year old girl    KENNEDY  This case  the police got a warrant to search the house  They found the suspect outside  marched him inside  where they encountered the wife and 10 year old    The police took the wife and daughter upstairs  told them to remove their clothing  physically searched them  not as a protective frisk or search for weapons but in the hopes of finding contraband    And that is when Judge Chertoff  the formal chief federal prosecutor for New Jersey  the former head of the Criminal Division in the Justice Department  President Bush s current secretary of homeland security  held that the police went too far    As Judge Chertoff said  a search warrant for a premise does not constitute a license to search everyone inside  You differed  You differed    And you ve reviewed with us your reasoning for it  the fact that you felt that the affidavit which had been filed by the police should be included in the search warrant    Judge Chertoff takes strong exception to that  as does the Fourth Amendment    as does the Fourth Amendment    As you mentioned yourself  the affidavit represents the police s view about the situation  But the search warrant is what is approved by the judge  Those are two different items that come up every time  in many  many instances    Why did you feel that  under these circumstances    under these circumstances    that that affidavit should be included  the result of which we have the strip searching of a 10 year old    a 10 year old that will bear the scars of that kind of activity probably for the rest of her life    The Fourth Amendment is clear  We want to protect the innocents  We want to have a search warrant that is precise  so that the police understand it and the person that it s being served to understands it    KENNEDY  That was all spelled out in the judgment    But you went further than that  You said  Well  in this case  we re going to include the affidavit  And as a result of your judgment in this case and the inclusion of the Affidavit  we have the kind of conduct against this 10 year old which she will never forget    Why  Judge Alito    ALITO  Senator  I wasn t happy that a 10 year old was searched    Now  there wasn t any claim in this case that the search was carried out in any sort of an abusive fashion  It was carried out by a female officer  And that wasn t the issue in the case    And I don t think there should be a Fourth Amendment rule    but  of course  it s not up to me to decide    that minors can never be searched  Because if we had a rule like that  then where would drug dealers hide their drugs  That would lead to greater abuse of minors    The technical issue in the case was really not whether a warrant can incorporate an affidavit  There s no dispute that a judge or a magistrate issuing a warrant can say that the affidavit is incorporated  And that was done here    The issue was whether    and it was a very technical issue    was it incorporated only on the issue of probable cause  or was it also incorporated on the issue of who would be searched    If the magistrate had said in the warrant  This warrant is incorporated as to the people who may be searched and then in the affidavit it said    and it did say this very clearly    We want authorization to search anybody who s on the premises  then there d be no problem whatsoever    ALITO  The warrant said it was incorporated on the issue of probable cause  And I thought that reading it in a common sense fashion  which is what we re supposed to do  that necessarily meant that the magistrate said  There was probable cause to search anybody who s found on the premises  and that s what I m authorizing you to do    KENNEDY  And that is what Judge Chertoff took strong exception in a very eloquent statement in talking about the protections and the reasons for the strict interpretation for the warrant    Let me move on    Judge Alito  your 3rd Circuit decisions don t exist in a vacuum    Mr  Chairman  at this point  since there has been some questions about whether we are flyspecking these cases  I d like to include in the appropriate place in the record the Knight Ridder studies that concluded that Judge Alito never found a government search unconstitutional  the Yale Law School professors    the rule for government is almost    every case reviewed  this was their conclusion  The Washington Post stories with regard to the cases  and also Professor Cass Sunstein s conclusions that    the studies that Judge Alito rules against individuals in 84 percent of the time    SPECTER  In accordance with our practices  if you want them in the record they will be there  without objection    KENNEDY  OK    So just looking at your writings and speeches  Judge Alito  you have endorsed the supremacy of the elected branch of government  You ve clarified that today    KENNEDY  You argued that the attorney general should have the absolute immunity  even for actions that he knows to be unlawful or unconstitutional  suggested that the court should give a president s signing statement great deference in determining the meaning and the intent of the law  and argued  as a matter of your own political and judicial philosophy  for an almost all powerful presidency    Time and again  even in routine matters involving average Americans  you give enormous  almost total  deference to the exercise of governmental powers    So I want to ask you about some of the possible abuses of the executive power and infringement on individual rights that we re facing in the country today    Judge Alito  just a few weeks ago  by a vote of 90 9  the Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Senator John McCain to ban the torture  whether it be here at home or abroad  As a former POW in Vietnam  John McCain knows a thing or two about torture    For a long time  the White House threatened to veto the legislation  and finally Senator McCain met with the president and convinced him to approve the anti torture law    Two weeks after that  the president issued a signing statement    no publicity  no press release  no photo op    where he quietly gutted his commitment to enforce the law banning torture  The president stated  in essence  that whenever the law of the land might be  whatever Congress might have written  the executive branch has the right to authorize torture without fear of judicial review    Now  I raise this issue with you  Judge    I raise this with you because you were among the early advocates of the so called presidential signing statements when you were a Justice Department official    You urged President Reagan to use the signing statements to limit the scope of laws passed by Congress  even though Article I of the Constitution vests all legislative powers in the Congress    You urged the president to adopt what you described as a novel proposal to issue statements aimed at undermining the courts use of legislative history as a guide to the meaning of the law    KENNEDY  You wrote these words  The president s understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress    With respect to the statement issued by President Bush reserving his right to order torture  is that what you had in mind when you wrote the president s understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress    ALITO  When I interpret statutes    and that s something that I do with some frequency on the Court of Appeals    where I start and often where I end is with the text of the statute  And if you do that  I think you eliminate a lot of problems involving legislative history and also with signing statements    So I think that s the first point that I would make    Now  I don t say I m never going to look at legislative history  And the role of signing statements in the interpretation of statutes is  I think  a territory that s been unexplored by the Supreme Court  And it certainly is not something that I have dealt with as a judge    This memo was a memo that resulted from a working group meeting that I attended  The attorney general had already decided that  as a matter of policy  the Reagan administration would issue signing statements for interpretive purposes and had made an arrangement with the West Publishing Company to have those published    And my task from this meeting was to summarize where the working group was going and where it had been  And I said at the beginning of the memo that this was a rough first effort to outline what the administration was planning to do  And I was a lawyer for the administration at the time    And then I had a big section of that memo saying and these are the theoretical problems  And some of them are the ones that you mentioned    ALITO  And that s why I left it  And all of that would need to be explored to go any further    KENNEDY  Judge Alito  in the same signing statement undermining the McCain anti torture law  the president referred to his authority to supervise the unitary executive branch    That is an unfamiliar term to most Americans  but the Wall Street Journal describes it as the foundation of the Bush administration s assertion of power to determine the fate of enemy prisoners  jailing U S  citizens as enemy combatants without charging them    President Bush has referred to this doctrine at least 110 times  while Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush combined used the term only seven times  President Clinton never used it    Judge Alito  The Wall Street Journal reports that officials of the Bush administration are concerned that current judges are not buying into its unitary executive theory  So they re appointing new judges more sympathetic to their executive power claims  We need to know whether you re one of those judges    In the year 2000  in a speech soon after the election  you referred to the unitary executive theory as the gospel and affirmed your belief in it    So  Judge Alito  the president is saying he can ignore the ban on torture passed by Congress  that the courts cannot review his conduct    In light of your lengthy record on the issues of executive power  deferring to the conduct of law enforcement officials even when they are engaged in conduct that your judicial colleagues condemn    Judge Chertoff  Judge Rendell    subscribing to the theory of unitary executive which gives the president complete power over the independent agencies  the independent agencies that protect our health and safety  believing that the true independent special prosecutors investigate wrongdoing are unconstitutional  referring to the supremacy of the elected branches over the judicial branch  and arguing that the court should give equal weight to a president s view about the meaning of the laws that Congress has passed  why should we believe that you ll act as an independent check on the president when he claims the power to ignore the laws passed by Congress    ALITO  Well  Senator  let me explain what I understand the idea of the unitary executive to be  And I think there has been some misunderstanding  at least as to what I understand this concept to mean    I think it is important to draw a distinction between two very different ideas  One is the scope of executive power  Often presidents    or occasionally presidents    have asserted inherent executive powers not set out in the Constitution  We might think of that as  you know  how big is this table  the extent of executive power    The second question is  When you have the power that is within the prerogative of the executive  who controls the executive    Those are separate questions  The issue of  to my mind  the concept of the unitary executive  does not have to do with the scope of executive power  It has to do with who within the executive branch controls the exercise of executive power  The theory is the Constitution says the executive power is conferred on the president    ALITO  Now  the power that I was addressing in that speech was the power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed  not some inherent power but a power that is explicitly set out in the Constitution    KENNEDY  Would that have any affect or impact on independent agencies    ALITO  The status of independent agencies I think is now settled in the case law    This was addressed in Humphrey s Executor way back in 1935 when the Supreme Court said that the structure of the Federal Trade Commission didn t violate the separation of powers and that it was revisited and reaffirmed in Wiener v  the United States in 1958    KENNEDY  So your understanding of any unitary presidency  that they do not therefore have any kind of additional kind of control over the independent agencies than has been agreed to by the Congress and signed into law at the prior time    ALITO  I think that Humphrey s Executor is a well settled precedent    What the unitary executive I think means now  we would look to Morrison I think for the best expression of it  And it is that things cannot be arranged in such a way that interfere with the president s exercise of his power on a functional    taking a functional approach    KENNEDY  I want to just mention this signing of the executive understanding of the legislation that we passed banning torture  what the president signed on to    The executive branch shall construe the Title X and Division A relating to detainees in a matter with the constitutional authority of the president to supervise the unitary executive branch as the commander in chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on judicial power    KENNEDY  Therefore  it s the warning that the courts are not going to be able to override the judgments and decisions  That s certainly my understanding of those words  which will assist in achieving the shared objective of the Congress and the president    That statement there  in terms of what was agreed to by Congress  19 0  by John McCain  by President Bush  and then we have this signing document which effectively just undermines all of that    it is something that we have to ask ourselves  whether this is the way that we understand the way that laws are to be made    It was very clear in the Constitution who makes the laws  The executive    Congress and the Senate makes it  The president signs it  And that s the law  That s the law    These signing statements  and recognizing the signing statements and giving these value in order to basically undermine that whole process is a matter of enormous concern    Thank you    SPECTER  Judge Alito  Senator Kennedy had noted that there were substantial gains  as he put it  in the Vanguard stock  or the Vanguard the asset  during the period of time that you held them  But he did not give you an opportunity to answer that  I don t like to interrupt in the midst of a series of questions  but you can respond to that if you care to do so at this time    ALITO  Well  Mr  Chairman  I had additional holdings in Vanguard during my period of service  But I think the important point as far as that is concerned is that nobody has claimed that I had anything to gain financially from participating in this case  And I certainly did not   Political Gateway Special Report       Washington   Jan 10th 2006     QA session between Ed Kennedy and Judge Alito  transcript    KENNEDY  Thank you very much  Mr  Chairman    There was one interesting omission between the exchange of yourself and Senator Hatch on the whole Vanguard issue in question  and that was the promise and pledge that you gave to this committee when you were up for the circuit court  I have it right here    It said  I do not believe that conflicts of interest relating to my financial interests are likely to arise  I would  however  disqualify myself from any cases involving the Vanguard companies  the brokerage firm of Smith Barney  or the First Federal Savings Loan of Rochester  New York    You remember that response  That was a pledge and promise to the committee that you would recuse yourself  Did you not    ALITO  Yes  it was  Senator    And as I said in answering Senator Hatch s question  if I had it to do over again  I would have handled this case differently  There were some oversights    KENNEDY  I m sure you might have  We ve had a number of different explanations for this    I d like to ask the clerk if they would take down and show the judge  if you d like to be refreshed about the number of times the name Vanguard appears on the brief and the number of times Vanguard appears on the opinion  which I believe you authored    Would you like to    if I could get a clerk to show those two documents    ALITO  Senator  I am familiar with that  I do not really need to see the document    KENNEDY  OK    ALITO  Senator  the name Vanguard certainly appears on the briefs  And it appeared in the draft opinion that was sent to us by the staff attorney s office    I just did not focus on the issue of recusal when it came up  That was an oversight on my part  because it didn t give me the opportunity to apply my personal policy of going beyond what the code requires    KENNEDY  So the individuals that responded on the ethical issues that were involved in this case  did they know that you had pledged and promised to this committee that you would recuse yourself    ALITO  I believe that they did  I believe that some of them at least addressed that specifically in      KENNEDY  Do you know specifically whether they did or not    ALITO  I believe they addressed it in their letters  so they must have been aware of it    KENNEDY  They understood that you had promised this committee that you would recuse yourself  Your testimony now is that those that made a comment upon your ethical behavior knew as a matter of fact that you had pledged to this committee that he would recuse yourself from the Vanguard cases    ALITO  Professor Hazard I know addressed that directly in his letter  I think Professor Rotunda addressed it in his letter  So  obviously  if the letters addressed the issue  they were aware of what was said on the Senate questionnaire    KENNEDY  And the final answer    we ll move on    is that you saw the name Vanguard on the briefs and you obviously saw them on the opinion  You re the author of the opinion  But your testimony here now is even though you saw the names on that  it did not come to mind at that moment that you had made the pledge and promised to this committee that you would recuse yourself    ALITO  I did not focus on the issue of recusal  I think  because 12 years had gone by and the issue of a Vanguard recusal hadn t come up    And one of the reasons why judges tend to invest in mutual funds is because they generally do not present recusal problems  And pro se cases in particular generally don t present recusal problems    ALITO  And so no light went off  That s all I can say  I didn t focus on the issue of recusal    KENNEDY  Well  this is important  when the lights do go on  and when the lights do go off  Because actually the accumulation of value of Vanguard had increased dramatically during this period of time  had it not    ALITO  It had  Senator  but I had nothing to gain financially by       CROSSTALK    KENNEDY  No  I m not asking to get on to the questions of gain or loss or whatever    I m just asking about the pledge to the committee which you had given and the fact that the Vanguard was so obvious both in the brief and in the opinion which you wrote  and the fact that during this period of time there had been a sizable increase in the total value of Vanguard  And as all of us know  if you re dealing with a case dealing with IBM  you can t have even a single share in that    The point about all of this is  is that so that interested parties that come before the courts are going to believe  not only in reality  but in appearance  that they re going to get a fair shake    And that  you have said  was certainly your desire  And I certainly commend you for at least that desire  But in this case  this was something we d recognize is extremely important    Judge  in just the past month  Americans have learned that the president instructed the National Security Agency to spy on them at home    KENNEDY  And they ve seen an intense public debate over when the FBI can look at their library records    And they ve heard the president announce that he has accepted the McCain amendment barring torture  But then just days later  as he signed it into law  the president s decided he still could order torture whenever he believed it was necessary  no check  no balance  no independent oversight    So  Judge  we all want to protect our communities from terrorists  But we don t want our children and grandchildren to live in an America that accepts torture and eavesdropping on American citizens as a way of life    We need an independent and vigilant Supreme Court to keep that from happening  to enforce the constitutional boundaries on presidential power and blow the whistle when the president goes too far    Congress passes laws  but this president says that he has the sole power to decide whether or not he has to obey those laws  Is that proper  I don t think so    But we need justices who can examine this issue objectively  independently and fairly  And that s what our founders intended and what the American people deserve    So  Judge  we must know whether you can be a justice who understands how to strike that proper balance between protecting our liberties and protecting our security  a justice who will check even the president of United States when he has gone too far    Chief Justice Marshall was that kind of justice when he told president Jefferson that he had exceed his war making powers under the Constitution    KENNEDY  Justice Jackson was that kind of president  sic  when he told President Truman that he could not use the Korean War as an excuse to take over the nation s steel mills    Chief Justice Warren Burger was that kind of justice when he told President Nixon to turn over the White House tapes  And Justice O Connor was that kind of justice when she told President Bush that a state of war is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nation s citizens    So I have serious doubts that you d be that kind of justice  The record shows time and again that you have been overly deferential to executive power  whether exercised by the president  the attorney general or law enforcement officials    And your record shows that  even over the strong objections of other federal judges    other federal judges    you bend over backward to find even the most aggressive exercise of executive power reasonable    But perhaps most disturbing is the almost total disregard in your record for the impact of these abuses of powers on the rights and liberties of individual citizens    And so  Judge Alito  we need to know whether the average citizen can get a fair shake from you when the government is a party  and whether you will stand up to a president    any president who ignores the Constitution and uses arguments of national security to expand executive power at the expense of individual liberty  whether you will ever be able to conclude that the president has gone too far    Now  in 1985  in your job application to the Justice Department  you wrote  I believe very strongly in the supremacy of the elected branches of government  Those are your words  am I right    ALITO  They are and that s a very inapt phrase    KENNEDY  Excuse me    ALITO  It s an inapt phrase  and I certainly didn t mean that literally at the time  and I wouldn t say that today    The branches of government are equal  They have different responsibilities  but they are all equal and no branch is supreme to the other branches    KENNEDY  So you ve changed your mind    ALITO  No  I haven t changed my mind  Senator  but the phrasing there is very misleading and incorrect    What I was getting at is the fact that our Constitution gives the judiciary a particular role and there are instances in which it can override the judgments that are made by Congress and by the executive  But for the most part  our Constitution leaves it to the elected branches of government to make the policy decisions for our country    KENNEDY  All right  I want to move on    Mr  Chairman  the clock is off  There are a number of points I want to cover and be timely  so I leave it up to the chair      SPECTER  Senator Kennedy  you re correct  We have a timer over here  We re trying to get the timer fixed    KENNEDY  If I would know when I have 10 minutes left      SPECTER  Let us see if we can t get that clock in the view of Senator Kennedy so he can see it when he s questioning the witness    KENNEDY  Thank you  Thank the chair    SPECTER  And give Senator Kennedy two more minutes    KENNEDY  There you go  There you go     LAUGHTER     UNKNOWN   Bravo    KENNEDY  Be quiet over there     LAUGHTER    Scurrilous dogs     LAUGHTER    Judge  quite frankly  your record shows you still believe in the supremacy of the executive branch  Judge Alito  I believe there is a larger pattern in your writings and speeches and cases that show an excess of almost single minded deference to the executive power without showing a balanced consideration of the individual rights of people    So let s discuss some of your opinions  These cases deal specifically with one form or another of executive power  the power of authorities to intrude in homes  search people who were not even suspected of committing a crime    KENNEDY  The Mellot v  Hemer  ph   where the U S  Marshal Service forcibly evicted a family of dairy farmers from their home and their farm  These farmers had no criminal record and were suspected of no crime    But after they fell on very hard times  the property was sold at a public auction  U S  marshals were sent to evict them    Remember  the marshals were sent to carry out a civil action  not a criminal action  a civil action  These farmers had committed no crime    Now  I respect the U S  marshals  They have a tough job and they do it with great professionalism  But in this case  the marshals entered the house with loaded guns  The family was unarmed  did not resist  but still the marshals pointed loaded guns at their heads  chests and backs    One marshal chambered a cartridge in his gun  Twice  they pushed the wife into her chair    The trial judge held there was enough evidence in this case to have a jury review the facts  hear the testimony and decide whether the marshals used too much force to evict these farmers    But that did not sit well with you  Judge Alito  You grabbed the case away from the jury  You wouldn t let them hear the testimony or make up their own mind about whether the marshals had gone too far    No  you simply substituted your judgment for the jury s and decided that the marshals  conduct was as a matter of all objectively reasonable  Judgment for the marshals  no jury of their peers for the farmers    Why  Judge Alito  Your colleague on the 3rd Circuit  Judge Rendell  called the marshals  conduct Gestapo like    Gestapo like  She said seven marshals detained  terrorized the family and friends  ransacked a home while carrying out an unresisted civil eviction  The trial judge thought the decision should be made by the jury  Why didn t you let the jury exercise an independent check on the marshals  actions    ALITO  There was some additional information regarding these people that was important  and that was that they had threatened other people  as I recall  And there was evidence about the possession of weapons and evidence that they would be dangerous  That was the basis on which the marshals acted the way they did    This was a case in which the marshals were sued for civil damages  And they asserted what s called the qualified immunity defense  and that means that if a reasonable person could have thought there was a basis for doing what they did  then they are entitled not to be tried  That is the law  I didn t make up that law    KENNEDY  Wait      SPECTER  Let him finish  Senator Kennedy    ALITO  That s not a legal standard that I made up  and that was the way I saw the case  and that s the way the other judge who was in the majority saw the case    Now  these cases involve difficult line drawing arguments at times  and I respect Judge Rendell s view of this very much  but reasonable people will view these things differently    KENNEDY  Well  the issue then was the actions of the marshals  whether it was reasonable    whether it was reasonable  And here you have a judge  Judge Rendell  saying it was Gestapo like to talk about terrorizing a family and ransacking a home while carrying out an unresisted civil eviction    Aren t juries there to make a judgment and determination whether it was reasonable or not reasonable  And didn t your action take that away because you ruled as a matter of law that their conduct was reasonable    ALITO  The Supreme Court has told us how we have to handle this issue  and it is for the judiciary to decide in the first place whether a reasonable officer could have thought that what the officer was doing was consistent with the Fourth Amendment  We have to make that decision    Now  if we decide that there s an issue of fact  if there s a dispute in the testimony about the evidence that the marshals had or about what these individuals were doing at the time when the search was taking place or what the marshals did  then certainly those factual issues have to be resolved by the jury    KENNEDY  That s  I think  certainly the view of Judge Rendell    Let me move on  if I could  to the Doe v  Groody  And I know that you have    Senator Leahy has talked about this and gone over the factual situation about the strip searching of a 10 year old girl    KENNEDY  This case  the police got a warrant to search the house  They found the suspect outside  marched him inside  where they encountered the wife and 10 year old    The police took the wife and daughter upstairs  told them to remove their clothing  physically searched them  not as a protective frisk or search for weapons but in the hopes of finding contraband    And that is when Judge Chertoff  the formal chief federal prosecutor for New Jersey  the former head of the Criminal Division in the Justice Department  President Bush s current secretary of homeland security  held that the police went too far    As Judge Chertoff said  a search warrant for a premise does not constitute a license to search everyone inside  You differed  You differed    And you ve reviewed with us your reasoning for it  the fact that you felt that the affidavit which had been filed by the police should be included in the search warrant    Judge Chertoff takes strong exception to that  as does the Fourth Amendment    as does the Fourth Amendment    As you mentioned yourself  the affidavit represents the police s view about the situation  But the search warrant is what is approved by the judge  Those are two different items that come up every time  in many  many instances    Why did you feel that  under these circumstances    under these circumstances    that that affidavit should be included  the result of which we have the strip searching of a 10 year old    a 10 year old that will bear the scars of that kind of activity probably for the rest of her life    The Fourth Amendment is clear  We want to protect the innocents  We want to have a search warrant that is precise  so that the police understand it and the person that it s being served to understands it    KENNEDY  That was all spelled out in the judgment    But you went further than that  You said  Well  in this case  we re going to include the affidavit  And as a result of your judgment in this case and the inclusion of the Affidavit  we have the kind of conduct against this 10 year old which she will never forget    Why  Judge Alito    ALITO  Senator  I wasn t happy that a 10 year old was searched    Now  there wasn t any claim in this case that the search was carried out in any sort of an abusive fashion  It was carried out by a female officer  And that wasn t the issue in the case    And I don t think there should be a Fourth Amendment rule    but  of course  it s not up to me to decide    that minors can never be searched  Because if we had a rule like that  then where would drug dealers hide their drugs  That would lead to greater abuse of minors    The technical issue in the case was really not whether a warrant can incorporate an affidavit  There s no dispute that a judge or a magistrate issuing a warrant can say that the affidavit is incorporated  And that was done here    The issue was whether    and it was a very technical issue    was it incorporated only on the issue of probable cause  or was it also incorporated on the issue of who would be searched    If the magistrate had said in the warrant  This warrant is incorporated as to the people who may be searched and then in the affidavit it said    and it did say this very clearly    We want authorization to search anybody who s on the premises  then there d be no problem whatsoever    ALITO  The warrant said it was incorporated on the issue of probable cause  And I thought that reading it in a common sense fashion  which is what we re supposed to do  that necessarily meant that the magistrate said  There was probable cause to search anybody who s found on the premises  and that s what I m authorizing you to do    KENNEDY  And that is what Judge Chertoff took strong exception in a very eloquent statement in talking about the protections and the reasons for the strict interpretation for the warrant    Let me move on    Judge Alito  your 3rd Circuit decisions don t exist in a vacuum    Mr  Chairman  at this point  since there has been some questions about whether we are flyspecking these cases  I d like to include in the appropriate place in the record the Knight Ridder studies that concluded that Judge Alito never found a government search unconstitutional  the Yale Law School professors    the rule for government is almost    every case reviewed  this was their conclusion  The Washington Post stories with regard to the cases  and also Professor Cass Sunstein s conclusions that    the studies that Judge Alito rules against individuals in 84 percent of the time    SPECTER  In accordance with our practices  if you want them in the record they will be there  without objection    KENNEDY  OK    So just looking at your writings and speeches  Judge Alito  you have endorsed the supremacy of the elected branch of government  You ve clarified that today    KENNEDY  You argued that the attorney general should have the absolute immunity  even for actions that he knows to be unlawful or unconstitutional  suggested that the court should give a president s signing statement great deference in determining the meaning and the intent of the law  and argued  as a matter of your own political and judicial philosophy  for an almost all powerful presidency    Time and again  even in routine matters involving average Americans  you give enormous  almost total  deference to the exercise of governmental powers    So I want to ask you about some of the possible abuses of the executive power and infringement on individual rights that we re facing in the country today    Judge Alito  just a few weeks ago  by a vote of 90 9  the Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Senator John McCain to ban the torture  whether it be here at home or abroad  As a former POW in Vietnam  John McCain knows a thing or two about torture    For a long time  the White House threatened to veto the legislation  and finally Senator McCain met with the president and convinced him to approve the anti torture law    Two weeks after that  the president issued a signing statement    no publicity  no press release  no photo op    where he quietly gutted his commitment to enforce the law banning torture  The president stated  in essence  that whenever the law of the land might be  whatever Congress might have written  the executive branch has the right to authorize torture without fear of judicial review    Now  I raise this issue with you  Judge    I raise this with you because you were among the early advocates of the so called presidential signing statements when you were a Justice Department official    You urged President Reagan to use the signing statements to limit the scope of laws passed by Congress  even though Article I of the Constitution vests all legislative powers in the Congress    You urged the president to adopt what you described as a novel proposal to issue statements aimed at undermining the courts use of legislative history as a guide to the meaning of the law    KENNEDY  You wrote these words  The president s understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress    With respect to the statement issued by President Bush reserving his right to order torture  is that what you had in mind when you wrote the president s understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress    ALITO  When I interpret statutes    and that s something that I do with some frequency on the Court of Appeals    where I start and often where I end is with the text of the statute  And if you do that  I think you eliminate a lot of problems involving legislative history and also with signing statements    So I think that s the first point that I would make    Now  I don t say I m never going to look at legislative history  And the role of signing statements in the interpretation of statutes is  I think  a territory that s been unexplored by the Supreme Court  And it certainly is not something that I have dealt with as a judge    This memo was a memo that resulted from a working group meeting that I attended  The attorney general had already decided that  as a matter of policy  the Reagan administration would issue signing statements for interpretive purposes and had made an arrangement with the West Publishing Company to have those published    And my task from this meeting was to summarize where the working group was going and where it had been  And I said at the beginning of the memo that this was a rough first effort to outline what the administration was planning to do  And I was a lawyer for the administration at the time    And then I had a big section of that memo saying and these are the theoretical problems  And some of them are the ones that you mentioned    ALITO  And that s why I left it  And all of that would need to be explored to go any further    KENNEDY  Judge Alito  in the same signing statement undermining the McCain anti torture law  the president referred to his authority to supervise the unitary executive branch    That is an unfamiliar term to most Americans  but the Wall Street Journal describes it as the foundation of the Bush administration s assertion of power to determine the fate of enemy prisoners  jailing U S  citizens as enemy combatants without charging them    President Bush has referred to this doctrine at least 110 times  while Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush combined used the term only seven times  President Clinton never used it    Judge Alito  The Wall Street Journal reports that officials of the Bush administration are concerned that current judges are not buying into its unitary executive theory  So they re appointing new judges more sympathetic to their executive power claims  We need to know whether you re one of those judges    In the year 2000  in a speech soon after the election  you referred to the unitary executive theory as the gospel and affirmed your belief in it    So  Judge Alito  the president is saying he can ignore the ban on torture passed by Congress  that the courts cannot review his conduct    In light of your lengthy record on the issues of executive power  deferring to the conduct of law enforcement officials even when they are engaged in conduct that your judicial colleagues condemn    Judge Chertoff  Judge Rendell    subscribing to the theory of unitary executive which gives the president complete power over the independent agencies  the independent agencies that protect our health and safety  believing that the true independent special prosecutors investigate wrongdoing are unconstitutional  referring to the supremacy of the elected branches over the judicial branch  and arguing that the court should give equal weight to a president s view about the meaning of the laws that Congress has passed  why should we believe that you ll act as an independent check on the president when he claims the power to ignore the laws passed by Congress    ALITO  Well  Senator  let me explain what I understand the idea of the unitary executive to be  And I think there has been some misunderstanding  at least as to what I understand this concept to mean    I think it is important to draw a distinction between two very different ideas  One is the scope of executive power  Often presidents    or occasionally presidents    have asserted inherent executive powers not set out in the Constitution  We might think of that as  you know  how big is this table  the extent of executive power    The second question is  When you have the power that is within the prerogative of the executive  who controls the executive    Those are separate questions  The issue of  to my mind  the concept of the unitary executive  does not have to do with the scope of executive power  It has to do with who within the executive branch controls the exercise of executive power  The theory is the Constitution says the executive power is conferred on the president    ALITO  Now  the power that I was addressing in that speech was the power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed  not some inherent power but a power that is explicitly set out in the Constitution    KENNEDY  Would that have any affect or impact on independent agencies    ALITO  The status of independent agencies I think is now settled in the case law    This was addressed in Humphrey s Executor way back in 1935 when the Supreme Court said that the structure of the Federal Trade Commission didn t violate the separation of powers and that it was revisited and reaffirmed in Wiener v  the United States in 1958    KENNEDY  So your understanding of any unitary presidency  that they do not therefore have any kind of additional kind of control over the independent agencies than has been agreed to by the Congress and signed into law at the prior time    ALITO  I think that Humphrey s Executor is a well settled precedent    What the unitary executive I think means now  we would look to Morrison I think for the best expression of it  And it is that things cannot be arranged in such a way that interfere with the president s exercise of his power on a functional    taking a functional approach    KENNEDY  I want to just mention this signing of the executive understanding of the legislation that we passed banning torture  what the president signed on to    The executive branch shall construe the Title X and Division A relating to detainees in a matter with the constitutional authority of the president to supervise the unitary executive branch as the commander in chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on judicial power    KENNEDY  Therefore  it s the warning that the courts are not going to be able to override the judgments and decisions  That s certainly my understanding of those words  which will assist in achieving the shared objective of the Congress and the president    That statement there  in terms of what was agreed to by Congress  19 0  by John McCain  by President Bush  and then we have this signing document which effectively just undermines all of that    it is something that we have to ask ourselves  whether this is the way that we understand the way that laws are to be made    It was very clear in the Constitution who makes the laws  The executive    Congress and the Senate makes it  The president signs it  And that s the law  That s the law    These signing statements  and recognizing the signing statements and giving these value in order to basically undermine that whole process is a matter of enormous concern    Thank you    SPECTER  Judge Alito  Senator Kennedy had noted that there were substantial gains  as he put it  in the Vanguard stock  or the Vanguard the asset  during the period of time that you held them  But he did not give you an opportunity to answer that  I don t like to interrupt in the midst of a series of questions  but you can respond to that if you care to do so at this time    ALITO  Well  Mr  Chairman  I had additional holdings in Vanguard during my period of service  But I think the important point as far as that is concerned is that nobody has claimed that I had anything to gain financially from participating in this case  And I certainly did not    Political Gateway Special Report
