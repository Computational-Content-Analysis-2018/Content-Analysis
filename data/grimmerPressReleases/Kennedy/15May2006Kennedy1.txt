         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       Washington  D C     This evening  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to President Bush s immigration address I commend the President for his courage in calling the nation s attention to the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform that includes providing a path to citizenship for those who are here  We are at a critical moment in this debate and his leadership is essential as we fight to fix our broken system once and for all  In reality  this debate is much larger and far reaching than the issue of immigration alone  It is about our national security and protecting our homeland  It is also about the kind of America we have been and the even stronger America we hope to become  It is about opening doors of opportunity to unleash the talents and strengths of everyone in the land  regardless of color or creed  so that we face the future with hope and determination I hope that the urgent work of immigration reform is not sidetracked by the President s proposal to use the National Guard at the border  We need to examine the plan carefully  I am concerned particularly by the strain it would pose to the men and women of the National Guard who already have faced multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan and aid extensively at home in responding to natural disasters We know enforcement alone will not get the job done  The only way to gain control of our borders is to combine stronger enforcement with a pathway to citizenship for those undocumented workers who are here and a realistic temporary worker program that includes the possibility of citizenship  That s what our plan does and it has the support of employers  workers  Republicans  Democrats  religious leaders  civil rights groups  and the American people  Now is the time to make it the law of the land   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
