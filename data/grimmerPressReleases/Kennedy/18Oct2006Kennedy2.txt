         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       BOSTON  MA  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  joined by Congressman Marty Meehan  discussed the critical importance of investment in high tech research for the Merrimack Valley  Kennedy and Meehan announced  2 million in federal funding for the University of Massachusetts Lowell for nanotechnology manufacturing research within the Mechanical and Plastics Engineering  Chemistry and Biology Departments  The funding was contained in the Defense Appropriations bill that passed into law this fall and is directed toward the development of sensors that can detect biological and chemical threats to soldiers and damage to equipment in the field   Through nanotechnology  we can create new ways to detect deadly diseases earlier and save more lives  We can develop more effective technologies for clean air and water  and even find ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels  Senator Kennedy said  Collaborations such as were announcing here today will keep Massachusetts at the forefront of this field  and will lead to more innovations and new manufacturing technologies   It is not an exaggeration to say that practically every material we use today will be reengineered at the nano level to make it better in some significant way over the next ten to twenty years  UMass Lowell  because of its rich history in manufacturing and polymers  is uniquely positioned to become a world leader in nanomanufacturing  said Congressman Meehan  The Nanomanufacturing Center will bring thousands of jobs to the region and keep Massachusetts on the cutting edge of this important technology   Nanotechnology is a field of science that examines and manipulates materials at the very small molecular scale  At this level  these materials can show different physical properties  opening an entirely new way of developing products and treatments  Nanotechnology is a key component to ensuring that Massachusetts remains a leader in the technological  innovation driven global economy  Nanotechnology will have a critical impact on the computer and communications industry  national security  as well as biopharmaceuticals and medical device development  These industries currently employ over 350 000 people in Massachusetts and are expected to grow as these new technologies are implemented  UMass Lowell has been a leader in this new field of research  and the funding will be a critical part of their new Nanomanufacturing Center   SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY REMARKS AT UMASS LOWELL  AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY   Nothing says more about UMass Lowells excellence than its commitment to the new frontier science of our time    nanotechnology  Its potential is enormous   Through nanotechnology  we can create new ways to detect deadly diseases earlier and save more lives  We can develop more effective technologies for clean air and water  and even find ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels    When I heard of the Universitys proposal to apply nanotechnology to better protect our soldiers in the field against chemical and biological weapons  I knew it had to go forward    Ive met with members of our armed forces from many parts of the country  and in todays world  theres obviously an important need to outfit our service men and women with the best protection possible against such threats  UMass Lowells Nano Manufacturing Center will be the proving ground to tell us how far nanotechnology can go to improve our lives  and make our soldiers safer   The sensor technology you will develop here at the Center will give our troops a 21st century canary in the coalmine device that could make all the difference in early detection of an attack   And the research here will help keep  the Merrimack Valley  Massachusetts and the nation as a whole at the forefront of the innovation driven global economy for many years to come    Worldwide  government investment in nanotechnology has soared ten fold in the past decade from  430 million in 1997 to  4 billion today  and the U S  funds 25  of that amount  But other nations are rushing to catch up   Japan will invest  1 billion this year  and so will the European Union  China plans a major increase  We cannot afford to ignore this challenge  and Massachusetts can lead the way in meeting it    Marty Meehan and I agree that UMass Lowell is ready to lead this great enterprise  Youre one of only three National Science Foundation Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers nationwide with a focus on nano manufacturing  Already youve demonstrated remarkable capacity in this new field  helping to launch Konarka Technologies  as one of the Commonwealths first ventures in nanotechnology    Today  our state is home to 100 nanotechnology firms and we lead all 50 states in our ability to create jobs and attract investment in this field  Nanotechnology firms now employ over 350 000 people in our state and theyve attracted tens of millions of dollars in venture capital to help propel the states high tech economy  As the field continues to evolve  the jobs and investment it generates will surely grow   Collaborations such as were announcing here today will keep Massachusetts at the forefront of this field  and will lead to more innovations and new manufacturing technologies   UMass Lowell and the Merrimack Valley are leaders in developing the full promise of this amazing technology    I share your commitment to making Massachusetts first in innovation  first in investment  and first in excellence in nanotechnology    Were all extremely proud of what youve accomplished so far  we look forward to what lies ahead   I commend all of you at UMass Lowell for your skill and dedication to this promising new technology  Keep up the great work  Thank you all very much     Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
