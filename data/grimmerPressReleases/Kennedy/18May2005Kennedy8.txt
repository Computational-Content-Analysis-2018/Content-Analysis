         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC   Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Representative George Miller introduced the bicameral Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2005 to provide economic relief to 7 3 million Americans  While Republicans seem determined to break the rules of the U S  Senate in order to push through extremist judges  Senator Kennedy is determined to give working Americans the increase they long deserve  He strongly believes that no one who works for a living should have to live in poverty     Senator Kennedy s proposal would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps  The current minimum of wage is  5 15 is grossly inadequate to live on in this economy with nearly 36 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  An American who works full time  year round at the current minimum wage earns  10 700 a year     5 000 below the poverty line for a family of three  In the past eight years Congress has raised their own pay seven times  yet has refused to offer minimum wage earners a single raise     Instead of scuttling the rules that have protected our constitution and citizens for more than two centuries  the Senate should be helping hardworking Americans by raising the minimum wage  said Senator Kennedy  It s a travesty that a family of three earning the minimum wage works five days a week all year round yet still lives below the poverty line  What does that say about us as a country     There are two new reports that support the need for an increase  A new study from the Center for Economic Policy Research shows that minimum wage jobs are not just entry level for jobs for teenagers  contrary to what we often hear from opponents of the minimum wage  A third of minimum wage earners from ages 25 and 54 will still be earning the minimum wage three years later  Only 40 percent of earners had moved out of the low wage workforce three years later  The Children s Defense Fund reports that a single parent working full time at the current minimum wage earns enough to cover only 40 percent of the cost of raising two children  Nearly 10 million children live in households that would benefit from the Fair Minimum Wage Act     Below is a fact sheet on the Fair Minimum Wage Act    RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS    The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2005 would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps       5 85 60 days after enactment    6 55 one year later    7 25 one year after that    The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 4 3 million since President Bush took office  Nearly 36 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Among full time  year round workers poverty has doubled since the late 1970sfrom about 1 3 million then to more than 2 6 million  An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem      The last time Congress voted to raise the minimum wage was in 1996  That increase raised it from  4 25 to  4 75 in 1996  and then in 1997 to its current  5 15 an hour     Three times in the last Congress the Republican leadership brought down a bill rather than let us have an up or down vote on the minimum wage    first on the State Department Bill  then on the Welfare Bill  and finally on the Class Action Bill      Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  earn  10 700 a year   5 000 below the poverty line for a family of three  Since the last increase in 1997  the value has eroded by more than 15 percent     Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  3 50 below what it was in 1968  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be  8 70 an hour today  not  5 15      Nearly seven and a half million workers will directly benefit from the minimum wage increase  More than eight million more will benefit indirectly  That s fifteen and a half million workers who will get a raise     A new report from the Children s Defense Fund shows that a single parent working full time at the current minimum wage earns enough to cover only 40 percent of the cost of raising two children  9 7 million children live in households which would benefit from the increase      And a new report from the Center for Economic Policy Research shows that half of minimum wage earners are between ages 25 and 54  and a third of them will still be stuck earning the minimum wage three years later  Only 40 percent of earners had moved out of the low wage workforce three years later     Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 370 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families  That s enough for a minimum wage family to buy   o Almost two years of child care o Full tuition for a community college degree o A year and a half of heat and electricity o More than a year of groceries o More than 9 months of rent    In the past eight years  Members of Congress will have raised their own pay seven timesby  28 500  In those same eight years minimum wage workers have not gotten a single raisethey continue to earn  10 700 a year      The current minimum wage fails to provide enough income to enable minimum wage workers to afford adequate housing in any area of this country      History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation  In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades  More than 11 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 232 000 per month  There were ten million new service industry jobs  including more than one and a half million retail jobs  of which nearly 600 000 were restaurant jobs     A fair increase is long overdue  Congress should act as quickly as possible to pass a minimum wage increase that reflects the losses suffered as the result of our shameful inaction in the past  No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty
