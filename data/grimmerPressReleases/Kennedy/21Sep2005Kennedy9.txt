         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633          Our Founders proclaimed the bedrock principle that we are all created equal  But everyone knows that when we started  the reality was far different  For more than two centuries  we have struggled  sometimes spilling precious blood  to fulfill that unique American promise  The goals  the principles  and the sacrifices of millions of Americans breathed an ever fuller life into our constitutional ideals            The Constitution itself has been the inspiration for this march of progress  The open ended principles that our Founders had the wisdom to bequeath us have acquired ever deeper meaning over the years  a remarkably steady movement toward greater protection for individual rights and liberties  and an increasing assurance that governments at all levels have the authority to defend ordinary Americans from overreaching by those who would discriminate against them or exploit them            We have made much progress  But our work is not finished  and we still look to our elected representatives and our independent courts to uphold those founding principles in each new generation  to continue the great march of progress  to never turn back and never give up our hard won gains            This was the basic issue in our hearings on the nomination of John Roberts to become our next Chief Justice  Would he bring to that high office the values and ideals that would enable our struggle for equality and opportunities for all to continue  or would he stand in the way             The only records made available to us were those of John Roberts as an aggressive activist in the Reagan Administration  eager to limit basic values we have achieved at great cost and sacrifice over the years  especially in basic areas such as voting rights  womens rights  civil rights  and disability rights  Hes an outstanding lawyer who says he could represent clients on any side of a question  As Congressman John Lewis eloquently stated in our hearings  25 years ago  John Roberts was on the wrong side of the nations struggle to achieve genuine equality of opportunity for all Americans  Now  we need to know whose side he is on today  We need to know that as Chief Justice of the United States  his sole client would be all the American people            John Roberts is a highly intelligent nominee  He has argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court  and won more than half of them  He is adept at turning questions on their head while giving seemingly appropriate answers  These skills served him well as a Supreme Court advocate  These same skills  however  did not contribute to a reasonable confirmation process  At the end of the four days of hearings  we still know very little more than we knew when we started                     He proclaimed repeatedly in the hearings that he would uphold the rule of law            In answer to a question about his views  he said  If I am confirmed  on the Supreme Court  I need to decide those questions with an open mind on the basis of the arguments presented  on the basis of the record presented in the case  and on the basis of the rule of law            In answer to another question about his views  he stated again  I will confront issues in this area as I would confront issues in any area        and that would be to fully and fairly consider the arguments presented and decide them according to the rule of law            In yet another instance  he proclaimed  The responsibility of the judicial branch is to decide particular cases that are presented to them in this area according to the rule of law                     And again  I became a lawyer or at least developed as lawyer because I believe in the rule of law            The rule of law  Everyone in the Senate agrees with that  In fact  we have each taken an oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution  and we take that oath seriously  But it reveals little about how we will vote on the important questions of the day  and what values and ideals we bring to our decisions                     Judge Roberts said that a judge should be like an umpire  calling the balls and strikes  but not making the rules            But we all know that with any umpire  the call may depend on your point of view  An instant replay from another angle can show a very different result  Umpires follow the rules of the game  But in critical cases  it may well depend on where they are standing when they make the call                     The same holds true of judges                      As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously stated  The life of the law has not been logic  it has been experience            As Justice Stephen Breyer offered in his confirmation hearing  I always think law requires both a heart and a head  If you do not have a heart  it becomes a sterile set of rules  removed from human problems  and it will not help  If you do not have a head  there is the risk that in trying to decide a particular persons problem in a case that may look fine for that person  you cause trouble for a lot of other people  making their lives yet worse            The rule of law is not some mathematical formula for meting out justice  It is our values and ideals that give it real meaning  in the case of the Constitution  not our personal values and ideals  but our values and ideals derived from the meaning of the constitutional text             We all believe in the rule of law  But that is just the beginning of the conversation when it comes to the meaning of the Constitution  The Constitution of Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas is a very different document from the Constitution of Justice Stevens and Justice Souter  Everyone follows the same text  That is the rule of law  But the meaning of the text is often imprecise  You must examine the intent of the Framers  the history  and the current reality  And this examination will lead to very different outcomes depending on each Justices constitutional world view  Is it a full and generous view of our rights and liberties and of government power to protect the people  or a narrow and cramped view of those rights and liberties and the governments power to protect ordinary Americans            Based on the record available  there is clear and convincing evidence that Judge Roberts view of the rule of law would narrow the protection of basic voting rights  The values and perspectives displayed over and over again in his record cast large doubts on his view of the validity of laws that remove barriers to equal opportunity for women  minorities  and the disabled  His record raises serious questions about the power of Congress to pass laws to protect citizens in matters they care about            In fact  there is nothing in the record to indicate otherwise  For all the hoopla and all the razzle dazzle  the record is no different in its bedrock substance than it was the day the hearings started            When Senator Kohl and others asked Judge Roberts whether he would disavow any of the positions he took over the years  he refused to do so  On the first day of the hearing  Senator Kohl asked  Which of those positions were you supportive of  or are you still supportive of  and which would you disavow  Judge Roberts never provided a clear response             Voting Rights Act  In the area of voting rights  he has a long and detailed record of strong opposition to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act  which is widely acknowledged by scholars and civil rights experts to be one of the most powerful and effective civil rights laws ever enacted  It outlaws voting practices that deny or dilute the right to vote based on race  national origin  or language minority status  and is largely uncontroversial today  Before it was passed  there had not been a single African American elected since Reconstruction from seven of the southern states with the greatest of African American populations            But in 1981 and 1982  Judge Roberts was one of a small group of attorneys in the Justice Department urging the Administration to oppose a strong Section 2  which allowed discrimination to be proved by demonstrating its result  not just its intent  Although Judge Roberts sought to characterize his opposition to this critical amendment as simply following the policy of the Reagan Administration  the dozens of memos he wrote on this subject show that he personally believed the Administration was right to oppose the results test            In fact  he pressed to keep others from changing their minds about opposing the law  When Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Brad Reynolds raised concerns about sending the Senate a letter on this issue  John Roberts urged the Attorney General to send it  stating that my own view is that something must be done to educate the Senators on the seriousness of this problem         Of course  the problem he saw was the amendment  not the discrimination it was designed to end           He also urged the Attorney General to assert his leadership against the amendment to Section 2  He wrote that the Attorney General should head off any retrenchment efforts by White House staff who were inclined to support the amendment  He consistently urged the Administration to require voters to bear the heavy burden of proving discriminatory intent in order to overturn practices that locked them out of the electoral process            Judge Roberts clearly knew that his position would make it harder for voters to overturn restrictive voting laws  As he wrote at the time  violations of section 2 should not be made too easy to prove         Remember  when he wrote this there were no African Americans elected to Congress from the states with the largest black populations  and only 18 in Congress overall  And there were only 6 Latinos in Congress  There is no indication in any of his writings on the Voting Rights Act that he was the least bit troubled by this obvious discrimination            The year after section 2 was signed into law  Judge Roberts wrote in a memo to the White House Counsel that we were burned by the Voting Rights Act legislation            Given his clear record of hostility to this key voting rights protection  the public has a right to know if he still holds these views  But Judge Roberts gave us hardly a clue            When I asked him if he holds these views today  he refused to answer  He repeatedly tried to characterize his views as the views of the Administration  He declined to say whether he agreed with them  then or now  That answer strains credibility  when the memos themselves declare  my own view is that something must be done            In fairness  he did concede that he no longer believes that Section 2 is  to use his words from the 1980s  constitutionally suspect  But the fact that it took almost 20 minutes for him to provide this obvious answer to a straightforward yes or no question is not reassuring            Both Senator Feingold and I tried to find out whether he came to agree with the strengthened Voting Rights Act after President Reagan signed it into law             Even when Senator Feingold asked whether Judge Roberts would acknowledge today that he had been wrong to oppose the effects test  he refused to give a yes or no answer            Senator Feingold asked  What Im trying to figure out is  given the fact that youve followed this issue for such a long time  I would think you would have a view at this point aboutwhether the department was right in seeking to keep the intent test or whether time has shown that the effects test is really the more appropriate test            Judge Roberts responded  Im certainly not an expert in the area and havent followed and have no way of evaluating the relative effectiveness of the law as amended or the law as it was prior to 1982            So we still dont know whether he supports the basic law against voting practices that result in denying voting rights because of race  national origin  or language minority status            You dont need to be a voting rights expert to say were better off today in an America where persons of color can be elected to Congress from any state in the country  as opposed to the America of 1982  in which no African American had been elected to Congress since Reconstruction from Mississippi  Florida  Alabama  North Carolina  South Carolina  Virginia  or Louisiana  because restrictive election systems effectively denied African Americans and other minorities the equal chance to elect representatives of their choice  In these states  African Americans were a third or more of the population  but they were effectively blocked from electing any candidate of their choice decade after decade throughout the twentieth century             Yet Judge Roberts repeatedly refused to give even this simple reassurance about the Act  Is that what he means by the rule of law            Civil Rights Restoration Act  Another very important area in which Judge Roberts refused to disavow his long history of opposition to civil rights is in the prevention of discrimination by recipients of federal funds  These laws were adopted because  Congress believed  as President Kennedy said in 1963  that  s imple justice requires that public funds  to which all taxpayers       contribute  not be spent in any fashion which encourages  entrenches  subsidizes  or results in       discrimination  As an assistant to Attorney General William French Smith  John Roberts argued that these important laws should be narrowed            In fact  his position was even more extreme than the Reagan Administrations  In 1981  he supported a recommendation to exempt institutions from civil rights laws if the only federal financial assistance they received was in the form of loans to their students  Under this view  the enormous subsidies the federal government gives colleges and universities in the form of federal financial aid would not have been enough to require them to obey the laws against discrimination            At many private institutions  financial assistance to students was the only form of federal aid  so Judge Roberts suggestion would have left those institutions largely free to discriminate against women  the disabled  and minorities in both education and hiring             In fact  Judge Robertss position was so extreme that it was rejected by the Reagan Administration and later by the Supreme Court  But in his testimony  Judge Roberts ignored this aspect of his record  He refused even to acknowledge that his past positions had gone beyond the Administrations  Instead  he stated repeatedly that he was just doing his job            He said  I was articulating and defending the administrations position        The position that the administration advanced was the one I just described  The universities were covered due to federal financial assistance to their students  It extended to the admissions office  Thats an accurate statement of the Administrations position  but the view Judge Roberts advanced in his December 8  1981 memo was quite different            I also asked whether he still agreed with the statement he made in 1985  that  t riggering coverage of an institution on the basis of its accepting students who receive Federal aid is not too onerous if only the admissions office is covered  If the entire institution is to be covered  however  it should be on the basis of something more solid than Federal aid to the students             Again and again  Judge Roberts refused to say whether he still agrees with those words  He said only Well  Senator  the administration policy was as I articulated it  And it was my job to articulate the administration policy            Thats no answer at all  I never asked about the policy of the Reagan Administration  I asked only whether today  he still believed  or would disavow  his earlier position  Given his repeated refusal to answer  I can only conclude that he still holds those views today            In addition  in response to questions from Senator Biden  Judge Roberts refused to say he no longer agrees with his former position that laws against discrimination should be narrowly interpreted to apply only in the parts of the institution that directly receive federal funds  Under this view  a college that received federal financial assistance through its admissions office could not discriminate in admissions  but it could discriminate in every other aspect of its operations  in hiring teachers  in instructing students  and in athletics  When Senator Biden reminded Judge Roberts that hed written in 1982 that he strongly agreed with this view  Judge Roberts never said he no longer holds that position  Instead he testified under oath  So if the view was strongly held  it was because I thought that was a correct reading of the law  Is that his view of the rule of law            Title IX  Another very important area in which Judge Roberts failed to give any reassurance was his position protecting women and girls against discrimination in educational programs under Title IX  In the case of Franklin v  Gwinnett County  in 1991  Judge Roberts argued that Title IX did not allow a high school girl who had been sexually abused by her teacher to recover damages  Judge Roberts argument would have left the victim with no remedy at all             Senator Leahy asked him  Do you now personally agree with and accept as binding law the reasoning of Justice Whites opinion in Franklin v  Gwinnett  Judge Roberts replied that  It certainly was a precedent of the court that I would apply under principles of stare decisis            That answer sounds reassuring  until you realize that Judge Roberts never answered whether he personally agreed with this unanimous decision of the Court            Senator Leahy offered Judge Roberts several chances to disavow his position in the Franklin case  He asked  Do you now accept that Justice Whites position  in Franklin v  Gwinnett County  was right and the governments position was wrong  Just Roberts replied again  I certainly accept the decision of the courtthe 9 0 decision  as you say  as a binding precedent of the court  Again  I have no cause or agenda to revisit it or any quarrel with it            That sounded reassuring  until I recalled that Justice Thomas repeatedly used the same words  I have no quarrel with it  to evade answers during his nomination hearing  Justice Thomas testified  for instance that he had no quarrel with the test established by the Supreme Court in Lemon v  Kurzman for analyzing claims under the First Amendments prohibition on the establishment of religion  But just two years later  Justice Thomas joined a dissent ridiculing the test and saying it should not be applied  and Justice Thomas has consistently opposed the Lemon test ever since            I have to wonder why it was so difficult for Judge Roberts simply to say  Yes  in hindsight  I personally believe that Franklin v  Gwinnett was correctly decided  and that victims of intentional sex discrimination in educational programs do have a right to relief under Title IX  Why was that so difficult an answer for Judge Roberts to give  Could it be that it was contrary to his view of the rule of law            Affirmative Action  Judge Robertss record is also one of consistent and long standing opposition to affirmative action  In the 1980s  he urged the Reagan Administration to oppose affirmative action  In the 1990s  in the administration of the first President Bush  he urged the Supreme Court to overturn a federal affirmative action program  In private practice in the late 1990s and as recently as 2001  he litigated cases challenging affirmative action  That includes his repeated challenges to the Department of Transportations disadvantaged business enterprise program  which has been upheld by every court that has reviewed it            On affirmative action  his view of the rule of law seems to be that established court precedents have little meaning  even though they have been found again and again to advance our progress on civil rights            In 1981  he advocated abolishing race  and gender conscious remedies for discrimination  although he admitted this position was in tension with the Supreme Courts opinion in United Steelworkers of America v  Weber  upholding affirmative action in employment  a case that had been decided only two years earlier  He wrote that the Administration did not see that opinion as a guiding principle                     In the same memos dealing with the Weber decision  Judge Roberts even suggested that the opinion might be overturned because of changes in the Courts composition             Given his long and consistent opposition to affirmative action  Senators were entitled to seek some reassurance from the nominee that he would not use the power of the Chief Justice to continue his past efforts to end affirmative action            I asked Judge Roberts  Do you agree then with Justice O Connor  writing for the majority  that gave great weight to the real world impact of affirmative policies in universities  He stated  I can certainly say that I do think that that is the appropriate approach  without commenting on the outcome or the judgment in a particular case  But you do need to look at the real world impact in this area and I think in other areas as well  So he thinks that we should consider real world impact  but he never stated whether he agreed with Justice OConnor that the University of Michigan case was correctly decided  On that issue  we dont know any more than we did before the hearing            Senator Feinstein also asked Judge Roberts his view of affirmative action  but he avoided her question as well  She asked  Do you personally subscribe  not to quotas  but to measured efforts that can withstand strict scrutiny  Judge Roberts replied  A measured effort that can withstand strict scrutiny isa very positive approach  Well  that sounds as though he agrees  but then he also said  And I think people will disagree about exactly what the details should be                     When Senator Feinstein stated she specifically wanted to know his view of Grutter v  Bollinger  the University of Michigan case upholding affirmative action  Judge Roberts gave a long answer that was no answer at all  In the Michigan case  obviously  you have  I always forget whether its the law school     but I think the law school program was upheld and the university program was struck down because of the differences in the program  But efforts to ensure the full participation in all aspects of our society by people  without regard to their race  ethnicity  gender  religious beliefs  all those are efforts that I think are appropriate                     But of course  Senator Feinstein had not asked about efforts to ensure participation without regard to race  Shed asked his view on a particular affirmative action program at the University of Michigan Law School that took race into account  We still dont know whether he agrees with that important Supreme Court decision  and his refusal to tell us is very troubling            The Right of All Children to Share in Public Education  Im also troubled by Judge Roberts refusal to distance himself from his past criticism of the very important Supreme Court decision in Plyler v  Doe  which held that the basic principle of equal protection requires all school age children to have the same access to public education  including the children of undocumented immigrants  In a very real sense  the Plyler decision is as important to the children of undocumented workers as the Brown decision is to African American children  Yet Judge Roberts strongly criticized the decision  On the day the case was decided  he co authored a memo criticizing the Solicitor Generals Office for failing to file a brief arguing that these children could be denied public education             Senator Durbin asked Judge Roberts  Did you agree with the decision       then  Or do you agree with it now  Judge Roberts avoided the question  saying I havent looked at the decision in Plyler v  Doe in 23 years                  Senator Durbin asked  Is this settled law  as far as you are concerned  about our commitment in education        Judge Roberts again avoided the question  stating that he had not looked at the case recently and that when he wrote the memo  he was just doing his job            So we are left with nothing to reassure us that he has changed his mind from his harsh criticism of that opinion in the past  His many statements of support for the rule of law yield no clue about his true convictions on this important question today            Womens Rights  Finally  a number of my colleagues on the Committee asked Judge Roberts about issues related to womens rights and a womans right to privacy  On these important matters  too  he never gave answers that shed light on his current views            No one is entitled to become Chief Justice of the United States  The confirmation of nominees to our courts  by and with the advice and consent of the Senate  should not require a leap of faith  Nominees must earn their confirmation by providing us with full knowledge of the values and convictions they will bring to decisions that may profoundly affect our progress as a nation toward the ideal of equality            Judge Roberts has not done so  His repeated allegiance to the rule of law reveals little about the values he would bring to the job of Chief Justice of the United States  The record we have puts at serious risk the progress we have made toward our common American vision of equal opportunity for all of our citizens            Supporting or opposing nominees to the Supreme Court should not be a partisan question  In my 43 years in the United States Senate  I have supported more nominees for the Supreme Court by Republican presidents than by Democratic presidents            But  there is clear and convincing evidence that John Roberts is the wrong choice for Chief Justice  I oppose the nomination  and I urge my colleagues to do the same    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
