         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC    Today Senator Kennedy opposed the asbestos legislation that was voted out of the Judiciary Committee because it is both unfair and unworkable  At the beginning of the markup  Senator Kennedy identified ten areas in which this legislation was seriously deficient  He and several of his colleagues offered a series of amendments that would have improved the bill  but unfortunately they were all rejected by the Republican majority  The Asbestos Trust Fund created by the bill is seriously underfunded and the provisions of the bill will make it harder for many asbestos victims to recover the compensation that they deserve     Senator Kennedy said  This bill is both unfair and unworkable  The Asbestos Trust Fund that would be created by this bill will exclude many seriously ill victims from receiving compensation and fails to provide a guarantee of adequate funding to make sure the victims who are eligible will actually receive what the bill promises to them  Senator Kennedy said  The shortcomings of the bill cannot be overlooked  They are too fundamental  They will end up hurting the seriously ill victims of asbestos disease who we are trying to help     Below is Senator Kennedy s statement on the legislation  outlining the ten areas of deficiencies      Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy Regarding the Asbestos Trust Legislation Voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee May 26  2004    At the beginning of this markup several weeks ago  I identified ten areas in which this legislation was seriously deficient    both unfair and unworkable  Unfortunately  none of those problems have been corrected  Amendments have been offered to address many of the deficiencies  Unfortunately  they have been rejected  As a result  what we have before us today is an Asbestos Trust Fund that excludes many seriously ill victims from receiving compensation and that fails to provide a guarantee of adequate funding to make sure the victims who are eligible will actually receive what the bill promises them    As I have said before  the real crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation crisis  it is an asbestos induced disease crisis  Asbestos is the most lethal substance ever widely used in the workplace     All too often  the tragedy these seriously ill workers and their families are enduring becomes lost in a complex debate about the economic impact of asbestos litigation  We should not allow that to happen  The litigation did not create these costs  Exposure to asbestos created them  They are the costs of medical care  the lost wages of incapacitated workers  and the cost of providing for the families of workers who died years before their time  Those costs are real  No legislative proposal can make them disappear  All legislation can do is shift those costs from one party to another     It is not enough to say that there are serious inadequacies in the way asbestos cases are adjudicated today  That does not mean that any legislation is better than the current system  Our first obligation is to do no harm  I regret to say that  despite the best intentions of its sponsors  this legislation will do harm    There are major flaws in the bill    1  Experts tell us that the Asbestos Trust created by this legislation is seriously underfunded  The funding plan in this bill relies on very substantial borrowing in the early years as the only way to pay the flood of claims  The result will be huge debt service costs over the life of the Trust that could reduce the  140 billion intended to pay claims by as much as 40  or more  The amount remaining would be far too little to pay the claims of all of those who are entitled to compensation under the terms of the bill  The legislation does not guarantee that sufficient resources will be available to keep the commitments which this bill makes to eligible victims    2  Seriously ill victims are not allowed to continue their cases in court until the Trust Fund is ready to process and pay claims  These victims will be left in a legal limbo  unable to recover either in the courts or from the Trust Fund  while time is running out for them    3  Thousands of lung cancer victims who have had very substantial asbestos exposure are denied any compensation from the Trust Fund  Under the legislation  these victims are losing their right to go to court  but receiving nothing from the Fund    4  The bill makes it harder for asbestos victims to recover compensation from the Trust Fund by unfairly raising the standard of proof  Victims should simply have to prove that asbestos exposure was a contributing factor to their disease  That is the standard used in most state courts and workers  compensation proceedings today  This bill requires a much tougher standard    5  The current bill does not honor all existing court settlement agreements  Some victims whose claims have been resolved in court will have to start pursuing their claims all over again     6  The bill lacks a clear  automatic sunset that allows victims to quickly seek compensation in the courts if the Trust Fund becomes insolvent and unable to pay their claims  The Committee s 2003 legislation contained such a provision  but this bill does not  Under the current bill  workers could end up trapped in the Trust with reduced benefits and long delays in receiving their payments    7  Residents of other asbestos contaminated communities are denied the same opportunity to receive compensation from the Trust Fund that the residents of Libby  Montana have under the bill    8  Victims with complex cases will be unable to get a qualified attorney to pursue their claims because the legislation imposes an inflexible cap on attorneys  fees that ignores the amount of work that the case actually requires    9  The bill takes rights away from victims of silica disease even though they are not eligible to receive any benefits from the Trust Fund    10  Before victims lose their right to proceed in court  the legislation should require full disclosure of the corporations and insurers who will fund the trust and the amounts each of them will pay  It does not    These shortcomings cannot be overlooked  They are too fundamental  They will end up hurting the seriously ill victims of asbestos disease who we are trying to help  I had hoped that these problems would be addressed by the Committee  Since they have not been  I must vote no   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
