commitment to raising the federal minimum wage  Last week  the citizens of Arizona  Colorado  Montana  Missouri  Nevada and Ohio voted overwhelmingly in support of raising the minimum wage  The leaders and activists that helped make that happen joined the senators to convey the strong desire that people have across the country to give hard working Americans the raise they deserve  Kennedys bill to raise the minimum wage from  5 15 to  7 25 is a top priority for the new Democratic Senate in the 110th Congress  America has spoken  and the new Congress will listen  If theres one message from this election that emerged loud and clear on a domestic issue  its raise the minimum wage  No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty   Senator Kennedy said  The success of these ballot initiatives and the wave of support across the country prove without a doubt that a raise in the minimum wage is long overdue  Senator Schumer said  Families barely making it by on the minimum wage are worried about putting food on the table  skyrocketing prices at the pump  rising tuition costs  and making sure their loved ones are healthy and safe  These families shouldn t have had to wait for nearly a decade to receive a raise and in January their wait will finally come to an end  American voters have made a statement at the polls  working families struggling to make ends meet deserve better  After 10 long years since Congress increased the minimum wage  the new Democratic led Congress will soon deliver on its promise to the American people  Senator Hillary Rodham

said Lenny Jones  SEIU Missouri State Council Director for the Give Missourians a Raise Campaign Manager  On November 7th the voters spoke  and they believe hard work deserves fair pay  The new Congress should listen and raise the federal minimum wage as soon as they get to work  said Alicia Russe Alicia Russell  member of Arizona ACORN  Chair of AZ ACORNs Political Action Committee  and leader in the successful ballot campaign to raise Arizona s minimum wage  Below are details of Senator Kennedys Minimum Wage Bill  RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS Senator Kennedys Fair Minimum Wage Act would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps    5 85 60 days after enactment    6 55 one year later    7 25 one year after that The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office  37 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s  An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem  Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year earn  10 700 per year  almost  6 000 below the federal poverty guidelines of  16 600 for a family of three  Since then the minimum wage was last raised in 1997  its real value has eroded by 21 3 percent  Every day the minimum wage is not increased  it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind  Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase  Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  4 00 below what it was in 1968  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  9 37 an hour today  not  5 15  Nearly fifteen million Americans will benefit from a minimum wage increase to  7 25 an hour  6 6 million directly  and another 8 3 million indirectly  Fifty nine percent of these workers are women  and forty percent are people of color  Eighty percent of those who would benefit are adult workers  not teenagers seeking pocket change  Fifty four percent of workers who will benefit are full time employees  and more than a third of these adults are sole breadwinners for their families  Increasing the minimum wage will help more than 7 3 million children whose parents would receive a raise  Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 400 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families  It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy  o 15 months of groceries o 19 months of utilities o 8 months of rent o Over two years of health care o 20 months of child care o 30 months of college tuition at a public  2 year college This year  the Senate raised its pay by  3 100 and is set to receive an additional  3 300 raise in 2007  It is shameful that Members of Congress received our eighth pay increase in nine years  yet we have not provided a single pay increase to the lowest paid workers  The salaries of lawmakers have gone up by  31 600 since 1997  while minimum wage workers continue to earn just  10 700 a year  History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation  In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades  Nearly 12 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 248 000 per month  In contrast  in the last four years  the minimum wage has held steady  but only 4 9 million jobs have been created  States across this country have raised their own minimum wages without adverse economic consequences  Study after study has shown that raising the minimum wage has not cost jobs in the states  An Economic Policy Institute study of Washington  Oregon  and Alaska showed that increases in the state minimum wage had no impact on the state unemployment rate  Similarly  the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center has found that after the last two minimum wage increases in Massachusetts in 2000 and 2001  employment grew more quickly in sectors with the most minimum wage workers  including leisure  hospitality  and the service sector  A recent Gallup poll found that 86  of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business  and three out of four small businesses said that a 10  increase in the minimum wage would have no effect on their company  Additionally  nearly half of small business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased  and only 16  of owners think the minimum wage should be reduced or eliminated entirely  Britain has the second largest economy in Europe  after Germany   They implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty  They raised their minimum wage to about  9 51 per hour last year  and they are planning to raise this rate to about  9 89 in October of this year  Ireland has an extremely robust economy  with impressive growth over the last decade  and the fourth largest GDP per capita in the world  The minimum wage rate in Ireland is 7 65  hour  about  9 65  and yet their unemployment rate is lower than the U S     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
