         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today s hearing made clear that the Department of Defense has a lot of work to do before the National Security Personnel System can truly take us into the 21st Century  The current proposal would set workers  rights back to the 19th Century  and that is unacceptable    The Department has overstepped its legal authority by effectively eliminating the collective bargaining rights of civilian defense employees  I strongly support modernization  but it can and must be done without abolishing vital worker rights    The changes will hurt 700 000 workers nationwide  including 6 400 in Massachusetts  These patriotic Americans are protecting us around the world  and we owe it to them to protect their rights  They take pride in their work  they love their country  and they ve served it with distinction  often for decades  They build command and control systems at Hanscom Air Force Base  They design ships at the Boston Navy Yard  and they protect our military installations at bases across Massachusetts    These men and women deserve better  They deserve the right to bargain over important issues such as the safety and health of their workplaces  and when they re required to work overtime hours  They deserve a fair appeals process when they ve been wronged  They deserve pay increases that depend on fair criteria  not the bias of their managers  Today s hearing made clear that the current proposal is unacceptable  and I urge the Department to go back to the drawing board and submit a fairer plan for reform   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
