         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE         Today  the Senate begins a debate on legislation unlike any other we have considered this year  Today s debate is not about economic gain or loss  or helping one state or one region of the country  Today s debate is about something far more basic  something that touches the spirit of every American  Today s debate is about hope    Hope is one of the qualities of spirit that make us human  Hope allows us to dream of a better life for our children  our community  and our world  especially for loved ones now suffering or in pain    Hope is what stem cell research holds for the parents of children with diabetes  who dream of a day when their constant fears for their childrens well being are things of the past    Hope is what stem cell research brings to those with Parkinsons Disease  who long for a time when the tremors of that disease are banished forever    Hope is what stem cell research brings to millions of Americans who seek better treatments and better drugs for cancer  diabetes  spinal injury  and many other serious conditions    Hope cannot be extinguished or destroyed  but it can be delayed  In the Bible  the Book of Proverbs tells us  Hope deferred makes the heart sick  And today hearts are sick almost to the breaking point  because for the past five the Bush Administration has shut down the stem cell research program begun at National Institute of Health  and imposed arbitrary restrictions on this life saving research    Hope soared anew a year ago  when the House of Representatives set aside partisan differences and courageously approved legislation to end those restrictions  and to give our scientists the tools they need to make progress in the fight against disease  The vote in the House affirmed that embryonic stem cells can promote a true culture of life by enabling fuller  longer lives for millions of our citizens  The House voted for hope  for progress  and for life    Conservatives and progressives  members of Congress who are pro choice and pro life  Representatives from big cities  small towns and rural areas  all agreed that stem cell research must go forward     The supporters of this legislation in the Senate come from backgrounds as diverse as its proponents in the House  From Senator Specter to Senator Harkin  from Senator Hatch to Senator Feinstein and Senator Smith to Senator Frist    all have concluded that stem cell research is one of the great breakthroughs of modern medicine    that it brings the possibility of fuller  longer life for millions and millions of people who suffer   All of the supporters of H R  810  with our different personal backgrounds and different faiths  have concluded that support for this legislation is the moral choice to make    The legislation before us takes only two actions  but they hold the key to medical progress     First  our legislation overturns the restrictions on embryonic stem cell research imposed by presidential order five years ago  That unilateral action by the Administration bypassed Congress and froze progress in its tracks by barring NIH from funding research on stem cells derived after 9 00 p m   Eastern Daylight Time on August 9th  2001  an arbitrary date and time chosen solely to coincide with a presidential speech     Many of us warned at the time that this policy would delay the search for new cures and put needless barriers in the path of medical progress  At a hearing of our Health Committee just days after the President s order was issued  many of us raised concerns about the new policy  and urged the President to reconsider  Our concerns were dismissed by the Administration  but time has shown that each of the potential drawbacks we spoke of then has become a real barrier to progress today     At the time that the President s order was issued  it was claimed that over 60 independent stem cell colonies  or lines  would be available to NIH researchers  Initially  NIH listed 78 such lines in its registry  but time and the unalterable facts of science have shown that two thirds of these lines are useless  or that claims about them proved to be an illusion  Today  only 21 stem cell lines are available to NIH researchers  and all of these were obtained using out of date methods and outmoded techniques    Each of these 21 lines is contaminated with animal tissue  because each was cultured on a so called feeder layer of mouse cells  Techniques developed since 2001 have allowed scientists to grow stem cells without mouse cells  but these new lines are off limits to NIH funded scientists because of the Administration s restrictive policy    Even if the 21 lines were not contaminated with mouse cells  they would still be unusable for treatments  The reason is that use of every one of these lines is constrained by a legal contract called a Material Transfer Agreement  and each of these documents contains a clause forbidding the use of the cells in patients  Let me be clear  if the cells in the NIH registry weren t already useless for treatment because they are contaminated  they would be useless because the contract under which they are provided forbids their use in patients    Five years ago  we warned that imposing an arbitrary date restriction on new stem cell lines would freeze progress by denying NIH researchers access to new lines that might hold the key to medical breakthroughs  These fears have proven well founded     Since the restrictions were imposed  scientists working overseas or with limited private funds have developed new lines with exceptional promise for research  For example  Dr  Douglas Melton at Harvard has derived 17 new stem cell lines with improved techniques  Scientists at the University of California have shown that stem cells can be derived without contamination from animal cells  And doctors in Israel have developed stem cell lines that have genetic traits with the potential of treating hereditary diseases  such as muscular dystrophy  These astonishing breakthroughs could lead to new cures and new understanding of these disorders  but the Administrations restrictions bar NIH from supporting research to explore their promise   To unlock the healing power of stem cell research  the first action our legislation takes is to end the ban that keeps NIH from supporting research on new stem cell lines    But science without ethics is like a ship without a compass  Strong ethical guidance is needed to ensure that scientific progress follows the moral course that we as a society set  For this reason  the second major action that our legislation takes is to establish ethical safeguards for stem cell research    And once again allowing NIH to lead stem cell research  we bring more research under the strong ethical standards that are part of every NIH grant for any kind of medical research  The bedrock principles of these standards are informed consent of the patient and approval of an ethics committee  In addition  when it comes to stem cell research  our legislation requires NIH to go beyond these general requirements  and requires NIH to issue specific standards for stem cell research    Before the NIH stem cell research program was terminated in the early days of the Bush Administration  it had developed an extensive and robust ethical framework for the research    These requirements include an extra level of review to assure that all research was conducted according to special protections applicable to stem cell research  They limit research only to cells derived from embryos from fertility clinics that were never to be used to initiate a pregnancy  and were likely to be discarded  They prohibit payment for donation of cells  They forbid improper inducements to donate embryos to further ensure that all cells used for research must come from embryos that would not be used to initiate a pregnancy    I want to take a moment to discuss this last point in detail  Even with the intense debate on stem cells over the last five years  there remains some confusion about the source of stem cells  The cells are not derived from fetuses  they are not from embryos that might otherwise have been used to start a pregnancy     Our legislation explicitly requires the stem cells to be derived from human embryos that have been donated from in vitro fertilization clinics  were created for the purposes of fertility treatment  and were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such treatment     In fertility clinics around the country  there are thousands of embryos that are simply thrown away  Hundreds of thousands more are frozen  and never used  They are not the result of a pregnancy  They are not the product of an abortion or a miscarriage  The only way they can produce life is to be implanted in a woman  and these embryos that we propose to save for research have not been and will not be  We believe that it is better to save embryos that would otherwise be destroyed so that they can give the gift of life to patients who are suffering  Life is too precious to allow an opportunity to cure illness to be simply thrown away    Some say that this debate is only about science  and that it is not a moral choice  I disagree  A vote on this bill involves a deeply moral choice  It is a choice between making progress toward better treatments for patients  or spurning a chance for new cures  There are deeply moral people on both sides of this debate  but I am convinced that medical progress is the right choice    Weve faced similar choices many times in the past  In the 1970 s  Congress was considering whether to ban research on recombinant DNA  the very foundation of biotechnology  Then  as now  some raised ethical concerns over dismissed the promise of this research as a pipe dream  and urged Congress to forbid it  In the 1980s  Congress made the right choice again  by rejecting attempts to outlaw IVF  a technique that has fulfilled the hopes and dreams of thousands of parents who would never have been able to have a child otherwise    Other forms of medical progress brought similar controversy  Transplantation  blood transfusion  even vaccines  all of these breakthroughs were once new and controversial  with strong voices raised against them  All were discussed and debated  and eventually adopted in ways that are consistent with Americas values  Each time we looked to the future and saw the potential of controversial research  we chose progress  and the benefits have been immense     We should make the same choice on stem cell research  We should not allow the misplaced fears of today to deny patients the cures of tomorrow    Some argue that we should support research on adult stem cells  or stem cells from umbilical cords  or stem cells derived using new genetic techniques  I agree  We should leave no stone unturned in the search for new cures  Perhaps some cures will come from one technique and other breakthroughs from another  Let s encourage our scientists to explore every avenue that is ethical and could lead to progress    But there is no sense in closing the door on one of the most promising areas of medical research discovered in decades  while we wait for other less hopeful methods to show success or failure  That is not my assessment  it s the judgment of every major scientific leader in America  According to a letter by 80 Nobel Laureates  For disorders that prove not to be treatable with adult stem cells  impeding human pluripotent stem cell research risks unnecessary delay for millions of patients who may die or endure needless suffering while the effectiveness of adult stem cells is evaluated     The Institute of Medicine was just as clear on the need for embryonic stem cell research  Adult stem cells from bone marrow have so far provided most of the examples of successful therapies for replacement of diseased or destroyed cells  Their potential for fully differentiating into other cell types  such as brain  nerve  and pancreas cells  is still poorly understood and remains to be clarified  In contrast  embryonic stem cells studied in animals clearly are capable of developing into multiple tissue types and capable of long term self renewal in culture  features that have not yet been demonstrated with many adult stem cells    In a letter to the Senate Appropriations committee  Dr  Elias Zerhouni  Director of the NIH  said  It is clear that more cell lines would be helpful in ensuring expeditious progress in this important field of science  His conclusions were echoed by other NIH Institute Directors  such as Dr  Elizabeth Nabel  head of the NIH Institute on Heart  Lung and Blood Disorders  who said  The limitations of existing cell lines are hindering scientific progress among a community that is very eager to move forward in this promising area     The judgment of the nation s scientific leaders could not be clearer or more emphatic  Yes  we should study adult stem cells  and stem cells from cord blood  and cells from genetically altered embryos  But we must not exclude the research that the best scientific judgment finds most promising  Let s let science decide which approach works best for patients       But in the end  this debate is not about abstract principles or complex terms of science  It s about the people who look with hope to stem cell research to help them with the challenges they face    Two years ago  I held a forum in Boston on the promise of stem cell research  One of the participants was Moira McCarthy Stanford from Plymouth  Massachusetts  whose 14 year old daughter  Lauren  has juvenile diabetes  I would like to end my remarks today with the letter that Lauren wrote to me  They explain  far more eloquently than any Senator could  the urgent need to pass this legislation  These are Lauren s words    For as long as I can remember  Ive had to take a lot of leaps of faith  Ive had to believe my parents when they told me taking four or five shots and day and pricking my finger eight or more times a day was just a new kind of normal  Ive had to just smile and say Im fine when a high blood sugar or low blood sugar forced me to the sidelines in a big soccer game  or into the base lodge on a perfect ski day  or out of the pool during a swim meet     But when I watched  with my parents  President Bushs decision on Stem Cell research in the summer of 2001  I just could not accept it  You see the one thing that has helped me accept all Ive had to accept these years is the presence of hope  Hope keeps me going      That night  President Bush talked about protecting the innocent  I wondered then  what about me  I am truly innocent in this situation  I did nothing to bring my diabetes on  there is nothing I can do to make it any better  All I can do is hope for a research breakthrough and keep living the difficult  demanding life of a child with diabetes until that breakthrough comes  How  I asked my parents  is it more important to throw discarded embryos into the trash than it is to let them be used to hopefully save my life    I am so happy to hear that the Senate is thinking of passing HR 810  I can dream again  dream of that great time when I write a thank you letter to the Senate  the House and everyone who helped me become just another girl  a girl who dreamed and hoped and one day  got just what she wanted  her health and future  Thats all Im really asking for     Those are Lauren s words  and they command us to act  Tomorrow  we must cast a vote of conscience and of courage  We must reaffirm that our common value of bringing hope to those who need it outweighs any single ideology  we must approve the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  and we must call upon the President of the United States not to veto hope     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
