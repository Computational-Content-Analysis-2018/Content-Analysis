         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C     Today Senator Edward Kennedy  Senator John Corzine and Representative Anthony Weiner introduced the Health Care Accountability Act  The bill would require states to report annually on the number of employees of large companies who receive health coverage through taxpayer funded health care and not employer based plans  More than 600 000 Wal Mart workers are forced to get health insurance coverage from the government or through their spouses  plans  Medicaid and CHIP provide a critical safety net for low income women and children  the disabled  and the elderly  Senator Kennedy said  They should not also have to underwrite the profits for large companies like Wal Mart  There s plenty for the Executive Suite  but it s time for a fair share for employees  pay and benefits  too Increasingly  large companies such as Walmart refuse to give their employees adequate health benefits forcing working men and women to rely on Medicaid as their safety net  This growing problem is caused by an increase in low income  temporary  and part time workers  a decreasing number of employees in unions  and a decline in good jobs in sectors like manufacturing  The data collected from the 15 states that require disclosure demonstrates that Wal Mart is the biggest abuser of taxpayer subsidized health care   costing taxpayers more than  210 million  including  61 million in Florida   47 million in Tennessee   32 million in California and  3 million in Massachusetts  This bill would shine the light on the unfair practices of some companies and let the American people know how much their state is paying for the benefits of fully employed workers  For too long the debate over the influence of Wal Mart on the economy has been based on a less than complete analysis of the cost to taxpayers of employers who reduce prices  in part  by shifting the cost of health care to the cities and states in which they operate  said Rep  Weiner  This legislation will allow us to paint a fuller picture of the Wal Mart debate than a superficial examination of the price of a pair of jeans  Meaningful bankruptcy reform cannot occur without honest health care  said Senator Jon S  Corzine  In New Jersey alone  over twenty thousand families sat at their kitchen tables and begrudgingly declared bankruptcy because of swelling medical costs  That s not right and we should do something about that  But making it harder for these decent people to declare bankruptcy is the wrong way to go Below are key facts about Wal Mart and the Healthcare Accountability Act KEY FACTS  Wal Mart and Health Care AccountabilityGeneral   Wal Mart operates 3 400 stores across the U S   with stores in all 50 states  and 1 300 stores internationally  Employs 1 6 million workers in the U S   Ranked number one by Fortune magazine as the world s most powerful company 2004 Revenues   288 billion 2004 Profit   10 billion  a 13  increase over 2003  Wal Mart business strategy includes extensive expansion of its operations  which is supported my millions of dollars in tax payer financed subsidies negotiated with state and local governmentsWorkers  Income   Full time is defined as 34 hours per week  Wal Mart employees earn  on average   7 50 to  8 50 per hour Full time employee at  8 per hour    272 weekly    14 144 per year Poverty guideline for family of three    15 219  8 an hour Wal Mart worker is below poverty guideline  and therefore eligible for food stamps  Average wage of non supervisory retail trade worker   10 04 per hour  Former Wal Mart managers have stated that they were forced to lower wage costs by deleting hours or forcing employees to work off the clock  In Oregon  a jury found in favor of 400 Wal Mart workers  representing 27 different stores   who sued the company for unpaid  off the clock overtimeHealth Coverage   Only 41 46  of Wal Mart employees are insured under the company plan  Nationally  68  of U S  workers at large firms have employer sponsored insurance  Low insurance coverage participation rates are due to Wal Mart s benefit policies which  1  specifically deny coverage to some employees  and 2  make it too expensive to purchase for others   Wal Mart requires full time workers to wait 6 months before they become eligible to buy into the Wal Mart medical plans  and 2 years for part timers  Average waiting period at large firms is just 1 3 months  Part time workers can never buy family coverage under the Wal Mart plan  workers who slip from full time to part time status lose family coverage   Out of pocket expenses for Wal Mart plans include  Monthly premiums  Family   143 54    249 71  Single   33 04    72 04 Annual deductibles   350    1 000 per person Co payments  vary  In 2001  Wal Mart workers paid 42  of the total cost of plan  up from 36  in 1999  In Massachusetts last year  Wal Mart worker paid 48  of the total cost of the plan  Typical employee of large company pays only 16  of total premium for single coverage and 24  for family  In 2002  Wal Mart spent an average of  3 500 per employee for health care coverage  Nationally  average spending per employee in the wholesale retailing sector was  4 800  average spending by U S  employers in general was  5 600 per employee  Full time workers hired in 1998 or later are required to pay a  50 surcharge every two weeks to buy coverage for spouses who are eligible for medical coverage through his or her employer  this can double the premium cost of spousal coverage under Wal Mart s least expensive plan  depending on deductible   Wal Mart does not cover costs of preventive or wellness care  except under limited circumstancesKEY FACTS  Health Care AccountabilitySOURCE  Glied  Lambrew  and Little  The Commonwealth Fund Report    The Growing Share of Unemployed Workers Employed by Large Firms  Oct  2003  A significant proportion of the nation s uninsured are workers in large firms  500  employees   or their family members  In 2001  this population represented 26  of the nation s uninsured  totaling 9 6 million people  This number exceeded the number of low income  uninsured children targeted by the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   6 3 million   the number of unemployed adults who are uninsured  3 9 million   and the number of older adults ages 55 to 64 lacking insurance  3 2 million  in that year  This number is also higher than the number of uninsured  4 million  who would benefit from the president s individual tax credit proposal  The trends show that this population will continue to grow  Although uninsured rates have risen at firms of all sizes  they have risen fastest among large employer workers  From 1987 to 2001  the rate of uninsured workers in large firms increased by 57   while the rate of uninsured workers in small and mid sized firms increased 25  and 27  respectively  The uninsured in large firms have disproportionately low incomes  Per analysis of the CPS data  1988 2002   46  of low income workers in large firms are uninsured for some time during a year  while only 14  of middle  and 8  of high income workers in large firms are uninsured  Low income workers in large firms are less likely to be offered employer sponsored insurance than higher income workers in the same firms  The disparities in employer sponsored coverage by wage level have been growing  and are expected to continue growing as large firms have been shifting toward a lower income workforce  The three basic explanations for why workers may not have health insurance include  they declined coverage when offered  they are not eligible for the coverage offered  or their firm doesn t offer health insurance benefits  The majority of large firms offer health insurance  however   Kaiser HRET  surveys suggest the majority of uninsured workers at these firms were not offered health coverage  In 1998  71  of uninsured workers in large firms weren t offered coverage by their employers  Compared with insured workers in large firms  uninsured workers are more likely to work part time  however  the majority of uninsured workers do work full time  68    2002 CPS data   Researchers suggest the potential reasons for this growing problem include advocates  traditionally secured health benefits for workers   A decline in manufacturing jobs  This sector was most likely to offer jobs with health coverage  perhaps due to greater historical presence of unionized workers   An increase in the number of small establishments within larger firms  i e   franchises   Per Census data  these small establishments are less likely to offer coverage than single establishment firms of the same size  SOURCE  AFL CIO and Good Jobs First www goodjobsfirst org  accessed via AFL CIO website The number of Americans insured by employer sponsored insurance has dropped due to two main causes  a rise in the number of jobs that do not provide coverage at all and growth in the number of workers who decline coverage because it is too expensive  Firms are passing on higher health care costs to employees  making coverage increasingly unaffordable for low income workers    According to the September 2003 KFF report  the amount of the monthly premium employees pay for family coverage has increased nearly 50   Cost shifting in the form of co pays and deductibles also increases the cost of care to employees  which hits low income families and those with high medical costs the hardest  The growing low income workforce is faced with the unavailability  and  or unaffordability of health coverage on the job  This trend places added burden on public programs that are already under stress due to fiscal constraints   Laura Capps  202  224 2633
