who suffered a workplace respiratory illness    Below is Senator Kennedys full press statement  as prepared for delivery  This week  on Workers Memorial Day  we remember those who have been killed or injured on the job  and we reaffirm our commitment to workers and their families to do all we can to end these senseless tragedies  Weve made progress in protecting worker safety since we passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act in 1970  But too many workers still are not safe  In 2005 alone  over 5 700 workers were killed on the job  Over 4 million became ill or were injured  Thats nearly 16 deaths and 12 000 workplace injuries or illnesses each and every day  Last year  the tragic deaths of miners at Sago and Alma mines showed us the gaps and shortcomings in mine safety  Across the country  America saw the senseless deaths of workers and the suffering of their families and friends  Every day  workers in other industries are facing equally dangerous conditions  Those dangers may not make headlines  but they continue to threaten workers health  their lives  and their families security  To the family members here todaywe are honored by your presence  You  more than anyone  know the dangers that workers face  We grieve for your loss  which is our loss as well  We think of the thousands of families across the country who have lost loved ones or who care for those injured on the job  We pledge to continue the battle so that others will not share your pain  Today  we are issuing a report telling the stories of workers who have suffered and died on the job  Their stories show us what needs to be done  They make clear its time to act  We need to fill the gaps and correct the shortcomings in todays rules and make worker safety a priority again in Congress  One of the most obvious problems is that literally millions of employees today are not covered by our safety laws  Too many other firms blatantly ignore the law and refuse to do what is necessary to keep their employees safe  Too often  as well  we find that those responsible for administering our safety laws arent doing their job not issuing new safety standards  not vigorously enforcing the law  and not even going after the worst offenders Congress can take concrete steps to address many of the failures  Thats why today we are reintroducing the Protecting Americas Workers Act  This legislation expands the coverage of our safety laws to protect 8 6 million more Americans  It tells those who enforce our safety laws to get the job done  to investigate more cases  to be more accountable to the public  and to correct job hazards beforenot after workers are killed or injured  It also protects workers who speak up about unsafe conditions on the job  and it adds important new penalties for violating the law Beyond this legislation  we must also find new and smarter ways of keeping workers safe  We must shine a light on OSHA to ensure that our safety laws are implemented the way they were intendedto protect workers by preventing hazards on the job  The Administration needs to put workers first and get the job done  Its time to send a message to those who put their employees in harms way that life and health must be valued above profit and greed  This is a new day and a new Congress  Its time to redouble our efforts and make our commitment a reality  Its time for Congress to act  so that the hardworking men and women of our country get what they deserve at lastthe security of a safe and healthy workplace   Below is a summary of the billPROTECTING AMERICAS WORKERS ACTSince the Occupational Safety and Health Act  OSHA  passed 37 years ago  we have made great progress toward providing every American worker with a safe work environment  But much more needs to be done  Too many workers are still being injured and even killed on the job  In 2005 alone  over 5 700 workers were killed at work  and 4 2 million workers were injured  Across this country  thats an average of 16 workers who die every day  and nearly 12 000 who are injured  And some are at even greater riskHispanic workers are almost 20 percent more likely to be killed on the job  The Protecting Americas Workers Act honors the memory of those who have died at work by expanding and strengthening our workplace safety law  It amends OSHA to cover more workers  increase penalties  strengthen protections  enhance public accountability  and clarify an employers duty to provide safety equipment  Covers more workers   Over 8 5 million American workers are not covered by OSHAs protections  These include federal  state  and local public employees  and some private sector employees  The bill provides OSHA protections to these workers  which include flight attendants  state correctional officers  and workers in government agencies Increases penalties for those who break the law   Under current law  an employer may be chargedat mostwith a misdemeanor when a willful violation of OSHA leads to a workers death   The bill makes felony charges available for an employers repeated and willful violations of OSHA that result in a workers death or serious injury   The bill also updates OSHA civil penaltieswhich been unchanged since 1990and sets a minimum penalty of  50 000 for a workers death caused by a willful violation  Protects workers who blow the whistle on unsafe conditions in the workplace  OSHA whistleblower provisions have not been updated since their adoption in 1970   The bill updates those whistleblower protections by incorporating successful administrative procedures adopted in other laws  like the Surface Transportation Act  Enhances the publics right to know about safety violations  The bill improves public accountability and transparency  o It mandates DOL to investigate all cases of death or serious incidents of injury  o It gives workers and their families the right to meet with DOL investigators o And it requires employers to inform workers of their OSHA rights Clarifies an employers duty to provide safety equipment   The bill clarifies that employers are required to provide the necessary safety equipment to their workers  such as personal protective equipment       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
