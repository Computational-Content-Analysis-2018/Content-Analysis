         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Washington  D C    Today  Senator Frist moved to vitiate the cloture vote on Richard Stickler  Senator Kennedy opposed Senator Frist s motion and demanded that the vote on Mr  Stickler s nomination occur as planned or be assured that the Bush Administration would not recess appoint Mr  Stickler  This afternoon  Senator Frist agreed that if the White House were to move to recess appoint Mr  Stickler  that a vote in the United States Senate would occur first   Senator Kennedy said  The Republican leaderships decision to cancel the vote on the Stickler nomination today shows growing consensus that the nations coal miners and their families deserve much better    Mr  Stickler has a troubling history of bending the rules for mine companies and looking the other way when it comes to the safety of mine workers  Too many brave coal miners have lost their lives in recent months to allow a nominee with his record to go forward   I urge President Bush to reconsider and to nominate someone to this crucial position who is a proven champion for mine workers safety   BACKGROUND ON RICHARD STICKLER      Mr  Stickler has spent the overwhelming part of his career as a coal industry executive  focused on profits and production  not on worker safety   In fact  mines where he was in charge had injury rates far above the national average  When he was Senior Manager at the Eagles Next Mine in Van  West Virginia  the injury rate was almost three times the national average   While he ran the Marianna Mine from 1983 to 1987 the injury rate climbed dramatically during this tenure   And  two miners were killed at Mine 84 in Pennsylvania while he was in charge        During his tenure as head of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Deep Mine Safety  he was well known for granting exceptions from safety rules for mining companies   He even bent critical rules designed to prevent mien fires on conveyor belts and to guarantee that miners could reach safe places to protect themselves from runaway railcars   One mine inspector called Sticklers special favors for the coal industry  a detriment to safety         that would  without a doubt  make the coal industry less safe for two thirds of its workers       Stickler was also in charge when the terrible accident at Quecreek occurred  trapping nine men underground in a flooded mine shaft for more than three days   That accident should have been a clarion call for the need to dramatically improve mine safety   The lessons of Quecreek mean that Mr  Stickler  more than anyone  should have known of the need to overhaul our mine safety  and particularly emergency rescue laws       But when Stickler testified on his nomination before our Labor Committee this spring  he displayed total apathy about the plight of coal miners and their safety   His testimony followed the tragic accidents at the Sago and Alma mines   Men had just died in the coals mines   Time and again  his response to the most pressing questions on mine safety was that he needed to think about it       Most incredible of all  when asked at his hearing about whether mine safety laws needed reform  he said that he thinks the laws are generally adequate       Sticklers nomination is opposed by the people who have the most to lose with a weak mine safety leader  the families of coal miners themselves   Senator Kennedy has received letters from family members in West Virginia  Kentucky  and Alabama  urging this Congress to oppose this nomination       The following unions have come out against the nomination   AFL CIO  United Mine Workers of America  United Steelworkers  International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  and the International Brothers of Boilermakers         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
