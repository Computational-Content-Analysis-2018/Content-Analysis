         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Vice President Cheney claims it s dishonest and reprehensible for critics to suggest the President misled the nation into war  In fact  the only thing dishonest and reprehensible is the way the Administration distorted  misrepresented and manipulated the intelligence to justify a war America never should have fought    It defies belief that the Vice President can continue to say with a straight face that Congress had the same intelligence as the President and Vice President had as we went to war  Congress did not have access to the Presidential Daily Briefs that President Bush received on intelligence since the beginning of his Administration  We need to know what was actually in those PDBs  which is why I am planning to offer an amendment requiring the Administration to turn them over to Congress    Vice President Cheney says  any suggestion that prewar information was distorted  hyped  or fabricated by the leader of the nation is utterly false  But the Vice President carefully doesn t say whether he or someone else distorted  hyped or fabricated that information and fed it to the President    Congress and the American people deserve truth and honesty from their government  It s time for the Administration to tell the truth about how and why we went to war in Iraq   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
