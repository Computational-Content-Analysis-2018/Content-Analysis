         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  One of the most profound economic shifts of the past century has been the entry of vast numbers of women into the workforce   In 1900  women made up only 18  of the working population  Today  more than 46  of our workers are women  Nearly three quarters of all mothers are in the labor force  and nearly four million women hold multiple jobs in order to provide adequately for their families   Although Americas women are working harder than ever  theyre not being fairly compensated for their contributions to our economy   Today  women earn 77 cents for each dollar earned by men  and the gap is even greater for women of color   African American women earn only 67 percent of what white men earn  and Hispanic women earn only 56 percent   Women are routinely paid less than men for performing the same jobs  and occupations dominated by women tend to be lower paying than male dominated occupations  even when the skill sets required are the same   The problem is not getting better   This years wage gap of 23 cents is the same as it was in 2002   Since 1963  when the Equal Pay Act was passed  the wage gap has narrowed by less than half of a cent a year   At that rate  women wont achieve fairness in the workplace for at least another 50 years   Thats unacceptable in the 21st century   Its true that the wage gap is caused in part by how society deals with the realities of working womens lives   Many women have to take time out from the workforce to care for children or other family members  and these gaps in employment can permanently reduce their future earnings     Its an unfortunate reality  but it shouldnt have to be this way   No one should have to give up fair treatment in the workplace in order to have children or care for elderly parents   We also cant blame the pay gap exclusively on womens dominant role in childcare   Outright gender discrimination also accounts for the disparity between men and womens pay   Theres ample evidence of such discrimination   Multiple studies  including a study by the Census Bureau in 2004  a General Accounting Office report in 2003  and a 2006 study by the Maryland Department of Labor  Licensing  and Regulation  have examined the gap in earnings between men and women and all reached the same conclusion  This gap cannot be explained by differences in education  tenure in the workforce  working patterns  or occupation   Gender discrimination alone causes a significant portion of the pay gap  and it illustrates the continued prevalence of discrimination against women in our society   Its appalling that such discrimination still exists in America   Its preventing working women from achieving their full potential  and Congress needs to act now to bring fairness to the workplace Women are not getting paid equally for doing the same jobs as men  Its illegal and its unacceptable  but it happens every day   There are too many gaps in the law  and too many barriers to effective enforcement Senator Clintons Paycheck Fairness Act will give Americas working women the support they need to fight for equal pay   It will make sure our fair pay laws apply to everyone  and it will strengthen the penalties for employers who are not obeying the law  These basic reforms are long overdue  and I urge my colleagues on the Committee to support this important legislation Equal pay for equal work is a key part of the solution   But we also need to deal with the problem that our economy often undervalues and therefore underpays work done by women  particularly women of color   Women are not getting paid what they are worth for doing jobs that may be different than those performed by men  but are of equal value to the employer Senator Harkins Fair Pay Act addresses this challenge   It will require employers to provide equal pay for jobs that are comparable in skill  effort  responsibility  and working conditions   It will give workers the information they need to determine whether female dominated jobs are being under valued  and it provides a remedy for workers who are victims of such systemic discrimination   It is the second key step on the path to workplace fairness  and it deserves our strong support as well I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about these important proposals and other ideas for closing the wage gap   Americas working women deserve full fairness on the job  and todays hearing is a step in the right direction        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
