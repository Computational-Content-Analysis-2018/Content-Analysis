         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I commend Senator Murray for holding this hearing on these safety issues so vital to the lives of Americas miners  their families  and their communities   Mining is an essential industry  and our miners deserve the safest possible working conditions   One year ago  the Senate passed the MINER Actthe most comprehensive reform of our mine safety laws in a generation   The Act addressed the critical lapses in mine safety so clearly demonstrated by the tragedies at Sago  Alma  and Darby mines   Now its time assess what progress has been made  and begin to look at further steps that may be needed to improve mine safety We must do everything we can to see that not a single life is lost due to ineffective administration or enforcement of our mining laws  outdated technology  or inadequate safety standards   Legislation is ineffective if it is undercut by weak regulations or lax enforcement  or if it is not carried out with the sense of urgency and purpose necessary to make the promise of the law a reality   We cannot bring back the brave miners who died last year   But we can honor them best by ensuring that our mines are as safe as possible   Congress should not settle for less        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
