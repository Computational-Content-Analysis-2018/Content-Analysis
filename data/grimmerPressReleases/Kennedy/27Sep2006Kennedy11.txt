         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   I thank the Senator  Mr  President  its entirely appropriate that we take these few moments here on the floor of the United States Senate to listen carefully and take the measure of an extraordinary Senator  Senator Jim Jeffords  In these next several weeks  this nation is going to be focused in many  many states on trying to select who is going to represent them in the United States Senate  And if the people of those states just took a few moments to listen to the eloquence of this Senator  they would know what the standard should be in selecting someone to represent them in this body  Its Jim Jeffords  He sets the standard  So we thank Jim Jeffords for his service    his service to the state of Vermont and his service to all of our states and to the country  We thank him for that service   We also thank the people of Vermont for their wisdom in selecting this extraordinary talent and giving him the kind of support that they gave over a long and distinguished career  especially in those times when he was willing to take positions and stand up on issues as a matter of conscience  They understood their native son  They respected him  and they supported him  So thank you to the voters of Vermont    Thank you to his family  Elizabeth that Senator Jeffords mentioned  Laura  and Leonard    a family that gave him great support  I think those of us who have been fortunate enough to know that family and meet that family understand what a strong influence it his been in terms of his service   And thank you  Senator Jeffords  for that simple eloquence that we heard from you today on the floor of the United States Senate  going back into the history of our country  providing inspiration as we listen to you talk about the history of the nation  mentioning with great pride the role of Vermonters in the time of the Civil War    and his understanding of history  talking about the Greatest Generation  which were inspiring figures to him and many of us continuing to the present    He typically understated his own achievements and accomplishments  I think many of us on this floor are well familiar with them  I certainly am as some who has had the good opportunity to serve with him on the Education Committee  I know the difference that he has made in the education of children in this country  particularly those with special needs  accomplishments which are memorable and historical  He mentioned just causally his interest in the education of the children here in the District of Columbia  A number of us who are here on the floor now remember Jim Jeffords speaking in our caucus not many years ago how that we as members of the United States Senate who happen to either live here in the District or work here  even though were working in this body  have a responsibility for the education of the children here  He was the inspiration of a program  a literacy program called Everybody Wins   And Jim Jeffords led a number of us to Brent School here near the Capitol to read with the second and third graders each week to ensure that those children were going to have an opportunity to learn to read  It was just a simple illustration  once again  that Jim Jeffords doesnt just talk the talk  he walks the walk  And on so many different times  he has been there doing just that  So  Jim  we admire your service  You have demonstrated here    and we dont understand perhaps well enough    that you can speak with a quiet and soft voice  but you speak with a great passion and a compelling argument  and with a simplicity and effectiveness that has enriched and enhanced the quality of life and opportunity  particularly for children but also for all Americans  Its a distinguished career  and its one I know that you should be    and are  proud of  All of us have had our own lives enriched and inspired because of our friendship with you and the type of Senator you have been     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
