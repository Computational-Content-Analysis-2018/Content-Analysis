         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senators Kennedy and Salazar joined the Reverend Luis Cortes  President of Esperanza USA  in a policy briefing with dozens of Hispanic Evangelical broadcasters  journalists  and newspaper owners  They discussed the immigration reform bill on the floor of the United States Senate this week and shared their views that the price of inaction is too high  Esperanza is the largest Hispanic Evangelical organization in the country  consisting of a network of over 10 000 Hispanic congregations  faith and community based agencies Below is Senator Kennedys statement  as prepared for delivery  This bill presents the best chance will have in years to secure our borders and bring millions of people out of the shadows and into the sunshine of America  We must act  and act now   Opportunities like this dont arise often  and we have to take advantage of this one  the price of inaction is too high  Too many people dying in the desert  too many employers abusing the system and hurting American workers  too many years of broken borders  If we dont take this on now it will be years before we can again Comprehensive immigration reform is a moral imperative  Although we pride ourselves on being a nation of immigrants  we have repeatedly failed to welcome the stranger in our midst  We defy our history and our heritage when millions of immigrants are relegated to second class citizenship  exploited in the workplace  or forced to live in constant fear of deportation  How we solve these problems is a test of our own humanity The elements of our system are inextricably intertwined  and we cant fix one without fixing the others  By legalizing the current undocumented population  we will be able to focus our enforcement efforts on people who pose a real threat to our national security  By creating a temporary worker program that fulfills the needs of Americas businesses  we can begin to stem the flow of illegal immigration  The bill also creates a robust employment verification system that increases penalties against employers who continue to hire undocumented workers Family reunification will remain the cornerstone of legal immigration under the bill  For the next 8 years  family based immigration will total 1 1 million legal immigrants  which is approximately 80  of all legal immigration  After we have reduced the existing backlogs  more than half of our future immigration will be based on family ties  If you are a U S  citizen or a legal immigrant  you can bring your spouse  your minor children  and your parents here to join you The remaining visas will be allocated based on a point system that factors in preferences for both high and low skilled workers  as well as extended family ties  About 20  will be reserved for refugees who desperately need safe haven in our country Although this bill is not perfect  it fulfills our core goals  border security  interior enforcement  effective employment verification  a temporary worker program with strong labor protections  a commitment to family based immigration  and an earned legalization program  I hope that you and your congregations will support the bill as the process moves forward       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
