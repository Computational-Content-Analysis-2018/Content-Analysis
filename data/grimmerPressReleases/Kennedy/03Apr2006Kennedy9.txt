         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Immigration is the story of American history  From the earliest days of our nation  generation upon generation of immigrants has come to be part of a land that offers freedom and opportunity to those willing to do their part  Immigrants built our great cities  They cultivated our rich farm lands  They built the railroads and highways that bind America from sea to shining sea  They erected houses of worship to practice their faiths  They fought under America s colors in our wars  In fact  60 000 immigrants are fighting in the U S  armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan today  Immigrants worked hard so that their children could embrace the ever widening possibilities in our land  And over the centuries  immigrants came to America from every part of the globe and made the American dream  They created a nation that is the envy of the world    That is our history   But it is also our present and our future      We heard the moving immigration story anew here in the Senate just last week as Senator Domenici eloquently described his family s immigrant roots  He told how his parents came from Italy with nothing  His father earned his citizenship through his service in the U S  Army in the First World War  His mother remained an undocumented immigrant until much later in life  In fact  she was arrested by the immigration authorities many years after coming to America  but she was able to gain legal status  remain in the country and later become a citizen  The Domenicis worked hard  learned English  built a successful grocery business  and their children went on to have successful professional careers  And as we know  one became a distinguished and respected United States Senator     Last week we also heard from Senator Martinez of Florida of his family s flight from Cuba to begin new lives in America  Young Mel Martinez was 15 years old when his family escaped from Cuba to seek a new life of freedom  Like millions before him  his family worked hard  learned English  and earned their success in Florida  And today  Mel Martinez not only was a cabinet secretary in the Administration  but was elected by the people of Florida to serve as their United States Senator    There are some in the United States Senate who seem to believe that immigrants are just criminals  In fact  the Frist bill that s before the Senate declares that all undocumented immigrants are criminals  The Frist bill would have declared Senator Domenici s mother to be a criminal and the Kyl amendment would disqualify her from earning American citizenship     The facts tell a different story  Immigrants    including undocumented immigrants    continue to strengthen the fabric of America in thousands of different ways  As David Brooks observed in his column last week in the New York Times  Hispanic Americans and Hispanic immigrants in particular are less likely to divorce  Husbands and wives stay together and raise their children  Even though they may have less money than other Americans  they spend almost twice as much on music for their children  they spend more on gifts and family get togethers  and they are more likely to support their elderly parents     And the path of progress that we witnessed with the Martinez and Domenici families is familiar even today  By the second generation  most immigrant families have reached the middle class and they pay more than enough taxes to make up for the costs of their parents  generation  By the third generation  90 percent of the grandchildren of Hispanic immigrants speak English fluently  and 50 percent of them marry non Hispanics  These patterns of assimilation are identical to those that characterized the children and grandchildren of Southern and Eastern European immigrants who came to the United States 100 years ago  and to the assimilation of German and Irish immigrants who came here 50 years before that     In many ways  our economy is more dependent on immigration than ever before  The arrival of new and young immigrant workers helps explain why America s economy grows faster than most of the aging European nations  According to the Aspen Institute  immigration will be the only source of growth in the prime age labor force in America in the next two decades  So America s choice really is between immigration and economic stagnation    However  even though immigration brings many benefits  there is no doubt that our current system is broken and fails to protect us and meet our nation s needs  Our borders are out of control at a time of heightened concern about terrorism  Millions cross our borders and remain illegally  creating an underground society that is subject to abuse and that harms American wages and working conditions  Millions more enter through our airports and seaports as visitors  but remain long after their visas expire  They come and remain because they wish to work and contribute  and our employers continue to offer them jobs  As a result  more than 11 million undocumented immigrants are living and working in America today    Many in Congress suggest that the answer is simply more enforcement  Just build more fences and hire more patrols and it will solve the problem    But we ve tried that before and failed  We ve spent more than  20 billion over the past decade to build fences and triple our border patrols  but illegal immigration went up  not down  In the 1980s  the rate of illegal immigration was 40 000 people a year  Today it s more than half a million  And the probability that a border crosser will be apprehended has plummeted from 20 percent a decade ago to just five percent today    An enforcement only approach to solving our immigration problems may make a good campaign slogan  But in reality  it s a failed strategy that threatens our security and threatens American wages    That s why Senator McCain and I have proposed a comprehensive  common sense plan to make a real difference    An effective immigration strategy must have three parts    First  we must enhance and modernize our immigration enforcement capabilities  both at our borders and at worksites  To accomplish this     Our bill enhances our capacity to monitor immigration flows and stop illegal entry  To do this  it doubles the number of Border Patrol agents over the next five years  And it builds roads  fences  and vehicle barriers in specific high flow areas  adds significant new technology at the border to create a robust virtual fence  develops new land and water surveillance plans  authorizes new permanent highway checkpoints near the border  and expands the exit entry security system to all land borders and airports   Our bill increases our capacity to crack down on criminal syndicates that smuggle immigrants into the country and place them at great risk  To aid in this mission  it creates new federal penalties for constructing border tunnels  new criminal penalties for evading or refusing to obey commands of immigration officers  new criminal penalties for financial transactions related to money laundering or smuggling  And it creates new fraud proof biometric immigration documents  increase access to anti fraud detection resources  improve coordination among federal  state  local  and tribal efforts to combat alien smuggling   Our bill increases cooperation with Mexico to strengthen migration control at Mexico s southern border to deter migration from Central America through Mexico and into the United States  And it requires cooperation with other governments in the region to deter international gang activity   And our bill would reduce the job magnet in America by creating a universal electronic eligibility verification system which will allow employers to tell which individuals are authorized to work in the United States  It will substantially increase penalties against employers who fail to comply with eligibility verification rules and add 5 000 new enforcement agents to back up these provisions  Second  we must address the presence of the 11 million undocumented workers who are here now  It s clear that we re not going to send them back  Many have American citizen children and even grandchildren  and deporting them would rip families apart  The massive roundup of 11 million people would create havoc in our communities and cost  240 billion  It would require 200 000 buses in a convoy that would stretch from Alaska to San Diego  These families want to continue working and contributing to our communities  and we should give them that opportunity not by offering an amnesty  but by allowing them to earn the right to remain  So under our plan  to earn their legal status and eventually apply for citizenship  they must   Pay a  2000 fine   Work for six years   Pay their taxes   Learn English and civics   Pass rigorous criminal and security background checks  And get in the back of the line behind those who have been waiting patiently to qualify for green cards  Unfortunately  yesterday on television Senator Frist mischaracterized our common sense proposal  He called it an amnesty  when in fact nothing is forgiven  nothing is pardoned  Undocumented workers must earn the privilege of legal status and a path to American citizenship  And he said that our plan allows undocumented immigrants to jump to the front of the line  when our bill says plainly in black and white that they must wait in the back  We should conduct this debate based on fact  not fiction    thoughtful policy and not bumper sticker slogans  Earned legalization should not be available to criminal aliens and others who would undermine US security  but we must not be fooled by the amendment offered last week by Senators Kyl and Cornyn  Our bill already excludes from earned legalization criminal aliens and any immigrant representing a security risk to the United States  The Kyl Cornyn amendment would also exclude literally millions of undocumented immigrants already living and working in this country because they previously failed to depart following an order to do so  Our analysis of DHS and INS statistics suggests that fully 95  of immigrants affected by the Kyl Cornyn amendment would not be criminal aliens  but rather exactly the hard working immigrants and families this program is designed to bring out of the shadows  The third and final element of a successful immigration strategy is to address future immigration  We must provide a path to earned legalization for those already here  But we must also address the continuing needs of our employers for workers and the reality that people will continue to come here to improve their lives and contribute to America  In the past  we have largely ignored these realities  We have turned our heads as people have come here to work  and required them to remain in an underground economy  That head in the sand policy cannot be allowed to continue  It s harmful to these workers  who are subject to abuse by employers  It s harmful to employers  who never know if their workers may be sent home tomorrow  And most of all it s harmful to American workers  whose wages are cut because employers can get away with hiring undocumented workers at lower pay  Therefore  the plan that Senator McCain and I propose  and that was adopted by the Judiciary Committee  provides a strong and effective guestworker program for the future  It s far better for American workers if future immigrants come here legally  with rights to fair wages and working conditions  rather than having to compete with illegal workers who are paid sub standard wages  Isn t it better if an employer must pay an immigrant carpenter a standard wage    just like American workers    than a substandard wage that drives down wages for everyone else  That s what our guestworker program would do  It is estimated that the American economy demands about 400 000 new low skilled immigrants each year  but our current system grants only 5 000 visas to these workers  That s why we have more than 11 million undocumented workers today  There simply are not enough visas to go around  To meet future needs  our guestworker program takes the common sense step of starting with a 400 000 annual quota  and allows the quota to be adjusted up or down in future years based on the needs of the economy  Taking this realistic step would free up our enforcement efforts to focus not on those who yearn to breathe free  They should be welcomed as guestworkers who contribute to America  We should concentrate our enforcement resources on those would truly harm us    the criminals  the drug smugglers  and especially the terrorists  That should be the priority for our time  Enhanced enforcement  Earned legalization for those who are here  And a realistic guestworker program for the future    That s a plan for success  And the American people know it  It s a plan that Time magazine reports is supported by more than three quarters of the American people  And they support it because they know that our three part plan increases our security  respects our values  and strengthens our progress  In fact  poll after poll find that that between two thirds and three quarters of all Americans favor a new program to allow temporary visas for future essential workers  and an even higher proportion favor allowing undocumented immigrants in the United States to earn citizenship if they learn English  have a job and pay taxes    In contrast  in a Time magazine poll conducted last week just one in four Americans favored making illegal immigration a crime and preventing anyone who entered the country illegally from remaining in the United States or working here  The American people want real comprehensive reform  not just more immigration enforcement    All three of these changes are necessary if we are to address the root causes of undocumented immigration and break the cycle of illegality which now corrodes our immigration system  All three of these changes are necessary if we are to ensure that immigrant families today  as in the past  continue to live the American dream and contribute to our prosperity  our security  and our values  All three of these changes are necessary if we are to be true to our heritage as a nation of immigrants    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner
