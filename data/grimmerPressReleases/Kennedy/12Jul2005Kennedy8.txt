         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     President Bush met this morning with the leaders of the Senate and the Judiciary Committee  and I m sure we all have the same questions  Was this really the first step in a serious consultation process that will be meaningful and will continue in the days and weeks ahead  Will the process result in an effort to select nominees who can bring the nation and the Senate together instead of further dividing us    I believe  and sincerely hope  that the answer to those questions is yes  Consultation is more than a process it s about an outcome  I hope we are not just going through the motions  That will be up to the President  True consultation is not a one sided conversation  The President must share his thoughts with all of us as well  I firmly believe the nation wants and needs us to proceed in good faith and with open minds  The conditions are right for serious cooperation between the Senate and the Executive  whom the framers of the Constitution made jointly responsible for assuring the quality and independence of the federal judiciary    The President has won a second term and does not have to run again  He is freer to carry out his desire to be a uniter  not a divider  despite the pleas from the fringes of the party he leads     Notwithstanding the constant clamor from the right  the public obviously does not support extreme right wing positions on key court related issues  Most Americans opposed the effort by some in Congress to order the courts to intrude into private medical decisions in the Schiavo case  Most Americans also rejected the idea that 200 years of Senate history should be reversed in order to give a narrow Senate majority the absolute power to approve extreme judges    Our constituents wonder why we seem to spend so much time shouting angrily at one another  Washington has lost the respect of many Americans because of the atmosphere of confrontation and conflict that pervades Congress and the Executive Branch  They much prefer us to spend more time and thought on finding common ground  They know that their families  their local governments  their schools  and their own businesses  could not function if they operated in the kind of hostile  polarized environment that often seems to prevail on issues here    Since the selection of judges is an area where the Constitutional framers placed the decision in the hands of the Senate and the President  we have a special obligation to make choices and take positions that facilitate cooperation and consensus  and avoid choices and positions that provoke confrontation and conflict     History demonstrates that the Senate and the President can work together on judicial nominations  especially Supreme Court justices  Many of us have been here for the nominations of numerous new Justices    in my case 18 of them  On 13 of those  there was a consensus  with close to 90  or more of the Senators voting for confirmation    on 5 there was unanimous consent in the Senate    It is not difficult to achieve that kind of consensus  We know what the Court needs and what the country expects  Nominees should be excellent lawyers who respect the constitution  understand the law  and understand and respect the vital role of the judiciary in our government  Most of the public do not want judges whose goal is to advance a result oriented agenda  or to take the law on detours of their own  They want judges who proceed from the basic principles that unite us  as reflected in the constitution and in two centuries of our shared history     Most Americans would agree with Chief Justice John Marshall that to keep the Constitution relevant and responsive  judges have to be willing to look at it not as an inflexible and technical legal code  but as a document that sets forth great outlines and important goals  with the details to be filled in later  by Congress and the Courts  Certainly when the framers wrote the copyright clause of the Constitution  they never contemplated computer downloading  but their objective in that clause is something that laws and legal decisions can build on    Of course  in the minds of most Americans  what defines this country  and what our courts must be deeply concerned about  is our rights and liberties  That is what our ancestors fought for two centuries ago  That is why the framers spent so much of their time and effort on a governmental structure and a bill of rights establishing and protecting our freedoms    both freedoms to and freedoms from  That is why we fought a civil war to expand freedom  That is why our ancestors came to these shores in the 1800 s and 1900 s  and why people everywhere still want to come here  There is no freer place in the world  and we must find judges who agree that their first obligation is to keep it that way  to safeguard those freedoms    Our judges must therefore be aware of freedom s history  so that they know what happens when we are tempted to dilute bedrock rights and liberties by subordinating them to short term political expediency  The notorious Palmer raids after World War I  the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II  and the McCarthy era during the Cold War are obvious examples of past abuses Supreme Court nominees should be well aware of    Next only to protection of their freedoms  Americans expect and want fairness  That means the rights and freedoms we cherish must be applicable to all    rich and poor  popular and unpopular  powerful and powerless    especially the poor  the unpopular and the powerless who may have no other recourse  That is what makes America very special among all the nations of the world  Courts cannot cure all the ills of society  but a court system that purports to provide legal remedies for legal wrongs must make those remedies real  It cannot be credible if it erects impenetrable barriers of money  process  or theory that deprive a right of any meaningful reality     The American people understand that our system of checks and balances is a cornerstone of our basic rights and liberties  They want us to make sure that the judges we confirm will not permit unconstrained executive power to usurp legislative power or judicial power  They certainly do not want the Congress or the President to control or interfere with the judiciary  They surely want an independent judiciary     We can look deeper into each of these general principles on which there is a national consensus  and find areas of agreement and disagreement  but they are clearly a guide for choosing a Supreme Court nominee who can achieve a broad consensus in Congress and the country     We cannot do so if we adopt an ideological standard promoted by a narrow group as the first principle of the process  It makes no sense to delegate the process to groups or their supporters within the government whose personal goal is to limit the range of nominees to those who will advance their own ideological agenda    Clearly  the choice is the President s  We can help him if he chooses the route of cooperation and consensus  Hopefully  he will not follow the advice of those who want to pick fights instead of picking judges    I would like to see a wide open process that begins with a search for Republicans in all walks of legal life    not just judges    selected for the quality of their minds and their commitment to the law  rather than for their adherence to extreme ideologies  I m confident such a search would produce a wide range of eligible candidates who might be able to gain a consensus in the legal profession  among the American people and with the Senate    President Bush has a unique opportunity to unite us  not divide us  He has an extraordinary chance to do so with this nomination and perhaps other Supreme Court nominations to come  If he does  the American people and American history will thank him    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
