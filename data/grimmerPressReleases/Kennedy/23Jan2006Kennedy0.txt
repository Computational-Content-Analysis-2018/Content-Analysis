         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement responding to President Bush s economic speech today    As much as President Bush would like to change the subject in Washington away from impending criminal indictments  reality prevents him from doing so no matter how many speeches he gives  Hurricane Katrina demonstrated in stark terms that so many Americans live every day on the brink of economic disaster and for them any setback becomes a major obstacle to survival  37 million Americans live in poverty  and millions more live one paycheck away from complete economic disaster as a result of the Bush economy  Yet not a single proposal in Bush s speech will help these Americans  He offered nothing to those who ve lost their jobs over the last 5 years get back to work doing the jobs they ve been trained to do  Instead  he s given up on today s workforce and  worse  he s broken his promise to the workforce of tomorrow by under funding the No Child Left Behind Act  Every where you look  Americans are feeling the squeeze of the Bush economy  as they spend 74 percent more on gas than they did at the beginning of 2001  Heating oil prices are expected to rise by 56 percent this winter  and President Bush has been asleep at the switch year after year while consumers pay the price for record oil company profits  Such rapid price increases will force consumers  especially the poor  to cut spending on clothing  health care and food just so they can get to work and keep warm this winter  The President s only answer for the sputtering economy is more tax relief for the wealthy  That s no answer when average Americans fall further and further behind  Today the President said that he believes the job of the President is to confront problems and not pass them on  After turning record surpluses into record deficits  adding four million to the number of Americans living in poverty  increasing our trade deficit by 30 billion  and putting America at greater risk by overextending our military  it seems that the President s beliefs are completely devoid of his own legacy   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
