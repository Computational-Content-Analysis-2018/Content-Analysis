         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   A year from now  the nation will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Civil Rights Division  When Congress authorized the Division as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1957  it brought America closer to realizing its highest ideals     the goal of liberty and justice for all  In the years that followed  the Division was at the forefront of the nations continuing struggle to guarantee equal justice for all Americans  It helped protect voting rights of African Americans who suffered discrimination  It worked to desegregate schools and universities  It opened doors of opportunity for women  Latinos  Native Americans  Asians  persons of faith  persons with disabilities  and members of language minority groups  Much of the success in the past few decades has come from the Divisions genuine and sustained commitment to vigorously enforce the nations civil rights laws  There has been enormous progress  but civil rights is still the unfinished business of the nation  Its extremely important for the Division to continue its strong commitment to equal opportunity and equal justice Thats why so many of us are so very concerned about the direction of the Division in recent years  Assistant Attorney General Kim and his predecessors have often spoken about the work of the Divisions Criminal Section  and we commend it  But the number of attorneys in that Section increased by 52  between 1998 and 2004  so its no surprise that the Criminal Section has been relatively active  But the core of the Divisions work is far broader than the work of one section  and includes protecting our citizens from discrimination in all its ugly forms in their day to day lives  In these areas  the Division seems to be falling short Weve seen repeated reports that the Divisions enforcement decisions are based on politics  not law  When former Majority Leader Tom Delay engineered a redistricting of Texas to deliver the House of Representatives to Republicans  the Division promptly pre cleared it  ignoring the unanimous view of its career attorneys that the plan discriminated against minority voters  The Supreme Court recently ruled that the plan violated the voting rights of Latino citizens  When Georgia passed a photo identification requirement for voting  the Division promptly pre cleared the change  overruling the advice of career staff that the law would disenfranchise minority voters  The district court and the conservative Eleventh Circuit called the Georgia law a 21st century poll tax and halted its enforcement  Yet the Division went ahead and pre cleared a new version of the Georgia law that was also blocked by state and federal courts The Division has also significantly curtailed its litigation against race discrimination  despite the reality that African Americans continue to face serious discrimination in many parts of our society Also troubling are reports that political considerations control the hiring of career lawyers in the Division  The system of seasoned career attorneys making hiring recommendations has been dismantled  and these decisions are now left to political appointees  Loyalty to right wing groups like the Federalist Society has replaced academic credentials  experience  and commitment to civil rights in the hiring process  These problems have hobbled the important work of the Division and we need to correct them  Mr  Chairman  I commend you for holding this hearing today  I welcome the opportunity to consider these important issues  and I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
