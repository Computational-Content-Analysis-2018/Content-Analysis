         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today at the Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing on the  Walter Reed Army Medical Center  Senator Edward M  Kennedy questioned  Administration officials about their responsibility in preventing the  inexcusable conditions that our wounded troops have endured  Kennedy also  focused his questions on the vast under reporting of the number of wounded  soldiers  which clearly has implications in both the long and short term care  our troops receive   Kennedy has launched a web hotline on his website   www kennedy senate gov  to offer Massachusetts soldiers and their families an  opportunity to voice their concerns about care in Massachusetts veterans  hospitals and facilities These revelations about the Bush  Administration are shameful  Senator Kennedy said  They have let our troops  down   They sent them into battle without adequate armor  Theyve failed to  provide a plan   And now theyre failing those who have sacrificed so much    They have the power to do right by our troops and instead theyve done wrong   Its one of the great disgraces of government in modern history On  January 29th the Department of Defense webpage listed a total of more than  47 000 non mortal casualties    The next day  on the same webpage  the  category of non mortal casualties had been replaced by one titled total   medical air transported and the figure was slightly more than 31 000    This  new figure excludes more than 16 000 wounded or injured service men and  women whose conditions were deemed not serious enough for  evacuation Below are Senator Kennedys remarks  as prepared for  delivery Our veterans and soldiers deserve medical facilities and care  that match their enormous sacrifices   However  we have learned that this  administration was not prepared or able to provide quality care for the wounded  from Afghanistan and Iraq   The conditions at Walter Reed are outrageous and  inexcusable  Sadly  the problem isnt just at Walter Reed  but throughout the  country The Administration must be held accountable for the care of our  troops and these problems must be fixed immediately   We must seek solutions to  the problems at Walter Reed and other facilities  Well make a new commitment to  our soldiers and our veterans  and to their families  who make such immense  sacrifices for this country Our soldiers and their families must know  that we will fight as hard for them at home as they fought for us  overseas  Like all Americans  I was appalled to learn about the horrible  living conditions at Walter Reed and the way our wounded soldiers are being  treated   The Washington Post performed a real service to the nation by breaking  this story   The burden of the war falls on the shoulders of less than 1  of  Americans  and it is up to the rest of us in the other 99  to show our respect  and gratitude to them   For each and every one of the troops who come home  wounded  sick or injured  we have an obligation to care for them and their  families In December 2003  President Bush made the same point   He  visited Walter Reed and called it a place of love and healing and great  compassion  He said we ask the soldiers  to face great dangers to meet a  national need  In return  we have made a commitment  We have made a commitment  to the troops  and we have made a commitment to their loved ones  and that  commitment is that we will provide excellent health care    excellent care    to  anybody who is injured on the battlefield The President visited Walter  Reed at Christmas and again spoke of the need to care for our troops  He said   We owe them all we can give them Not only for when they re in harm s way  but  when they come home to help them adjust if they have wounds  or help them adjust  after their time in service And now we hear about mold growing in  patients rooms at Walter Reed  cockroaches running around  mouse droppings  and  soldiers and their families overwhelmed by the bureaucracy  Seventy five  percent of troops polled by Walter Reed last March said their experience at the  Hospital was stressful  Suicide attempts and unintentional overdoses from  prescription drugs and alcohol have been frequent   Outpatient service is  understaffed   Wounded soldiers and their families are left in limbo for months  before a decision is made on their status Dr  Winkenwerder and Gen   Kiley  how could such conditions have been allowed to foster for so  long Last week  the Washington Post identified several people  members  of congress  patients  and their families  who had raised concerns about the  unacceptable conditions at Walter Reed as far back as 2003 How many of  you here today knew about the issues soldiers were having at Walter Reed prior  to when the Washington Post published its story last month It certainly  seems these problems were obvious and were known about well before General  Weightman assumed command six months ago    Only after these allegations became  public were investigations initiated  Why has it taken the press and a public  outcry to get all of you to do your job A month ago the Department  of Defense reorganized the way it releases casualty figures from Iraq and  Afghanistan  On January 29th the Departments webpage listed a total of more  than 47 000 non mortal casualties    The next day  on the same webpage  the  category of non mortal casualties had been replaced by one titled total   medical air transported and the figure was slightly more than 31 000   This new figure excludes more than 16 000 wounded or injured service men  and women whose conditions were deemed not serious enough for  evacuation On the Departments Press Resources  website  only those  who are wounded in action are mentioned  about 23 000 troops These  differences are confusing and raise questions that I hope you can answer   They  have implications in both the short and the long term about the care our troops  receive and how the country has to plan to see that they get good care in the  future Why has the Department of Defense suddenly felt the need to cut  in half the number of soldiers who need care  How do you explain this new  approach Which of these numbers  the higher or the lower  does the  Department of Defense use to allocate funds for the medical needs of soldiers  coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan Did career professionals in the  Department of Defense estimate the number of military personnel who would need  health care services as a result of service in Iraq and Afghanistan  To ensure  that were preparing to address the health care needs of the all the woundedin  the short and the long termit is important to know these estimates  It is  essential to see these estimates if they exist and to understand how they have  changed so that we can better understand why the Administration is failing our  soldiers
