         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Senator Ken Salazar  and Representative Luis Gutierrez joined national Latino leaders to express concern over the enforcement only approach to immigration reform currently before Congress  The Secure Fence Act of 2006    Proposing to build fences is an admission of failure by the Republican Congress that it cannot address one of the top challenges facing America  Senator Kennedy said  We can pour billions of dollars into fences  but they wont address the complex challenge of illegal immigration without comprehensive reform  Fences are a bumper sticker solution to a real world problem   Over 50 organizations signed a letter sent to Senators today urging them to consider the negative consequences to the Secure Fence Act of 2006  The letter to Senators cites the vagueness of the legislations mandate  the negative impact it could have on border communities  and expresses concern over granting extraordinary powers to the Department of Homeland Security to enforce such vague legislation   Below are Senator Kennedys remarks followed by the letter sent to Senators today   STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY AT IMMIGRATION PRESS CONFERENCE    AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY   I am honored to be here today with these distinguished Latino leaders to express my deep objection to the fence bill and to urge Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform   Voting for fences may be good politics for some  but its bad policy for America  Its a feel good vote that will do more harm than good   Votando para la cerca sear buena politica para algunos  pero es muy malo para los Estados Unidos   Proposing to build fences is an admission of failure by the Republican Congress that it cannot address one of the top challenges facing America  the urgent need for immigration reform    Fences are a bumper sticker solution to a real world problem   We can pour billions of dollars into fences  but they wont address the complex challenge of illegal immigration without comprehensive reform   Half of those here illegally came by airplane legally  then remained here illegally after their visas expired  No fence will solve this problem   We have 12 million undocumented immigrants living and working in our communities  Fences will do nothing to bring them out of the shadows   We have employers offering jobs  Fences will do nothing to prevent them from bringing in more workers   Just ask security experts and the officials at the Department of Homeland Security  Theyll say that controlling our borders is impossible unless we couple enforcement efforts with a temporary worker program and path to earned citizenship for the undocumented   The anti immigrant spectacle by Republican leaders this summer was an insult to our immigrant heritage  Instead of respecting the hard work and contributions of immigrants  they declare immigrants and those who help them to be felons   President Bush got it right in May when he declared that an immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive  He got it wrong last week when he indicated that the House fence bill is an acceptable interim measure   I urge my Senate colleagues will join me in opposing this senseless measure     September 27  2006    VIA FAX   Dear Senator    The Senate will soon consider HR 6061 PCS  the Secure Fence Act of 2006  which has erroneously been referred to as the fence bill  This bill goes far beyond the construction of border barriers  It provides unprecedented authorities to the Secretary of the Department  Homeland Security  DHS  to take all actions necessary and appropriate to prevent all unlawful entries into the U S    The consequences of such an immense and vague mandate to the Secretary could result in policies and procedures that would adversely affect American communities at the Northern and Southern borders  and maritime states  wherever  border  might be defined  United States citizens and lawful permanent residents would not be immune to the consequences of the extraordinary powers granted DHS in this bill  We must remember that the border is not simply a delineation line  communities live along the border and their rights must be respected  Moreover  DHS must be held accountable for actions taken in these communities    Finally  we question the wisdom of delegating such sweeping authority to a government agency  Numerous GAO and CRS reports to Congress cite accountability and management problems at DHS  showing that DHS requires the same Congressional and legal oversight as other agencies of the government    H R  6061 is a broad bill with potentially harmful consequences for American communities  We strongly urge the Senate to oppose
