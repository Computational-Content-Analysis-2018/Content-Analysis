         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  Senate Democrats led by Senators Edward M  Kennedy  Jack Reed  and Susan Collins offered an amendment to the Department of Labor and Health and Human Services appropriations bill to provide  2 92 billion in federal assistance to low income and elderly residents  This combined with  1 883 billion in regular funds and  300 million in contingency funds already provided in the bill equals  5 1 billionthe authorized level in the Energy Policy Act of 2005  The vote is expected this afternoon     LIHEAP  the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  grants aid to low income families who can t afford the steep cost of energy  The number of households receiving this assistance has increased from 4 million in 2002 to 5 million this year  the highest level in ten years  yet only 15 percent of the eligible population     Families throughout the nation are likely to face higher heating bills this winter  On average  households heating primarily with natural gas will pay about  350  48 percent  more this winter for heat  and those relying primarily on oil will pay about  378  32 percent  more  Forecasts of a cold winter and high fuel costs mean that the elderly  the disabled  and many others will be forced to make painful choices between heating their homes and paying for food  health care  and rent    unless we act now    The Bush Administration has closed their eyes to the long term needs of the poor  freezing LIHEAP funds and cutting the Community Services Block Grant  According to ABCD  a community action agency in Massachusetts whose neighborhood network handles the outreach and application process for LIHEAP  the cut in Community Services Block Grant funding through the Continuing Resolution means that access to LIHEAP will shrink by more than 70   Up to 10 500 householdsout of a current total of 15 000 recipients  may not get their benefits    Rising energy costs are a huge part of the problem  Significant numbers of citizens live with the constant threat of power shut offs  because they can t pay their energy bills  and there s no relief in sight  According to a recent report by the Energy Information Administration  the outlook for the coming winter is bleak  Home heating bills are likely to soar  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have strained already tight oil and natural gas production  According to the American Petroleum Institute  20 percent of the nation s refinery capacity is down or is restarting as a result of damage by both hurricanes     Senator Kennedy s Floor remarks in support of the amendment follow  as well as statistics on how LIHEAP assistance affects Americans      30    Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy on the Reed Collins Amendment to Increase LIHEAP Funds October 25  2005   Winter is rapidly closing in on states across America  Yet even after Hurricane Katrina shocked the nation about the desperate plight of the poor  the Administration and the Republican Congress continue to ignore our neediest citizens    According to the Energy Information Administration  home heating bills will soar this winter  Households heating primarily with natural gas will pay an average of  350 more this winter for heatan increase of an incredible 48 percent over last year  Those relying primarily on oil for heat will pay  378 morean increase of 32 percent     The people most in need of help on this issue are the 37 million Americans living in poverty today  including 13 million children  According to a recent report by Economic Opportunity Studies  families in poverty will owe an average of 25 percent of their entire income for their energy bills this winter  The federal poverty guideline is  16 090 for a family of three  That means that  4 022 will be spent on home energy bills  leaving only  12 000 or  1 000 a month for expenses the entire year     A family whose rent is  800 a month would have only  200 left  For a household of three  that s only  63 per person per month for food  clothing  and health care     46 million Americans lack health insurance in this country  If such families have a health emergency and no health insurance  their annual income could be further strapped     What if the family owns a car so they can get to and from work  More money will be needed to pay the high cost of gasoline  and to make monthly car and insurance payments     Since many families live below the federal poverty line  they will have even less money left for other needs after they pay to heat their homes    A recent study by researchers from Stanford University  the University of Chicago  the RAND Corporation  and UCLA found that when poor families heating bills go up during cold winter months  they reduce their spending on food     LIHEAP  the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program  was created two decades ago to prevent low income families from being forced to make these impossible trade offs  Yet federal funding for LIHEAP has been stagnant for over a decade  even as the need for assistance has risen sharply  As a result  the purchasing power of LIHEAP assistance  adjusted for inflation  is now only a little over half of what it was in 1982     33 million household are eligible for LIHEAP assistance  These households will spend nearly  55 billion in energy costs  Yet the LIHEAP program is funded at only  2 billion    According to the National Energy Assistance Directors  Association  LIHEAP assistance reached 5 million families this yearthe highest level in ten years  but only 15 percent of the eligible population  In Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves 134 000 families  which is only 15 percent of the 867 000 families are eligible for assistance    Earlier this month I visited the Curtis Hall Community Center in Boston  Massachusetts with Mayor Menino  I heard first hand about the extreme need for home energy assistance among senior citizens     Last winter  Eileen Duggan  a widow from Jamaica Plain in Boston  kept her oven on high and wore several layers of clothing because her time worn furnace was inadequate to provide enough heat  She started buying less food so that she could use her small monthly budget to pay her heating bill  Despite her best efforts  she still couldn t pay that bill  and last April  with the New England winter chill still in the air  she asked the utility company to stop sending her oil  I told the oil man   Don t give me anymore  I can t afford it    she said     Other low income families have also been sharing their stories  One example involves a single mother who lives in Haverhill  Massachusetts with her 18 year old son who is handicapped  her 19 year old daughter  and her daughter s child who has a medical condition  Both mother and daughter work as school bus monitors  and they have little or no income over the summer  Their rent is  950 a month  Their last gas bill was  1729  Because they couldn t pay the bill  their gas was shut off last winter  Even if they qualify for  600 in LIHEAP assistance the gas company may still refuse to reconnect their service  unless the family comes up with another  400 to  800 towards their debt    Millions of low income Americans set their thermostats at just 60 degrees or even lowerif their heat is still onwhile Congress  the Administration  and the vast majority of us rest content in warm homes  Yet the Bush Administration and the Republican Congress do nothing year after year     This is the third time I have stood on the Senate floor urging Congress to open its eyes to the needs of the poor    It s shameful that after the President and the Republican Congress froze LIHEAP funds through the Continuing Resolution  they continue to tune out the pleas of low income families who need home heating assistance     Last week  the Republican leadership decided to use a procedural maneuver once again to block emergency funding for LIHEAP  Almost every Democratic Senator supported this additional relief  but Republican Senators overwhelmingly opposed it  and it was defeated     There is no excuse for the Republican majority to look the other waybut they do  They continue to ignore families who lie awake at night worrying how to make ends meet  They refuse to acknowledge the parents who worry  day after day  week after week  month after month  how to feed their children and keep the heat on  or the elderly who turn down their thermostats  put on extra sweaters  or even turn off the heat in an attempt to save money    It s time to tell low income families across the country that we hear them  that we care about them  and that we don t intend to leave them shivering in the cold again this winter     That s why I strongly support the Reed Collins amendment to add  2 9 billion to the LIHEAP program  We need to increase LIHEAP funding now to avoid real harm to real people this winter  and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment     FACT SHEET ENERGY COSTS AND LIHEAP   MASSACHUSETTS    In Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves approximately 130 000 householdsbetween 14 000 and 15 000 in Boston     In Massachusetts  the current average price per gallon of home heating oil is  2 51  This is an increase of 30 percent  69 cents  over the average price per gallon last October   1 82      This winter  800 gallons of heating oilthe typical need for winter heatingwill cost approximately  2000  about  500 more than they would have paid last year     Many families in Massachusetts will start the winter already behind in heating bills  As of May  80 percent of ABCD clients  ABCD is a community action agency in Boston  owed the gas company an average of  900  In some cases the heat has been turned off and can t be turned back on until the families pay off their debt    NATIONAL    According to the Energy Information Administration  on average  households heating primarily with natural gas will pay about  350  48 percent  more this winter for heat  and those relying primarily on oil will pay about  378  32 percent  more     Federal funding for the LIHEAP program has been stagnate for over a decade  If you adjust for inflation  the purchasing power of LIHEAP funding this year is only a little over half of what it was in 1982   Which amounts to a cut of  1 6 billion      The number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance has increased from 4 2 million in FY02 to close to 5 million this year  the highest level in 10 years  Yet  the program only serves about 15 6 percent of eligible recipients     33 million households are eligible for LIHEAP assistance  Combined  these houses will spend nearly  55 billion  compared to the  2 billion available for LIHEAP     94 percent of household served by LIHEAP funds have at least one member who is elderly  disabled  a child under 18  or has a single adult living with one or more children     The average LIHEAP household has an income of less than  10 000     Households in poverty will owe an average of 25  of their entire annual income for their energy bills     At the projected level of family expenditures needed to keep LIHEAP eligible homes normally warm or cool with their essential appliances running  an average of about  1936 in FY06   the 2005 LIHEAP average benefit of  318 would cover less than 15 percent of the average bill   Laura Capps
