         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  joined by the Massachusetts delegation  sent the following letter to President Bush calling for a federal disaster declaration for Massachusetts    For the past week  Massachusetts has been pounded by historic storms    and for the first time in recent memory  every river in the state was under a flood alert  Some cities like Brockton  Worcester  Framingham  Springfield  Greenfield  and now Taunton are potentially facing millions of dollars in damages to homeowners and local businesses  The full extent of the damages is not yet known  but thousands were forced to evacuate and hundreds of homes and businesses have been severely damaged    After touring the dam and meeting with the community and local officials and emergency responders  Kennedy said  The people of Taunton and surrounding communities have come together during this time  and I m here to offer a helping hand  I urge President Bush to declare Massachusetts a federal disaster area so that our affected residents will be able to seek the assistance they need     A PDF of the signed letter from the delegation is available upon request     30    Dear Mr  President    We are writing to express our strong support for the federal disaster declaration request made by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  It is extremely urgent that the Commonwealth receive this declaration immediately so that flood victims will not have to wait for recovery assistance     Sustained  heavy rains accompanied by strong winds have battered our state for more than a week  Flooding has forced thousands of residents from their homes and caused wide spread property damage  High winds pose an additional hazard of potentially uprooting trees  causing further damage  Already  75 communities have reported serious flooding  including 30 which have undergone evacuations    Time is of the essence for a federal disaster declaration  The National Weather Service forecasts that southern New England will face another bout of significant rainfall in the coming days  Plus  temperatures are expected to fall below 30 degrees during the evening in some parts of the Commonwealth this week     It is vital that we provide every assurance to those families which have lost their homes during the flooding that they will not be left out in the cold  and that there is a plan in place to recover their losses  With your grant of a federal disaster declaration  families across the Commonwealth     particularly those without any insurance     will be able to begin the process of recovering those losses     Currently  a range of state and local resources are being brought to bear on this disaster  However  judging from the extent of the damage it is clear that federal assistance is urgently needed  In Springfield alone  there are estimated to be  3 million in damages  Similarly  Greenfield  one of the most heavily hit communities  anticipates significant damages  The Whittenton Pond Dam in Taunton remains perilously close to buckling  which could send a six foot wave of flood waters into the city causing more property damage and further stressing the means of local and state first responders     While it will undoubtedly take time to fully recover from the flooding  families which have lost a home and those with other serious property losses deserve to have the reassurance that the federal government is at their side in their time of need  Moreover  schools  hospitals  town halls and other public facilities that may be in need of urgent and costly repairs should be a high priority for your Administration  Therefore  we request that you issue a federal disaster declaration as soon as possible  so that the recovery process may begin in earnest     With respect and appreciation  and we thank you for considering this request    Sincerely     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
