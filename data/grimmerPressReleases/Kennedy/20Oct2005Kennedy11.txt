         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Thank you Senator Enzi for convening this important oversight hearing    The basic federal programs we re considering today are meant to serve the important public purpose of providing the opportunity for thousands of people with disabilities to go to work    Disabled Americans want to work and contribute to their communities in the same way as their non disabled friends and families  They have dreams just like everyone else  For far too long  we ve been denied the talents and contributions of thousands of our fellow citizens  just because they are disabled    So it s a sad day when our Committee staff produces clear findings that indicate shameful and serious failures in many aspects of employment programs for the disabled  and flagrant abuses by certain contractors for personal gain    Our goal is to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities  But our actions in Congress haven t matched the rhetoric  We haven t demanded accountability from the Department of Education in its oversight of the program  It s unfortunate that they refused to attend this hearing today  People with disabilities deserve far better    I m sure Secretary Spellings will be as shocked as we are by these depressing staff findings  These two long established federal programs may be showing their age  They were designed for another era  and newer landmark programs like the ADA and IDEA have joined the effort  But that s no excuse for the fraud and abuses that this investigation seems to have uncovered  The disabled beneficiaries of these two programs faced enormous hardship even in the best of circumstances  and the last thing they needed was to become victims of major incompetence and outright fraud  abuse  and corruption  with the Department of Education AWOL on what was happening  Even minimum responsible oversight would have smelled smoke and been alerted to the problem  So I hope these findings will finally sound the Congressional alarm    As Senator Enzi said  people with disabilities are unemployed at the unacceptably high rate of 70   When we passed the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 that was not the vision we had in mind  The Act was about much more than curb cuts  It was about improving access to opportunities  especially jobs  for people with disabilities      The ADA itself built on significant progress over the past four decades    In the 1970 s  we passed Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to end discrimination in the schoolhouse and promote equal opportunities for people with disabilities     We built on this promise in 1975  by passing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  Last year we reauthorized this important civil rights law for the 6 5 million students with disabilities and their families  We want them to have greater opportunities after they leave the schoolhouse  but in too many cases they still do not     The promise of IDEA and ADA and the powerful vision of lives in the community that developed out of the Supreme Court s Olmstead decision have failed to penetrate much of the modern workplace     It s obvious that our national approach to employment of people with disabilities isn t working  Employment is too low and static  Poverty rates are at 30   and median household is  27 000 a year  and we can few signs of improvement  The JWOD and Randolph Sheppard programs were both created nearly 70 years ago under Franklin Roosevelt     At that time  they responded brilliantly to the realities of an era when workplaces we inaccessible  when having a disability carried a much greater stigma  and when a quality education was out of reach for most children with disabilities      But that was before the Rehabilitation Act   Before IDEA   Before the ADA      The evidence Senator Enzi laid out today makes a clear case for reform  Over the past 15 years since enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act  real progress has taken place  ADA created a revolution in the way society views disabilities  and that revolution is continuing    If we believe in equality of opportunity  if we believe everyone has something to contribute     then any reform should provide a broad commitment to employ people with disabilities  based on their skills  not their disabilities    It should create entrepreneurs among the disabled  and give them the skills and resources they need to operate a successful business and employ others     It should give people with disabilities a real choice about where they work and what they do  These are issues of basic human dignity and basic human rights     Most of all  any program should make a genuine commitment to move more people with disabilities into job settings with non disabled workers     We all know that there s a bipartisan willingness to tackle these issues in Congress  The time is right for reform  I was proud to join recently with Senator Roberts on legislation that has the potential to employ 100 000 or more people with disabilities in their communities     I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today  and to working with Senator Enzi and many others in Congress  with leaders in the disability community  and employers to move this debate forward  We can and must do better and now is the time to do it    Laura
