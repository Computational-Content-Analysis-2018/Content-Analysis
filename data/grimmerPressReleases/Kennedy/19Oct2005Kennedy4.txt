         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  ranking member of the United States Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  highlighted key issues at a hearing that explored the reemployment challenges National Guard and Reservists face when returning home from war  Kennedy  a senior member on the Senate Armed Services Committee  has led a series of discussions in Massachusetts confronting the need for local  state and federal cooperation in ensuring national guard and reservists are taken care of when assimilating back into the civilian workforce    Families have told us of the heavy financial burdens that the call ups have caused  They have to struggle with mortgage payments  fuel costs  childcare and other costs of raising a family  Senator Kennedy said  Often  savings aren t adequate  and families live in fear of bankruptcy    Nationally  more than two hundred thousand reservists and National Guard troops across the country have been called to active duty  far away from their homes and businesses  As a result  many of their families are facing economic hardship  and their creditors keep calling  Some of them operated small businesses  and because of their absence  those businesses are now in trouble    According to a Defense Department survey of Reservists  41  lost substantial family income when they were called up  The average self employed Reservist lost  6 500 in annual income  but many lose far more  For physicians  it was a loss of  25 000  These families have put our national security ahead of their financial security  and they deserve our help    Kennedy  after meeting with family members of deployed reservists in Massachusetts  requested the Government Accountability Agency  GAO  conduct a study on the way in which federal agencies work together to ensure that members of the Guard and Reserves are treated with the respect they deserve    The study reported on the four agencies that protect servicemembers  rights  Department of Defense Employer Support of Guard and Reserve  DOD ESGR   Department of Labor Veterans  Employment and Training Service  DOL VETS   Department of Justice  DOJ   and Office of Special Counsel  OSC  and how they work together to serve returning soldiers  The GAO Report found a serious need for better inter agency coordination because servicemembers  problems are getting lost in the bureaucracy     On the GAO report  Kennedy said  We need to do everything we can to protect the rights of our servicemembers as they reenter the American workplace  The GAO report shows that Guard members and Reservists  rights are at risk of being mired in a bureaucracy that can t communicate with itself  It demonstrates the need to streamline these procedures and designate one agency to oversee how servicemembers  problems are handled from start to finish  These men and women have already made tremendous sacrifices in doing their duty  and it is our job to be sure that the federal government does its duty to our volunteer military  to ensure that no one suffers on the job for serving their country on the battlefield    A summary of the GAO report and the Senator s statement at the hearing are included  PDF of complete GAO report available upon request     30    Strain on the National Guard and Reserves    Today  there are over 1 000 members of the Massachusetts Air and Army National Guard serving in Iraq and Afghanistan today       Nearly 800 000 National Guard and reservists have been called to active duty since September 11th  including 7 500 troops from Massachusetts for combat tours in Iraq or Afghanistan     Over 500 Massachusetts National Guardsmen were called to active duty to respond to Hurricane Katrina relief     According to a DOD survey of reservists  41  lost family income when they were mobilized  The average self employed reservist who is deployed will experience an average of  6 500 in lost income  but some professionals  like physicians in private practice may lose as much as  25 000     30    GAO FINDS FEDERAL AGENCIES NEED TO DO MORE TO PROTECT SERVICEMEMBERS  EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS Four agencies protect servicemembers  rights  Department of Defense Employer Support of Guard and Reserve  DOD ESGR   Department of Labor Veterans  Employment and Training Service  DOL VETS   Department of Justice  DOJ   and Office of Special Counsel  OSC   The GAO Report found a serious need for better inter agency coordination  because servicemembers  problems are getting lost in the bureaucracy  Specifically  GAO found   The four agencies have no unified way of collecting information about servicemembers  complaints  Their information collection systems are incompatible and don t track the same data  Many files are kept only on paper so they cannot be electronically transferred between agencies   A critical part of employer outreach and education is identifying and collecting contact information on employers of reservists  Collection of this information has been mandatory since 2003  Yet as of August 2005  DOD did not have civilian employer information on nearly 40  of reserve forces   No one agency has the responsibility for overseeing servicemembers  complaints from start to finish  which means agencies focus on their own turnaround time  rather than on a swift resolution for the servicember  This leads to tremendous inefficiencies  For example  tracking a sample of 52 complaints at DOL found servicemembers had waited an average of 619 days from initial filing of a complaint to final resolution  GAO recommends that   DOD use its period surveys to ask servicemembers about how well our reemployment laws are working   DOD take steps to ensure servicemembers report their civilian employment information and share this information with agencies that educate employers about USERRA   DOL  DOD  DOJ  and OSC explore ways to electronically transfer information between agencies   the Secretary of Labor develop a plan to increase efficiency by reducing use of paper files and adopting an automated complaint system  and  Congress should consider designating a single office to oversee the entire complaint resolution process   30    STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY  SENATE HELP EMPLOYMENT AND WORKPLACE SAFETY SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ON EMPLOYER ACCOMMODATION OF GUARD AND RESERVE PERSONNEL   I commend Chairman Isakson and Senator Murray for holding this important hearing  The longer the war in Iraq goes on  the greater the toll it places on members of the Guard  Reserves  and their employers     Before September 11th  the average number of Reservists and members of the Guard on active duty was 35 000  Today over 150 000 are on active duty around the world  with many on their second  third  or even fourth tours of duty     Their continuing deployments strain our troops and their families  but they also cause hardship for their employers  Large companies struggle to find ways to work around their absent employees  but for small businesses  the loss of an individual can mean the difference between survival and bankruptcy  and for doctors and lawyers  the time away may well mean that their practice no longer exists when they return from their deployment     But the greatest hardship falls on the members of the Guard and Reserves themselves and their families  In the current economy  continuing activations can be a severe hardship  When these men and women leave their civilian jobs behind  they often give up higher salaries and benefits too  Their families have to find other ways to meet mortgage payments  buy groceries  and care for their children without the benefit of their civilian salaries     To reduce this hardship  our laws provide that service members returning home are entitled to return to their old jobs  without losing their seniority or benefits  Most employers obey the law  and as a recent survey by the Department of Defense has found  many employers actually go above and beyond the law s requirements to help reservists and their families  We ll recognize some of these employers at today s hearing  Massachusetts protects the salaries of its state employees called up for duty in the armed forces by paying the difference between their civilian pay and their military pay  Raytheon  the largest employer in the state  does so indefinitely  It also continues employee health benefits  so that families don t have to change doctors while their loved one is away  Raytheon employees receive credit for their pensions while they are on duty     Hopefully  now that this issue is being raised  many more employers will follow the example of the companies here today  and many more soldiers who are bravely fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan or serving in other parts of the world will find their jobs waiting for them when they return     Too many soldiers  however  return to find that they ve been replaced  or are being demoted to a lower paying position or a job with less responsibility     We ll hear today from the Department of Defense  which provides support for over 800 000 members of our Guard and Reserve now on drilling duty  The Department has over 4 000 volunteers  including 800 ombudsmen  across the country who answer questions and try to resolve workplace problems  In FY2004  over 1 400 service members had problems with their employers and filed complaints with the Department of Labor as well     When I first heard about these types of problems from Massachusetts reservists  they told me they were worried about their jobs when they returned  Their employers were frustrated when they left their jobs to serve our country  and they feared they would be punished for it    by being passed over for promotion  being moved to another position  or worst of all  being fired    I asked the Government Accountability Office to study what the federal government actually does to protect the rights of men and women and uniform  since it s not enough to have protective laws on the books  We also need to enforce them  The GAO report I m releasing today shows that our federal agencies need to do a better job  Servicemembers  rights are at risk of being mired in a bureaucracy that can t communicate with itself  The four agencies responsible for enforcing the rights of our reservists and National Guard members have separate tracking systems that are not only not electronic  but are also incompatible with each other  In some cases  GAO found that the same servicemembers  files were being opened and closed repeatedlywith some complaints taking nearly two years to resolve    GAO has a number of recommendations to address these problems  such as that one agency should be responsible for overseeing the complaint process from start to finish  We need to consider this option seriously and I look forward to working with my colleagues to tackle these challenges and provide the necessary oversight and assistance to these agencies     We need to do everything we can to protect the rights of our servicemembers as they reenter the American workplace  These men and women have already made tremendous sacrifices  leaving behind not only their civilian jobs but also their homes  their families  and their communities  They are doing their duty with great skill and courage  and it s our job to be sure that the federal government does its duty too  so that no one in our volunteer military suffers on the job for serving their country on the battlefield     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
