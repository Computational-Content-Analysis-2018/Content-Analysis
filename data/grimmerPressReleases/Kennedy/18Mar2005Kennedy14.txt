         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The fundamental issue in this tragic case is what Terri Schiavo would have wanted if she were somehow able to tell us  Our hearts go out to both her husband and her parents  I felt that Congress should not intervene  and that the courts are the fairest forum to do what is right  I intend to do all I can to see that any action Congress takes is constructive and free from partisan politics  and does not make a tragic situation worse by exploiting this terrible tragedy   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
