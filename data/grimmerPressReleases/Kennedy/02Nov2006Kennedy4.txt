         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent a letter to Assistant Attorney General Wan J  Kim  conveying his concerns and asking questions about the Civil Rights Divisions election monitoring and enforcement plans for the November 7th elections  The Civil Rights Division has failed to take the steps necessary to safeguard equal access to voters at the ballot box in recent elections  Kennedy voiced his concerns to ensure that race and ethnic background do not serve as barriers to full and equal participation in this election  Senator Kennedy wrote  The Division has strayed in recent years from its traditional role of ensuring equal access to the ballot box  irrespective of race or color  I am troubled that the Department s failure to pursue claims of discrimination against minority voters has created the false impression that overt voting discrimination against minorities is no longer a serious problem  In recent months  courts across the country have blocked enforcement of restrictive election laws and procedures enacted by Republican controlled state legislatures and implemented by Republican election officials  It is critical that the Justice Departments activities with respect to voter fraud in no way undermine voters access to the ballot    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
