         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I continue to believe that Mr  Gonzales should not be on the agenda for this Committee meeting He declined to answer or evaded many of the questions we asked him at the hearing  He has failed to provide full and forthright answers to our follow up written questions His past responses that all of the Administration s policies  regardless of their consequences  were justified because we had captured some really bad people demean the strength of our Constitution  An essential part of winning the war on terrorism and protecting the country for the future is protecting the ideals and values that America stands for here at home and around the world  The checks and balances in the Constitution are essential to our democracy and a continuing source of our country s strength  They are not obstacles or inconveniences to be jettisoned in times of crisis The Bybee Torture Memorandum was written at Mr  Gonzales s request  The memo itself is directed to him  After its release in August 2002  the memo was official policy on interrogations by the Defense Department and the C I A  for two and a half years until it was finally repudiated last month  on the eve of Mr  Gonzales s nomination Yet he refuses to tell us anything about how the Bybee Memorandum was written and why he ordered it  We know from press reports that the C I A  asked him for advice on how far the agency could go in interrogating detainees  In July 2002  he held meetings with other Administration officials to discuss how to legally justify certain interrogation methods  He refuses to tell us anything about those meetings He says he can t remember what specific interrogation methods were discussed He can t remember who asked for the Justice Department s legal advice in the first place He can t remember whether he made any suggestions to the Department on the drafting of the Bybee Memorandum  although he admits that it would not be unusual for his office to have done so He doesn t know how the memo was forwarded to the Defense Department and became part of its Working Group Report in April 2003  which was used to justify the new interrogation practices at Guantanamo  Those practices  in turn  migrated to military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq We have a torture problem  The F B I  says so  The Red Cross says so  The Defense Intelligence Agency says so  The Defense Department says it investigated more than 300 cases of detainee torture  sexual assault  and other abuse  Additional allegations of abuse are being reported on a daily basis  Yet Mr  Gonzales can t remember any details of how it happened I ve repeatedly asked Mr  Gonzales to provide documents on his meetings  evaluations  and decisions on the Bybee Memorandum  These documents would speak volumes about all the issues Mr  Gonzales says he has trouble remembering  Yet he refuses to provide the documents  He won t even search for them  In his responses to my written questions  Mr  Gonzales stated eight times that he has not conducted a search for the requested documents  In other words  the documents we want may exist  but he s not going to look for them  It s hard to imagine a more arrogant insult to this Committee s oversight role Mr  Gonzales refused to answer other questions and requests on the grounds that they would involve classified information  predecisional or internal deliberations  or deliberative material  None of these grounds is sufficient  There is no legal bar to providing classified materials to Congress  they re routinely provided to Congress and discussed in closed meetings  There is no recognized privilege for predecisional or deliberative materials  The only exception is in the rare case where the President himself determines that his interest in secrecy outweighs the public interest in disclosure  and he himself invokes executive privilege  That hasn t happened here It was clear when Mr  Gonzales was nominated that his involvement in the prisoner detention and interrogation issues would be a major concern of the Senate  and that the Senate would need full information and materials on this subject  Serious abuses of detainees occurred in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo  Mr  Gonzales s role in developing legal justifications goes to the heart of the issue whether he should be confirmed as the nation s chief law enforcement officer  If we allow this nominee to proceed to a vote without insisting on answers to our questions  we ll be abdicating our advice and consent responsibility and weakening our oversight function precisely when it is needed most The Bybee Memorandum was no law review article or newspaper op ed  As Mr  Gonzales himself has said  it was the definitive legal opinion by the Justice Department on the rules on torture for the entire Executive Branch of the Government  As far as we know  until the Department released its revised version of the memorandum last month  the Bybee Memorandum was the only official Justice Department opinion on the definition of torture  on the legal defenses for those who commit torture  and on the power of the President to override laws and treaties on torture  There may have been other memos on torture  but the White House refuses to give them to us Harold Koh   a leading scholar of international law and Dean of the Yale Law School  who served in both the Reagan and Clinton Administrations   calls the memo the most clearly legally erroneous opinion he has ever read  I hope every member of the Committee will take the time to review Harold Koh s testimony If the counsel for the President had received such an opinion  Koh said at our hearing  you would have expected him to do at least one of two things  First  reject it on the spot and send it back or  second  send it to other parts of the government and have them give a second opinion  particularly the State Department  which I believe  following the policies in the U S  Report on the Convention Against Torture  would have said that the opinion is flatly wrong Instead        that opinion was allowed to become executive branch policy  was incorporated into the DOD working group report  and remained as executive branch policy for some two and a half years  during which time I believe that a permissive environment was inevitably created In his response to our questions  Mr  Gonzales said that he has no specific recollection of  his  reaction to the conclusions  reasoning  or appropriateness as a matter of policy of any of the particular sections of the memorandum at the time  he  received it two and a half years ago He did say  however  that he believed at the time that it was a good faith effort to interpret the Anti Torture Statute  At the hearing  he told Senator Leahy  I don t recall today whether or not I was in agreement with all of the analysis  but I don t have a disagreement with the conclusions then reached by the Department Let s review those conclusions  The Bybee Memorandum made three basic points First  it said that torture means only acts that inflict the kind of pain experienced with death or organ failure  To commit torture  it said  a government official must have the precise objective of inflicting severe pain  If causing such harm was not his precise objective   even if he knew that severe pain would result from his actions   he should be acquitted Second  the memo said that the President has the inherent constitutional power as Commander in Chief to override the prohibitions against torture enacted by Congress Third  it said that government officials can avoid prosecution for their acts of torture by invoking the defenses of necessity or self defense   even though the Convention Against Torture  which Congress ratified in 1994  states very clearly that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever may be invoked as a justification for torture None of these points qualify as a reasonable or good faith legal argument  The Bybee Memorandum defined torture so narrowly that Saddam Hussein s henchmen could have claimed immunity from prosecution for many of their crimes  Beating you  suffocating you  ripping out your fingernails  burning you with hot irons  suspending you from hooks  putting lighted cigarettes in your ear  it s not clear how many of these barbaric methods would have been prohibited under the Bybee Memorandum  since none of them necessarily involved near death or organ failure  the specific conditions specified in the memo as constituting torture Mr  Gonzales refused to tell us whether the extreme conduct mentioned in the F B I  e mails is illegal   such as burning detainees with lighted cigarettes  exposing them to extreme temperatures  giving forcible enemas and holding them in prolonged stress positions in their own urine and feces  He explained his refusal as follows   W ere the Administration to begin ruling out speculated interrogation practices in public  by virtue of gradually ruling out some practices in response to repeated questions and not ruling out others  we would fairly rapidly provide al Qaeda with a road map concerning the interrogation that captured terrorists can expect to face That s arrogant nonsense  Our laws  our treaties  and our military field manuals all provide specific and clear guidance on where to draw the line on torture  Mr  Gonzales s failure to condemn these acts of torture only weakens America s standing in the world and sets back our efforts against terrorism To reach their narrow definition of torture  the authors of the Bybee Memorandum relied on totally unrelated federal statutes that define emergency medical conditions for purposes of providing health benefits  As the revision last December of the Bybee Memorandum admits  the statutes relied on do not define severe pain even in that very different context       and they do not state that death  organ failure  or impairment of bodily function cause  severe pain   Clearly  the original reasoning was repudiated  Clearly  the memo s definition of torture was far too narrow  If it applied in other countries  U S  soldiers and citizens traveling abroad would be at far greater risk The Bybee Memorandum s provisions on Executive Power are also wholly inconsistent with the separation of powers in the Constitution  Article II  Section 3 directs the President to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed  Yet the Bybee Memorandum states that the federal Anti Torture Statute would be unconstitutional if it interferes with the President s direction of such core war matters as the detention and interrogation of enemy combatants At a press conference in June 2004  Mr  Gonzales refused to say whether this statement remains good law in the Bush Administration  He would say only that the President has not exercised his Commander in Chief override  he has not determined that torture is  in fact  necessary to protect the national security of this country Mr  Gonzales evaded questions asked on this issue by Committee members  To this day  we still do not know whether the President believes he has the option to authorize torture Let s be clear  there is no such thing as a Commander in Chief override  It s certainly not in my copy of the Constitution  It appears to be something that Mr  Gonzales and his colleagues have invented Congress has repeatedly passed laws and ratified treaties prohibiting torture and mistreatment of detainees  and the President does not have the power to violate them  When a nominee claims that such an override exists  or suggests that those who commit torture might be able to invoke the defense of necessity or self defense notwithstanding Congress  categorical prohibition against such a defense  it sends a message that anything goes to our troops and intelligence officers in the field  To allow such extreme claims to become official U S  policy for two whole years was reckless and  in my view  disqualifying Mr  Gonzales has demonstrated a similar disregard for the rule of law in his effort to facilitate the C I A  practice of ghost detainees  The Administration has always claimed to be in full compliance with the Geneva Conventions in Iraq  Yet in the spring of 2004  we learned from General Taguba that between six and eight of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib Prison had not been registered as required by Army regulations and were being moved around the prison to avoid detection by the International Committee for the Red Cross  General Taguba described this practice as deceptive  contrary to Army doctrine and in violation of international law In September  Army investigators told the Armed Services Committee that as many as 100 detainees at Abu Ghraib had been hidden from the Red Cross at the C I A  s direction   and that the C I A  had refused requests to cooperate with the military investigation  This disclosure drew outrage from both Democrats and Republicans  Senator McCain said  The situation with the CIA ghost soldiers is beginning to look like a bad movie       This needs to be cleared up rather badly Since then  we ve learned that Mr  Gonzales has been a major architect of this policy  On March 19  2004  at his request  the Justice Department provided him with a draft memorandum   the so called Goldsmith Memorandum   to allow the C I A  to ship certain persons out of Iraq  Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention specifically states  Individual or mass forcible transfers  as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country  occupied or not  are prohibited  regardless of their motive  Violations of Article 49 constitute grave breaches of the Convention and therefore qualify as war crimes under federal law In spite of the clear  unequivocal language of this provision  the Justice Department ruled that Article 49 does not in fact prohibit  for the purpose of facilitating interrogation  the temporary removal from Iraq of protected persons who have not been accused of a crime In October 2004  the Washington Post reported that one intelligence official familiar with the operation said the C I A  used the memo as legal support for secretly transporting as many as a dozen detainees out of Iraq in the last six months  The agency has concealed the detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross and other authorities  the official said The legal analysis in the Goldsmith Memorandum is an embarrassment  Yet it appears to have been the legal justification for the C I A  to commit war crimes  As with the Bybee Memorandum  Mr  Gonzales has categorically refused to answer the Committee s questions about his involvement He refuses to provide or even conduct a search for documents relating to his request for the Goldsmith Memorandum He refuses to say anything about his discussions with the author of the memo He says he doesn t know whether the C I A  acted on the memo  as the Washington Post reported He even says that he has never had the occasion to come to definitive views about the analysis in the memo Far from helping to clear the air  Mr  Gonzales has clouded it further  To let his nomination proceed would make a mockery of the notion of Congressional oversight and accountability There are many other issues in Mr  Gonzales s record that should give members of this Committee pause As predicted by Secretary Powell and senior military lawyers  Mr  Gonzales s memorandum of January 2002 on the applicability of the Geneva Conventions to the war in Afghanistan brought a strong negative reaction from even our closest allies and lowered the bar for the protection of our own troops  According to the Schlesinger Report  in September 2003 military commanders in Iraq cited this memo as legal justification for the use of extreme interrogation techniques at Abu Ghraib prison  The worst abuses there occurred from September to December 2003 In his answers to the Committee  Mr  Gonzales made clear that the Administration does not consider the C I A  to be bound by the prohibition on cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment in Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture  This shift in legal policy was apparently made in a separate Justice Department memorandum which has also not been provided to Congress Today  therefore  C I A  agents are authorized to treat detainees in a cruel  inhuman  and degrading manner   even if it violates constitutional rules in the U S    so long as they do not commit torture under the Department s definition  President Bush also exempted the C I A  from his directive in February 2002 to treat all detainees humanely  This shameful change in legal policy endangers the safety of American soldiers who are captured abroad Finally  the New York Times reported that Mr  Gonzales excluded critical Administration personnel from deliberations on the Administration s plan to establish military tribunals at Guantanamo  a plan that was widely criticized as unjust  unworkable  and unconstitutional  Secretary of State Powell  National Security Advisor Rice  and the head of the Justice Department s Criminal Division  Michael Chertoff  saw the President s Military Order only after it was published in November 2001  Most of the Pentagon s top military lawyers were also kept in the dark  More than three years after the Order s publication  not a single detainee at Guantanamo has been successfully prosecuted  To the contrary  as predicted by officials who have expertise in the field  the military tribunal process there is falling apart      All of us continue to be impressed by the story of Mr  Gonzales s life  Growing up in a small house with no hot water or telephone  raised by parents who were migrant farm workers  he obtained degrees from two of the nation s finest universities  He became a justice on the Texas Supreme Court  and has served as one of the President s closest advisers over the past four years  I agree with President Bush when he said that in many ways Mr  Gonzales embodies the American Dream The American Dream  however  involves more than the ability of the poor and dispossessed to gain power and prestige  As Dr  Martin Luther King Jr  preached in 1965  the American Dream also challenges us to respect the dignity and the worth of all human personality  President Bush similarly observed in his Inaugural Address just last week  From the day of our Founding  we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights  and dignity  and matchless value  because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth It s that aspect of the American Dream that s before us today   the commitment of the United States to individual dignity  human rights  and the rule of law   our respect around the world as a beacon for human rights  not as a violator of human rights The torture and other abuses of prisoners in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo have done immense damage to America s standing in the world The extreme and irresponsible claims in the Bybee Memorandum have raised questions about our commitment to the rule of law  and have exposed our own soldiers to greater risk  and the Defense Department s adoption of this memo as official policy has undermined our military s rules  traditions  and commitment to justice The Goldsmith Memorandum has recklessly approved a practice that violates Army regulations and the plain language of the Geneva Conventions The continuing effort to pin the blame for the torture scandal on a few bad apples among our soldiers while ignoring or even rewarding Mr  Gonzales and others responsible for the policy has sent the wrong message to our nation and the world I cannot support a nominee who has done so much to harm America s basic interests and fundamental values  I urge my colleagues to reject his nomination   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633
