         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on President Bush s speech today I agree with President Bush that the attack on the Golden Mosque was an unconscionable and cowardly act  and an affront on people of all faiths We can t let this despicable act become the torch that ignites a full scale civil war in Iraq  The eruption of such shameful violence demonstrates the urgent need for reconciliation between the Sunni  Shiite  and Kurdish people in Iraq An inclusive and broad based government is needed that represents the interests of all    not just narrow sectarian groups  The constitution should be quickly revised to meet the concerns of the Sunni  We need a concerted effort to bring those responsible for the attack to justice and to keep the political process on track I m deeply concerned  however  that the President missed this opportunity to address the growing concern over port security  Year after year after 9 11  the Administration has fumbled the ball on port security We re living on borrowed time when it comes to inspecting cargo  and it s urgent that the Administration act  A good start would be to revise the budget request for port security  and stop short changing these critical homeland security needs   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
