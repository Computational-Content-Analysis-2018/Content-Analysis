         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the Administrations immigration proposal and the new social security no match regulations Sadly  the Administrations proposal would make our immigration crisis worse  Without strong new laws  the Administrations plan will do little to enhance our security and will hurt millions of immigrant families who are contributing so much to our communities and our economy  The new social security no match regulations will only exacerbate the already serious problems of our immigration system by causing even more confusion about who can be hired  resulting in the unjust firings of legal workers who look foreign and driving more hard working people into the shadows  Todays proposal is prime example of the need for a comprehensive overhaul of our nations outdated immigration laws  Senate Democrats voted for real reform and for the sake of the nation its high time for Republicans to join in that effort      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
