         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  made the following statement in response to the audit report released by the US Department of Education on student loans      Im very troubled by the Inspector Generals finding that AES PHEAA received at least  35 million in improper 9 5 percent subsidy payments  and may have received millions more  The Administration should move aggressively to recoup these funds  and AES PHEAA should immediately put controls in place to ensure that the improper billing cited in the report does not happen again     Its obvious that weve only scratched the surface in terms of revealing the full extent of the 9 5  loan scandal  The Inspector General needs to undertake a full scale review of every lender that received these subsidies  so students and taxpayers can know which lenders benefited improperly and so the Secretary can recoup all wasteful payments and put the funds back into student aid  where they belong          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
