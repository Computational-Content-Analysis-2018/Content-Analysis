         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      As  prepared for delivery            I welcome our  participants in todays roundtable discussion on the No Child Left Behind Act    Im grateful to our colleagues on the committee  especially Senator Enzi and  his staff for helping us to arrange this roundtable           One of the major goals of the No  Child Left Behind Act is to have a capable teacher in every classroom across the  nation  We all know that teachers are an especially important factor in student  learning   They support  encourage  and inspire students to do their best and  become the best they can be  Im sure all of us here today have had great  teachers whom well never forget  International comparisons show that the United States is  falling behind other countries in student achievement   The heart of the problem  is the pervasive achievement gap between white students and other students   On  the most recent test comparing students in industrialized nations  white  students in the U S  performed better than the average for all countries  while  Hispanic and African American students did worse   If we can close this  achievement gap  and guarantee all students a good education  we can put America  back at the top of the list          Research also shows  that the way to close this achievement gap is to see that all children have good  teachers   One study found that having a high quality teacher for five years in  a row can overcome the average 7th grade achievement gap in math between lower  income and higher income children          Its unacceptable  that Americas most at risk students are too often taught by the least prepared   the least experienced  and the least qualified teachers   Students in  high poverty and high minority schools are twice as likely to be taught by new   inexperienced teachers than students in less poor and less diverse schools    Such teachers are less likely to receive the pay and support they need and they  often leave their school or leave teaching all together  further destabilizing  already struggling schools          The teacher  distribution gap exists for many reasons  such as poor working conditions   outdated facilities  large class sizes  inadequate salaries and benefits  and  better support for individual teachers   These are all problems that can be  solved         Its especially  troubling  given the global challenges we face  that we have such serious  teacher shortages in math and science  Nearly half the math classes in  high poverty or high minority high schools are taught by teachers without a  major or minor in math or a math related subject   From 1990 to 2002  the  percent of public high school math teachers with full certification in math  decreased from 90 percent to 80 percent  We need teachers well trained in these  basic subjects who can inspire students to study them         Today were here to discuss some proven  strategies and innovative approaches to meeting these challenges          Obviously  we need  to do more to recruit better teachers for high need schools   They deserve  better financial incentives  better training  better opportunities to advance in  their careers  and stronger support in taking on the added challenge of teaching  in high need schools         Retention of good teachers is also a problem   In  the 2003 2004 school year  nearly 270 000 public school teachers left the  profession   The percent of teachers leaving the profession has risen steadily   from 6 6 percent in 1994 to 8 4 percent in 2004   In 2004  28 percent of those  who left the field had less than 3 years of experience   Workplace conditions   lack of support  and lack of opportunities for professional development are  major considerations in their decisions to leave their schools   Its clear that  what were doing now to support and retain teachers isnt enough          Today  well discuss  some of the innovative models that schools are using to overcome these problems   reduce the teacher distribution gap  and strengthen teaching as a profession    Well hear about the importance of strong leadership and better strategies for  recruiting and retaining good principals in schools where theyre needed most           Well also hear  about how to measure teacher effectiveness   There is no scientific formula for  what makes a great teacher  Excellent educators are produced by combination of  factors  knowledge of content  good classroom preparation  the right  personality  support from other teachers and communication with them  and  continuous learning in and outside of the classroom             Student test scores are not the only measure   A  balanced approach is needed  so that we can direct training and other resources  as effectively as possible         All of you here  today have much to contribute to this discussion of effective strategies to meet  these challenges   We look forward to your insights  and we appreciate your  willingness to be here today  The roundtable format enables us to hear from more  people and to have an interactive discussion   After Senator Enzi makes his  introductory remarks  well ask each of our participants to describe the  strategies that have been effective in their communities for recruitment and  retention of teachers  and the types of support and professional development  that are most effective in high need schools   Once each witness has responded  we  will open up the discussion so my colleagues can comment and ask questions   In  order to keep the discussion moving  we request that all participants limit  their responses to any question to one minute   If the need arises  we will vary  the format a little to fit the discussion   Laura Capps
