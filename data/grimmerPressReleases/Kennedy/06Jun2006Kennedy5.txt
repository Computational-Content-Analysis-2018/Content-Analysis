         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                     Its no surprise that the American people are frustrated with the Republican Senate these days  They deserve and want action on the enormous challenges we face as a nation  the endless and costly war in Iraq  the many dangers to our national security  skyrocketing gas prices  soaring health care costs  the upcoming hurricane season  How we can have safer schools and better care for our children  and so many other urgent issues  But instead of dealing with these real priorities  the Senate Republican leadership is asking us to spend time writing bigotry into the Constitution    Why arent we taking up the Defense Authorization Bill  which is so vital to our national security  It provides the authorization for the salaries for our troops in the field  including a 2 2  pay raise  It provides urgently needed equipment for our troops to carry out their missions in humvees with safer body armor  It authorizes the food and supplies our troops need in Iraq and Afghanistan  It contains funds to care for those who are injured or wounded  or who may be suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder when they come home  But the Republican leadership of the Senate has told us that supporting our troops has to wait    Lets be clear about what this debate is really about  Its a blatant effort to deny some members of our society the right to receive the same benefits and protections that married couples now have  Like this Senates intrusion into the Terry Schiavo case  it is a cynical attempt to score political points by overriding state courts and intruding into individuals private lives and most personal decisions  Its the politics of prejudice and division at its worst    Make no mistake  a vote in support of this amendment has nothing to do with the protection of marriage  A vote for it is a vote against civil unions  against domestic partnerships  and against all other efforts by states to treat gays and lesbians fairly under the law  Its a vote to impose discrimination on all 50 states  and to deny them their right to write and interpret their own state constitutions and state laws  Its a vote to deny states the right to define what marriage equality means    Marriage is a solemn commitment to plan a future together  to share in lifes celebrations  to be there as a source of comfort to ease lifes burdens and pains  This impacts real families with real life struggles  When the citizens of a state have decided to recognize those families    through their state constitution or state laws    the Senate has no business undermining their personal  private decisions    Some even claim that our recent action in Massachusetts is a threat to the rest of the nation  Over 8 000 couples have celebrated their commitment to each other since our Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the state constitution requires marriage equality    In ruling to allow same sex marriage  our states Supreme Judicial Court was interpreting the Massachusetts Constitution  not the U S  Constitution  The court ruled that our states Constitution forbids the creation of second class citizens  It concluded that the state could not deny the protections  benefits and obligations of civil marriage to two individualsregardless of genderwho wish to marry    Far from being a right createdas our opponents like to sayby activist judges  the right of all our citizens to have equal treatment under Massachusetts state laws was granted and approved by the people of Massachusetts when they voted on and adopted our State Constitution  The people said that our states Constitution forbids the creation of second class citizens  and our courts affirmed equality for all   In Massachusetts  civil marriage brings all the benefits of a marriage license  and equal status under the marriage laws  which touch upon nearly every aspect of life and death  In addition to all the intangible benefits of marriage  a civil marriage is a contract    it grants valuable property rights  protection against creditors and the automatic entitlement to the property of their spouses estate when he or she dies    Under state laws in Massachusetts and many other states  marriage confers property rights  And the specific property rights vary from state to state  Some states have a community property regime  Others  like Massachusetts  do not   But it has always been a bedrock principle of our form of government that the kind of state property rights flowing from a civil marriage contract is a matter of state law  not federal law  And the laws governing the property rights of a married couple have always varied from state to state    For example  a couple married in Louisiana will have all property owned in that state subject to the community property laws of that state  But if they own property in another state  that property is governed by the laws where the land is owned   Now some of our colleagues want to federalize the rights flowing from civil marriage and overrule individual state laws  How odd that the same people who oppose federal regulation in almost every other area now want a federal constitutional amendment to eviscerate state contract and property laws  but only when they grant benefits to same sex couples  That is discrimination  and its wrong   In Massachusetts  marriage   and the stability and security it brings to families    is alive and well  Indeed  Massachusetts has the lowest divorce rate in the nation  Were having plenty of public debate and democratic process  The sky is not falling  Indeed  even the Boston Herald editorial page called this weeks Senate debate what it really is  pandering on a hot button issue   Im proud that Massachusetts continues to be a leader on marriage equality  Being part of a family is a basic right  and I look forward to the day when every state accepts this basic principle of fairness    Obviously  those who disagree with Massachusetts law have a First Amendment right to express their views  But theres no justification for undermining the separation of church and state in our society  or for writing discrimination into the U S  Constitution    Supporters of the amendment claim that religious freedom is somehow under attack  It is  but the attack comes from this Federal Marriage Amendment  not from whats happening in the states  This amendment is an Anti Marriage Amendment  It tells churches they cannot recognize a same sex marriage  even though many churches are now doing so    No church in Massachusetts is required to recognize any civil marriage  Indeed  my own Catholic Church does not recognize most post divorce second marriages between a man and a woman  and thats their legal prerogative  By the same token  they are not required to recognize same sex marriages  The law of each church is what determines the religious aspects of a sacramental marriage  But the law of the states is what determines the civil aspects and property rights flowing from a marriage contract   We cannot  and should not  require any religion or any church to accept any marriage as sacramental  Thats up to the particular religion  But it is wrong for our civil laws to deny any American the basic right to be part of a family  to have loved ones with whom to build a secure future and share lifes joys and tears  and to be free from the stain of bigotry and discrimination   According to the 2000 Census  same sex couples live in virtually every county in the country  Thats almost 600 000 households  Nearly one quarter of these couples are raising children  Thats an estimated 8 to 10 million children being raised in gay and lesbian partnered homes  As many as 14 million children in America have a gay or lesbian parent    Despite these growing numbers  many here in the Senate want to deprive these men and women  these children  and their families  of the legal protections and benefits associated with marriage  These families stand up to private bigotry and prejudice in their ordinary activities   why would the federal government make their lives harder by writing discrimination into the Constitution  Its wrong for Congress to add another burden to these families already struggling to live their lives and take care of each other    The General Accounting Office has identified 1 138 protections and benefits provided by the federal government on the basis of marital status  Many of these are laws relating to family and medical leave  social security benefits  and tax benefits  Gay and lesbian couples deserve the same rights as married couples  including the right to be treated fairly by the tax laws  to share insurance coverage  to visit loved ones in the hospital  and to have health benefits  family leave benefits  and the many other benefits that automatically flow from marriage    Supporters of the Federal Marriage Amendment claim the need to stop activist judges  Our colleagues should recall the words of another activist court    The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the most vital personal property rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness    The activist judges stating this fundamental belief were part of the Supreme Courts 1967 decision in the landmark case Loving v  Virginia  which held that marriage is a basic civil right  and that freedom to marry a person of another race may not be restricted by racial discrimination    Now  nearly forty years later  I urge the Senate not to turn back the clock on this progress  or start writing discrimination into our countrys most cherished document  The framers never wanted it to be used for short term political games  thats why it is so difficult to amend  As Chief Justice John Marshall said  the Constitution is intended to endure for ages to come    Two years ago  we defeated a disgraceful attempt to force this right wing agenda into the Constitution and we re prepared to do so again  There is too much at stake to let the politics of bigotry prevail  I urge the Senate to reject this so called Federal Marriage Amendment  and get back immediately to the real business of the nation  Save the pandering for right wing supporters on the campaign trail          Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633
