         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  we re all thankful for those comments given by our members about the extraordinary bravery and heroism of our men and women who serve in the armed forces of our country  and all of us are day after day salute to their courage and their dedication to the country and it reminds us of our responsibility of making sure we re going to get the policy right in Iraq  More about that at another time  Mr  President  I think we find ourselves now in the middle of June and it s important  as we move through a legislative agenda    and more on that next week    that we pause for a few moments and take stock about where our country is in terms of its    the economy of this nation and take stock about where our country is with regards to working families in this nation  we get often tied up on particular pieces of legislation  but I think all of us are very mindful that it is the working families of this nation that have made America great  If America is great    and it is great    it s because of the working families in all parts of our nation  And we re mindful of our recent history of those extraordinary men and women that lifted our nation out of the great depression of the 1920 s and the 1930 s  the extraordinary exploitation of workers that took place even prior to that time and during that period of time and the struggle that workers had in order to have a voice in the decision making part of this nation in the work workplace as well as in governmental policies that influenced the conditions with which they worked  and it was a long  continuing struggle  And it was a long  continuing struggle with the loss the loss of life and blood that was shed and battles that were fought  physically fought  and out of the end of it came the really trade union movement  which has made such a difference in terms of the life of this country  the fairness of the country  the economic fairness and economic justice of the nation  And it s always impressed me as one who has been the    a sponsor of the increase in the minimum wage with a number of our colleagues  that even though many of these unions are making a good deal more than the minimum wage  that any time that that issue about working conditions for fellow Americans that are at the short end of the economic ladder  they re always out there  They re always there  They re always not only speaking but in support of their fellow workers in this country  That was seen in this last year in the seven different states that had initiatives about the increase in the minimum wage where the representatives of the trade union movement were out there going door to door working with other families  shoulder to shoulder  to try to indicate and reflect that this nation wanted to make sure that work paid  that those on the short end of the economic ladder  primarily women  were going to be able to receive a decent wage for a decent hour s work  recognizing that  again  the majority of women that were out there receiving the minimum wage had children  so it was a children s issue  it was a women s issue  a civil rights issue because so many of those they that earn the minimum wage are men and women of color  Most of all  it was it was a fairness issue and Americans understand fairness  What we have seen  Mr  President  over the more recent years is enormously distressing and disturbing because we have seen that those members of the trade union industry targeted by un unscrupulous employers and companies that are bent upon destroying the trade union movement and move us back into a different time and a different circumstance for those workers  We saw it in the fact that it took ten years for us to get an increase in the minimum wage  and the minimum wage was purchasing at the end of those ten years less perhaps than at any time in the history of the minimum wage  and we ve seen it reflected in the policies of this administration when they cut about seven million workers out of overtime and when they refused to include Davis  Bacon provisions with the restoration of the buildings and constructions down in    at Katrina and a whole series of additional kinds of activities  We see the courts as well strike striking down protections  In the last few weeks protection protections for an increase in minimum wage and overtime pay for home care workers and also a supreme court that is striking down effectively equal pay for women  There s really an assault on working families  Now  if we look back  Mr  President  at the history of this country  what really reflects  these are general statements and comments  but let s really look at what were the circumstances and what were the conditions that I speak about  If you look at 1947 to 1973  and we re looking here at the economic growth here in the United States of America  this is the Economic Policy Institute  and you look over this chart here  you will see that each segment of the American economy is all growing and virtually at the same rate  This was 1947 to 1973  America was growing together  This is really extraordinary  Mr  president  because we know we just came out of World War II  we had mobilized 15 million of our fellow citizens  and that had an extraordinary impact  We had to retool the whole domestic economy and still  we were able to see the growth in the United States of America move along at a similar kind of growth pattern so that all Americans and those at the low lowest end of the economic ladder moving just a little bit faster  a little bit faster than some of those  particularly  in the top 20   And then  Mr  President  from 1973 we find that up to the years 2000  a new political philosophy taking place in this country  and this was the policy policies that we re going to see the very dramatic and significant tax cut policies  the economic policies that took place in the 1980 s and after  the republicans    and look at this  Mr  president  Look how our level of growth between 1973 and 2000  Here we have the lowest economic growth growing at the lowest rate and on up to those at the top growing the fastest  In a number of instances  growing three or four times fast faster than those at the lowest  And that is directly a result of economic policies by primarily the executive and congress  with advantaged those individuals at the top of the economic ladder and disadvantaged those at the bottom  And if we look at what has been happening over the last five years  Mr  President  we see that those at the economic lad ladder at the lowest end are now not only moving not moving up  but falling further behind  and those top 10   not the top    1  1   not the top 20   the top 1  have been moving up dramatically  And so we re having a divided America  a divided America  a divided America  Now  let s see what is the one factor that has had the greatest influence on all of this what factor has been the trademark in all of this  Mr  President  This is an interesting chart  because remember we talked about 1947  how we all grew together  Look at this  Mr  President  We had the increase in productivity  that is  the increase in workers  output  finding more efficiencies  more effectiveness  and we also find a corresponding increase in the wages  American workers were participating in the increased productivity  And with that participation all during this 20 year period  the American economy and Americans were growing together  growing together  not apart  We ask ourselves  do we want to be a divided nation or do we want to be one nation with one history and one destiny  And then look what happened during the latter period  This is at a period of peak union membership  wages and productivity rise together  America was on the road to prosperity and all Americans were participating and the trade union movement played an important part to ensure fairness at the workplace  Now we find that the unions decline and what happens correspondingly  As the unions decline  the work workers fall further behind  Here  we have the real wages going across the last    from virtually from the 1970 s to 2007  virtually stagnant  and look at the increasing productivity grew at more than 206   more than wages  And what does that demonstrate  This  Mr  President  demonstrates that we have seen the extraordinary growth in the profits  We find workers  wages that are basically stabilized  corporate profits grew at the 63  and the wages went down here and the individuals went to the top  Top at the same period of time that workers and unions are being attacked and attacked and attacked  In 1947 to the early 1960 s  Mr  President  right in here  we had effectively what we call the card check off  which is the subject of the legislation that we ll be voting on next Tuesday  Interestingly  the card check off was in effect all during this period of time  from 1941  1946  1956  up to 1961  we had virtually the card check off  The legislation we ll be voting on next Tuesday has already been in effect and been utilized  We ll hear a lot of statements here on the floor of the United States Senate about a process and a procedure which is irregular  fraught with problems and complexities  but the fact of the matter is we had it in use here in the United States of America all during the period where we had economic stability and economic growth and the nation was growing together  And then as the National Labor Relations Board changed  the Supreme Court and businesses got geared up  they effectively eliminate ed the card check off  And we have seen what has been happening in the marketplace and this indication here by the abuses that have skyrocketed  So  Mr  President  when we had the check off  we had economic growth  we had economic prosperity  and America growing together  That is what we want  That is what next Tuesday morning is about  to restore this period of time when America  with the check off  was able to ensure economic growth and prosperity for workers across the board  That is what we re looking for  Now you say  well  what are all these abuses that you talk about  That s an easy word to use  but what are we really talking about  Mr  President  what we re talk talking about are these kinds of abuses  which are the everyday abuses being used in the workplace  First of all  the workers face too many roadblocks to try and get a union  Aver here  workers who lead the union effort are fired  I will give the examples and illustrations of that  Then the employer challenges the election results at the NLRB  So even if they have a successful vote in the union  30  to 50  of all of those results are challenged in the NLRB and then the employer appeals the ruling more often in court  and then the employer refuses and stalls and refuses to bargain for the contract  If you look and find what s been happening in courts  you ll find more of them have been upholding the national labor relations board when they have found against the workers  and then after one year  the employer    if they re able to delay    can seek to stop recognizing the union and the workers start all over again  This is a pattern  This isn t a unique situation  This is what is happening now  This is what is happening  This is what is happening  And this is what happens  Mr  President  We have the employees fired in one quarter of all the private sector in June organizing campaigns  One quarter  they re all fired  One in five workers who openly advocate for a union during an election campaign is fired  Now  it s fair enough to ask in 2005  30 000 workers received back pay after the national labor relations board found that employers had violate ed    30 000  Mr  president  in one year alone  30 000  That means that 30 000 employers at some time during the year fired people in violation of the law  30 000  That s 30 000 we re talking about that are being treated on that part  Now  Mr  President  the question can come about do workers really want to join  I mean are we talking about something that is a real problem or not  Here s 1984 to 2005  Workers want unions more than ever  but can t join them  The percentage of nonunion work workers that want a union is up 23   The percentage of workers in a union is down 6 5   so you d think with those kinds of indicate ors that we would be able to have a clear pathway where people would have an opportunity to join  but that is not the case  And what we have seen  Mr  President  what we have seen  Mr  President  is that across the countryside on the wide range of different kinds of issues  this is what s happening  Mr  President  across the countryside with the average family in this country  we find that gas is up 79   we find that medical is up 38   we find tuitions are up 43   we find the housing is up 40   and wages effectively are stagnant or held at up 4   Mr  President  the numbers of people that wanted to join the unions showed that more than the work force  more than 60 million workers would join a union if they could  but they cannot  Now  we ve given you some of the flow lines and the statistics  Mr  President  but these charts here show what happens to some real people  I was fired  They forced us to attend meet meetings  they threatened that if our campaign was successful  our paychecks would suffer  Managers would follow me around the workplace at all times  They would not permit other work workers to talk to me  They isolated me from my co workers  Within days after the union election was certified by the National Labor Relations Board  I was fired  This gentleman here had worked in that plant and had found all kinds of safety concerns  raised these safety concerns to the employers and was told to keep quiet  even though he believed that those kind of safety matters were really endangering the lives of the people that he was working with  And when he found that the employers were unwilling to try and address some of these safety conditions  he said I ve got to try and form a union  and then he had these following circumstances  that within days after the union election was certified  he was fired  So this is happening out there  these are examples of the 30 000  Mr  President  Ana Calles who was a laundry worker in California  the union was the only way to have better pay  insurance  equality and not discrimination  When we tried to organize  management told us we would lose our jobs  The workers are scared  NLRD has not been able to help machine  We ve had to wait three years to get a decision  Delay  delay  delay  Since the appeal of the NLRBs ruling the company committed intense violations of workers  rights so an spa and her co work co workers are suffering  It s quite clear why individuals want to be able to join for those workers  These are the Department of Labor statistics that show that work workers are going to be able to have an income  modest income up to one third more than those that are not  Mr  President  If you look at particular sectors of our economy  this is an interesting chart  Mr  President  Union jobs mean higher wages for women and for people of color  Again  we re talking about equity in this country  we re talking about fairness in this country  This is what unions do in terms of equity and in terms of fairness  If you look at women  the difference that it makes in terms of helping to assist them  31  if you re talking nonunion American women latinos  This is the federal poverty line Mr  President  this black line that goes across here  now  look at what is the figures are  national figures for these particular industries  the cashier  child care  cook  and the housekeeper  And if they are nonunion  they re below the poverty line  If you re a cashier and you re a member of a union  you re just above it  a little less than  25 000  We re talking about people that have a sense of dignity and pride and desire to do a good day s work  and these are men and women of pride  And we re what we re talking about is  20 000   25 000 a year  Mr  President  Child care  The difference at a union wage  it is just about at the poverty    federal poverty level  If you re a cook  it s just again a little above the poverty level  And a housekeeper  just above  This is the commitment to try and make sure that work pays and that we re not going to have our fellow Americans living in poverty  We re talking about people that want to work  can work  will work  and that chart is about as clear an indication of the difference if they have an opportunity to join  Mr  President  I ll mention just a couple of companies that have recognized the card check process  There are some employers that have been remarkably enlightened and have recognized it and say  we re going to let the workers in our company  if they choose to have a check off  we ll recognize it  That used to be the way the law went and a number of companies  such as Cingular wireless  has supported that concept and the management didn t pressure us or try to interfere  we didn t attack the company  they didn t attack us  we were focused on improving our jobs and making Cingular a better place to work  This is the executive president on human service  Rick Bradley said we believe employs should have a choice  making that choice available to them and observe the results  Employees who are engage ed in the business and who have a passion for customers  The purpose of this  Mr  President  is to show when America has been at its best and its strongest  we have grown and we all grow together  When but we find out America is divided and the principal reason for this kind of division is demonstrated with these charts is so often because employers have assaulted and attacked the workers and their representatives over this history  We want to try and bring America back together again  make it stronger from an economic point of view  Final chart  which shows in Ireland the strongest economy in Europe  the highest union member membership and the strongest annual growth  Partnership and fairness and decency go hand in hand  and I hope the senate will recognize that on the Tuesday next when we vote       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
