         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC   Today the New Democratic Network kicked  off their campaign to pass comprehensive immigration reform this year with a  forum that included Senators Edward Kennedy  Harry Reid  Bob Menendez and the  two leaders of the battle in the House  Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren and  Congressman Luis Gutierrez   Kennedy is working with Senator McCain and  Representatives Gutierrez and Flake on new legislation that will be introduced  in the coming days   NDN has been one of the strongest advocates for tough but  fair reform and NDN President Simon Rosenberg conveyed that passing  comprehensive immigration reform is one of NDN s highest legislative priorities  this year  Below is Senator Kennedys  statement  as prepared for delivery  We have an excellent opportunity this year to enact  comprehensive immigration reform   The Senate passed a good bill last spring but  unfortunately it became mixed in election year politics and never passed   In  fact  as voters made clear last November   The American people understand the  issue and they want real reform   Its up to us to give it to them    None of us can turn our  back on our immigrant histories   As President Kennedy so often said America is  a nation of immigrants   Like many of you here today  my family arrived in this  country not all that long ago   All they had was a vision of a better life and  the will to work hard to make it a reality   They developed one other defining  attribute  an intense love of their new homeland   We see that deep devotion to  America in countless immigrants today  Last weekend  I was in Boston for the decommissioning of  the U S S  John F  Kennedy  the aircraft carrier named for my brother and  launched 40 years ago this year   It was a moving experience for me and all of  the members of our family who were there   The highlight of the weekend was the  swearing in ceremony for 300 new citizens on the carrier    some of whom are  members of the ships crew   60 000 members of our armed forces  today are  immigrants  and they have chosen to serve our nation because of their sense of  patriotic duty  Immigrants constantly renew  our country both economically and  culturally  and they strengthen its values    The continued growth and prosperity of America depend on it   Ask any  economist   immigrants contribute enormously to our  economy  But the immigration system  itself is broken   Millions of undocumented workers live and work in our  communities in daily fear that they will be exposed and deported   Their  unlawful status makes them easy targets for exploitation by unscrupulous  employers   They live in the shadows  afraid to contribute to and participate  fully in their communities   They deserve better than that  and its up to us   to give them a reasonable path to citizenship   We also need to amend the  law to allow the lawful entry of workers to meet the needs of our economy and do  the jobs that Americans cannot do or choose not to do   When they come here   they deserve the full protection of our wage and labor  laws  Finally  we have to do a  better job of controlling our borders   We cant solve the problem of  undocumented workers and adopt a successful temporary worker program unless we  can control our borders   Ultimately  our immigration  laws speak volumes about us as a nation   Each of us is here because America  opened its arms to us or to our ancestors   We succeeded as a nation because we  attracted and welcomed generations of immigrants who abided by Americas values  of hard work  perseverance  faith  family and love of country   Immigrants are  our heritage and our history  and theyre also our future   The time is now for  honest and fair immigration reform   Lets get it done                                                             Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202 224 2633
