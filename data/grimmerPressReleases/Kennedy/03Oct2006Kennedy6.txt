         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to the admission from the White House that Secretary Rice was briefed by the CIA about the Al Qaeda threat months before 9 11  as reported in todays New York Times   The extent to which this Administration will go to cover up their own mistakes is breathtaking  and quite simply  dangerous  Each of this administration s failures has been compounded by a stubborn refusal to face facts and take responsibility  It is also increasingly clear that the Republican Congress has made it far too easy for this administration to avoid accountability to the American people  If the Republicans in Congress had taken their oversight responsibilities seriously  it would not have taken five years for these basic facts to come to light  Each day  it seems we learn of new facts demonstrating this Administration knew about the nations threats whether it be 9 11 or on the ground in Iraq  and failed to take the appropriate action  Each day  we learn of a new sad and disturbing revelation for the nation     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
