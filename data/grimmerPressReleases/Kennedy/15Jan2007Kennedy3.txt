         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today Senators Edward M  Kennedy and Chris Dodd sent a letter to Secretary Robert Gates questioning him about a recent article that two new brigades of troops the President intends to send to Iraq will be deployed without the protection of the most up to date armored vehicles  The Senators  who strongly oppose the escalation of the war  contend that it makes no sense to send even more of our forces into danger and ask the Secretary of Defense to explain what he is doing to rectify the problem and provide adequate protection  Senator Kennedy has fought for increased funding for body armor and humvees since the start of the war  Working side by side with families of fallen soldiers  he remains committed to ensuring that our men and woman have the equipment they need as they put their lives on the line for the United States  Last week  Senator Kennedy introduced legislation that would require Congress to vote before the President escalates troop levels to fight a civil war  giving the American people a voice in the process  Senator Dodd is the author of several provisions signed into law to provide U S  military members critical combat equipment  including a 2006 measure to restock thousands of war battered military vehicles and a 2004 initiative to reimburse troops for buying their own body armor and other gear for use in Iraq and Afghanistan  Below is a text of the letter and story from the Baltimore Sun  January 15  2007The Honorable Robert M  GatesSecretary of Defense1000 Defense PentagonWashington D C  20301 1000Dear Secretary Gates  Were writing to express our concern that the proposed troop surge by the President will put 22 500 more U S  troops in Iraq without the best armor protection available  The Presidents proposal is intended to secure Baghdada notorious site for IEDs  We are enclosing a recent article in the Baltimore Sun  which reports that the two new brigades of troops the President intends to send to Iraq will be deployed without the protection of the most up to date armored vehicles  These latest vehicles  which have V shaped bottoms  enable vehicles to better withstand explosions and provide significantly better protection for our troops  This shortfall is endangering many of our troops already in Iraq  and appears to be yet another in a litany of failures to provide adequate armor to the troops  We are concerned for many reasons about the Presidents proposed troop increase  but surely  if we cannot provide adequate protective vehicles to our troops already in Iraq  it makes no sense to send even more of our forces into this danger  Please let us know what are you are doing to rectify the armor shortages for our troops currently in Iraq  and what you will do to provide adequate armor protection if the Presidents proposal to send more troops is implemented  We look forward to your responses to these questions and to understanding the ways in which you propose we address these shortfalls With respect and appreciation  Sincerely Edward M  Kennedy Christopher Dodd BALTIMORE SUNOriginally published January 10  2007Better armor lacking for new troops in IraqThe military services said last month that they need 4 060 of the MRAP vehicles  with 2 500 for the Army  538 for the Navy and 1 022 for the Marines  The delivery schedule is uncertain  Meanwhile  a permanent replacement for the Humvee  incorporating the latest design and armor improvements  is years away  Pentagon officials said  and mired in technical and cost disputes Separately  the Army is buying the 15 ton M1117 armored vehicle for its military police  The V hull vehicles were in production in the late 1990s but were canceled by the Army as unnecessary  In June 2004  the service decided that it needed them after all  The Army has said it needs 2 600 Today  Textron Inc  is producing 48 per month at its New Orleans plant under a contract for 1 250 vehicles That s all they had the money for  said Clay Moise  vice president for business development for Textron s Marine and Land division But a lack of money only partly explains why  four years into the war  there is a shortage of vehicles that can effectively survive an IED The key reason it is taking so long is pretty simple  At each step along the way for the past four years  the key policymakers have assumed we were just months away from beginning to withdraw from Iraq  said Loren B  Thompson  a national security analyst at the Lexington Institute  a nonpartisan think tank in Arlington  Va  As a result  they never made long term plans for occupying the country effectively Aldrich said the explanation is more complex This is a radically different vehicle  and it took time  even under the pressure of war  for this country to tool up and meet the demand  he said  Our contribution to the delay was not being able to press a button and instantly start producing 20 a week  And the warfighter had to adjust and realize this wasn t a temporary problem   that we are more likely to face this type of attack than any other for decades to come The Humvee  of course  has its admirers  In its newer versions  such as the M1114  added armor is matched with a more powerful  turbocharged diesel engine and other improvements I love it  It s not at all hard to drive  said Army Spec  Jessica Dersch  22  of Erie  Pa  I ve been through three explosions in 10 months  she said in a recent interview outside Camp Blue Diamond in Ramadi But the IED threat to Humvees is reflected in the Marines  hard won experience in Anbar province If you are hit by an IED  your chance of survival is four or five times greater in an MRAP than in a M1114  said a Marine commander  referring to the standard Humvee About half of the Marines  combat vehicles in Anbar are Humvees  and these are associated with 60 percent of the combat deaths and 65 percent of the wounded Marines  officers said  By comparison  attacks on V hull armored vehicles have resulted in 2 1 percent of Marine combat deaths and 3 5 percent of the service s wounded A report released yesterday by the Government Accountability Office  the investigative arm of Congress  said the IED problem came about in large measure because there were not enough U S  troops in Iraq after the 2003 invasion to secure Saddam Hussein s ammunition caches In the weeks after the invasion  vast amounts of anti personnel and anti tank mines  artillery shells and other explosives were stolen from unguarded Iraqi arsenals IEDs made from looted explosives have caused about half of all U S  combat fatalities and casualties in Iraq and have killed hundreds of Iraqis  the GAO said david wood baltsun com http   www baltimoresun com about bal reporterfeedback 0 4526743 htmlstory recipient
