         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The Republican back room deal on education includes the biggest cuts to student loan programs ever  in order to secure  13 billion for tax giveaways for the richest Americans  America can do better for our students and families struggling to open the doors of education for their children  Our future depends on it    At a time when college costs have increased by 46  since 2001 and Pell grants have been stagnant for the fourth year in a row  this deal abandons the Senate provisions increasing the maximum Pell grant by  450  The small amount of funding for student aid included in the Conference report     13 billion for tax cuts and only  3 75 billion for students   will only be available for a very small subset of students  We should provide incentives for students to study math and science  but at the same time give every American the chance to attend college   We must address the broader crisis of hundreds of thousands of college ready students never making it because costs are too high and student aid falls short  In today s global economy  we need more scientists and engineers  but every qualified student should get the help he or she needs to achieve the American dream    I also am disappointed that this bill rejects Senate passed proposals to increase competition in the federal loan programs  This will give private lenders an unfair advantage over the more cost efficient federal loan program  The end result will be increased costs to taxpayers  The actions taken today hand the keys of the student loan program over to profit hungry banks and lenders  The United States Senate missed the opportunity to say students  not banks  should be given a break   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
