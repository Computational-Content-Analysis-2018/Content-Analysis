         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE              Mr  Chairman  I commend you for holding this important hearing on the contributions of immigrants in the United States Armed Forces to the defense of our nation     I also want to commend Senator Warner  McCain  Senator Graham and Senator Martinez for their leadership in moving us forward toward realistic immigration reform      If anyone doubts the many benefits that immigrants bring to our country  they need to look no farther than their valiant service in the United States military   These immigrants could easily have taken civilian jobs to care for their families   But today  More than 60 000 naturalized citizens and permanent residents now wear the uniform of the United States of America   They take the same oath of enlistment as any American soldier  sailor  airman or Marine    I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies  foreign and domestic  that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same  and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me  according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice   So help me God   I can think of no greater commitment to their adopted land     They take this solemn promise to heart   In all of our wars  immigrants have fought side by side with Americans  and with great valor   They make up five percent of our military today  but over our history have earned 20 percent of the Congressional Medals of Honor   And at least 101 have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in Iraq and Afghanistan   Since the President and Congress made changes to expedite citizenship applications filed by immigrant men and women in our armed services  more than 13 000 service members have naturalized   I have had the honor and privilege of participating in military naturalization ceremonies for some of these green card troops     Naturalization has a special place in our society   It is the uniquely powerful moment when new citizens embrace our nation  and our nation embraces them   Naturalized citizens are Americans by choice  and that choice is a great tribute to our country and its ideals   Given the deep commitment of these immigrants to our land  it is an affront to their noble military service to declare the 12 million undocumented immigrant men  women and children to be criminals  as some in Congress have done   And it is an insult to their dedication to our defense when the far right in Congress makes the wrong headed bumper sticker claim that the solution to our immigration problems is just to build more fences and add more border patrols   We have tried that before and it doesnt work   And this simplistic proposal led by the far right in Congress is a formula for failure   It would leave us weaker and less secure   Americans know that our immigration system is broken   But they also understand that immigration is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive solution   Clearly  we must take serious steps to secure our borders and enhance enforcement   But common sense suggests that we are not going to round up 12 million undocumented immigrants and deport them   Instead  we owe it to our nation to take into account what these hard working immigrant families have to offer to Americas strength  security  and values in the years ahead   We must provide a path for them to learn English  pay their taxes  show a steady work history  and earn the privilege of American citizenship   And we must establish a means for future immigrants to come here legally to meet the legitimate needs of our employers for more workers     We must also enact the DREAM Act  which is included in the Senate bill   This bipartisan compromise will enable immigrant students to pursue higher education like citizens  or join the military  as many are eager to do   The DREAM Act is the right title  since the Act will give thousands of bright  hard working immigrant students a chance to peruse their American Dream   By denying them these opportunities  we deny our country their intelligence  their creativity  their energy  and often their loyalty     President Bush and a bipartisan majority in the United States Senate support this comprehensive immigration reform   And religious leaders  business leaders and community leaders are calling on Congress to pass this it this year        These leaders support comprehensive reform because they are eyewitnesses to the patriotic spirit of our courageous immigrants in uniform as well as the many  many other immigrants who are part of our extraordinary history and heritage   Immigrants are an indispensable element of what makes America the Promised Land   They have contributed immensely to our communities   They have created new jobs  and even whole new industries  and have helped make America the land of freedom  hope and opportunity that it is today   Once again  we honor those immigrants who serve in our military  especially in these dangerous and difficult times   I commend this Committee for convening this hearing on such an important subject  and I thank the distinguished witnesses for their testimony today      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
