         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy                       202  2224 2556    WASHINGTON  DC    Senators Edward M  Kennedy and John F  Kerry and Representatives Barney Frank and James McGovern issued statements today on the action by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the time period for considering requests for a rehearing on the proposal to construct a liquefied natural gas terminal in Fall River  Massachusetts  The Senators and Representatives strongly oppose the LNG terminal in Fall River that was authorized on June 30th  2005     The City of Fall River  the Navy and other concerned parties had requested the rehearing  FERC will now be able to consider the requests without being bound by the 30 day time limit for reviewing such requests  which would have expired on September 15  2005    Senator Kennedy said  This misguided project should never be built  FERC now has a chance to correct its mistake and finally put to rest the idea of siting an LNG facility in Fall River  The additional information given to FERC provides more than enough evidence that the safety risks are far too great    We have got to stop this project from being built  It s the right thing to do for the people of Fall River and the right thing to do to from a homeland security aspect  At a minimum  this decision gives us more time to work with Mayor Lambert and others to get FERC to see the light  Without a doubt  their wrong decision on this project needs to be reheard and reassessed  said Senator Kerry     Congressman Frank said  There have been significant developments since the FERC decision that strengthened our already strong case  I hope that the FERC will use this extension to look at the new national security and economic data as a basis to reverse the approval of this ill advised project    I am pleased that FERC has decided to at least listen to additional arguments against the Fall River LNG proposal  Rep  McGovern said  There have been a lot of developments since FERC s original decision  including the Navy s opinion and the provision in the transportation bill prohibiting the removal of the old Brightman Street Bridge  FERC needs to hear and consider these changed circumstances   Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy   202  2224 2556
