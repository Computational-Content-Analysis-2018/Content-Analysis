FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE YAWKEY CENTER FOR CANCER CARE GROUNDBREAKINGJUNE 18  2007 As Prepared for Delivery To the many patients and their families who come here  Dana Farber is one of the most important places they will ever visit in their lives  For those you treat  their lives are divided into a time before cancer and a time after  It is a tribute to your extraordinary skill  dedication and genius that so many patients can look back after years of healthy and fulfilling lives and say  Dana Farber made it possible As many of you know  Dana Farber helped my son  Ted  and my daughter Kara and our family through their illnesses  and were forever grateful for all you did You make it possible for patients to walk out these doors and enjoy the precious moments of lifethe holidays with family  the joy of children  the games at Fenwayand to do so free from the ravages of cancer  You bring joy to those who pace anxiously in the halls and in the waiting rooms  hoping for good news from the surgeon or the oncologist  At Dana Farber  you have made the extraordinary routine  and patients across Massachusetts and throughout the world have benefited immensely  We know the progress will continue far into the future  thanks to the astonishing research taking place at the Institute today In this century of the life sciences  cancer researchers are constantly expanding the boundaries of knowledge  Their discoveries are opening new doors of health and expectations for the 1 3 million people who are diagnosed with cancer every year  In recent years  weve reaped the benefits of better treatments and new methods of prevention for breast cancer  cervical cancer  lymphoma and leukemia  to name only a few Your success is a tribute to the vision and leadership of many dedicated doctors and civic leaders  but none more so than the man it was my privilege to know for many years  Sidney Farber  I learned a great deal from him during my own early years in the Senate  when he was defining a new future cancer policy  When I first became chairman of the Senate Health Subcommittee in 1971  Dr  Sidney Farber had a vision to create a comprehensive  leading edge cancer institute and I had the opportunity to help bring Sidneys vision for cancer research into reality It is impossible to know how many lives Sidney saved  how many scientists he inspired  and how many children he helped  with his great compassion and unique hope  His contributions were not limited to the hospital or the clinic  From the early 1950s to his death in 1973  he was a dazzling witness at numerous Congressional hearings on cancer research  He was a captivating speaker  and I remember how brilliantly he brought his optimism and excitement to the halls of government  Ever since  Ive been inspired by the commitment and dedication of all the doctors  the nurses  and the staff at Dana Farber  Youre proof that with strong dedication and true commitment to excellence  anything can be accomplished  The Army Air Force in World War II had a famous motto that could easily be applied to Dana Farber  The difficult we do immediately  The impossible takes a little longer  But not much longer  I would add  in the case of Dana Farber  So I extend my warmest congratulations and greatest respect to everyone who made this day possible  and I look forward to seeing see you all at the ribbon cutting
