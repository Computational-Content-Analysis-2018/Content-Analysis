         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy addressed over 500 grassroots health advocates from across the country at the 7th Annual Health Action Conference  Senator Kennedy spoke about the history of the Children s Health Insurance Program which he authored the legislation for and the critical importance of making its reauthorization a priority for the 110th Congress  The CHIP program  which will expire in 2007 unless it is reauthorized by Congress  has gone a long way towards reducing the number of uninsured children in America  However  millions of children still don t have access to health care or the services for which they are eligible  Senator Kennedy is determined to make sure that this critical program covers even more of America s children REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDYFAMILIES USAJANUARY 26  2007Thank you  Ron Pollack  for that generous introduction  Your skillful leadership  and your commitment to quality health care has made such a difference in countless debates on this important issue in Congress and across the country  Today  youre making progress through the strange bedfellows coalition  just the kind of bipartisan effort we need to help break the logjam and deal responsibly with the health care crisis thats such a serious ongoing challenge to the nation Families USA is an extraordinary organization that has been an inspiration to me and many others for many years  Everyone at this conference has devoted their energy and their spirit to one basic idea B that the promise of America belongs to every American and every family Year after year  we ve seen that promise delayed and denied  When I leave  I will go back to the fight to raise the minimum wage so that hard working Americans can live with dignity and security  Yet even this obvious advance has been blocked and stalled again and again in recent years  After six long years of the most rubber stamp Congress in my memory  I havethis to say Democrats are back and we re going to make some changes around here We have a huge amount of work to do  and we need your help to get it done  Earlier this week  the President came out with a health plan that hands out even greater benefits to the wealthy  does nothing to improve access to coverage  and undermines the health care safety net in order to give block grants to the states  That s the wrong approach  It doesn t support the bipartisan reforms that states like Massachusetts have undertaken  it undermines them The right approach is to make sure that every American can have the same kind of guaranteed coverage that their Congressman  their Senator and their President enjoys The place we need to start is CHIP  the Childrens Health Insurance Program that provides quality care for children in every state  In its first year  CHIP enrolled nearly a million children  and enrollment has grown ever since  Average monthly enrollment is now 4 million  and over 6 million have been enrolled for at least part of the year Its had a dramatic effect on coverage for children  Over the last decade  the percentage of uninsured children has dropped from 22 percent in 1997 to13 percent today  And that s in spite of the fact that more and more of their parents have been losing coverage because employers decide to reduce it or drop it entirely We know CHIP has made a difference in the lives of millions of children  but we also know that this is no time to rest on past success  because CHIP faces a severe and growing budget shortfall that will affect more and more states During the first years of the program  funds available to the states exceeded the need  but this situation is now the reverse  The budget we inherited from the Republican Congress assumes that CHIP funding will remain flat at about  5 billion a year  Even assuming only modest growth in the program s expenses  it would need  2 billion a year more than that  just to hold its own over the next five years  Well no longer have the safety valve of reallocating unspent funds from state to state  since more and more states will use up all their funds The effect of this shortfall will be felt across the nation  More and more states will have to cut back their services  17 States will face shortfalls this year  Next it will be 23  And by 2012  36 states will have needs greater than the available funds  and millions more children will be left out again  We cant let that happen We put a Band Aid on the problem last year  After months of stalling by some in Congress  we obtained  271 million in urgently needed funds for CHIP Band Aids are necessary to stop the bleeding B but they don t fix the problem  That s why I m joining Senator Rockefeller and Senator Snowe in introducing legislation to provide the funds we need to avoid the shortfall that will hit the states this year Passing that bill will be a good first step  but the greater challenge is to revitalize and strengthen CHIP so it fulfills its promise to cover all eligible children  We know that 9 million children in America today don t have health coverage  Two thirds of them6 millionare eligible for CHIP or Medicaid but aren t enrolled because of bureaucratic barriers  or because states have cut back their enrollment efforts due to lack of funds Think about that number  9 million children in the wealthiest and most powerful nation on earth  9 million children whose only family doctor is the hospital emergency room  9 million children at risk of blighted lives because of illnesses that could easily have been treated if they had a regular source of care 9 million uninsured children in America isn t just wrong B it s outrageous  and we need to change it  We need to start right now B not next year  not next month  but now We know where the Bush Administration stands  Well see their actual budget in a few weeks  It won t cover all children  It won t cover the children eligible for CHIP but who aren t enrolled  It won t even cover all the children in the program We can t rely on the Administration to do the right thing  Congress has to step up to the plate  We re fortunate to have champions like John Dingell  Jay Rockefeller  Olympia Snowe  and other colleagues who are ready to meet the challenge  In fact  there has been no greater champion of CHIP across the nation than my colleague Orrin Hatch  His commitment is as unwavering today as it was a decade ago when we worked together to create the program Our goal is to expand this needed program  improve its outreach  and make good health a reality for every child in America But we cant get it down without all of you as well You can persuade every newspaper in the country to run stories about the children who don t have health care B and to keep running them until we correct the problem You have to let every governor  every state representative  and every local mayor know that they should be calling Washington now  and keep right on calling until every child has decent health care  And most of all  you have to make your voices heard by every Senator and every Representative on Capitol Hill You have to let them know that making sure the nation s children have quality health care isn t just an option or a nice idea  It s not just something we wish we could do It s something we have to do  It s an obligation and it s a clarion call to action So  let me close by asking you this Are you ready for this battle Are you ready to fight for working families Are you ready to fight at long last to make health care a right for every American child Were on the way  Thank you  Families USA  for all you do so well   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
