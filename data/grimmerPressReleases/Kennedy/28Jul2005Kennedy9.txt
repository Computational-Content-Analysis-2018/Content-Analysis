         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I join my colleagues in expressing my deep sorrow and regret that the Republican leadership has allowed another month to go by without taking action on the bipartisan stem cell bill approved overwhelmingly by the House of Representatives    Over the last several weeks  the Republican leaders in the Senate have ignored the true priorities of the American people  They ve denied the Senate the opportunity to provide our troops the protections they need against attack  They ve denied the Senate the chance to guarantee funding for veterans  health  and to raise the minimum wage  and to allow importation of lower cost medicine from Canada and other nations    And they have stalled and delayed  and twisted and turned  to deny action on legislation to unlock the healing potential of stem cell research    They say there s no time for stem cells  or for the needs of our troops  or our veterans  or working families  There s plenty of time to protect the makers of lethal assault weapons    but no time for lifesaving cures     The bill is right there  Mr  President  right there on that desk in front of you  At any time  the Majority Leader could walk over  pick it up and have a vote on a bill that would bring new hope to millions of Americans     But on that desk the bill is destined to remain    because the Republican leadership would rather appease its right wing base than take action on bipartisan legislation to help patients    For years  patients and their families have waited for a medical breakthrough to provide new hope for serious illnesses like Parkinson s Disease  spinal injury and Alzheimer s Disease    Then at last  dedicated scientists made that breakthrough  They discovered stem cells  which can repair the injuries that cause untold suffering and shorten lives    The cruel irony is that just as medicine was giving patients new hope  the Bush Administration snatched it away through needless restrictions on stem cell research     In a few days  on August 9th  patients across America will mark the fourth tragic anniversary of that cruel decision        We in the United States Senate had the opportunity    no  we had the responsibility    to see that August 9th of this year did not mark four years of failure and four years of missed opportunity     But the Republican leadership would not let us meet that responsibility  They let the first week of July slip by  and then the second  and now the last    all with no action on this urgently needed legislation    Every day that we delay is another day of falling behind in the race to cure diabetes  cancer  Parkinson s Disease  and many other serious illnesses    It s another day for America to lose ground to Korea  Singapore  Britain  and other nations in the competition for global leadership in biotechnology    Most of all  it s another day of shattered hopes for millions of patients and their families across America    Legislation should be an expression of our values  and our legislation says loud and clear that we value patients and their families    not rigid ideology    It s a travesty that no action has been taken on this lifesaving measure   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
