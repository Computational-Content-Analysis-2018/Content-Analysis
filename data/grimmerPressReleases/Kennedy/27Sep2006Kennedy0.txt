         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    WASHINGTON  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Senator Robert Menendez introduced the Honest Medicare Act of 2006 to monitor the Medicare Part D donut hole and its effect on senior citizens   Under the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003  the Medicare Prescription Drug benefit  also known as Part D  was designed with a coverage gap in the middle  This gap is known as the donut hole  After their total prescription drug costs have reached  2 250  beneficiaries must bear the full cost of those drugs alone for the next  2 850  with no assistance  Yet they are still forced to pay their monthly premiums   Senator Kennedy said  The Bush Administration and the Republican Congress enacted a Medicare drug law designed by the drug companies and for the drug companies  Millions of seniors will be denied the medicines they need because the law includes a gaping hole in the coverage    and the Bush Administration won t even tell Congress and the American people how many seniors are at risk  The first step toward finding a realistic solution is to honestly define the problem  Our bill requires the Administration to level with the American people on how many seniors are losing coverage for the drugs they need to protect their health   The Honest Medicare Act of 2006 would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide a monthly report on the number of seniors who have fallen into the donut hole  It would also require the Secretary to monitor and report on the amount that enrollees are spending on prescription drugs while in the donut hole   I have heard the heart wrenching stories from my constituents who have fallen into the donut hole and are no longer covered for critical medicines  said Menendez  What we dont know are the specifics of how many seniors have fallen into this hole and how much of their own money theyve had to spend on prescriptions  With better information we can tackle this problem afflicting so many of our seniors   Seniors are in danger of falling into the donut hole repeatedly and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that one third of enrollees will enter the coverage gap every single year  Because of the structure of the plan  which is tied to the annual increase in drug expenses for Medicare beneficiaries  the donut hole itself will only grow larger and more difficult for individual seniors to manage  and the Commonwealth Fund estimates that it will increase to  5 066 by 2013    According to the Institute for Americas Future  the average Medicare beneficiary who enrolled in the drug program at the beginning of this year has already fallen into the donut hole  and nearly 7 million seniors this year alone will find themselves in this looming coverage gap   The text of the bill is included below   To amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require monthly reporting regarding the number of individuals who have fallen into the Part D donut hole and the amount such individuals are spending on covered Part D drugs while in the donut hole   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled   SECTION 1  SHORT TITLE   This Act may be sited as the Honest Medicare Act of 2006   SECTION 2  MONTHLY REPORTING REGARDING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FALLEN INTO THE PART D DONUT HOLE AND THE AMOUNT SUCH INDIVIDUALS ARE SPENDING ON COVERED PART D DRUGS WHILE IN THE DONUT HOLE   Section 1860D 1 of the Social Security Act  42 U S C  1395 w 101  is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection    d  INFORMATION REGARDING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE REACHED THE INITIAL COVERAGE LIMIT Not later than the 15th of each month  beginning with February 2007   the Secretary shall make available to the public information on     1  the number of individuals enrolled in a prescription drug plan or an MA PD plan who have reached the initial coverage limit applicable under the plan but who have not reached the annual out of pocket threshold specified in section 1860D2 b  4  B   and    2  the amount such individuals are spending on covered part D drugs after they have reached such limit and before they have reached such threshold      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
