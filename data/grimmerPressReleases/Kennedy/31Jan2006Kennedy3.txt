         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  KAGAN  A lot of news happening today  including the death of civil rights icon Coretta Scott King  Also just minutes away from the Senate voting on the nomination of Samuel Alito to be the next Supreme Court justice     To get some comments on both of those  let s welcome in Senator Ted Kennedy  Democrat from Massachusetts     Senator  good morning KENNEDY     Good morning KAGAN  First  we re just minutes away from the Alito nomination  The efforts to filibuster this were basically a bust  What s the problem with the Democrats trying to pull together and be able to stop this nomination  sir KENNEDY  Well  first of all  I think you ll see in just a few minutes that the Democrats are together in voting their concern about whether Judge Alito is the right person to promote to the Supreme Court  whether he s going to be a part of the march to progress which we have seen over the period of these recent years and which all Americans are reminded about  particularly today  with the death of Coretta Scott King  who was really the mother of the civil rights movement  There s enormous poignancy  I think  in this vote  Coretta Scott King  a part of Dr  King s whole movement  knocked down the walls of discrimination and prejudice in this country  in this society  and someone who believed that we could be a better country when we did that  That was certainly an issue during the Alito hearings  I think you re going to see Democrats expressing their reservations about it  Let me just say  finally  I think this whole process reminds that Americans that we have    I can remember Democrats in recent times voting overwhelmingly for Republican nominees  We can do that  We have done it  I think Americans want us to be together when it comes to the Supreme Court  I think we can be together  but it s a two way street KAGAN     But  Senator  this is going to be one of the most partisan votes on a Supreme Court nominee that we ve seen KENNEDY  Well  I consider    I ll vote negatively  But I think if you re going to talk about partisanship I d say that our Republican friends are the partisanship because they didn t have to have this fight  did they  They had Harriet Miers and the Republican right wing gave the litmus test to Harriet Miers and they sunk her  I think what we learned from Harriet Miers and this nominee is that  like President Reagan nominating Sandra Day O Connor  all of us came together  all of us were together  And I would certainly hope that we ve learned this now  and that in the future we re going to have someone that can bring the nation together rather than being a divisive force  But we re reminded of this particularly because of Coretta Scott King and the extraordinary impact that she had on this country with Dr  King  And I think not only in her contributions in the civil rights battle  but also as a mother  I know the children and know the children well  She was an extraordinary mother  They all have a presence  They all resolved to giving something back to America  And I think we honor her memory by continuing the battles against discrimination and bigotry in our country KAGAN     She did lead an incredible life  indeed  and was an incredible woman  And we thank you for helping us remember her today     Senator Ted Kennedy KENNEDY     Thanks very  very much KAGAN     It s going to be a fascinating morning on Capitol Hill  as well     Thank you  Senator
