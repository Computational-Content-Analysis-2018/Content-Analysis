         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE             Its an honor to join you at the 97th Convention as you continue the NAACPs historic fight for fairness and equality   Since its founding in 1909  under the guidance of great leaders like W E B  DuBois  the NAACP has played a key role in enabling that the nation live up to its highest ideals of fairness  justice  and opportunity for all     Laws enacted because of many of you in this room have brought greater equality for racial and ethnic minorities   The workplace is more open and the ballot box is more accessible because of the NAACP   With leaders like Chairman Julian Bond  President and CEO Bruce Gordon  and Hilary Shelton from the Washington Bureau  the NAACP continues to lead the way   As we all know  the battle for racial equality in America is far from over   The landmark national laws of the past four decades have provided a foundation  but the full promise of these laws has yet to be fulfilled    Literacy tests and poll taxes no longer block access to the ballot box  but we cannot ignore the fact that discrimination is sometimes as plain as ever  and that more subtle forms of discrimination are plotted in back rooms and imposed by manipulating redistricting boundaries to dilute minority voting or by systematic strategies on election day to discourage minority voting    The persistence of overt and more subtle discrimination makes it critical that we reauthorize the Voting Rights Act  which is Congress greatest contribution to the Civil Rights Movement   For nearly a century  the Fifteenth Amendment promised that race would not limit access to the ballot box  but it took the Voting Rights Act to breathe life into that basic guarantee    And it took organizations like yours and the sacrifice of brave men and women who had the courage to gather at the Edmund Pettis Bridge and face the shameful violence of those who would deny them the right to vote before the nation finally acted     Im honored to have fought in the Senate for the Voting Rights Act each time it was before Congress  from the historic passage in 1965 to the votes to strengthen it in 1970  1975  1982 and 1992   In memory of Fannie Lou Hamer  Rosa Parks  Martin Luther King Jr  and Coretta Scott King   we need to all see that the Act is extended and strengthened again   We had a solid victory last week in the House  where a bipartisan coalition beat back poison pill amendments to pass the Act by a wide margin   In the Senate Judiciary Committee we take up the reauthorization bill later today and our goal is to have a vote by the full Senate before the August recess    The Acts temporary provisions dont expire until 2007  but we cant afford to wait until the last minute to extend the Act   We must build on the momentum already achieved in the House and Senate to guarantee the Act will continue to protect the precious right to vote   Each of you should let your Senators know how important it is to have their support for renewing the Voting Rights Act     Some still question whether there is still a need for the Acts expiring provisions   They even argue that discrimination in voting is a thing of the past  and that were relying on decades old discrimination to stigmatize certain areas of the country today   Ive heard the evidence presented over the past several months of hearings  and I can tell you that theyre just plain wrong   Yes  weve made progress that was almost unimaginable in 1965   But the goal of the Voting Rights Act was to have full and equal access for every American regardless of race  We have not achieved that goal    If voting discrimination is ancient history  why has a federal judge in Georgia have to intervene twice to block the states unconstitutional attempts to impose a discriminatory photo identification requirement for voting that makes it disproportionately hard for minorities to vote     Judge Murphy blocked the first version of the Georgia law as an unconstitutional poll tax  A poll tax   In 2006   In 1965  we fought the poll tax during the debate of the original Voting Rights Act   After the Supreme Court ultimately held it unconstitutional  we thought this shameful practice had ended   But the court found that the Georgia law was just a 21st Century version of this old evil   If the Voting Rights Act is no longer needed  how do you explain the Texas legislature shifting 100 000 Latino voters out of  a district just as they were about to defeat an incumbent and finally elect a candidate of their choice   The Supreme Court struck down that district last month in the cancelled LULAC v  Perry   In 1999  the Dinwiddie County Board of Supervisors in Virginia moved a polling place from a club with a large African American membership to a white church on the other side of town  under the pretext that the church was more centrally located   We saw this tactic when we renewed the Act in 1970   We didnt expect to see it again in on the eve of the 21st century  but we did            Or how about the town of Kilmichael  Mississippi  which cancelled its elections three weeks before election day  because an African American stood a strong chance of being elected the towns first ever African American mayor   Was that 1965   No  it was 2001   These arent examples of discrimination from the 1960s  They happened only recently  and they make clear that we must act now to reauthorize the Act  The NAACP has been a partner from the beginning and together we will renew it      Laura Capps Melissa
