         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa WagonerFebruary 2  2007         202  224 2633  FACT SHEET INCLUDED  Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy reacted to the declassified summary of the Iraq National Intelligence Estimate     that took nearly 3 years to produce  The key judgments of the report indicate that the conditions in Iraq will continue to deteriorate at rates comparable to the latter part of 2006 and confirm that the term civil war is accurate to describe the war in Iraq  even though conditions are more complex than the term describes  Frustrated by the lack of intelligence information  Senator Kennedy passed an amendment last August  requiring Negroponte to task the intelligence community to prepare an updated NIE  The last time the NIE was updated was in 2004  yet President Bush decided to escalate the war before this updated NIE was complete    The nations intelligence experts have confirmed the nightmare scenario for our troops in Iraq  The country is sliding deeper into the abyss of civil war and our brave men and women are caught in the middle of it  Prospects for halting the escalating sectarian violence are bleak  Greater chaos and anarchy are looming and needless additional U S  casualties are inevitable   Its abundantly clear that what we need is not a troop surge  but a diplomatic surge  working closely with other countries in the region  Sending more U S  troops into the cauldron of this civil war is not the solution to Iraqs political problems  Not only does President Bush fail to see that reality  but also hes going out of his way to defy it  He developed his plan to escalate the war before the completion of this intelligence estimate  and he continues to ignore the will of the people  and a bipartisan majority of Congress  Congress is right to send him a clear message of opposition to this strategy  and if he continues the present course  we must act to stop it  protect our troops  and end this misguided war Summary of Key Findings From Iraq NIE Iraqi societys growing polarization  the persistent weakness of the security forces and the state in general  and all sides ready recourse to violence are collectively driving an increase in communal and insurgent violence and political extremism   Unless efforts to reverse these conditions show measurable progress during the term of this Estimate  the coming 12 to 18 months  we assess that the overall security situation will continue to deteriorate at rates comparable to the latter part of 2006   Even if violence is diminished  given the current winner take all attitude and sectarian animosities infecting the political scene  Iraqi leaders will be hard pressed to achieve sustained political reconciliation in the time frame of this  Estimate   Despite real improvements  the Iraqi Security Forces  ISF particularly the Iraqi policewill be hard pressed in the next 12 18 months to execute significantly increased security responsibilities  and particularly to operate independently against Shia militias with success  Sectarian divisions erode the dependability of many units  many are hampered by personnel and equipment shortfalls  and a number of Iraqi units have refused to serve outside of the areas where they were recruited   Extremists continue to act as very effective accelerators for what has become a self sustaining inter sectarian struggle between Shia and Sunnis   Significant population displacement  both within Iraq and the movement of Iraqis into neighboring countries  indicates the hardening of ethno sectarian divisions  The term civil war accurately describes key elements of the Iraqi conflict  including the hardening of ethno sectarian identities  a sea change in the character of the violence  ethno sectarian mobilization  and population displacements  Iraqs neighbors influence  and are influenced by  events within Iraq  but the involvement of these outside actors is not likely to be a major driver of violence or the prospects for stability because of the self sustaining character of Iraqs internal sectarian dynamics  A number of identifiable internal security and political triggering events  including sustained mass sectarian killings  assassination of major religious and political leaders  and a complete Sunni defection from the government have the potential to convulse severely Iraqs security environment  In these conditions  three security paths might emerge o Chaos leading to partitiono Emergence of a Shia strongmano Anarchic fragmentation of power
