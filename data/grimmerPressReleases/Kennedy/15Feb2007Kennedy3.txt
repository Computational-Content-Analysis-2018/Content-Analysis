         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing  Senator Edward M  Kennedy questioned General Peter J  Schoomaker  Army Chief of Staff  about the lack of adequate armor for our men and women serving in Iraq  Senator Kennedy has repeatedly fought for increased funding for the protection of our troops  On January 10th he and Senator Dodd sent a letter to Secretary Gates outlining concerns and  receiving no response  Senator Kennedy sent an additional letter to General Schoomaker on February 12th  Below is his statement  as prepared for delivery  as well as the text of both letters  General Schoomaker  every time this committee has asked whether you have sufficient funding and equipment to protect our troops in Iraq  we have been assured that you do  In November of 2003 you told this committee  This army is committed and what we ve got to do is commit ourselves and make sure we re supporting our soldiers  Three years ago  you told this Committee  I am confident that were doing everything we can to move more up armored Humvees and other armored vehicles into theater  When I expressed frustration about the lack of armored humvees and the need to make it a higher priority in a February  2004 hearing  you said  we are raising production levels and Im with you 100  In April of 2005  the deputy to former Marine Corps Commandant  General Hagee  testified at a Seapower Subcommittee hearing that the Marines had all the funding they needed for the up armored humvees  Two months later  General Hagee assured this Committee that the force protection of our troops is absolute priority number one In June of 2005  when I raised this issue with General Myers  he assured us that safety and the force protection of our troops is absolutely first priority  In February of 2006  when I asked you again about this topic you said We re going to continue to have to either anticipate it and overproduce  which I believe we have in body armor  or come up with other solutions to this situation we ve got According to an April 2005 GAO report  the Army said nine times that they had enough armored vehicles  only to turn around and add more  Each time  the Army paid for them with funds Congress added to purchase armored vehicles in excess of the stated requirements Press reports keep emphasizing shortages of armor and armor kits  General Speakes said recently  We dont have the kits  and we dont have the trucks  Last week  General Pace said troops would even have to share armored vehicles  because there arent enough to go around And now we learn that least some of our troops in Iraq will be sent out in Humvees not yet equipped with the FRAG Kit 5 armor  which is designed to reduce deaths from roadside bombs It is outrageous that the Army has been so slow to respond to this obvious urgent need  It makes no sense whatsoever  to keep ordering our troops into combat without the armor they ought to have to protect themselves  General Schoomaker  I understand that your so called unfunded priority list for fiscal year 2008 includes  2 2 billion for MRAP vehicles  the most up to date protection for our troops    but you are not asking for any MRAP funding in the fiscal year 2008 budget  either in the basic budget or in the supplemental  Doesnt that raise questions about how serious the Army is about protecting our troops  How can we be adding to more troops if you cant assure that this committee that they have the most effective armor and vehicles The Marine Corps recently awarded 9 contacts for the production of MRAP vehicles that provide the best protection  As I understand it  the Army intends to reprogram about  90 million in already appropriated funds to buy about 60 of the vehicles  With more than  5 billion available to the Army in the FY07 supplemental for other procurement items why are you planning to spend such a small amount to increase production of these urgently needed vehicles  With so much at stake the routine testing schedule doesnt make sense unless major doubts exist about the vehicles  Lets get them to our troops as fast as possible  Lets not be penny wise and pound foolish when the crisis is now February 12  2007Gen  Peter J  SchoomakerArmy Chief of Staff200 Army PentagonRm  3E528 Washington D C  20310 0200Gen  Schoomaker  On January 10th I sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates outlining my concern that the Presidents planned escalation of U S  troops in Iraq without the best armor protection available  I received no response  Since sending the letter to Secretary Gates  there has been a variety of press reports confirming my fears  Last week Gen  Peter Pace testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee  referring to the surge  that Theres one area that is not going to be 100  equipment  and that has to do with the up armored Humvees and some of the armored trucks  This is unacceptable   In todays Washington Post  an article titled Thousands of Army Humvees Lack Armor Upgrade highlights the Armys struggle to meet the demand for additional armored Humvees to deal with the surge  The article points out that the Armys supply of Humvees with the latest armor kit is deficient by over 4 000 units  Despite ramped up production  the Army is still unable to provide an adequate number of Humvees to its troops   Unfortunately this is not a new issue  The lack of adequate armor is a problem that has become synonymous with the war in Iraq  Now  because of the even more deadly Explosively Formed Penetrators  the problem is only more pronounced   At this Thursdays hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee I hope you will be prepared to address for the Committee  A series of options for dealing with this critical equipment problem in the future  A clear strategy to ensure that none of our soldiers will be fighting without the full complement of the latest and most effective vehicle armor  Anything less than 100  of our soldiers having access to such protection is unacceptable   A clear explanation as to why additional troops should be deployed if it is a fact that they will be under equipped Sincerely Edward M  Kennedy January 15  2007The Honorable Robert M  GatesSecretary of Defense1000 Defense PentagonWashington  D C  20301 1000Dear Secretary Gates  Were writing to express our concern that the proposed troop surge by the President will put 22 500 U S  troops in Iraq without the best armor protection available  The Presidents proposal is intended to secure Baghdada notorious site for IEDs   We are enclosing a recent article in the Baltimore Sun  which reports that the two new brigades of troops the President intends to send to Iraq will be deployed without the protection of the most up to date armored vehicles  These latest vehicles  which have V shaped bottoms  enable vehicles to better withstand explosions and provide significantly better protection for our troops  This shortfall is endangering many of our troops already in Iraq  and appears to be yet another in a litany of failures to provide adequate armor to the troops  We are concerned for many reasons about the Presidents proposed troop increase  but surely  if we cannot provide adequate protective vehicles to our troops already in Iraq  it makes no sense to send even more of our forces into this danger  Please let us know what you are doing to rectify the armor shortages for our troops currently in Iraq  and what you will do to provide adequate armor protection if the Presidents proposal to send more troops is implemented   We look forward to your responses to these questions and to understanding the ways in which you propose we address these shortfalls   With respect and appreciation  Sincerely Edward M  Kennedy    Christopher Dodd  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
