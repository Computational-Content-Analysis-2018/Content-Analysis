         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for calling this hearing on the National Uniformity for Food Act  which would prohibit states from applying food safety laws unless they are identical to provisions of the Federal Food  Drug  and Cosmetic Act    This extreme bill is a giveaway to the food industry  and all Americans will pay for it with their health  Everyone agrees that the bill would pre empt Proposition 65  the California law that requires warning labels on products that contain ingredients known to the state to cause cancer  birth defects  or reproductive problems  But there is little agreement after that    The food industry claims that only about a dozen State laws would be pre empted  but the Center for Science in the Public Interest  with the support of many state officials  has identified about 200 such laws    For example  according to the Center  the bill would pre empt statutes regulating the quality of milk and food served in restaurants in all 50 states  It would pre empt laws on unsafe food and color additives and laws on shellfish in more than a dozen states  It would pre empt warnings required by at least 18 states about the effect of alcohol consumption by pregnant women on their unborn children    In Massachusetts  the sale of dead lobster is banned  because it decomposes so rapidly  We can now set more stringent bacterial standards for milk than under FDA guidelines  and ban or require warnings about food or color additives that are considered safe under Federal law  These and potentially other food safety laws in Massachusetts would be pre empted by S  3128     In fact  the bill is so vaguely written that we dont know how broad the pre emption of state and local health laws would be  There will certainly be costly litigation on the issue  Otherwise  states will have to assume their laws are pre empted and resort to the costly process in the bill to petition the FDA for exemptions  The Congressional Budget Office estimated costs of  100 million to FDA and  64 million to the states for these petitions over 5 years  But the estimate assumes that California will file one petition for Proposition 65  instead of one for each compound for which that law now requires a warning  Because determinations for each compound are obviously highly fact specific  there will need to be individualized petitions for each one  and the CBO estimate is obviously too low     State officials across the nation argue that their laws would be unfairly pre empted and their efforts to improve the safety of food would be crippled  The legislation obviously is intended to benefit the food industry  regardless of its impact on the right of states to protect the health of their citizens    Even identical state laws would be limited under this bill  Every state enforcement action would potentially be subject to a federal pre emption defense  on the ground that the state is imposing a materially different requirement than under Federal law  The cases could even be removed to federal court  and this is especially true when neither the FDA nor the state has issued a regulation setting a tolerance for a harmful substance in food     The bill would  however  allow a state to enforce when FDA has issued a regulation setting a tolerance level for a harmful substance or  if the FDA hasnt issued a regulation  when the state has a policy on the harmful substance  either through regulation or administrative decision     But the bill blocks the state from enforcing a policy rejected by the FDA  This prohibition is true even when the FDA rejected the policy 20 years ago and there is new science validating the policy     The bill also implies that a state may not enforce its laws when there is neither an FDA nor a State regulation or policy  In such cases  the state should be permitted to allege that a food contains a substance  that the substance is poisonous  and that it may be injurious to health  The bill implies that local food safety lawssuch as those in New York Citymay never be enforced  even when they are identical to federal laws     The uncertainty surrounding enforcement and the hugely increased cost to the states of each enforcement action would drastically reduce the number of those actions  and could deter the states from even bringing them at all  We cant expect an under funded FDAwhich conducts only about 20 percent of domestic inspections and is able to inspect at most 2 3 percent of imported foodto fill this gap     Congress shouldnt even be considering such a step  especially when weve all focused on strengthening the nations ability to respond to bioterrorism  Do we really want to prevent a state from doing more to protect its citizens from bioterrorism than the federal government does  Why disarm our state food safety officialswho will be our first responders if terrorists put anthrax in our food supply  The certification by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is hollow reassurance that this that this wont happenall it indicates that the authors of the bill know this is a real possibility    If we ever mark this bill up  the first amendment should be to rename it the Make Way for Terrorism with Foods Act     Cal Dooley  the President of the Food Products Association  could not cite a single case in which manufacturers had to put two different labels on a food  let alone 50 labels  Label uniformity is obviously not the issue here  Yet the food industry wants us to cripple state efforts to enforce the safety of our food     In fact  as we all know  the industry wants to be able to add ingredients to food that some states feel may cause serious health risks  or even cancer or birth defects  Which of the Proposition 65 ingredients  for example  does the food industry want to put in our food  I hope these hearings will help us get to the bottom of issues like this     I thank the Chairman and I look forward to todays testimony     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
