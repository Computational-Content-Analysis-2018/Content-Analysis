         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633    As you know  we have had a chance to go through many documents that you authored during the early and mid 1980s when you worked in the Department of Justice and in the White House     I am deeply troubled by a narrow  cramped    and perhaps even a mean spirited    view of the law that appears in some of your writings  In the only documents that have been made available to us  it appears that you did not fully appreciate the problem of discrimination in our society  It also seems that you were trying to undo the progress that so many people had worked  fought and died for in this country    At the outset  I want to be clear that I do not think    nor am I suggesting    that you are a person who is in favor of discrimination  I do not believe that     I am concerned  however  that  at the time you were writing these letters and memoranda and notes  you simply did not grasp the seriousness of the impact of discrimination on our country as a whole  Let s start with the Voting Rights Act  Most Americans think that the right to vote is the most important tool that they have to participate in our democracy    You do agree  don t you  Judge Roberts  that the right to vote is a fundamental constitutional right in our democracy     You will recall that  in the 1960s  millions of our fellow citizens were denied access to the voting booth because of race  To remedy that injustice  Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and outlawed discrimination in voting  Section 2 of that Act is widely believed to be the most effective civil rights statute enacted by Congress    In 1982  Congress took action to extend the Voting Rights Act and to make clear that discriminatory voting practices and procedures are illegal if they are intended to be racially discriminatory or if they are shown to have a racially discriminatory impact    It was this latter provision    the prohibition against voting practices that have a discriminatory impact    that provoked your heated opposition  Judge Roberts    In our earlier discussion of Brown v  Board of Education  you agreed that the actual impact of racial segregation on public education and school children was perfectly valid for the Court to consider  But when it came to voting rights  you rejected the consideration of actual impact    You wrote that violations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act    and I quote    should not be made too easy to prove since they provide a basis for the most intrusive interference imaginable by federal courts into state and local processes    You also wrote  quote  It would be difficult to conceive of a more drastic alteration of local government affairs  and under our federal system such an intrusion should not be too readily permitted    And you didn t stop there  You concluded that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was  quote  constitutionally suspect and contrary to the most fundamental  tenets  of the legislating process on which the laws of this country are based    Do you believe today  Judge Roberts  that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is constitutionally suspect    I am also deeply troubled by another statement that you made at that time  And I quote  There is no evidence of voting abuses nationwide supporting the need for such a change    No evidence  I was there Judge Roberts  Both the House and the Senate had extensive hearings  We considered detailed  specific testimony from affected voters throughout the country  But you dismissed the work of Congress out of hand  Don t be fooled  you wrote  by the House vote or the 61 Senate sponsors of the House bill      Many members of the House did not know that they were doing more than simply extending the Act and several of the 61 Senators have already indicated that they only intended to support a simple extension    Judge Roberts  Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly supported this legislation  but you thought that we didn t really know what we were doing  Newt Gingrich and James Sensenbrenner voted for the House bill  Dan Quayle was an original Senate co sponsor of the bill  We held extensive hearings  created a lengthy record  yet you thought that that there was no evidence of voting abuses that would justify the legislation     Do you believe today that we need federal laws to assure that all of our citizens have equal access to the voting booth  Or do you still believe that the Voting Rights Act is contrary to the most fundamental tenets of the legislating process on which the laws of this country are based     Ronald Reagan signed the Voting Rights Act of 1982    including section 2 with its discriminatory impact provision that caused you such distress    didn t he  Yet that still didn t seem to convince you  After passage of the Voting Rights amendments  you wrote    we were burned  Do you still feel that you were burned   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
