         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today  the House of Representatives passed the Reconciliation bill that slashes health care  education  and other programs  The United States Senate passed the bill by a minimal margin in December    Senator Kennedy said  Today the Republicans showed their true colors by turning their backs on the needs of the hardest working Americans and their families one day after President Bush s empty promises in his State of the Union address  The passage of this draconian bill solidifies the Bush Administration s misplaced priorities and proves that special interests dictate their policies   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
