         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  DC    Today  U S  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   and his Massachusetts Congressional Delegation colleagues wrote the Federal Aviation Administration chief Marion Blakey to urge her to halt a planned reduction in force at its New England region office in Burlington  Massachusetts     This seems like a penny wise  but pound foolish way to cut costs at the FAA  said Kennedy  Not only has air traffic safety been a heightened issue in our region lately  but our nation is also facing a dangerous shortage of air traffic controllers in the coming five or six years  Now is not the time to shuffle the deck and cut essential staff support  The FAA should be working to ensure that its air traffic operations are fully staffed  rather than thinning the ranks of those dedicated to a safe and smooth running air traffic system    The reduction in force  which was announced on December 6  would affect at least 79 members    and potentially many more    of Burlington s air traffic operations administrative and support personnel  Other regional offices targeted for reduction include the Eastern region in Jamaica  NY  the Great Lakes region in Des Plaines  IL  and the Western Pacific region in Hawthorne  CA    Dear Administrator Blakey    We are extremely concerned about the FAA s planned reduction in force at its regional office in Burlington  Massachusetts and its potentially adverse effect on air traffic operations in New England  We urge you to halt the planned reduction in force unless and until it can be shown that such a reduction will not have a harmful effect on air safety     Difficult fiscal times call for difficult choices  but we do not believe it wise to reduce air traffic operation capacity in one of the busiest air traffic regions in the nation  Logan International Airport in Boston is among the busiest airports in the nation  accommodating over 11 million passengers a year  Flights between Boston and London are among the nation s 20 most heavily traveled international routes  and Logan Airport is one of the nation s premier shipping points for international trade  Last year   12 9 billion in exports and imports passed through Logan  a 40 percent increase over the prior year     As you know  passenger safety is of a newly heightened concern at Logan after the recent series of runway incursions and radar problems  The FAA is working to improve passenger safety  and we support this effort  We hope you agree that it s unacceptable to seek a reduction in force that would compromise safety by reducing essential expertise in air traffic operations in the New England region     As air traffic increases  in New England and nationally  with the coming shortage of air traffic control personnel  it s surprising that the FAA would choose to reduce its staffing capacity for air traffic operations  Now more than ever  we should be working to see that air traffic operations are fully staffed and expertly managed  We would welcome the opportunity to work with you and the Administration to obtain proper funding in the federal budget to accomplish these goals  The FAA s planned reduction in force in its New England region office is contrary to these goals  and we urge you to halt it     With respect and appreciation  and our gratitude for considering our request   We look forward to your response                                         Sincerely    The Massachusetts Delegation    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
