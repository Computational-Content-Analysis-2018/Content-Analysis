         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today Senators Kennedy and Enzi added to their relief package for Katrina victims an education bill that provides one time  temporary impact aid to local school districts and private schools  They developed the bill with their colleagues Senators Alexander and Dodd  The bill provides immediate relief to the schools    both public and private   that have opened their doors to these students in a time of crisis  without opening political or ideological battles  The aid provided by the bill would flow through the public school system and maintain public accountability while assisting both public and private schools across the country that have generously taken in thousands of students     So many schools in the region and around the country have graciously opened their doors to children without the assistance they deserve  We need a response to Katrina that is as generous as the American people are  This bill puts aside politics and ideological battles to get the necessary aid to these schools and to these children without further delay  Senator Kennedy said  My wife is from Southern Louisiana so we feel a special appreciation for the way that so many schools are ministering to those who lost so much     Under the bill  each eligible district will receive quarterly installment payments for each student enrolled in a given quarter in either a public or a private school in that district  Maximum total payment is  6 000 per student and  7 500 per student with disabilities  not to exceed cost of tuition at private schools  A summary of the bill is below     In the past several weeks to help develop his education legislation  Senator Kennedy has visited New Orleans  spent time with evacuees at Camp Edwards in Massachusetts and met with recovery experts and officials from the area to determine the best course of action to help get schools back on their feet and accommodate displaced students  He recently met with the U S  Conference of Catholic Bishops and discussed provisions in the proposal for aid to private schools  In these meetings  Kennedy learned that 700 schools and 30 colleges and universities have been damaged and destroyed and an estimated 473 000 elementary  high school and college students have been affected by the disaster  most of whom have been displaced  At a HELP Committee hearing he convened with Senator Enzi  Kennedy heard moving testimony from Superintendent Diane Roussel of Jefferson Parish who said  Money isn t always the answer to solving the ills in our public schools  but when we re talking about equipment  supplies  rebuilding  and maintaining our teaching workforce  money is the answer     Hurricane Katrina Elementary and Secondary Education
