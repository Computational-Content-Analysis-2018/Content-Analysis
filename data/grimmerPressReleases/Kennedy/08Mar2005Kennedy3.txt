         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  In a vote in just a few hours  the Senate will declare its true intentions in what this bankruptcy bill is all about  Are we really trying to curb those that abuse our bankruptcy laws to ensure fairness in our society  Or  do we stand with the radical elements of our society who want to roll back protections for a woman s right to choose at any cost  even if it means protecting those guilty of violence   I whole heartedly support Senator Schumer s effort to ensure that people who commit violence or threats of violence can t use bankruptcy as a shield  This isn t about being pro life or pro choice  It s about being pro law and anti violence  Anyone who values a culture of life in our society should support this amendment  Committing acts of violence against anyone in our society is wrong  and should not be given special protections in any of the laws of this land   We need to close that loophole in the bankruptcy law for those who are found guilty of violence and intimidation  If this bill really dealt with stopping the abuse of our bankruptcy laws  then the Senate would pass this amendment and send a strong message that those who break the law through violence and intimidation shouldn t have bankruptcy as a shield   There s no legitimate reason to oppose this amendment  Some have said it will chill free speech  That s nonsense  The only thing this will chill is violence  intimidation and bankruptcy abuse  The amendment itself says peaceful protest and speech are protected   Former Operation rescue president Randall Terry owed more than  1 6 million in fines and fees for acts of clinic violence  but filed bankruptcy to avoid paying his victims  Defendants in the notorious Nuremberg Files case create a website hit list targeting doctors  nurses  and judges who had supported reproductive freedom  The site listed those who had been wounded in grey type  and the names of murder victims were crossed out    including Barnett Slepian  who was slain in front of his family in 1998  Authors of the Nuremberg Files were found guilty and ordered to compensate the victims  But they filed for bankruptcy  bragging that they would never have to pay their victims   Although many of those who abuse bankruptcy in this way have committed violence against abortion clinics and those who work there  the Schumer amendment addresses violence and intimidation against any lawful business  It also addresses violence and intimidation against judges who uphold laws that protect businesses from violence   Before voting on the Schumer amendment  every Senator needs to ask themselves  What kind of country are we if we allow repeated abuses of bankruptcy by people who break the law  and then intentionally declare bankruptcy to avoid paying the judgment ordered by the court   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
