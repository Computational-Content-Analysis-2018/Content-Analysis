         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Weaver s Cove Energy has proposed to revise its Fall River liquefied natural gas terminal project by using smaller size LNG vessels  The passage of federal legislation preserving the Brightman Street Bridge effectively prevented large size LNG vessels from passing the bridge to reach Fall River  Under the new proposal  which was submitted earlier this month to the Army Corps of Engineers  the smaller size LNG vessels would be 725 long  with an 82 foot beam  and have a 55 000 cubic meter capacity  Under the proposal  one such vessel would arrive every three days  or 120 deliveries per year  Prior to this proposal  the project proposal had been configured to berth ships of a total length of about 950 feet and a beam of 145 feet  Moreover  the large vessels were expected to have a 145 000 cubic meter LNG capacity     Senator Edward M  Kennedy said  This new proposal does nothing to address the serious public safety concerns posed by the Weaver Cove location  and we ll remain united in opposition to this project    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
