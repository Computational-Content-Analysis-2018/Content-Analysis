         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      As Prepared for Delivery   The most basic duty of any government is to protect the safety of the people it serves  A recent report to the FDA Science Advisory Board raises troubling questions about this Administrations ability to meet this basic responsibility  with regard to food safety and many other area where American families count on FDA to protect their health  And instead of improving matters  the White House is poised to make them worse by threatening to veto the very bill that funds FDA     The reports conclusions could not be more stark or more shocking     FDA does not have the capacity to ensure the safety of food for the nation   FDA s ability to provide its basic food system inspection  enforcement and rulemaking functions is severely eroded  as is its ability to respond to outbreaks in a timely manner and to develop and keep pace with the new regulatory science needed to prevent future problems     Every time American families go to the grocery store  they worry about the safety of the food they buy  Every time parents buy toys for their children  they worry if the paint is contaminated or the materials are defective     They ought to be able to count on FDA and other health agencies to stand guard for them  to use the latest and best science to protect them  and to stop at nothing to detect dangerous products     But the advisory committee report reveals that FDAs promise to protect American families is too often an empty one  because of the starvation budgets and absent leadership that FDA has endured in recent years  The plain truth is that FDA doesnt have the money it needs to do the job it has to do     If the problems revealed by the report were confined to food safety  they would be disturbing enough  but the study shows that the effectiveness of the entire agency has been eviscerated by neglect      The major findings of the report read like an indictment     Finding  1  The FDA cannot fulfill its mission because its scientific base has eroded and its scientific organizational structure is weak     Finding  2  The FDA cannot fulfill its mission because its scientific workforce does not have sufficient capacity and capability      Finding  3  The FDA cannot fulfill its mission because its information technology infrastructure is inadequate     I am pleased that we are joined by Secretary Leavitt today  and I welcome him to our committee  I hope he will take this opportunity to explain to the American people how FDA has been allowed to reach this sorry state      I also look forward to a thorough examination of how to improve food safety     Even a brief review of recent food safety concerns must ring alarm bells in every community  Salmonella was found in domestic peanut butter  Botulism was found in chili  An adulterant from China in pet foods led to illness and deaths in cats and dogs      An E  coli outbreak in spinach from California last summer killed 3 and sickened more than 200 others  I dont have to look far to see the threat from E  coli  On Cape  Cod last month  we were told to boil our drinking water because it was contaminated with these dangerous bacteria      The Administrations food safety plan offers recommendations on improving food safety  and I look forward to hearing Secretary Leavitts discussion of this proposal  However  many experts believe we ought to do far more  and I look forward to the views of our distinguished panel on this matter      Both the European Union and the Japanese have more robust food safety programs than we do  and we can learn from them  Most significantly  they have much stronger programs to police imported food  combining inspections in the country of origin and testing of imported foods  We should be able to do at least as well      We need to give FDA the tools it needs to identify food safety problems more quickly and respond more effectively  Most importantly  we need to focus on preventing outbreaks in food  Each part of the food industry must have an effective plan in place to prevent hazards in the food it makes and markets      Preventive controls arent new  and they work  FDA has had regulations in effect since 1973 to require safety processing for many canned foods  Because of these regulations  there are now virtually no problems with botulism in these foods      FDA issued regulations in 2001 to require safety processing for juices  after E  coli in apple juice killed or injured children  Most manufacturers now pasteurize their juice  which eliminates this contamination      Despite the effectiveness of these regulations  the Administrations plan proposes to expand this authority only with major limits  Under the proposal  FDA will be able to impose preventive controls only for foods that have repeatedly been associated with serious adverse health consequences or death      Essentially  this provision is a requirement that people be injured or even killed before the FDA can act  Such a requirement undermines the basic goal of preventing illness  Every manufacturer should be required to implement effective  preventive controls  And we must give FDA the authority to enforce the requirement before people are injured  not make them wait until them damage is done      The HELP Committee worked together this year to reauthorize user fee programs that provide significant resources for FDA  We need to be similarly creative to meet the agencys other pressing needs      Its a privilege to work closely with Senator Enzi on this hearing  and I look forward to working with him and our committee colleagues to develop a response to food safety      I also look forward to working with our colleagues on the Agriculture committee  and I see that the Chairman of that committee  who is also a colleague on this committee  Senator Harkin  is here with us this morning  If Senator Enzi would be agreeable  I hope we might have the opportunity to hear from Senator Harkin at the conclusion of Senator Enzis remarks               Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
