         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY ON SENATE FLOOR  For many of us on this side of the aisle  there is a feeling of excitement and possibility for the next Congress  But sadly that Congress will no longer have the wise counsel  extraordinary talent  and perceptive insights of our friend and colleague of many years  the outstanding Senior Senator from Maryland  Paul Sarbanes  Over the course of his 30 years in the Senate  Paul has been a consistently eloquent voice of reason  compassion  and great intellectual depth  He has brought nothing but dignity to this historic chamber  and he eminently deserves his place of honor as the longest serving Senator in the history of the State of Maryland  As a member of the Banking Committee  hes been a respected leader in expanding and enhancing the economic vitality of America  especially urban America  through his strong support for housing  transportation  and financial policies that make sense for the nation and its people  In recent years  he guided into law one of the most significant reforms of corporate governance in more than half a century  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee  hes been a highly respected voice on many of the most serious challenges we face on foreign policy  He was an opponent of the war in Iraq from the beginning  and he was a leader in the Iran Contra investigation in the 1980s  He believes deeply in the importance of public service  Drawing on his wide learning  he often speaks about the great importance that the ancient Greeks placed on public service  I understand he tells young students that in ancient Athens  people who involved themselves only in private life were called idiotes  which is the original source of the word idiot in English  Paul has always been a strong defender of the highest ideals of the United States at home and for a peaceful world that respects human rights  Because of his leadership and the policies hes long championed  Americas cities are reclaiming their historical role as the heart of American commerce and culture  and todays shareholders have new confidence in the integrity of the stocks and bonds they invest in and depend so heavily on  Its a record of accomplishment that has improved the lives of millions of our people and has helped to restore faith in American business  at a time when public confidence in corporate America was badly shaken and storm clouds were gathering over the American economy  Its also the record of a patient  deliberative and active Senate workhorse  who has dedicated his career to the mastery of complicated  nuanced  and often seemingly insoluble problems at home and in the wider world  Its the record as well of a public servant who responded to the nations call to deal with some of the most difficult challenges of corruption and incompetence in our lifetime  From the impeachment proceedings against President Nixon  to the Iran Contra investigation and the Whitewater hearings  to the way he shone a bright light on the outrageous and predatory lending practices that exploit lower income Americans and keep so many hard working citizens mired in poverty  Paul Sarbanes was a Senator who could always be relied on to take the assignment seriously  prepare brilliantly  and make decisions on the facts  on the rule of law  and his firm belief in the need for justice and fairness in public life  Needless to say  he was a match for even the best of witnesses  I doubt that any other Senator could go head to head with a witness in a hearing as skillfully as Paul Sarbanes could do with Alan Greenspan  Pauls also been a profile in courage  He voted for what he thought was right  without regard to the political consequences  And as his long and strong support by the people of Maryland made clear  they respected him all the more because of it  Few Senators weve been blessed to serve with can match Paul Sarbanes when it comes to decency  intelligence  or mastery of policy  Its a privilege to listen to him and learn from him in Senate debate  He can champion a proposal he favors with great skill and eloquence  and he can also utterly dissect a flawed proposal point by point  It can be a very distressing experience to oppose him on an issue and have him do the same thing to your side of the argument  Im fortunate to have supported Paul many more times than I opposed him  But regardless of which side you were on  his motivation in debate was always clear  to achieve the best outcome for the public good  and to do so by opening his opponents eyes and minds  not by harshly attacking their positions  Elizabeth Drew well captured this quality of Paul in her assessment of life in Washington during Watergate  She wrote of the young Baltimore Congressman who  with just three years in Congress  found himself in the thick of the House impeachment proceedings against President Nixon  He won the attention and respect of the nation when his colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee chose him to be the manager of the first article of impeachment  for obstruction of justice  As Liz Drew wrote  History and process lift people  and they have lifted this group  and given the public a chance to see it  Paul Sarbanes would not have looked at all bad at the Constitutional Convention  he might have been one of the great ones  I certainly agree  As we say farewell to this outstanding Senator of our time  we will forever be grateful to this Greek immigrant son of Maryland for all he has done to make our country and our world a better place  and for consistently elevating the quality of life in the Senate we all love so deeply  Fifty years ago  Paul was a young student at Oxford University in England on a Rhodes Scholarship  founded over a century ago by the wealthy British statesman whose goal was to encourage students in the English speaking world and other countries to be involved in public service and join the worlds fight  Paul Sarbanes has helped to lead that fight for half a century  and Im sure that Cecil Rhodes would be very proud of him  Well miss you Paul  We wish you and Christine great happiness in the years to come  Youre irreplaceable  but we take some comfort in the knowledge that a new young Sarbanes  blessed with the same intellect and commitment to public service  will be joining us in January as a member of the House of Representatives
