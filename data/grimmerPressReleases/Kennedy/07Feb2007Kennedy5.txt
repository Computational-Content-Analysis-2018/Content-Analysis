         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  Republicans in the Senate continue to say no to an honest debate about the war in Iraq  Our troops deserve better  They have done everything we have asked them to do  and they have served with dignity  honor  and valor  More than 3 000 Americans have been killed so far  and more than 23 000 have been wounded  64 sons of Massachusetts have made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq The American people also deserve a real debate on Iraq  We have already spent hundreds of billions of dollars of their money on this war  and today the President is asking for hundreds of billions more  But President Bush does not have the consent of the American people  He is insisting on his policy of escalation when most Americans are convinced that de escalation is the only realistic strategy  Our grave concern with the Presidents proposals have led the Senate Democrats to seek an honest debate on the war in Iraq  That debate must include a vote that puts each Senator on the record as to whether he or she opposes sending tens of thousands more American troops into this civil war  Despite the clear result of the November election  our Republican colleagues are still not willing to take a stand against the Presidents plan to escalate the war in Iraq  They are not even willing to debate the issue  even though it is the most important national security issue of our time  The Senate Republicans are concerned with protecting the President from a rebuke when we all should be concerned with protecting the tens of thousands of American soldiers who are now scheduled to be dropped into the cauldron of civil war The American people rejected a do nothing Congress  but the Republicans seem not to have gotten the message  Instead  the Republican minority has decided that it will obstruct  delay and filibuster  That did not work on the minimum wage  and it will not work on the war in Iraq  The American people voted for change and accountability  and they will get it  I introduced legislation in January that would have required that the President obtain Congressional authorization for any escalation in Iraq  I would have preferred to immediately consider that binding legislation  but I was willing to work towards a bipartisan expression of opposition to the Presidents misguided decision to escalate the war  I supported the resolution proposed by Senator Warner to stop this escalation in its tracks  Sadly  even when the Democrats are willing to adopt a Republican resolution  the Warner resolution  the Republicans refuse to allow a simple up or down vote The cost in precious American lives is reason enough to end this mistaken and misguided war  But the cost here at home came into full view on Monday as we received the Presidents budget  The Presidents budget devotes more than  200 billion to the war in Iraq  Where does that  200 billion come from It comes from childrens health  as the Presidents budget under funds the CHIP program by  8 billion  That program has been extremely successful in providing health care to low income children  Yet there are still more than 8 million children in America with no health coverage  Theres a health care crisis with our nations children  But what does the President propose to do about it  His budget will make the crisis even worse by cutting 400 000 children from the Childrens Health Insurance Program  It comes from our seniors and our disabled citizens  The Presidents budget cuts  66 billion from Medicare  which is a lifeline to millions of retirees and disabled Americans  If the President has his way  more than 700 000 people in Massachusetts who rely on Medicare could see their quality of care go down  It comes from those battling mental illnesses  Each year 25 percent of Americans suffer from some sort of mental illness  We owe it to them and their families to do all we can to ensure that they are able to lead full and productive lives  Yet the Presidents budget cuts mental health assistance by  159 million dollars  It comes from Hurricane Katrina victims  Despite massive ongoing needs on the Gulf Coast  the Presidents budget offers no additional assistance to help people rebuild their lives It comes from nations defense against the epidemics such as the flu as the President proposes to slash funding for Center for Disease Control by  165 million  It comes from Medicaid  our health care lifeline for the poor  which the President intends to cut by  50 billion over the next 10 years  In Massachusetts  880 000 citizens depend on Medicaid and this budget places them at risk  It comes from our childrens education  The Presidents budget underfunds the No Child Left Behind reforms by almost  15 billion  In my state of Massachusetts  these cuts would leave more than 51 000 children behind It comes from our youngest children  By cutting  107 million dollars from the Headstart Program  the President fails to give our youngest children a strong start in life  It comes from our students with special needs  When we passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act we made a promise to disabled children and their families that they would receive the education they deserved  President Bushs budget breaks that promise by cutting funding to IDEA by  290 million It comes from school safety  Our children ought to be able to go to school without fearing violence  But this budget cuts funding for Safe and Drug Free Schools It comes at the expense of our teachers  Over the next decade  this nation will need to hire two million new teachers  But this budget cuts funding for teacher quality grants  It comes at the expense of our students  At a time when college costs are skyrocketing  the Presidents budget completely eliminates the Perkins Loan Program  which over 500 000 students depend on to help them afford a college education  We know that a college degree is the ticket to a bright and better future  but budget closes the college door instead of opening it wider  It comes from our workers who are looking for good jobs to support their families  because the Presidents budget slashes  1 billion from programs that train Americans for jobs  In Massachusetts alone there are nearly 25 000 people waiting to be enrolled in job training programs  In Boston  there are 25 applicants for each job training slot  These men and women are doing all they can to help them support their families  This budget can find  200 billion more for the war in Iraq  but not a dime for people here at home trying to better their lives  It comes from families who need help putting food on the table  The President wants to cut the Food Stamp program by over  600 million  leaving nearly 300 000 families wondering where to find the next meal for themselves and their children  It comes from the poor who are struggling against the bitter cold  as it cuts 17 percent of the funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps low income families afford to heat their homes Perhaps most tragically of all  money for the war in Iraq comes from our veterans themselves  Nearly half of troops who return from Iraq will require health care services to cope with the physical and mental toll of war  Yet  the Presidents budget under funds veterans health  It provides only half the increase in funding required for the VA to keep pace with the needs of our veterans  In Massachusetts alone there are 453 000 veterans who have served our country when they were called to duty  and we have a moral obligation to do all that we can for them  This is the cost of this war  This is all for a war that never should have happened  It is a war that should be brought to an end  Yet this Administration is allowing it to go on and on and on  with mistake after mistake after mistake  This terrible war is having an effect not only on our troops  who are paying the highest price  but on our children  our elderly  our schools  our workers and the poor here at home While the President forges ahead with a surge in Iraq  the American people need a surge here at home  Americans see the cost of health care and the cost of college going up  What about a surge in our health and education policies to meet their needs Americans here at home worry about their economic security  about their jobs and stagnant wages and how they can support their families  How about a surge here at home to meet their needs Last week  we met with our nations mayors  They described the problem of school dropouts and how they are turning to crime in our communities  Where is the surge to address that problem No wonder the American people are growing angrier and angrier as the war rages on  They expect Congress to be an effective restraint on the President and his abuse of the war power  Opposition to the escalation is clear already  How much clearer does it have to be  before Republicans in Congress and the President finally respond to the voices of the American people  When will this war be brought to an end Mr  President  an escalation now would be an immense new mistake  compounding the original misguided decision to invade Iraq  Public support for the war does not exist  There is no support for this escalation We have surged our forces four times in the past  and each time the situation hasnt changed  The President cannot continue to unilaterally impose his failing policy on an America that has already rejected it  Congress has a responsibility to stop the President from sending more of our sons and daughters to die in this civil war  The legislation on which Democrats seek a vote is our first effort to meet that responsibility  It is our chance to go on record in opposition to the surge  Its a clarion call for change  Last week  the new National Intelligence Estimate confirmed the nightmare scenario unfolding for our troops in Iraq  The country is sliding deeper into the abyss of civil war and our brave men and women are caught in the middle of it  Prospects for halting the escalating sectarian violence are bleak  Greater chaos and anarchy are looming and needless additional U S  casualties are inevitable Its abundantly clear that what we need is not a troop surge  but a diplomatic surge  working with other countries in the region  Sending more U S  troops into Iraqs civil war is not the solution to Iraqs political problems  Not only does President Bush fail to see that reality  but also hes going out of his way to deny and defy it  Congress needs to express its opposition to this strategy  If the President refuses to change course  we must act to change it ourselves  protect our troops  and end this misguided war The war today is not the war that Congress authorized four years ago  Now  its a civil war  The war today is not about Saddams weapons of mass destruction or his alleged relationship with Al Qaeda  Its Iraqi against Iraqi  Iraq is at war with itself  and American soldiers are caught in the middle This debate is about what is best for our troops and our national security  Our forces have served with great valor  Theyve done everything theyve been asked to do  Sending more of them into a civil war will not make success any more likely  We have a responsibility to vote on this issue now  before it is too late  The American people deserve to know where Senate Republicans stand  It is bad enough that the Senate Republicans failed for five long years to hold this President accountable  They should not deprive the majority of this Senate  and the overwhelming majority of Americans  the chance to put the President on notice and call on him not to send more of our forces into the middle of this civil war in Iraq It is time for the Republicans to stand up to the President and stand up for our soldiers by clearly opposing the escalation of this war     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
