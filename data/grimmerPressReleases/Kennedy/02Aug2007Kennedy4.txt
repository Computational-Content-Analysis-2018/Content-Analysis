         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Todays assertion of executive privilege by Karl Rove and Scott Jennings continues the White Houses shameful stonewalling of any investigation by Congress of the Administrations corruption of the rule of law  The Committee has interviewed and taken testimony from dozens of witnesses and reviewed thousands of documents in an effort to learn more about the improper actions in firing U S  Attorneys What we have learned is disturbing  Plainly  partisan motivations heavily influenced these decisions  and equally plainly  the White House was involved  Testimony and documents demonstrate that the White House Counsels office and the White House Political Office were in frequent communication with officials of the Department of Justice over the firings  both before and after they took place  The Committees investigation has already revealed a stunning politicization of the Department of Justice  The former head of the Civil Rights Division acknowledged boasting of hiring Republicans as career lawyers  He even moved minority women out of the Appellate Section to make way for what he called good Americans  Monica Goodling admitted she crossed the line by using partisan considerations in selecting immigration judges and career Assistant U S  Attorneys  Career attorneys complained that the candidates they had picked for job interviews were subjected to internet searches to weed out any who had Democratic or liberal credentials  The result of this despicable partisanship is obvious on the Departments abysmal record on civil rights and its disregard for the rule of law to justify warrantless wiretapping  its abuse of habeas corpus  and even its acceptance of torture When Alberto Gonzales was nominated to become Attorney General  many of us in Congress doubted he would let go of his role as White House Counsel  He promised he understood the difference and would serve all of the people as Attorney General  That should have meant he agreed his primary allegiance would be to the rule of law  Instead partisan considerations have routinely tainted the Department of Justice  The investigation of the U S  Attorney firings led directly to the White House and to Karl Rove and Scott Jennings  Other agencies have been tainted too  After serving for a year in this White House John Dilulio said this  There is no precedent in any modern White House for what is going on in this one  a complete lack of a policy apparatus  What youve got is everything  and I mean everything  being run by the political arm  Its the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis  In agency after agency  this description has come true  Attorney General Gonzales opened the door for Mr  Rove and Mr  Jennings to bring partisan politics to the administration of justice  They must not be allowed to hide their corruption of justice behind claims of executive privilege A common theme throughout these hearings has been the corruption of professional standards through partisan behavior  It is clear that the Administration has been willing to pursue partisan interests at the expense of professionalism to an unprecedented degree  To prevent against this type of behavior  Congress long ago enacted the Hatch Act  which prohibited federal employees from using their official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election  According to press reports  the Office of Special Counsel found a sufficient amount of evidence to investigate possible White House violations of the Hatch Act  Part of this investigation involves a presentation you gave at GSA headquarters with the permission of the head of the GSA when she asked the attendees how they could  help our candidates  On May 16  Doan was notified she had violated the Hatch Act  Six GSA employees have provided information about your GSA presentation  How many such political briefings have you conducted for Executive Agencies and federal employees during your service in the White House  Do you create the substance of these briefings yourself  If not  who else is involved in these projects  Were you aware of the Hatch Act prohibitions against political activity  Did you ever question whether this type of briefing violated the Acts prohibitions  As the Deputy Director of the Office of Political Affairs  did you ever seek clearance for these briefings  If so  from whom  Please briefly describe the elements of the briefing  Did you discuss specific candidates  Did you discuss specific congressional districts  Did you advise attendees on how to elect Republican candidates and advance Republican issues  In hindsight  do you think that the question by the head of the GSA about how federal employees could help candidates was appropriate  Did you answer the question  If so  what did you say  Have you had similar exchanges at other briefings in federal buildings  What was your understanding of the purpose of these briefings  As a former state campaign manager for President Bush and a number of Republican candidates  did you feel that your briefings would help elect Republican candidates  If not  what did you hope the briefings would achieve  What other purpose beyond overt political activity could these briefings possibly serve
