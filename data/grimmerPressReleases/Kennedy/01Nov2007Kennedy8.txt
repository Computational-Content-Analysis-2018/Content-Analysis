         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       Its a privilege to join my colleagues to support childrens health  I commend too the former Assistant Surgeon General  Dr  Woodie Kessel for his courage in speaking out for children  He has worked tirelessly for childrens health in Republican and Democratic Administrations alike  and he recognizes that a strong  bipartisan CHIP bill is the most important step we can take to improve the health of Americas children      Were here today to say theres no higher priority in America than our children  When we shortchange our children  we shortchange our future      Its almost unimaginable that an American President could tell American parents that we cant afford health care for American children      What the President is saying to parents is that its more important to help children in Iraq than children in America      This is a clear case of misplaced priorities  mistaken values and misguided morality  A veto of this bill is wrong and Americans will not tolerate it      In just 41 days of war  we spend what is needed to cover the ten million children who would benefit from the bill before us today      The Administration boasts of renovating clinics  training doctors  vaccinating children and improving access to care all over Iraq        Those are commendable accomplishments  but we should show the same commitment to the health of our own children       For the Bush Administration  improving health care for children in Iraq is an achievement  In America  its a veto      A bipartisan majority in Congress has made a judgment to stand up to the empty rhetoric and hollow slogans of the White House  and give all children in America get the healthy start in life they deserve  The United States Senate voted yesterday to go forward with action on our compromise bill       Support for our proposal is so broad because CHIP isnt a Republican idea or a Democratic idea  Its not a state program or a federal initiative  Its not public sector or private sector  Its all of those things  and more  CHIP is an American success story  And the children of America deserve to have that success continue      Well keep fighting for CHIP until the children of America get the health care that they deserve and that the American people are demanding            Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
