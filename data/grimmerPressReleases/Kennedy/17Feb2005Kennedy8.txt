         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washington  D C  Today Senator Kennedy fought to change the bankruptcy bill to ensure that it protects the rights of American families  He offered several amendments to address the bills great weakness  it puts the profits of credit card companies and banks ahead of the needs of hard working  hard pressed Americans  Kennedy emphasized that we have recently witnessed the worst corporate misconduct since before the Great Depression  yet this legislation  written by the financial services industry    currently does nothing to prevent corporate abuse     Kennedys amendments focus on protecting the 2 million Americans who face bankruptcy because of illness and the high costs of healthcare  as well as shielding low income families from the costly burden of legally proving that they are not abusing the bankruptcy code  The Judiciary Committee previously heard testimony from Dr  Elizabeth Warren whose Harvard University study demonstrated that almost half of all Americans who file for bankruptcy every year are the victims of our broken healthcare system  not irresponsible spendthrifts living high on the hog     If were going to pass a bankruptcy bill  lets pass a real one  a bill that protects working families who are forced into bankruptcy because of a serious illness  and military families who face dire hardships  These families have more than met the test of taking personal responsibility and doing the right thing  Now we have a moral obligation to provide solutions that are fair and compassionate  while cracking down on corporate executives who loot their companies at the expense of workers  retirees  creditors and stockholders  said Senator Kennedy     In his opening statement  Kennedy cited the stories of some medically bankrupt victims he has met with including Zoraya Marerro  a single mother who suffers from epilepsy while one of her three children has spina bifida  Ms  Marerro no longer qualifies for benefits and cant afford private insurance for her and her son  she is doing everything she can to avoid bankruptcy yet faces a debt of over  60 000     The first set of amendments that Kennedy offered would exempt those families facing bankruptcy due to serious medical hardship from also facing the burdensome means test  make sure that reasonable health insurance expenses qualify as permissible expenses in that means test calculation  provide a minimum homestead exemption of  150 00 for medically distressed bankruptcy filers  and ensure that families below median income are not subjected to means tests requirements     Kennedy will also fight to stop the travesty of high level corporate insiders who walk away with millions while the companys workers and retirees are left empty handed  As it stands now this 500 page bill does nothing to strengthen the woefully inadequate laws to prevent corporate abuse  Kennedys amendments will strengthens the ability of bankruptcy courts to invalidate fraudulent transfers by corporate insiders and will better allow the court to stop inappropriate payments to corporate insiders after the company is in financial distress  Every dollar recovered from these outrageous insider deals is another dollar that will be there to compensate workers  retirees  and other creditors     Medical Bankruptcy  Fact Sheet     1 458 million individuals or couples filed for bankruptcy in 2001  These bankruptcies involved 1 925 million debtors and 1 939 million dependents  a total of 3 864 million people      Bankruptcy is up 33   since Bush took office     Between 46 2  and 54 5  of all bankruptcies  midpoint estimate 50 35   were caused  at least in part  by illness or medical debts  Thus  medical bankruptcy involved between 1 850 098 and 2 227 000 Americans in 2001  midpoint estimate   2 038 549            The number of medical bankruptcies increased approximately 2200  between 1981 and 2001           Most medical debtors had some health insurance  but many suffered gaps in coverage          v 75 7  had health insurance at the onset of the bankrupting illness         v 68  had coverage at the time of their bankruptcy filing        v 62  had continuous coverage        v 1 3 of those with private coverage at onset lost it during the course of illness        v Only 2 9  of the uninsured went without coverage voluntarily  most others couldnt afford it   High medical bills contributed to 60  of medical bankruptcies  with drug costs contributing to 48    Drug costs were the major problem for most Medicare insured debtors  and many of those with psychiatric disorders   In 35  of cases lost income due to illness was a factor           Out of pocket medical costs since the onset of illness averaged  11 854  v The privately insured had the highest costs    13 460  due to the very high costs incurred by those who initially had private coverage but then lost it         v Cancer patients costs averaged  35 878           Families in medical bankruptcy suffered many privations  In the 2 years before filing for bankruptcy          v 22  went without food        v 30  had a utility shut off        v 61  went without needed medical care        v 50  failed to fill a doctors prescription        Examples of Corporate Abuse    The greatest need for change in the bankruptcy laws by far is in the area of corporate bankruptcy  That is where we have witnessed an epidemic of abuse in recent years  the worst corporate misconduct since before the Great Depression  Some of these companies were brought down by outright criminality  Yet we are considering a five hundred page bankruptcy bill that virtually ignores these issues  It does nothing to address the corporate looting by high level insiders  It does nothing to protect the companys workforce from losing their jobs  their health care  and their pensions  This bill should not leave the Committee until those glaring omissions are rectified     1  Enron executives cashed out on more than  1 billion of company stock  knowing the company was in trouble  And shortly before the company declared bankruptcy  it paid its top executives bonuses as high as  5 million each to stay on  By contrast  Enron workers lost  1 billion in retirement savings  And thousands of them lost their jobs  as well   2  With WorldComs stock price steadily climbing through the 1990s  CEO Bernie Ebbers made out handsomely  buying hundreds of thousands of acres of land in Canada and in the South and a yacht building business in Georgia  The discovery that he owed the company  366million in specially negotiated personal loans helped ease him out the door only a few months before the company declared bankruptcy  but he still was granted a pension worth  1 5 million a year for life   Shortly afterward  WorldCom filed for bankruptcy and tens of thousands of employees lost their jobs  WorldCom employees  who had over half of their 401 k  savings in WorldCom stock  lost almost all of their retirement   3  At Tyco  tens of thousands of employees were laid off in 2002 when the company declared bankruptcy  Former CEO Dennis Kozlowski  by contrast  received millions of dollars in compensation and his original severance deal promised him  122million in cash  800 000 shares of stock  and a consulting contract  And the Chief Financial Officer was initially granted a  45 million severance package  even after he had been indicted for grand larceny     4  As Kmart was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy  the company bought two new corporate jets  Once it finally tumbled into bankruptcy  CEO Chuck Conaway got a  9 million golden parachute  Meanwhile  Kmarts bankruptcy cost workers over 57 000 jobs and Kmart had to close 600 stores nationwide     5  A major corporation Kennedys home state of Massachusetts  Polaroid  filed for bankruptcy in 2001  In the months leading up to the companys filing  the corporation made  1 7million in incentive payments to its chief executive Gary DiCamillo on top of his  840 000 base salary  The company also received bankruptcy court approval to make  1 5 million in payments to senior managers  to keep them on boardthese managers collectively received an additional  3 million when the companys assets were sold off   By contrast  just days before Polaroid filed for bankruptcy  it canceled health and life insurance for more than 6 000 retirees  and canceled health insurance coverage for workers on long term disability  It also stopped severance benefits for thousands of workers who were recently laid off   Polaroid workers had been required to put 8  of their pay into the companys Employee Stock Ownership Plan  ESOP   When the company declined  their retirement savings were virtually wiped out           STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD KENNEDY  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEETING ON BANKRUPTCY  FEBRUARY 17  2005   as prepared for delivery    I hold in my hand the bill we are considering  It is 501 pages long  We need to take a fresh look at this bill  It was first written many years ago  by the financial services industry  The Senate hasnt taken a serious look at it in four years  A lot has happened since then   For example  more than two hundred thousand reservists and national guard troops have been called to active duty  far away from their homes and businesses  Their families are facing economic hardship  and their creditors keep calling  Many of them operated small businesses  and without them  those businesses are now in trouble  This bill does nothing to protect those who are fighting for us   When one reservist left home  his wife had to run his construction company  but without him there  the company could not compete and lost bids until family income was cut 80   The family lost its savings  lost its credit  and is in financial shambles  It will probably run into the path of this bill if it is passed  but instead of helping to alleviate their suffering  this bill  in its present form  will treat them like tax evaders or defrauders   Since 2001  weve also seen the worst corporate scandals in decades  Corporate fraud and mismanagement have forced many companies into bankruptcy  Enron  Worldcom  Adelphia  Polaroid to name but a few  As a result of those bankruptcy proceedings  thousands of their workers have lost not only their jobs  but their health care and pensions  We have a real bankruptcy problem  yet the legislation fails to address these major problems   This legislation  as presented to us  is terribly unfair  It tightens the screws mercilessly on hard working families who are down on their luck  while failing to crack down on corporate executives who betray their workers and their stockholders  Under this bill  wealthy individuals can and will continue to hide millions of dollars in assets from their creditors   If were going to pass a bankruptcy bill  lets pass a real one  A bill that protects working families who are forced into bankruptcy by a health care crisis  and military families who face dire hardships  A bill that protects working families from the abusive practices of credit card companies  A bill that cracks down on corporate executives who loot their companies at the expense of workers  retirees  creditors  and stockholders   Families who worked hard and played by the rules are being forced into bankruptcy in increasing numbers  This legislation in its current form will seriously hurt those families   Even if you supported this bill in the past  I ask you not to jump to the conclusion that  in its current form  it is the right bill for us to be passing in 2005   First  we must consider the economic environment  We are still recovering from the 2001 recession  Nearly 8 million Americans are still unemployed  and one in five of those workers have been out of work for more than six months  And the unemployment insurance safety net that workers once relied on hasnt been modernized to meet todays demands  Jobs in health care  financial services  and information technology are being shipped overseas   Today  workers who lose their jobs have a tough time finding new jobs with comparable wages  benefits  hours  and overall quality  Part time jobs do not provide financial stability  but companies are relying more and more on part time workers  Part time workers earn  3 97 less per hour than regular full time workers  Few part time workers have health insurance or pension plans   Working families are being squeezed in every direction by the current economy  Their ability to live the American dream is increasingly out of reach with each passing year  They find it harder and harder to earn a living    to pay the mortgage    pay the rent    pay their medical bill    pay their food bill    pay their gasoline bill    and still send their sons and daughters to college  The cost of just getting by keeps rising so much faster than family income   Health care costs are out of reach  Health insurance premium costs have soared 59 percent  Drug costs have soared 52 percent   Housing costs are up 44 percent in the last four years  Child care often costs up to  10 000 per year for one child  more than the cost of public college tuition  College costs are rising at double digit rates  Tuition at public colleges has risen 35 percent in the last four years    Today  hardworking families are just barely balancing on a cliff of piling bills  just hoping they wont topple over  They are forced to go into debt just to get by  The average American family now spends 13 percent of its income to pay debts  the highest percentage since 1986  And the average American household is carrying more than  8 000 in credit card debt  More than half of all Americans say they have too much debt and three quarters say that debt is a major reason its harder to achieve the American dream today  Its no wonder that bankruptcy is on the rise   This year  more people will end up bankrupt than will suffer a heart attack  More people will file for bankruptcy than will graduate from college  Bankruptcy is up 33 percent since President Bush took office  An American now goes bankrupt every 19 seconds  But almost none of them go bankrupt because they want to  They go bankrupt because they are forced to    One of the greatest weaknesses of this bill is its failure to address the issue of bankruptcies caused by serious illness or injury  Illness is bankrupting millions of Americans whove done everything right  They have worked hard  played by the rules  earned a good salary  saved their money  even purchased health insurance  only to find thats not enough   This bill would penalize them twice  once by the failure of the health care system and a second time by the failure of the bankruptcy laws  It will make matters worse   At our one morning of hearings on this bill  we heard briefly from Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren about the recent Harvard study that undermines the basic premise of this bill  the assertion that people who file for bankruptcy should be presumed to be abusers of the system   But the study showed that almost half of those who file for bankruptcy every year are the victims of our broken health care system  not irresponsible spendthrifts who choose bankruptcy after making frivolous purchases at the mall   They are middle income Americans who have faced a serious injury or illness  They have faced huge doctor and hospital bills that insurance didnt cover  They have been unable to work after suffering serious medical problems   They are people like April Wetherell  a 50 year old woman from Toms River  New Jersey  who went back to school after having children and received her Masters in Social Work  She was working at a visiting nurse agency in 2003 when she suffered a stroke while recovering from knee surgery  The stroke left her unable to speak  work  or care for her own needs  At the time of her stroke  April still owed about  25 000 in student loans  She had been making payments on her student loans until her illness left her unable to return to her job  Although April had health insurance  it didnt cover all her medical costs  and she was left with more than  20 000 in unpaid medical bills  At the time of her stroke  April had about  7 000 in credit card debt  which she had been paying off on a timely basis  Even though she had done all the right things  April was forced into bankruptcy because she was struck unexpectedly by a serious  incapacitating illness   Or Walton Pinkney of Frederick  Maryland  an electrician for more than 10 years  Walton switched jobs in 2000  and his new employer did not provide health benefits for the first 90 days of employment  Walton collapsed with heart failure during his first month at his new job  Because his new health benefits had not yet taken effect  he was responsible for over  45 000 in medical expenses related to his heart condition  Although he attempted to return to work  his employer said his health was too poor for him to work  Faced with large medical bills he could not pay after he lost his job  Walton finally had to file for bankruptcy in 2003     Or Zoraya Marrero  a single mother with three children from Woodbridge  Virginia  Her oldest child suffers from spina bifida  Zoraya received state disability benefits and medical coverage for her child due to the illness  After moving to another state in 2000  she learned that not only did she no longer qualify for benefits  she had to pay back  60 000 for benefits shed already received  Zoraya has been fighting the  60 000 claim and paying her own medical expenses while working in a doctors office  She cant afford private insurance  and cant afford to pay for her sons costly medical care  Zoraya recently filed for bankruptcy   These people did not seek bankruptcy relief willingly  They and millions of other Americans in similar situations have filed for bankruptcy only after exhausting all other options   Professor Warrens study shows that in the two years before they actually declared bankruptcy  those who filed for bankruptcy after suffering serious illness or injury went through extensive sacrifices as they struggled to pay for their health care and to make ends meet  One in five went without food  Almost one third had their electricity shut off  Almost half lost their phone service  And many more went without needed medical care  Some even moved their infirm parents to less comfortable facilities   This bill does nothing to protect those hard working Americans who did everything they could to stave off bankruptcy  but were left with no other choice after exhausting all their resources  This bill actually makes it more difficult for good citizens like these to get the fresh start that the bankruptcy laws are intended to offer   The idea of giving a fresh start lies at the heart of our bankruptcy law  In 1833  Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story  one of our great legal scholars  explained why  Bankruptcy laws  he said  were intended to divide a debtors remaining assets among his creditors  when he could not pay all his debts  But the purpose was also to relieve unfortunate and honest debtors from perpetual bondage to their creditors  Bankruptcy legislation should  Story said  relieve the debtor from a slavery of mind and body  which  robs his family of the fruits of his labour   One hundred years later  the U S  Supreme Court repeated Justice Storys message  the Bankruptcy Act is intended to relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness  and permit him to start afresh free from the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes  The power to earn a living for himself and his family  the Court said  is a personal liberty  and from the viewpoint of the wage earner there is little difference between not earning at all and earning wholly for a creditor    In short  the same moral values which led this nation to abolish debtors prisons  also led us to let bankrupt debtors apply their remaining assets to cover their debts  but then to give them a fresh start  They should have full rights to their own future earnings  so that they will not have to live in bondage to their past debtors      That is the essence of a capitalist system  we encourage risk taking  whether it is borrowing money for a car to go to work  or a limousine to start a small business  or a tractor to run a farm  or a boat to fish the ocean  If a borrower runs into trouble not of his own making  whether a loss of the job  a bad time for the business  a drought  or a poor year for fish  he may not be able to pay off all his debts  But after he pays as much as he can  we do not say to him  you cannot go out and earn a living in the future for yourself and your family  your future earnings belong to your creditors  As Story said  that would remove the incentives to get back into the economy and contribute to it   Yet this legislation does exactly that  It tells them that they cannot get that fresh start unless they run a Kafka esque gauntlet of procedural barriers that will require time and money they do not have  It forces them to pay for credit counselors who may be predatory themselves  It forces them to miss work to go to audits of their meager estates   Just listen to the CRS summary of the key standard for the means test that lies at the heart of this bill  you are presumed to be an abuser of the system  if current monthly income  excluding allowed deductions  secured debt payments  and priority unsecured debt payments  multiplied by 60  would permit a debtor to pay not less than the lesser of  a  25  of nonpriority unsecured debt or  6000  or  100 a month   whichever is greater  or  b   10 000   Maybe you can figure that out  most people cant  But that will determine whether or not you can get your debts discharged in bankruptcy    The bill is flawed from top to bottom  It uses a look back income formula that ignores the fact that most filers have lost  or are about to lose  their jobs  It uses a stingy IRS formula for permitted family expenditures  It places unnecessarily new burdens on the bankruptcy court system  without improving that system   That is why  since it was first presented to us  it has been opposed by bankruptcy judges  scholars  practitioners  labor unions  consumer advocacy organizations  and civil rights groups who recognize that its harsh and excessive provisions will have a devastating effect on working families  Its basic premise was opposed by both of the National Commissions which studied the bankruptcy system during the 1970s and 1990s  Instead of focusing on the Enrons and Wordcoms  where the Executives lined their own pockets and the employees and pensioners were left twisting in the wind  this bill hurts women  children  and hard working American families   those who truly need the bankruptcy system to prevent unintended financial hardship   Instead of reducing the real abuse by formerly wealthy bankrupts who game the system  it presumes abuse by middle Americans who  as its sponsors admit  rarely do so   The bill does not address the credit card companies massive and unseemly nationwide campaigns to hook unsuspecting citizens B like the elderly  college students  and the working poor B on credit card debt  Even family pets have been urged to sign up for their cards  They send billions of credit card solicitations every year  They push cardholders to raise their limits  They encourage making minimum monthly payments without disclosing what that will mean in interest payments before the quickly growing debts are repaid   These companies are doing fine  so what is the rush in pushing this private interest bill  other than avoiding a close and serious look at the problems this bill would create  or filling the void on the Senate floor  We have plenty of other important legislation we could take up on the floor right now  bills that have widespread bipartisan support and are public priorities  from minimum wage to stem cell research to Drug Reimportation  One morning for a hearing     one morning for a mark up on a 500 page bill that is riddled with problems  A bill that was introduced one night and placed on our agenda the next day   Despite the rush  many of us have tried to play by the rules by seeking to improve this bill in committee  We have circulated many serious and important amendments that would address many of the flaws in the bill  I hope they will be considered seriously  I will start by offering several amendments today that will protect families with high medical costs from this bills draconian provisions  They will help families who tried to meet their responsibilities and to do the right thing  but were overcome by the sickness and injury that absorbed their income and savings  The amendments will provide solutions that are fair and compassionate to families who deserve our help  not the antagonism and mean spiritedness reflected in the present form of this bill   My first set of amendments will exempt those families facing bankruptcy due to serious medical hardship from also facing the burdensome means test  make sure that reasonable health insurance expenses qualify as permissible expenses in the means test calculation  and provide a minimum homestead exemption of  150 000 for medically distressed bankruptcy filers   I also hope to address other issues  and especially to join Senator Durbin in confronting the serious problems that we saw in Massachusetts in the Polaroid bankruptcy and other states have seen in other recent corporate bankruptcies   I sincerely hope that those who have supported the prior versions of this bill will reconsider and listen carefully to the improvements that are suggested today  We have at least that much of an obligation to those whom this bill in its present form will hurt  those who have already been the victims of a bad economy  a broken health care system  and extended military call ups   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
