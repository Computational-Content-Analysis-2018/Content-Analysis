         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       BILL SUMMARY INCLUDED    I commend Chairman Enzi  Senator DeWine  and Senator Mikulski for their bipartisan work on the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act  Its been a lifeline for senior citizens across the country for forty years  and all of us want it to continue to fulfill its important role in the years ahead   Like Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid  the Older Americans Act is part of our commitment to care for the nations seniors in their golden years    This year  the first of the members of the baby boom generation will be eligible for the Acts services  One in nine Americans are over age 65 today  By the year 2030  the number will be one in five    Its clear we need to get our priorities right in this reauthorization  That means starting now to put the infrastructure in place to provide services to baby boomers who retire    This bill takes some of the necessary steps  It requires state and local agencies to acknowledge the changing demographics and to plan ahead  I hope Congress will continue to build on these efforts in the coming years and provide increased funds for the important programs in this Act   Our bill also encourages civic activities by seniors  Numerous examples exist of successful volunteer programs involving seniors  such as Senior Corps  Experience Corps  and Family Friends  and we need to build on these successes    My staff recently visited Experience Corps at a volunteer site at the Marshall School in Dorchester  Massachusetts  Senior citizens have a special classroom in the school where they tutor students in reading and writing  Theyre helping to improve the lives of students who havent always had the easiest times or the best opportunities  Theyre role models for the young students  demonstrating that those who work hard can all do well in life and achieve great things  Its a very inspiring project   The members of the new generation of older Americans obviously want to be engaged in their communities after they retire  and its essential to draw on their experience and knowledge in constructive ways    The bill is also intended to encourage good nutrition  healthy living and disease prevention among seniors  The Meals on Wheels program  enacted in the 1970s  is one of its greatest successes  and Massachusetts has been in the forefront of the effort to provide community based nutrition services to the elderly  Our state program coordinates twenty eight nutrition projects throughout the state to deal with poor nutrition and social isolation of seniors  Our bill will expand the ability of programs such as Meals on Wheels to reach all older individuals who need better nutrition   According to the Census Bureau  6 7 million persons aged 55 or older will be living in poverty by 2008  a 22  increase since 2000  By 2015  the number will increase to 9 million if the current trend continues    The Older Americans Act also provides essential opportunities for employment of older Americans through the Senior Community Service Employment Program  which offers job training for seniors and involves them in the communities which they love  and which also love them  Last year  the program supported 61 000 jobs and served 92 000 people    Congress created this program to provide older adults with community service opportunities  We recognized that senior citizens are especially valuable assets to the communities in which they live  Through community service  older adults are also provided with the job training they need to become self sufficient in the workforce    Unfortunately  in recent years the focus on community service has blurred  and many of us are concerned about the Administrations lack of interest in maintaining this important aspect of the program   Older Americans today provide 45 million hours of valuable service to their communities  particularly in senior centers  public libraries  and nutrition programs    Overall  our bill maintains the emphasis on community service and enables the program to continue to serve older Americans efficiently and well  As we move to the Senate floor and later to negotiations with the House  it is essential that community service remain paramount and that any attempts to weaken this program be defeated   We must also address formula issues within this bill  I know that Senator Bingaman  Senator Murray  and others are worried about the disparities their states may face  This bill is important to seniors throughout the nation and we must work to ensure that every state is fairly funded   Although there are still some issues to resolve  this bipartisan bill is a good start and I support its passage           Summary of the Older
