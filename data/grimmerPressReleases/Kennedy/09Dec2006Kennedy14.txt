         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C Early this morning  the United States Senate and the House of Representatives passed legislation that will save health care coverage for thousands of children   Last night  with strong bipartisan support  Congress acted to avert disaster for thousands of low income children around the nation  With its urgently needed action  Congress assured that states facing shortfalls in the Childrens Health Insurance Program would receive the funding needed to see that they can continue to provide quality health care coverage for low income families    CHIP Shortfall Reduction Package Summary  H R  6164     Redistribution Funds from Expiring FY 04 and Unspent FY 05 CHIP Funds    FY 04 Redistribution  HHS Secretary would be directed to spend  146 m  in expiring FY O4 CHIP funds  FY 04 CHIP allotments that were unspent after three years and reverted to the Secretary for redistribution to other states  on the states that are experiencing shortfalls  spending down on a monthly basis in the order that states hit shortfalls    FY 05 Redistribution  As of March 31  2007  those states that have more than twice the total CHIP funds that they need to meet projected demand in the remaining years of the program would give up half of their remaining FY 05 funds to a new redistribution pool  but no state would give up more than  20 m  in FY 05 funds  These redistribution funds  approximately  125 m   would be spent down by the Secretary to fill the shortfalls on a monthly basis  in the same manner as FY 04 funds are spent     States that Expanded Medicaid Before CHIP Enacted Given Access to CHIP Funds  11 Qualifying states that had expanded their Medicaid program before CHIP was enacted would be able to spend up to 20 percent of their FY 06 and 07 allotments towards providing Medicaid coverage for eligible children  States helped include  CT  HI  MD  MN  NH  NM  RI  TN  VT  WA  WI     Temporary Solution   None of 14 Shortfall States will Run Short Before May 4  Under current law  14 states are anticipated to run short of federal CHIP funds at some point during the fiscal year  starting in January  Under this bill  no state would experience a shortfall before May 4  While not a complete solution  this proposal makes a down payment on the problem and gives the Congress time to consider more comprehensive solutions either through the CHIP reauthorization process next year or through some other vehicle     Differential Match for CHIP Covered Populations Other Than Children and Pregnant Women  Shortfall states that provide CHIP coverage to non pregnant adult populations would receive funds from the redistribution pool  but they would only be eligible for the regular Medicaid match for these populations  This provision prioritizes CHIP funding for children  but does not exclude other populations states are including from funding     Sound Alternative Without Spending New Funds  Due to budget rules and funding constraints  no new funds could be spent to address the shortfalls this year  However  this proposal takes an important first step to addressing this problem by using existing CHIP funds and redirecting them to where they are needed most to protect children from being left without health coverage due to these federal shortfalls         Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
