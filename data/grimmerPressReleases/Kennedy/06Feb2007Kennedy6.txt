         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Edward M  Kennedy questioned Secretary Robert Gates about the total of the surge  citing a recent CBO estimate that a more accurate number will be 35 000  48 000  Senator Kennedy also questioned General Peter Pace on reports that the new troops will not have the adequate armor that need  Below are Senator Kennedys remarks  as prepared for delivery   Secretary Gates  the American people are tired of this Administrations refusal to address the situation in Iraq honestly We went to war based on hyped up intelligence cooked up behind closed doors and the result has been a disaster for our national security  our military  and our standing in the world Most recently  the President hasnt even been straightforward about the level of troops hes sending for the escalation  The President specifically said hes committed a little over 20 000 more troops Those are his words  That is what he has led us all to believe  the American people  Congress and the Iraqi people A press release by the Department of Defense issued the day after the President announced his surge states only that other combat support and combat service support units may also be deployed as necessary once new requirements are assessed But we now learn that the President failed to give us the full picture  The number he announced to the nation doesnt include support personnel In fact  the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a more accurate total for the surge  when support personnel are included  is in the realm of 35 000 to 48 000 troops  much  much larger than the President led us to believe  He misled the country on the full magnitude of additional deployments involved in the escalation Clearly  there is the Presidents surge  and then there is the secret surge he doesnt want to talk about  The American people are tired of these games  tired of the smoke and mirrors  tired of all the deception and misrepresentation  Secretary Gates  either the President is distorting the facts to low ball the number of troops required  or he is sending our soldiers into Iraqs civil war without adequate support personnel  He needs to explain which is the case  Can you do that for us Why were the support troops not included by the President when he announced the planned surge  Where will the support troops come from  and how many of them will be in harms way in Iraq  QUESTIONS GENERAL PACE ON ADEQUATE ARMOR  Gen  Pace  inadequate armor continues to be a major problem for our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan  Im concerned that we are sending even more troops into Iraq without the best equipment  Almost immediately after the President announced the surge  senior commanders said the Army began saying they did not have enough equipment for the surge  General Speaks said  We dont have the kits  and we dont have the trucks  The recent assertion by the CBO indicates that the honest number of troops in the Presidents planned surge is in the range of 35 000 to 48 000  not a little over 20 000 more troops as he claimed  There are serious concerns about our ability to properly equip and protect not only the soldiers currently fighting  but also the new soldiers the President plans to send over Gen  Pace  if our top commanders expressed concern about our ability to properly equip and protect 21 500 troops  how can we properly protect nearly twice that number of new troops    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
