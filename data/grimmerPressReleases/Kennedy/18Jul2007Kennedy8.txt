         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  From our earliest days as a nation  education has been the engine of the American dream  We can look to the landmark success of the GI Bill to see what a difference higher education makes The bill granted veterans up to  500 each term the equivalent of  5 600 today  The GI bill swung the gates to college wide open and half of all veterans went through those gates determined to create a new life for themselves and their families  Over five million veterans received vocational or job training  and more than two million attended college In 1940  the average GI was just 26 years old and had attended only one year of high school  The bill even enabled many of these GIs  who had served the country so magnificently  to become professionals it produced 67 000 doctors  91 000 scientists  238 000 teachers  and 450 000 engineers  It also funded the education of three Presidents  three Supreme Court Justices  and about a dozen Senators who served in this very chamber Historians credit the GI Bill with creating the American middle class and modernizing America  That was possible because of the large federal investment and the enormous return on that investment  Its estimated that for every dollar invested by the GI Bill  our country received seven dollars in return Fourteen billion dollars was spent over the first six years of the bills enactment  In 1951  the federal budget was just  46 billion  In other words  6 years of spending on the GI bill was equivalent to nearly one third of a single years federal budget Since then  the federal commitment to student aid and higher education has shamefully become less of a priority  In 2006  federal spending on all education programs accounted for just one fortieth of the federal budget  America deserves better The bill is a step in the right direction  It dedicates over  17 billion for students and families to benefit from a college education and keep our country strong in the years ahead  It will help keep the doors to college open for all students  regardless of income level or background  just as the GI bill did half a century ago When I graduated from high school  good jobs were available to high school graduates  but that is no longer the case  Today  60 percent of new jobs require some post secondary education  compared to just 15 percent half a century ago  Yet the United States now ranks only 14th in college graduation rates among all industrial nations In the face of the challenges of the global economy  college education is more important than ever  but its never been more difficult to afford  The cost has more than tripled over the last twenty years  Today  average tuition  fees and room and board at public colleges is almost  13 000    and its more than  30 000 at private colleges  Each year  over 400 000 talented  qualified students dont attend a four year college because they cant afford it  At the same time  the buying power of the Pell Grant the lifeline to college for low income students has shrunk dramatically  Twenty years ago  the maximum Pell Grant covered 55 percent of costs at a public four year college  Today  it covers only a third of those costs  As a result  students are sinking deeper and deeper into student loan debt In 1993  fewer than half of all students took out loans to finance their education  but today  more than two thirds of students borrow for college  Today  the average student leaves college with more than  19 000 in student loan debt  This mountain of debt is distorting the basic life choices of countless Americans  Its forcing them to delay getting married  delay buying a home  and delay starting a family  Its also discouraging many young people from choosing careers in fields such as teaching  social work and law enforcement  the low paying but vital jobs that bring large benefits to our society  As students struggle to pay back their loans  the lenders who offer them are making more money than ever  We offer lenders enormous subsidies to take part in the federal loan programs  This bill will put an end to this wasteful spending and ensure that federally subsidized student loan programs put students interests first  The Higher Education Access Act of 2007 will provide more than  17 billion to help students and families pay for college  This legislation will help reverse the crisis in college affordability in several ways  It will immediately and dramatically increase the amount of aid for Pell Grant recipients  It will help students manage their debt  by capping student loan payments at 15 percent of their monthly income  It will provide longer deferments in loan repayments for student borrowers facing economic hardship  It will completely forgive the loans of those who enter societys most needed professions  and It will restore balance to our grossly unfair student loan system by reducing unnecessary subsidies for lenders  The most important part of this legislation is the dramatic increase in need based grant aid to students  Everything we know about the college affordability crisis tells us that low income students and families are struggling the most  Earlier this year  after four years of broken promises by President Bush  the Democratic Congress responded to this challenge by increasing the maximum Pell Grant to  4 310  an increase of  260  The Higher Education Access Act will build on what we started by increasing the maximum Pell grant to  5 100 next year  a  790 increase  and to  5 400 in 2011  We know that Pell grants have opened the door of opportunity for countless young students over the years  It is imperative for Federal and State legislatures to continue offering financial aid Programs to colleges and universities across the country in order to even the playing field for the underserved and disadvantaged Make no mistakethe most important thing we can do to increase college access and affordability in America is to increase need based grant aid  That is exactly what this legislation does Our young college graduates are also painfully aware of how difficult those first years after college can be  when their paychecks are small  but their student loan bills are large  Our legislation will help these students by giving them the option of capping their loan payments at 15 percent of their monthly discretionary income It will also stem the tide of young people who are choosing not to enter public service professions  by granting loan forgiveness to borrowers who stay in those professions for ten years  Our society needs more teachers  more emergency management and law enforcement professionals  more public health doctors and nurses  more social workers  more librarians  more public interest lawyers  and more early childhood teachers  Senator Harkin has been particularly strong in his support of loan forgiveness for public interest lawyers  Under our bill  well produce more of them  because theyand all the groups Ive just mentionedwill be eligible for loan forgiveness  Let me give a few examples of how much this relief will mean to borrowers struggling to repay their debt Take  for example  a starting teacher in Massachusetts who makes a salary of  35 421  If that teacher graduated with the average loan debt for the State    18 169he or she will have a monthly payment of  209   Under the income based repayment plan  that monthly payment would be  148 instead     61 less  Over the course of the year  that teacher would pay  732 less than he or she would have paid under the standard repayment plan  And if the teacher stays in the job for 10 years  the remaining debt would be cancelledin this case  a benefit of over  10 000  In addition a number of our colleagues have worked hard to ensure that our men and women in the militaryand their familiesare treated fairly in the student loan system  Weve included several provisions to extend loan deferments for active duty service members  and taken other steps that will help those who serve our country attend college  Weve heard the arguments from the big lenders  They claim that if Congress reduces their subsides to pay for the measures Ive just described  theyll be forced to reduce the benefits they offer to borrowers on student loans  But the grant aid in this bill dwarfs any benefit a lender could offer on a loan In the long term  we must bring more market based competition into the student loan system  to make it as efficient for taxpayers as possible  Today  theres very little competition in loan programs  because many colleges enter special deals to work with a handful of lenders  and students seldom get their loans from anywhere else Instead  lenders should compete against each other to participate in the federal student loan program  The Higher Education Access Act takes a step in this direction by creating a pilot program in which an auction will be used to see what subsidies are truly necessary to keep loans available to students  The money we save through this pilot program will be sent back where it is needed most  to increase financial aid for students  Im pleased that Senator Gregg has joined our call to use actions to operate the student loan programs  and I commend him for his leadership on this long overdue reform The bill before us will deliver long overdue relief to students and families across the nation  who are struggling to afford college  But there is more we can  and must  do to improve higher education for students and families In addition to the bill before us  our Education Committee reported legislation that makes important changes to reauthorize the Higher Education Act  The Higher Education Amendments Act  as that bill is known  will take common sense steps to improve higher education  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Jack Reed and Senator Enzi  that legislation will dramatically simplify the federal financial aid form  and examine how we can streamline the federal financial aid process even more in the future As we provide more aid to students  the bill will recognize that colleges also need to do their part to keep college costs down  The Higher Education Amendments Act will hold colleges accountable for skyrocketing college costs by creating a nationwide watch list of colleges whose costs are increasing at a rate greater than their peers  and by encouraging the Department of Education and colleges to publish more consumer friendly information about college costs and programs The legislation also continues our focus on teacher preparation  by strengthening partnerships with the K 12 schools who hire the teachers  based on the most successful strategies like induction and mentoring The bill maintains the strength of the TRIO programs  which prepare students to go to college and stay in school We also include a new program to support the graduation of more registered nurses We also create a new student safety grant program to help colleges and universities improve their campus safety and emergency response systems  As the nightmare at Virginia Tech made us all too aware  tragedy can strike anywhere  including on college campuses Our legislation also addresses the serious ethics scandal over student loans  As investigations by New York Attorney General Cuomo  other states  and our Committee have found  many lenders are involved in sweetheart deals with colleges  Some lenders even offer gifts to college and university employees in order to obtain the loan business for their students To encourage lenders and colleges to follow high ethical standards  the Committee included provisions from my Student Loan Sunshine Act  and several other lender ethics and borrower friendly proposals by Senator Enzi and Senator Clinton  Senator Dodd will be complementing these efforts in the Banking Committee with companion legislation on private school education loans These are critical reforms  The Senate should be considering the bill today as well  I hope we will move quickly to take up and pass the Higher Education Amendments Act  and do even more to open the doors of college for all students  and make sure that their interests always come first When President Roosevelt signed the GI Bill into law in 1944  our country gave hope and opportunity to an entire generation That hope was renewed when Congress first passed the Higher Education Act more than 40 years ago  guided by one clear principle  that no qualified student should be denied the opportunity to attend college because of the cost I recall very clearly how important that principle was for President Kennedy  During the 1960 campaign  there was a clear difference on that issue  My brother believed very strongly that if you work hard  study hard  and get accepted to college  you should be able to attend the college of your choice  without regard to cost  That view resonated powerfully with students and families  and it helped create the groundswell that led to the creation of the Higher Education Act in 1965  and again in 1972 when we established the Pell Grant More than ever college is the key to opportunity for students and the key to a strong America for the future  No students should have to mortgage their future in order to pay for higher education I urge the Senate to approve this important legislation      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
