         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   U S  Senators Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   and Sheldon Whitehouse  D R I   today called for a Justice Department investigation into allegations of illegal voter suppression tactics by Republican political operatives  including former Karl Rove aide Tim Griffin  during the 2004 elections  Griffin is now serving as interim U S  Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas At a time when the Departments political independence and its commitment to enforcement of civil rights statutes have been called into doubt  it is vitally important that the Department thoroughly investigate these allegations of unlawful voter suppression  and the apparent failure of Department employees to forward to the appropriate authorities information they had about this practice  the senators wrote in a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales The letter cites voter suppression incidents by the Republican Party in the 1980s  During the 2004 elections  e mail evidence suggests that Tim Griffin  then a political operative at the Republican National Committee  knew and approved of a program to cage voters  sending a political campaign mailing to targeted voters and challenging the right to vote of those whose mail was returned undelivered  in predominantly African American neighborhoods in Jacksonville  Florida  Last year  Griffin was appointed interim U S  Attorney without Senate confirmation  displacing a federal prosecutor who has testified he was told he was fired to make the job available for Griffin Today  Senators Kennedy and Whitehouse demanded an investigation by two DOJ watchdog agencies to determine whether Griffin may have violated the Voting Rights Act or other federal laws  and whether Justice Department officials knew of Griffins potentially unlawful activity when he was named U S  Attorney  Kennedy and Whitehouse are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee  which is conducting its own investigation into the unprecedented firing late last year of several U S  Attorneys  Senator Kennedy  a longtime champion for voting rights  will chair a Judiciary Committee hearing this Thursday on oversight of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division  Whitehouse served as U S  Attorney for Rhode Island from 1994 1998  It is very disturbing to think that Department officials may have approved the appointment of a United States Attorney knowing that he had engaged in racially targeted vote caging  the senators wrote  Moreover  it is very disturbing to think that senior officials were aware of this practice and did nothing to refer their information to relevant officials within the Department for investigation and a determination as to whether it was a violation of a consent decree or law within the Departments jurisdiction to enforce The full text of the letter is below June 18  2007Alberto GonzalesAttorney GeneralUnited States Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NWWashington  D C  20530Dear Attorney General Gonzales We write to request that the Department of Justice promptly investigate allegations that the Republican National Committee engaged in vote caging during the 2004 elections  We also ask that you investigate whether any Department officials were aware of allegations that Tim Griffin had engaged in caging when he was appointed United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas  and whether appropriate action was taken  Caging is a reprehensible voter suppression tactic  and it may also violate federal law and the terms of applicable judicially enforceable consent decrees  Caging is a voter suppression tactic whereby a political campaign sends mail marked do not forward to a targeted group of eligible voters  A more aggressive version involves sending mail to a targeted group of voters with instructions to sign and return an acknowledgment card  The campaign then creates a list of those whose mail was returned undelivered and challenges the right of those citizens to vote  on the ground that the voter does not live at the registered address  There are many reasons why registered mail might be returned to sender that have nothing to do with a voters eligibility  A voter might be an active member of the armed forces and stationed far from home  or a student registered at his parents address  Even a typographical error during entry of the voters registration information might result in an address that appears invalid  The Republican Party has a long and ignominious record of caging  much of it focused on the African American community  For example  in 1981 the RNC sent a mass mailing into predominantly African American neighborhoods in New Jersey and used the resulting 45 000 letters marked undeliverable to challenge those voters eligibility  In 1986  the RNC used similar tactics in an effort to disenfranchise roughly 31 000 voters  most of them African American  in Louisiana  These tactics led to litigation and the RNCs eventual signing of two consent decrees  still in effect  which bar the RNC from using ballot security programs ostensibly intended to prevent voter fraud as a tactic to target minority voters In 2004  however  allegations of caging by Republican officials arose again  this time over an effort to suppress votes in Florida  Emails sent in August 2004 by Tim Griffin  then Research Director and Deputy Communications Director of the RNC  demonstrate his knowledge and approval of a spreadsheet listing caged voters in predominantly African American neighborhoods in Jacksonville  Florida   See attached   Two years later  Mr  Griffin was appointed  without Senate confirmation  as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas  Such actions appear plainly to violate the consent decrees signed by the RNC in 1981 and 1986  We ask that you investigate whether in these circumstances Mr  Griffin or others may also have violated the Voting Rights Act  the National Voter Registration Act  the mail fraud statute  or any other federal statute It also appears that high ranking officials in the Department knew of Mr  Griffins involvement in caging  Monica Goodling recently testified to the House Judiciary Committee that she discussed concerns about Mr  Griffins involvement in caging with Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty during a session to prepare for Mr  McNultys Congressional testimony  It is very disturbing to think that Department officials may have approved the appointment of a United States Attorney knowing that he had engaged in racially targeted vote caging  Moreover  it is very disturbing to think that senior officials were aware of this practice and did nothing to refer their information to relevant officials within the Department for investigation and a determination as to whether it was a violation of a consent decree or law within the Departments jurisdiction to enforce We  therefore  ask the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility to conduct an investigation to determine who in DOJ knew about Mr  Griffins potentially unlawful activity before he was named interim U S  Attorney  and whether appropriate action was taken on that knowledge  and to recommend whatever action is appropriate At a time when the Departments political independence and its commitment to enforcement of civil rights statutes have been called into doubt  it is vitally important that the Department thoroughly investigate these allegations of unlawful voter suppression  and the apparent failure of Department employees to forward to the appropriate authorities information they had about this practice Sincerely Edward M  Kennedy    Sheldon WhitehouseUnited
