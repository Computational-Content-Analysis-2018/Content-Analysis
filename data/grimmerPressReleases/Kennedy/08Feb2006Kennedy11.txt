         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Many Senators on both sides of the aisle find the concept of a Trust Fund to compensate the victims of asbestos related diseases appealing  I have consistently said that I would support a properly designed and adequately funded Trust Fund bill that would fairly compensate all the victims of asbestos induced disease in a timely way  The problem is that S 852 does not meet that standard  It is not properly designed and it is not adequately funded  Many seriously ill victims of asbestos disease are completely excluded from compensation under the Fund  And the legislation does not even provide adequate revenue to ensure that all the victims who are eligible for compensation under the terms of the Trust Fund will actually receive what the legislation promises them  These are fundamental flaws that cannot be corrected by a few last minute amendments  They go to the heart of the bill The problem is that powerful corporate interests responsible for the asbestos epidemic have fought throughout this process to escape full accountability for the harm they have inflicted  As a result  the focus has shifted from what these companies should pay victims to what they are willing to pay them  That is preventing the Senate from enacting Trust Fund legislation that will truly help the workers who have been seriously injured by this industrial plague This legislation was constructed backwards  The first decision made was that the size of the Trust Fund could not exceed  140 billion over 30 years  Why  Because that was all the corporations whose reckless conduct created the asbestos problem were willing to pay  The Asbestos Study Group  the chief lobbyists for this legislation  began this process by promising an evergreen fund that would provide as much money as necessary over time to fairly compensate the victims of asbestos disease  But they soon reneged on that commitment  Instead  these companies are now insisting on an absolute cap on their liability    no matter how many victims are suffering from asbestos induced disease or how serious their illnesses  Asbestos diseases take years  sometimes decades  to develop after the exposure to asbestos fibers  Thus  no one can say for sure how many victims there will be  The companies claim that they need financial certainty to plan for the future  What about the millions of victims of asbestos exposure who live every day under the cloud of asbestos disease  What about the ability of these workers and their families to plan for their future Each year  more than 10 000 of them die from lung cancer and other diseases caused by asbestos  Each year  hundreds of thousands of them suffer from lung conditions which make breathing so difficult that they cannot function at all  Even more become unemployable due to their medical condition  And  because of the long latency period of these diseases  all of them live with fear of a premature death due to asbestos induced disease  These are the real victims  Aren t they entitled to the certainty of knowing that  should the worst happen  they and their families will be fairly compensated  All S 852 offers them is an inadequately funded Trust Fund that most experts believe will be insolvent within a few years The real crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation crisis  it is an asbestos induced disease crisis  All too often  the tragedy these workers and their families are enduring becomes lost in a complex debate about the economic impact of asbestos litigation  We cannot allow that to happen  The litigation did not create these costs  Exposure to asbestos created them  They are the costs of medical care  the lost wages of incapacitated workers  and the cost of providing for the families of workers who died years before their time  Those costs are real  No legislative proposal can make them disappear  All legislation can do is shift those costs from one party to another  Unfortunately  S 852 would shift more of the financial burden onto the backs of injured workers  That is unacceptable Senators Specter and Leahy have devoted an enormous amount of time and effort to this Asbestos Trust Fund legislation  They did not set the arbitrary  140 billion ceiling  The Republican leadership made clear that the Trust Fund could not exceed that amount regardless of the legitimate needs of asbestos victims  The sponsors were left with the unenviable task of deciding which worthy claims to exclude  As a result  the bill before us contains fundamental flaws  which make it both unfair and unworkable  It does not provide a reliable guarantee of just compensation to the enormous number of workers who are suffering from asbestos induced disease The argument that there are serious inadequacies in the way asbestos cases are adjudicated today does not mean that any legislation is better than the current system  Our first obligation is to do no harm  We should not be supporting legislation that excludes many seriously ill victims from receiving compensation and that fails to provide a guarantee of adequate funding to make sure that these injured workers covered by the Trust Fund will actually receive what the bill promises them  This bill will do harm to these asbestos victims The list of serious flaws in S 852 is  unfortunately  a long one  I will focus my remarks on several of the most egregious Financial Inadequacy Experts tell us that the Asbestos Trust created by this legislation is seriously underfunded  The funding plan in this bill relies on very substantial borrowing in the early years as the only way to pay the flood of claims  The result will be huge debt service costs over the life of the Trust that could reduce the  140 billion intended to pay claims by as much as 40 percent  The amount remaining would be far too little to pay the claims of all of those who are entitled to compensation under the terms of the bill In addition  there is a strong constitutional argument that the existing bankruptcy trusts cannot be forced to turn over all their assets  which will place  7 6 billion of the projected funding in jeopardy  Many companies are also likely to challenge their obligation to finance the Asbestos Trust  It is not at all clear how much money will actually be available to pay eligible victims what the legislation promises they will receive There is likely to be a serious shortfall in the early years  when nearly 300 000 pending cases will be transferred to the Trust for payment  Studies show the Trust will not have the resources to pay those claims in a timely manner  Payments to critically ill people may be delayed for years One way to reduce the enormous financial burden on the fund in the early years would be to leave many of those cases in the tort system  especially cases which were close to resolution  That would be fair to the parties in those cases and it would greatly improve the financial viability of the fund  Unfortunately  that proposal has been repeatedly rejected by the sponsors of the bill  As a result  there will be a serious mismatch between the number of claims the Trust Fund will face when its doors open and the payments coming into the Fund  That will force major borrowing in the first five years  The debt service resulting from that borrowing will financially cripple the Trust In its August report  CBO recognizes the seriousness of this debt service problem  explaining Because expenses would exceed revenues in many of the early years of the fund s operations  the Administrator would need to borrow funds to make up the shortfall  The interest cost of this borrowing would add significantly to the long term costs faced by the fund and contributes to the possibility that the fund might become insolvent   Emphasis added In a response to inquiries from Judiciary Committee members last week  CBO issued an even more dire warning about the likelihood of insolvency There is a significant likelihood that the fund s revenues would fall short of the amount needed to pay valid claims  as well as debt service and administrative costs  There is also some likelihood that the fund s revenues would be sufficient to meet those needs  The final outcome cannot be predicted with great certainty  Without a substantial increase in the resources available to the fund  there is no way to guarantee that the fund will not either revert to the court system or require additional funding That statement should trouble every Senator on both sides of the aisle  There is a significant likelihood that the fund s revenues would fall short  While we may disagree on other issues regarding compensation for asbestos victims  each of us knows that it would be disastrous    for victims and businesses alike    to create a Trust Fund that cannot meet its financial commitment to victims and is destined for insolvency  None of us want to see that result  We cannot in good conscience ignore the warnings from the Congressional Budget Office and from other experts In addition to the concerns CBO has identified  there are other major problems with S 852 related to the projections of pending and future claims that could push the Trust Fund even further out of balance For example  there has been a significant increase in the number of mesothelioma cases in recent years  The only known cause of mesothelioma is asbestos exposure  This new information suggests that the CBO cost estimate may understate the cost of the mesothelioma claims that the Trust Fund will incur by more than  15 billion  This is by no means the only instance where there is strong evidence to suggest that the number of eligible claimants will substantially exceed CBO estimates If S  852 is enacted  the United States Government will be making a commitment to compensate hundreds of thousands of seriously ill asbestos victims  but will not have ensured that adequate dollars are available to honor its commitment  That will precipitate a genuine asbestos crisis  and this Congress will bear the responsibility for it  Since the Trust Fund will be borrowing extensively from the United States Treasury in its first few years of operation  if it does become insolvent  there will be a direct impact on American taxpayers Start Up The legislation before us would close the courthouse doors to asbestos victims on the day it passes  long before the Trust Fund will be able to pay their claims  Their cases will be stayed immediately  Seriously ill workers will be forced into a legal limbo for up to two years  Their need for compensation to cover medical expenses and basic family necessities will remain  but they will have nowhere to turn for relief Under the legislation  even exigent health claims currently pending in the courts will be automatically stayed for nine months as of the date of enactment  An exigent health claim is one in which the victim has been diagnosed as being terminally ill from an asbestos related illness and having a life expectancy of less than one year By definition  these cases all involve people who have less than a year to live due to mesothelioma or some other disease caused by asbestos exposure  Their cases would all be stayed for nine months  Nine months is an eternity for someone with less than a year to live  Many of them will die without receiving either their day in court or compensation from the Trust Fund The stay language is written so broadly that it would even stop all forward movement of a case in the court system  A trial about to begin would be halted  An appellate ruling about to be issued would be barred  Even the deposition of a dying witness could not be taken to preserve his testimony  The stay would deprive victims of their last chance at justice  I cannot believe that the authors of this bill intended such a harsh result  but that is what the legislation does The bill does contain language allowing an offer of judgment to be made during the period of the stay in the hope of producing a settlement  However  this provision is unlikely to resolve many cases because it requires the agreement of the defendants  There is no incentive for defendants to agree to a settlement when the case has been stayed  Those who have tried cases know that it is only the imminence of judicial action which produces a settlement in most cases  Delay is the defendant s best ally  and under this bill  the case is at least delayed for nine months and may never be allowed to resume if the Fund becomes operational  If  however  these exigent cases were not stayed  and judicial proceedings could continue  there would be far more likelihood of cases settling under the offer of judgment process I strongly believe that  at a minimum  all exigent cases should be exempted from the automatic stay in the legislation  Victims with less than a year to live certainly should be allowed to continue their cases in court uninterrupted until the Trust Fund became operational  Their ability to recover compensation in the court should not be halted until the Trust Fund is open for business and they are able to receive compensation from that Fund  It is grossly unfair to leave these dying victims in a legal limbo  For them  the old adage is especially true    justice delayed is justice denied Under the legislation  defendants would receive a credit against what they must contribute to the Trust Fund for whatever payments they make to these dying victims  so they would not be paying twice  as some have claimed Allowing the exigent cases to go forward in the courts without interruption is a matter of simple fairness  Staying the cases of victims who have less than a year to live is bureaucratic insensitivity at its worst  Most of these victims will not live to see the doors of the Trust Fund open We should not deprive them of their last chance    their only chance    to receive some measure of justice before asbestos induced disease silences them  They should be allowed to receive compensation in their final months to ease their suffering  They should be allowed to die knowing that their families are financially provided for  S 852 in its current form takes that last chance away from them I intend to offer an amendment to allow these severely ill victims to have their day in court Sunset The way the legislation is written  victims will lose out at the back end of the process as well  should the Trust Fund run out of money after several years of operation If the Trust Fund does become insolvent  a very real possibility  workers will not have an automatic right to immediately return to the court system  The process outlined in the current bill could take years  Workers could end up trapped in the Trust with reduced benefits and long delays in receiving their payments  There needs to be a clear  objective trigger    inability of the Trust to pay a certain percentage of claims within a set period of time    that will automatically allow victims to pursue their claims in court if the Trust runs out of money  The Judiciary Committee s 2003 legislation contained such a provision  but this bill does not  We cannot allow seriously injured workers with valid claims who are not paid in a timely manner by the Trust to be denied their day in court  That would be a shameful injustice The Asbestos Trust is being presented as an alternative source of compensation for victims suffering from asbestos induced disease  If that alternative runs out of money and can no longer compensate those victims in a full and timely manner  their right to seek compensation through the judicial system should be immediately restored with no strings attached  No principle is more basic  Yet  this bill violates that principle Lung Cancer Victims I am particularly upset by the way lung cancer victims are treated in this bill  Under the medical criteria adopted by the Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly two years ago  all lung cancer victims who had at least 15 years of weighted exposure to asbestos were eligible to receive compensation from the Fund  However  that was changed in S 852  Under this bill  lung cancer victims who have had very substantial exposure to asbestos over long periods of time are denied any compensation unless they can show asbestos scarring on their lungs  The Committee heard expert medical testimony that prolonged asbestos exposure dramatically increases the probability that a person will get lung cancer even if they do not have scarring on their lungs  Deleting this category will deny compensation to more than forty thousand victims suffering with asbestos related lung cancers  Under the legislation as now drafted  these victims are losing their right to go to court  but receiving nothing from the Fund  How can any of us support such an unconscionable provision Since we began considering asbestos legislation  no aspect has concerned me more than the treatment of lung cancer victims  My top priority has been to make sure that these severely ill workers receive just and fair compensation And I have not been alone  A number of other members have spoken out about the importance of adequately providing for lung cancer victims who have been exposed to substantial amounts of asbestos over long periods of time Now we find that these victims  many of whom will have their lives cut short because of asbestos induced disease  will not receive one penny in compensation from the Trust Fund  They are losing their right to go to court  but being denied any right to compensation under the Fund  They are  in essence  being told to suffer in a legally imposed silence with no recourse whatsoever One of the arguments we hear most frequently in favor of creating an Asbestos Trust Fund is that in the current system  too much money goes to people who are not really sick and too little goes to those who are seriously ill  Well  lung cancer victims who have years of exposure to asbestos are the ones who are seriously ill  They are the ones this legislation is supposed to be helping  Yet  they are being completely excluded The Committee heard extensive testimony from distinguished medical experts    Dr  Laura Welsh and Dr  Philip Landrigin    that prolonged exposure to asbestos can cause lung cancer even if the victim does not also have markers of nonmalignant asbestos disease  They cited numerous medical authorities supporting their position  They even described treating lung cancer victims whose disease was clearly caused by asbestos but who had neither pleural thickening or asbestosis In a situation where people are undeniably severely ill and undeniably had 15 or more years of weighted exposure to asbestos  it is wrong to completely exclude them from compensation under the Trust Fund  Some of the proponents of S 852 have attempted to justify excluding them by claiming that smoking probably caused their lung cancers  But  the evidence refutes this contention First  even those lung cancer victims with 15 or more weighted years of exposure to asbestos who had never smoked were removed from eligibility for compensation under the Trust Fund  So  this is about more than just the relationship between asbestos and smoking Second  regarding the smoking issue  Dr  Landrigan testified that smokers who have substantial exposure to asbestos have 55 times the background risk of developing lung cancer  while smokers who were not exposed to asbestos have 10 times the background risk of developing lung cancer  Clearly  the asbestos exposure makes a huge difference There is a powerful synergistic effect between asbestos and tobacco in the causation of lung cancer  Both are substantial contributing factors to the disease  The smoker with substantial asbestos exposure should receive less compensation from the Trust Fund than the nonsmoker with lung cancer  That principle appears throughout the bill  But smoking is not a reason to exclude the smoker from all compensation Without prolonged exposure to asbestos  the smoker would have been far less likely to contract lung cancer  It is a gross injustice to completely exclude these severely ill workers Any person who was exposed to asbestos for 15 or more weighted years and now has lung cancer should be eligible for compensation from the Trust Fund  It would not be automatic  Their cases would be reviewed individually by a panel of physicians to determine whether asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to their lung cancer  These 40 000 victims of asbestos should not be arbitrarily excluded from receiving compensation  They were included in the original legislation  it was agreed to by medical experts for both business and labor  and that provision should be restored to the bill  I will be proposing an amendment to rectify this serious injustice Standard of Proof This bill also tampers with the agreed upon medical criteria carefully negotiated between representatives of business and labor by raising the standard of proof for each disease category  The language in S 852 requires the workers to prove that asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to their disease  instead of just a contributing factor  This is a major increase in the burden workers must overcome to receive compensation  It is significantly higher than most states currently require in a court of law  Rather than having to show that asbestos exposure contributed to their illness  they will now have to address the relative impact of asbestos and other potential factors  This change is a serious step in the wrong direction  raising the bar even higher on injured workers Community Contamination Another major shortcoming of this legislation is its failure to compensate the residents of areas that have experienced large scale asbestos contamination  S 852 simply pretends that this problem does not exist  It fails to compensate the victims of all asbestos induced diseases  other than mesothelioma  whose exposure was not directly tied to their work  There is very substantial scientific evidence showing that the men  women and children who lived in the vicinity of asbestos contaminated sites  such mining operations and processing plants  can and do contract asbestos induced disease The reason that this legislation needs a special provision to compensate the residents of Libby  Montana  is because it does not compensate victims of community contamination generally  The residents of Libby are certainly entitled to compensation  but so are the residents who lived near the many processing plants from Massachusetts to California that received the lethal ore from the Libby mine  The deadly dust from Libby  Montana was spread across America  W R  Grace shipped almost 10 billion pounds of Libby ore to its processing facilities between the 1960s and the mid 1990s  One of the places it was shipped was to the Town of Easthampton  Massachusetts  where the operations of an expanding plant spread the asbestos to the surrounding environment  into the air and onto the soil  I intend to discuss this problem in great detail as the debate moves forward I raise it now as a dramatic example of one of the major injustices caused by the arbitrary exclusion of a large number of asbestos victims from compensation under the Trust Fund  Nor is the problem of community contamination limited to the sites receiving ore from Libby  Community asbestos contamination can result from many different sources  For example  medical experts believe it may result from exposure to asbestos after the collapse of the World Trade Center  Because of the long latency period  we often do not learn about community asbestos contamination until long after it occurs  Certainly these victims of asbestos are entitled to fair treatment as well  They should not be arbitrarily excluded from compensation as if their suffering is somehow less worthy of recognition than the suffering of other asbestos victims  Yet  that is what S 852 does Conclusion This is a bill that shifts more of the financial burden of asbestos induced disease to injured workers by unfairly and arbitrarily limiting the liability of defendants  It does not establish a fair and reliable system that will compensate all those who are seriously ill due to asbestos  It lacks a dependable funding stream which can ensure that all who are entitled to compensation actually receive full and timely payment  These are very basic shortcomings We cannot allow what justice requires to be limited by what the wrongdoers are willing to pay  I intend to vote no and I urge my colleagues to do the same   Laura
