         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit is the second highest court in the nation  As such  its judges bear a unique responsibility    By law  the D C  circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over many issues that other appellate courts cannot deal with  Only the judges of the D C  Circuit can hear appeals under many critical laws that affect our economy  our environment  and our election system  Because the Supreme Court only hears a limited number of cases  the judges of the D C  Circuit often have the final word on laws that affect the lives of millions of Americans  at home and in the workplace     Unlike most of the members of the D C  Circuit  Brett Kavanaugh is not a judge  an experienced litigator  or a legal scholar  Far from it  Mr  Kavanaugh is a political operative  a man whose ambition has placed him at the center of some of the most politically divisive events in recent memory  He is not qualified for this position  If his nomination is approved  I can say with confidence that Mr  Kavanaugh would be the youngest  least experienced and most partisan appointee to the court in decades    Mr  Kavanaugh blatantly lacks the broad legal experience that is the hallmark of federal judgesparticularly those at the highest levels  He has never tried a case to verdict or to judgment  In fact  Mr  Kavanaugh has only practiced law for ten years  Even counting his time as a law clerk  he still has only half of the average legal experience of nominees to the D C  Circuit  To put this in context  Mr  Kavanaugh would be the least experienced member of the D C  Circuit in almost a quarter century    His lack of experience is underscored by his responses to questions from Judiciary Committee members  When he was asked to name his ten most significant cases  Mr  Kavanaugh could only cite five cases for which he actually appeared in court  and only two cases in which he was lead counsel  He even cited two cases for which he merely wrote a friend of the court brief for someone who was not a party to the lawsuit     I am not alone in my judgment that Mr  Kavanaugh is not qualified for this position  Aside from my seven colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who voted against his appointment  organizations from around the country are united in their opposition to his nomination  The AFL CIO  the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights  the NAACP  the National Urban League  the United Auto Workersthe list reads like a who s who of citizen representatives     Most troubling  however  is the lukewarm evaluation of the American Bar Association  which has now conducted three separate evaluations of Mr  Kavanaugh  On the latest and perhaps closest evaluation  the ABA took the unusual step of downgrading its rating of Mr  Kavanaugh  Today  a majority of that committee does not believe Brett Kavanaugh can meet their highest standard for federal nominees    Why did the ABA downgrade its rating  It did so after confidential interviews with judges and lawyers familiar with his work  when numerous questions were raised about Mr  Kavanaugh s ability as an attorney and potential appellate judge     A judge who heard Mr  Kavanaugh s oral arguments found that his presentation was less than adequate  and that he demonstrated skills on the level of an associatea young lawyer at a law firm  Lawyers familiar with his work raised additional questions about his impartiality and partisanship  One attorney specifically questioned whether Mr  Kavanaugh was capable of being balanced and fair should he assume a federal judgeship    But Mr  Kavanaugh s lack of qualifications goes beyond years of experience or individual interviews  More important  Mr  Kavanaugh is almost completely unfamiliar with the substantive issues of law that consistently arise in the D C  Circuit     These aren t arcane concerns  The D C  Circuit has a key role in upholding the rights of American workers  That Court decides far more appeals than any other circuit of decisions by the National Labor Relations Board on unfair labor practices  Usually  these cases are filed by employers across the country attempting to overturn unfair labor practice findings against them by the Board  Recently  almost one in three such appeals have been heard by the D C  Circuit     During our hearings  I asked Mr  Kavanaugh whether he had any experience handling labor law matters  He couldn t provide a single example of work in this areanot one  Instead  he made vague reference to his work as a law clerk and his brief time in the Justice Department     The D C  Circuit is also important to anyone who breathes our air or drinks our water  It is the only federal appellate court that can hear appeals on rules to protect the environment under the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act  It is the only federal court that can grant a remedy when the Executive Branch fails to follow Congressional mandates to protect the environment under these laws    Nothing in Mr  Kavanaugh s record suggests that he would be willing to keep the executive branch in compliance with the law on these matters  More generally  nothing in his record suggests that he would be able to avoid the partisanship and politics that have marked his brief career    In fact  partisan politics is the only area in which Mr  Kavanaugh s qualifications cannot be questioned  He has been deeply involved in some of the most bitterly divisive political events in the last decadeand always on the same side    At the Office of the Independent Counsel  Mr  Kavanaugh co authored the infamous Starr Report  wrote the articles of impeachment against President Clinton  and investigated the tragic suicide of Vince Foster     As an Associate White House Counsel  Mr  Kavanaugh worked to support the nomination and confirmation of Jay Bybee  the author of the notoriousbut then still secrettorture memo  He also was personally responsible for drafting the executive order that made presidential records less accessible to the public and the press  This was order was so restrictive that one observer said it would make Nixon jealous in his grave    We gave Mr  Kavanaugh an opportunity to prove that he was independent and impartial in spite of his partisan past  I personally noted that this was my chief concern with his nomination  and I know that my colleagues did the same  Mr  Kavanaugh refused to specify the issues and policies on which he would recuse himselfin spite of the fact that he was at the center of a number of executive policy directives in recent years     His answers to our questions resembled political talking points more than they did the answers we would expect from a nominee to such a prominent lifetime position in the nation s Judiciary  He has shown nothing to suggest that he will stand up to the President when his duties require it    Mr  Kavanaugh is not qualified for this job  Even worse  his nomination is a harsh reminder of the partisan and ideological pressures that have marked many recent judicial nominations  His nomination seems little more than a crass Administration attempt to politicize the courts and provide a solid vote in favor of even the most extreme political tactics of the Administration  The federal courts need experienced  independent judges who can rise above their partisan beliefs and enforce the rights and guarantees of our Constitution and the rule of law    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
