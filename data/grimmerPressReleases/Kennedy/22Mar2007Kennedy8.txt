         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement  in support of the comprehensive immigration reform bill introduced today in the  House I commend Representatives Gutierrez and Flake for introducing  comprehensive immigration legislation and moving us one important step forward  towards fixing our broken system  We have worked together closely on this plan  and I believe it strikes the right balance between protecting our security   strengthening our economy  and enacting laws that uphold our humanity   The immigration raids in New Bedford and other parts of the country  are a painful reminder that reform is overdue  Raids are stopgap solutions that  unfairly penalize vulnerable workers  drive them deeper into the shadows  and  create a two tiered economy that keeps hurting all workers  In contrast  the  Gutierrez Flake bill provides reforms that will hold accountable those employers  who break the law while giving these undocumented workers an opportunity to earn  legal status and stand up for their rights  thereby improving working conditions  for all workers  Im hopeful that the House introduction today will  help spur the necessary negotiations in the Senate to help forge the right kind  of compromise  Last year  we beat the odds in the Senate by passing bipartisan  immigration bill    and Im confident well do so again in the coming  weeks   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202 224 2633
