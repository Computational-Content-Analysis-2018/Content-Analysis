         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Secretary Chertoff responded to the lawmakers first request regretting the invitation to visit the site of the proposed LNG facility   The office of United States Department of Homeland Security Secretary  Michael Chertoff  has responded to Massachusetts lawmakers  request for an onsite visit to Fall River  Massachusetts  Chertoff s office regretted the invitation by the lawmakers saying  The Secretary appreciates your invitation and strong interest and concern about the proposed Liquefied Natural Gas  LNG  facility in Weaver s Cover in Fall River  Massachusetts  however  due to scheduling constraints  he is unable to make personal visits to each proposed facility  Earlier this month  the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission approved the siting of a Liquefied Natural Gas facility in the densely populated Massachusetts community     Senator Kennedy said  I am deeply disturbed that FERC has made its decision to approve the Fall River LNG terminal without the guidance of the Department of Homeland Security s own Coast Guard Letter of Recommendation  Secretary Chertoff owes it to the people of Fall River to visit the facility and see for himself the unacceptable risk these cities and towns will face if this facility is allowed to be built  In this era where terrorism is unfortunately an all too real threat  we should make safety our highest priority    Senator Kerry said  We must work together as hard as we can to make our communities across the country as safe as possible and Fall River should not be an exception  It is unconscionable and absolutely unacceptable to allow this project to proceed in these dangerous times and the people of Fall River deserve better  I strongly urge Secretary Chertoff to reverse his decision to visit the proposed site first hand and join us in fighting against this project    Secretary Chertoff s decision is disappointing  particularly in light of FERC s recent action  Rep  McGovern said  The Department of Homeland Security simply cannot continue to ignore the significant safety concerns surrounding the Fall River LNG proposal  I hope that Secretary Chertoff knows that we will continue to educate him on this issue  and that if he can t find his way to Fall River  we ll be insisting on a meeting here in Washington    I am disappointed that Secretary Chertoff will not visit and see first hand what we all have been saying for some time  the LNG plant in Fall River is dangerous and should be located in areas away from major population centers  said Congressman Frank  An important component of Homeland Security is to mitigate future threats and I urge him to reconsider  Congressman Markey said  It is outrageous that Secretary Chertoff would put the corporate interests of industry CEOs ahead of the security concerns of citizens of Fall River  Newport  Jamestown  Bristol  and Tiverton  But it is not surprising that Secretary Chertoff would refuse to visit LNG facilities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island  For citizens living in communities near LNG facilities  Secretary Chertoff s plan is not risk based it is risky and his silence sends a clear message to the citizens of Massachusetts and Rhode Island   your security concerns are not our concern   He went on  When I asked whether or not Secretary Chertoff would support regulation to prevent the siting of new liquefied natural gas terminals in densely populated areas  a vulnerable target for terrorist attacks  he refused to do so    I m confident that a visit to the proposed Weaver s Cove site will dramatically show the massive security and environmental threats such a facility would pose to thousands of residents from Rhode Island and Massachusetts   said Congressman Patrick Kennedy  So far  the Commission has failed to recognize the devastating impact the Weaver s Cove project will have on the many cities and towns in Rhode Island situated on the waterways in which these supertankers will use  As we look to address the region s energy needs we should never jeopardize the safety of our communities     Senator Jack Reed stated  While we recognize that natural gas is an important and growing component of New England s and the nation s energy supply  during a global war on terrorism which has seen several high profile  devastating attacks  we must consider the significant safety and security risks associated with siting LNG marine terminals in urban communities and requiring LNG tankers to pass within close proximity to miles of densely populated coastline    The letter in its entirety is below    July 15  2005   The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  U S  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  DC 20528   Dear Mr  Secretary    We are writing again  this time on behalf of both Massachusetts and Rhode Island  to urge you to join us on a visit to potential LNG sites in our states  Each of us has legitimate and serious concerns about the safety of our citizens if LNG projects are allowed to go forward at either Weaver s Cove in Fall River  Massachusetts or KeySpan  Rhode Island   Even if the Rhode Island KeySpan project does not go forward and the Weaver s Cove project does  a number of Rhode Island cities and towns  such as Newport  Jamestown  Bristol  Middletown  Portsmouth  and Tiverton  are situated on the very waterways that the LNG supertankers will have to use to reach Weaver s Cove  and are subject to the same dangers as Fall River    We are familiar with the Letter of Recommendation procedure under which the Coast Guard makes recommendations as to the safety and security requirements and conditions necessary for LNG vessels to use waterways and conduct cargo operations at the facility  We are deeply concerned  however  that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  granted approval of these projects on June 30th before the Letter of Recommendation was issued     As you may know  counter terrorism experts  acting in a pro bono capacity  have advised both states that safety requirements against terrorist attacks cannot be met at these locations  and have described them as invitations to terrorism  We believe that the Department of Homeland Security should convey its views on these projects to FERC  The determination to permit either project to go forward is of sufficient public importance that it should be made at the Secretarial level    We expect that FERC will issue its formal order within days  and  as provided in the law  Fall River will then have 30 days to file an application for FERC to reconsider the decision  Time is of the essence  and we urge you to visit the sites with us  You will see that the planned facilities will be a prime target for terrorist activity and a very real danger to the people of Fall River  Newport  Jamestown  Bristol  Middletown  Portsmouth  and Tiverton     We also ask that you appeal to FERC to wait for the Coast Guard to submit its Letter of Recommendation and consider it before it hears and rules on appeals from these sites     In light of the recent terrorist attacks in London  the nation must be more vigilant than ever in protecting densely populated urban areas  The United States Government should not permit LNG facilities to be built for the first time in thirty years in such areas  Doing so will create major additional vulnerability and increase the likelihood of terrorist attack  at the very time we should be more effectively responding to the dire threats to our transportation system and port facilities     We strongly urge you to visit Fall River and Rhode Island and inform FERC of your views on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security  We are confident that you will agree with our analysis since allowing this facility to be built will place the men  women and children who live or work in these cities at unacceptable risk    We look forward to your visit to our states before FERC acts again on this matter  and we thank you for your prompt attention to this request     With respect and appreciation    Edward M  Kennedy     John F  Kerry United States Senate     United States Senate
