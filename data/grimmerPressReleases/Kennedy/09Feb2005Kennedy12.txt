         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     We re all here today because we have constituents who obtain prescription drugs from Canada  The reason is obvious  They re fed up with being gouged by exorbitant U S  prices for drugs  when the identical drugs are available in Canada at half the price and are just as safe  Drugs from Canada are certainly a better choice for hard pressed patients than cutting their U S  pills in half or taking them every other day to make them more affordable  or not taking needed drugs at all     The Administration s new estimate of the cost of its Medicare drug program makes action even more urgent  The problem is not caused by its being too generous toward seniors  In fact  it is not generous enough  Too much of the cost of the program goes to increase the drug industry s already inflated profits     The soaring new cost is more than a fresh blow to the Administration s credibility  it is an indictment of their policy of putting drug industry profits ahead of senior citizens  needs    It s no surprise that innovative seniors discovered the opportunity for instant relief available in Canada  and began organizing bus trips across the border from many of our northern states    In Massachusetts  the City of Springfield began using Canadian pharmacies to provide prescription drugs for its city employees and retirees  Springfield s example led the way for other cities and state governments across the country to do the same  The internet revolution vastly expanded the opportunity  enabling patients across America to go to Canada on the internet and save thousands of dollars a year on their prescriptions     Yet all we hear from the Bush Administration is that Canadian drugs are unsafe and imports should be prohibited  That s nonsense  What the Administration s really saying is that imports from Canada are unsafe for drug industry profits  even though they re entirely safe for patients  health     It s time for Congress to step in and allow imports from Canada   and from other developed countries too  Neither the Administration nor the strong arm tactics of the drug industry should be able to block this obvious benefit for senior citizens and millions of other Americans outraged by the unaffordable costs of the drugs they need     Our bill achieves the goal in a realistic way  Patients will be able to import drugs from firms in Canada who are registered with FDA and regularly inspected by FDA  Wholesalers and pharmacies will be able to import drugs from other developed countries too  if they register with FDA and agree to regular inspections by FDA    The imports will fully meet FDA standards for approval  and will have FDA approved labeling      Equally important  drug companies will be prohibited from retaliating against foreign distributors  as several major companies are now trying to do to shut down the rising tide from Canada  Pharmaceutical industry CEOs can march down to the shore like King Canute and try to command the tides to halt  but Congress should not be their accomplice    The high prices Americans pay today for prescription drugs are unacceptable and unsustainable  Our bipartisan bill is a sensible and practical solution that will bring prices down for patients at no risk to the safety of our drug supply  This legislation could become the first bill that President Bush vetoes  but I suspect he won t  because not enough of our Republican colleagues in Congress would be willing to side with price gouging by the pharmaceutical industry to sustain the veto   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
