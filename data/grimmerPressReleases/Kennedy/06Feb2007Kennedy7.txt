         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  last night  the Republicans said no to an honest debate about what is best for our troops in Iraq  our national security and for the American people  Our men and women in uniform have done everything we have asked them to do  and they have served with dignity  honor  and valor  The cost  in blood and treasure  has been staggering More than 3 000 Americans have been killed so far  including 64 from Massachusetts and more than 23 000 have been wounded Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed  and millions have fled their homes or even their country We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on the war already  and today the President is asking for hundreds of billions more  President Bush insists on his policy of escalation when most of us in Congress are increasingly convinced that de escalation is the only realistic strategy  The American people do not support further escalation of this war  The legislation on which we seek an honest debate is intended to make a record of who is on the side of the American people and opposes sending tens of thousands more American troops into this civil war  Despite the clear result of the November election  our Republican colleagues are not prepared to face the truth on Iraq  They are determined to avoid a debate on the most important national security issue of our time  The Republicans care more about protecting the President than protecting our troops  Theyre willing to allow tens of thousands more of our young men and women to be dropped into the cauldron of civil war The cost in precious American lives is reason enough to end this mistaken and misguided war  But the cost here at home came into full view yesterday as we received the Presidents budget  The Presidents budget devotes more than  200 billion to the war in Iraq  Where does that money come from It comes from childrens health as the Presidents budget under funds the CHIP program by  8 billion  That program provides health care to low income children It comes from our childrens education because his budget under funds the No Child Left Behind reforms by almost  15 billion It comes from our seniors and our disabled citizens  The Presidents budget cuts  66 billion from Medicare  which is a lifeline to millions of retirees and disabled Americans It comes from our workers who are looking for good jobs to support their families  because the Presidents budget slashes  1 billion from programs that train Americans for jobs and give them a better future It comes from the poor who are struggling against the bitter cold  as it cuts 17 percent of the funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps low income families afford to heat their homes This is a war that never should have happened  It is a war that should be brought to an end  Yet this Administration is allowing it to go on and on and on with mistake after mistake after mistake  This terrible war is having an effect not only on our troops  who are paying the highest price  but on our children  our elderly  our schools  our workers and the poor here at home While the President forges ahead with a surge in Iraq  the American people need a surge here at home  Americans see the cost of health care and the cost of college going up  What about a surge in our health and education policies to meet their needs Americans here at home worry about their economic security  about their jobs and stagnant wages and how they can support their families  How about a surge here at home to meet their needs Last week  we met with our nations mayors  They described the problem of school dropouts and how they are turning to crime in our communities  Where is the surge to address that problem No wonder the American people are growing angrier and angrier as the war rages on  They expect Congress to be an effective restraint on the President and his abuse of the war power  Opposition to the escalation is clear already  How much clearer does it have to be  before Republicans in Congress and the President finally respond to the voices of the American people  When will this war be brought to an end To make matters worse  we now discover that the President hasnt been straightforward about the level of troops hes sending for the escalation  The President specifically said hes committed a little over 20 000 more troops  but as we now learn  that number hides the full story According to a report by the Congressional Budget Office last week  the practice of the Pentagon is to deploy additional support troops when additional combat troops are sent  In fact  CBO estimates that a more accurate total for the surge  when support personnel are included  is in the realm of 35 000 to 48 000 troops  much much larger than the President led us to believe A press release by the Department of Defense the day after the President announced his surge  stated only that other combat support and combat service support units may also be deployed as necessary once new requirements are assessed Clearly  there is the Presidents surge  and then there is the secret surge he doesnt want to talk about  The American people are tired of these games  tired of the smoke and mirrors  tired of all the deception and misrepresentation  Either the President is distorting the facts to low ball the number of troops required  or he is sending our soldiers into Iraqs civil war without adequate support personnel  And now we learn from the San Francisco Chronicle on Sunday that our troops are being sent to Iraq undertrained  underarmed and under prepared  The Administrations policies and the escalation by the White House have forced the Pentagon to cut corners in rushing more troops into battle According to the Chronicle  the 3rd Infantry Division had so little time between deployments to Iraq they had to cram more than a years worth of training into four months Some soldiers were assigned to the unit so late they had only two weeks training in Kuwait before being sent into Iraq In addition  the Chronicle reports  the Defense Departments Inspector General found that our troops still lack the armored vehicles and weapons they need to protect themselves Mr  President  this is wrong  An escalation now would be an immense new mistake  compounding the original misguided decision to invade Iraq  Public support for the war does not exist  There is no support for this escalation We have surged our forces four times in the past  and each time the situation hasnt changed  In April 2004  more than 15 000 troops were sent to Iraq to try to stop Maqtada al Sadrs uprising in Najaf  We lost 135 soldiers during that month long operation but Sadr and his militia were not stopped  Today  theyre more powerful than ever In November 2004  we sent 12 000 troops to stop the insurgents in Fallujah  We lost 137 Americans in that assaultmore than in any other month of the warand Fallujah was not stabilized In September 2005  we sent 22 000 more soldiers to provide security for referendum and the elections in Iraq  There was calm for the election days  but it had no long term effect on the violence  and 300 more of our soldiers died In 2006  after the bombing of the mosque in Samara  we sent more than 12 000 troops to stabilize Baghdad  It obviously didnt work  and 347 more Americans died  General Abizaid doesnt support this escalation  He told the Senate Armed Services Committee last November  More American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more  from taking more responsibility for their own future  He said  Ive met with every divisional commander  General Casey  the corps commander  General Dempsey  we all talked together  And I said  In your professional opinion  if we were to bring in more American troops now  does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq  And they all said no  And the reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more General James Conway  Commandant of the Marine Corps  doesnt support it  He said  We do not believe that just adding numbers for the sake of adding numbers  just thickening the mix  is necessarily the way to go Secretary Powell said that he is not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence  this civil war  will work General Barry McCaffrey  former Vice Chief of Staff for the United States Army  thinks it wont work  He said  Putting another 20 000 to 30 000 troops  particularly into urban combat in a city of seven million Arabs of Baghdad  is a fools errand  It is sticking your finger in the water  When you pull your finger out  their presence will not have made a difference General Hoar  former head of CENTCOM  told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month The addition of 21 000 troops is too little and too late  This is still not enough to quell the violence  and without major changes in the command and control of forces within Baghdad  the current set up for shared control is unsatisfactory Even General Casey proposed a different strategy  but the White House overruled him The President cannot continue to unilaterally impose his failing policy on an America that has already rejected it  Congress has a constitutional responsibility to stop the President from sending more of our sons and daughters to die in this civil war  This legislation is our effort to meet that responsibility  It is our chance to go on record in opposition to the surge  Its a clarion call for change  Last week  the new National Intelligence Estimate confirmed the nightmare scenario unfolding for our troops in Iraq  The country is sliding deeper into the abyss of civil war and our brave men and women are caught in the middle of it  Prospects for halting the escalating sectarian violence are bleak  Greater chaos and anarchy are looming and needless additional U S  casualties are inevitable Its abundantly clear that what we need is not a troop surge  but a diplomatic surge  working with other countries in the region  Sending more U S  troops into Iraqs civil war is not the solution to Iraqs political problems  Not only does President Bush fail to see that reality  but also hes going out of his way to deny and defy it  Congress needs to express its opposition to this strategy  If the President refuses to change course  we must act to change it ourselves  protect our troops  and end this misguided war The war today is not the war that Congress authorized four years ago  Now  its a civil war  Sectarian violence is rising  Militias commit unspeakable acts of violence and torture  Ethnic cleansing is a fact of daily life  Millions of Iraqis are fleeing the violence and leaving their country  The war today is not about Saddams weapons of mass destruction or his alleged relationship with Al Qaeda  Its Iraqi against Iraqi  Iraq is at war with itself  and American soldiers are caught in the middle I have introduced legislation which would require the President to get the authority he needs from Congress before moving forward with a further escalation in Iraq  and I still intend to seek a vote on it unless the President changes course  This debate is about what is best for our troops and our national security  Our forces have served with great valor  Theyve done everything theyve been asked to do  Sending more of them into a civil war will not make success any more likely  We have a responsibility to vote on this issue now  before it is too late  The American people deserve to know where Senate Republicans stand  It is bad enough that the Senate Republicans failed for five long years to hold this President accountable  They should not deprive the majority of this Senate  and the overwhelming majority of Americans  the chance to put the President on notice and call on him not to send even more of our forces into the middle of this civil war in Iraq   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
