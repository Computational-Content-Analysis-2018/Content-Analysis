         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   It s no wonder that polls these days show public support for the Republican Senate is in the ditch  Instead of dealing with the real challenges facing the nation  the Republican Leadership insists on pandering to its far right wing by this misguided proposal to deny some members of our society the right to marry and receive the same benefits and protections that married couples now have This so called Federal Marriage Amendment should really be called the Republican Right Wing Anti Marriage Amendment  A vote for it is a vote against civil unions  domestic partnerships  and other efforts by states to treat gays and lesbians fairly under the law  It s a vote to impose discrimination on all 50 states  and deny them their right to interpret their own state constitutions and state laws  A vote for this amendment is a vote for bigotry    pure and simple  It makes no sense for the first time in our history  to amend the Constitution by writing discrimination back into it The proposed Amendment is inconsistent with our basic values  The Constitution is the foundation of our democracy and the enduring principles of our nation  We ve amended the Constitution only seventeen times since the adoption of the Bill of Rights  Aside from the Amendment on Prohibition  which was quickly recognized as a mistake and repealed thirteen years later  the Constitution has only been amended to expand and protect people s rights  not to take away or restrict those rights Across the country  more and more children have same sex parents  It is wrong for Congress to add another burden to these families struggling to live their lives and take care of each other  Citizens in this country believe in tearing down the walls of discrimination  We should be expanding protections  not creating new barriers for civil rights Gay and lesbian couples deserve the same rights as married couples under state law  including the right to be treated fairly by the tax laws  to share insurance coverage  to visit loved ones in the hospital  and to have health benefits  family leave benefits  and the many other benefits that automatically flow from marriage  In fact  there are more than a thousand federal rights and benefits based on marriage and all families deserve equality Clearly  there is no need to amend the U S  Constitution on this issue  Each state should be allowed to decide the issue for itself  Marriage and other issues of family law have always been matters of state sovereignty For two centuries  laws on marriage have been for each state to resolve  and are solidly rooted in the enduring principles of federalism  The states are already engaged in vigorous debates about the issue  Across the country  Alabama  South Carolina  South Dakota  Tennessee  Virginia and Wisconsin are all holding statewide referendums on constitutional amendments to ban same sex marriage this year The American Bar Association opposes this Senate Amendment  As the ABA has clearly stated  Congress should not rush to judgment and use the constitutional amendment process to impose on the states a rigid viewpoint regarding a controversial issue of great consequence to this nation Marriage is a solemn commitment to plan a future together  to share in life s celebrations  to be a source of comfort to ease life s burdens and pains  These are real families with real life struggles  and the Senate should reject any effort to undermine the progress we ve made I m proud that Massachusetts continues to be a leader on marriage equality for our citizens  We recognize that being part of a family is a basic right  and I look forward to the day when every state accepts this basic principle of fairness In upholding same sex marriage  our Supreme Judicial Court interpreted the Massachusetts Constitution  not the U S  Constitution  Nearly 7 000 same sex couples have married in the state in the past two years  Those who oppose gay marriage and disagree with what happened in Massachusetts have a First Amendment right to express their views  But there s no justification for undermining the separation of church and state in our society  or to write discrimination into the U S  Constitution Supporters of the amendment claim that religious freedom is somehow under attack  But no court  no state  no Congress can tell any church or religious group how to conduct its affairs  The separation of church and state under the First Amendment is not affected in any way by what Massachusetts and other states are doing The law of each state is what determines the legal and civil effects of marriages and civil unions  The law of each church is what determines the religious aspects of a sacramental marriage  No church in Massachusetts has been required to do anything it doesn t wish to do  The true threat to religious freedom is this Anti Marriage Amendment itself    it tells churches that they cannot recognize a same sex marriage  even though many churches are now choosing to do so The Senate should be addressing the real problems facing our country  Instead of writing bigotry and prejudice into the Constitution  we should be dealing with the issues of war and peace  jobs and the economy  the crisis over energy  and the many other priorities facing the country  It s wrong for the Republican leadership to try to write its agenda of hate into the Constitution  I urge the committee to oppose this disgraceful and unseemly amendment   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
