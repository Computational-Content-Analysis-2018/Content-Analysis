         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I want to correct the record about a very important issue    Yesterday  Vice President Cheney said elected officials had access to the intelligence  and were free to draw their own conclusions  He said  They arrived at the same judgment about Iraq s capabilities and intentions that was made by this Administration and by the previous Administration    What world is Dick Cheney living in  No one seriously believes what the Vice President is saying  Once again  he s deliberately deceiving the American people  It s a calculated  partisan  political  prevarication     President Bush and Vice President Cheney have begun a new campaign of distortion and manipulation  Because the polls show that Americans have lost trust in the president and believe he manipulated intelligence before the war  the President and Vice President have abandoned any pretense of leading this country and have gone back on the campaign trail    But this time  the country won t buy it    Not only can the President and Vice President not find weapons of mass destruction  they can t find the truth either    The Administration broke the essential bond of trust that has to exist between the White House and the American people  They have to be able to trust that we will be told the truth  especially on the all important issues of war and peace     The Congress did not have access to the intelligence that the President and Vice President had   It s plain wrong    The Administration s drumbeat for war began in the summer of 2002  but it did not provide an Intelligence Estimate     the collective wisdom of the intelligence community    to back up its claims about Al Qaeda and nuclear weapons and immediate threats until Democrats on the Intelligence Committee demanded it     Even then  the Administration did not provide the intelligence estimate until October 1  2002    just two days before the debate on the resolution authorizing war began  The vote on the resolution occurred just one week later  on October 11     Beyond the NIE  the suggestion that the Congress has access to the same classified material as the President is preposterous  The President receives a Presidential Daily Brief and a briefing every morning with top intelligence officials  The White House has access to memos with intelligence information that the Congress never sees  It is abundantly clear that the Administration is engaged in nothing more than a devious attempt to obscure the facts and take the focus off the real reason we went to war in Iraq  No matter what the Vice President says  150 000 American troops are bogged down in a quagmire in Iraq because the Bush Administration misrepresented and distorted the intelligence to justify a war that America never should have fought     In his march to war  President Bush exaggerated the threat to the American people  It was not subtle  It was not nuanced  It was pure  unadulterated fear mongering  based on a devious strategy to convince the American people that Saddam s ability to provide nuclear weapons to Al Qaeda justified immediate war     In a speech on August 26  2002  to the Veterans of Foreign Wars  the Vice President asserted  We now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weaponsMany of us are convinced that Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon  As we now know  the intelligence community was far from certain  Yet the Vice President had been convinced     On September 8  2002  the Vice President was even more emphatic about Saddam  He said   We  do know  with absolute certainty  that he is using his procurement system to acquire the equipment he needs in order to enrich uranium to build a nuclear weapon  The intelligence community was deeply divided about the aluminum tubes  but Vice President Cheney was absolutely certain     The Intelligence Estimate did not find a cooperative relationship between Saddam and Al Qaeda  On the contrary  it stated only that such a relationship might develop in the future if Saddam was sufficiently desperate    in other words  if America went to war  But the estimate placed low confidence that  even in desperation  Saddam would give weapons of mass destruction to Al Qaeda     But President Bush was not deterred  He was relentless in playing to America s fears after the devastating tragedy of 9 11  He drew a clear link    and drew it repeatedly    between Al Qaeda and Saddam     On September 25  2002  at the White House  President Bush flatly declared  You can t distinguish between Al Qaeda and Saddam when you talk about the war on terror    In his State of the Union Address in January 2003  President Bush said  Evidence from intelligence sources  secret communications  and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists  including members of Al Qaeda  and that he could provide lethal viruses to a shadowy terrorist network     Two weeks later  in his Saturday radio address to the nation  a month before the war began  President Bush described the ties in detail  saying  Saddam Hussein has longstanding  direct and continuing ties to terrorist networks     He said  Senior members of Iraqi intelligence and Al Qaeda have met at least eight times since the early 1990s  Iraq has sent bomb making and document forgery experts to work with Al Qaeda  Iraq has also provided Al Qaeda with chemical and biological weapons training  An Al Qaeda operative was sent to Iraq several times in the late 1990s for help in acquiring poisons and gases  We also know that Iraq is harboring a terrorist network headed by a senior Al Qaeda terrorist planner  This network runs a poison and explosive training camp in northeast Iraq  and many of its leaders are known to be in Baghdad    In fact  the 9 11 Commission Report stated clearly that there was no operational connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda  That fact should have been abundantly clear to the President  Iraq and Al Qaeda had diametrically opposing views of the world     The Pentagons favorite Iraqi dissident  Ahmed Chalabi  is actually proud of what happened  We are heroes in error  Chalabi said in February 2004  As far as we re concerned  we ve been entirely successful  That tyrant Saddam is gone and the Americans are in Baghdad  What was said before is not important  The Bush Administration is looking for a scapegoat  We re ready to fall on our swords  if he wants    What was said before by Administration officials does matter  The President s words matter  The Vice President s words matter  So do those of the Secretary of State  the Secretary of Defense and other high officials in the Administration  And they did not square with the facts     The Intelligence Committee agreed to investigate the clear discrepancies  and it s important that they get to the bottom of this  and find out how and why President Bush took America to war in Iraq  Americans are dying  Already more than 2000 have been killed  and more than 15 000 have been wounded     The American people deserve the truth  It s time for the President to stop passing the buck and for him to be held accountable     It s time for a change in this country   Something s got to give    A tarnished White House and a damaged presidency is pulling America backwards      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner
