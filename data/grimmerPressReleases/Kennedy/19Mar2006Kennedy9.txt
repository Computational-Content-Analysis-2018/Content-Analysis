         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C     Today  on CBSs Face the Nation  Bob Schieffer asked Vice President Cheney to respond to Senator Kennedys statement that the Administration has been dangerously incompetent and its policy in Iraq is not worthy of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform    The Vice President used his usual line of personal attacks by claiming that what Senator Kennedy reflects is sort of the pre 9 11mentality    He contended that his past assertions that Americans would be greeted as liberators and that the insurgency was in its last throes were basically accurate and reflect reality    Senator Kennedy was the first senator to outline a comprehensive argument against the war and has consistently challenged the Administrations policies  Today  Vice President Cheney said that Ted Kennedy has been wrong from the beginning    In response  Senator Kennedy said   Vice President Cheney has been consistently wrong about the war in Iraq   Hes called the shots on a dangerously incompetent strategy  He was wrong about the link between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein   He was wrong about Saddam Husseins weapons of mass destruction   He was wrong about America being greeted as liberators   He was wrong about the insurgency being in its last throes   Now he rejects the idea of civil war   The American people understand the clear lessons of 9 11  Al Qaeda is the greatest threat to our national security   The war in Iraq has increased support for Al Qaeda and made America more hated in the world   America is less safe because the Bush Administration lost its focus and waged a war in Iraq we never should have fought Below is a fact sheet on what Vice President Cheney has asserted in the past and a transcript of the exchange today on CBS  Cheney  Wrong on IraqLink between Iraq and Al QaedaWe know that he  Saddam Hussein  has a long standing relationship with various terrorist groups  including the al Qaeda organization  Meet the Press  March 16  2003Weapons of Mass DestructionBut we now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons  Among other sources  we ve gotten this from the firsthand testimony of defectors    including Saddam s own son in law  who was subsequently murdered at Saddam s direction  Many of us are convinced that Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon  Veterans of Foreign Wars  August 26 2002U S  will be greeted as LiberatorsWell  I dont think its likely to unfold that way  Tim  because I really do believe that we will be greeted as liberators   There is no question but what they want to the get rid of Saddam Hussein and they will welcome as liberators the United States when we come to do that  Meet the Press  March 16  2003Last ThroesThe level of activity that we see today from a military standpoint  I think  will clearly decline  I think they re in the last throes  if you will  of the insurgency  Larry King Live  May 30  2005 Transcript  FACE THE NATION  March 19  2006   SCHIEFFER   Let me read to you what Senator Kennedy  a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts and a long time opponent of the war  said on the third anniversary         Here s part of his statement   He said  It is clearer than ever that Iraq was a war we never should have fought    The administration has been dangerously incompetent  and its Iraq policy is not worthy of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform   Yet  President Bush continues to see the war through the same rose colored glasses he s always used   He assures the American people we are winning while Iraq s future and the lives of our troops hang so perilously on the precipice of a new disaster         Dangerously incompetent is what he is saying   I want to give you a chance to respond         CHENEY   Well  I would not look to Ted Kennedy for guidance and leadership on how we ought to manage national security  Bob         I think what Senator Kennedy reflects is sort of the pre 9 11 mentality about how we ought to deal with the world and that part of the world         We used to operate on the assumption before 9 11 that criminal attack was    a terrorist was a criminal act  a law enforcement problem         We were hit repeatedly in the  90s and never responded effectively         And the terrorists came to believe not only could they strike us with impunity  but if they hit us hard enough they could change our policy  because they did in Beirut in 1983 or Mogadishu in 1993         We changed all that on 9 11   After they hit us and killed 3 000 of our people here at home we said enough is enough   We re going to aggressively go after them   We ll go after the terrorists wherever we find them   We ll go after those states that sponsor terror   We ll go after people who can provide them with weapons of mass destruction         We ll use our intelligence and our military services very aggressively   And we have   We did it in Afghanistan  we ve done it in Pakistan  we re working with the Paks  we captured or killed hundred of Al Qaida   We ve done it in Saudi Arabia  and obviously we re doing it now in Iraq         That kind of aggressive  forward leaning strategy is one of the main reasons we haven t been struck again since 9 11 because we ve taken the fight to them         Senator Kennedy s approach would be pack your bags and go home  retreat behind your oceans and assume you can be safe         But we learned on 9 11 that in fact what s going on 10 000 miles away in a place like Afghanistan or Iraq can have a direct impact here in the United States when we lost 3 000 people that morning         And we know now that the biggest threat that we face of all is isn t just another 9 11  it s a 9 11 where the terrorists have something like nuclear weapons or a deadly biological agent to use against us          The Iraq situation has to be viewed within the broader context of the global war on terror   It is a global conflict         You can t look just at Iraq and make decisions there with respect to how that is going to come out without having major consequences for everything that s going on         And I think we are going to succeed in Iraq   I think the evidence is overwhelming   I think Ted Kennedy has been wrong from the very beginning   He s the last man I d go to for guidance in terms of how we should conduct U S  national security policy       Laura Capps Melissa  Wagoner 202 224 2633
