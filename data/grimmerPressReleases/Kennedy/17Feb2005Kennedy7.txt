         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Thank you  Mr  Chairman  I commend you for calling this hearing on the pricing of prescription drugs  Drug prices in America have been rising consistently at 2 to 3 times the rate of inflation  For patients across America  the high cost of prescription drugs means skipping doses or cutting pills in half  or doing without them altogether  It means higher health insurance premiums and higher copayments for citizens  and greater pressure on businesses to reduce or cancel insurance coverage for employees    These seniors  problems are compounded for firms struggling to compete in the global economy  Foreign patients pay fair prices for prescription drugs  while Americans pay prices that are typically twice as high even for drugs made by U S  companies in the United States  American patients face a double whammy  They pay prices that support the exorbitant profits of the pharmaceutical industry  and they bear a disproportionate share of the burden of research that benefits the whole world    In responding to these issues  the Commerce Department has produced a report that reads as if it were written by the drug industry s public relations department  Far from suggesting ways to bring down the cost of drugs to American consumers or provide fairer financing of pharmaceutical research  the report uncritically parrots the pharmaceutical industry line that the higher the price of drugs  the better off patients are  In the Bush Administration s view  drug companies won t invest in research on new drugs unless each investment promises a pot of gold  According to the Commerce Department  the problem isn t that Americans pay too much  it s that Europeans and Canadians pay too little    It s time to recognize that year in and year out  the drug industry is among the most profitable industries in America if the not the most profitable  If the drug companies don t invest in research to create new drugs  they may have no future profits at all  The best drug in the world is useless if patients can t afford to buy it     Patients across America need drugs they can afford  Businesses need affordable drugs for their employees and retirees  Businesses across Massachusetts need the same  It s true in Massachusetts and true in every other state    That s why Senators Dorgan  Snowe  Grassley  McCain  Jeffords  Clinton  Bingaman  and I introduced a bill last week to allow patients across America to buy safe drugs at the fair prices that Canadians and Europeans pay  not the exorbitant prices they have to pay in the United States  I look forward to quick action by Congress to get this done for the American people    I welcome Undersecretary Aldonas and our other witnesses today  and I look forward to their testimony           Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
