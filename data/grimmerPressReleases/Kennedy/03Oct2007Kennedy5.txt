         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to several recent decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board      The NLRB under this Administration is apparently bent on continuing its highly politicized anti worker decisions that overturn long established precedents and undermine basic rights of employees across the country  The Dana Corporation decision is particularly troubling  By reinterpreting the law to discourage voluntary recognition of unions  the Board is creating needless additional conflict and confusion in the workplace and further silencing the voice of the American worker  Action by Congress is obviously needed to restore the intent of the law and protect workers freedom to choose a union  The long respected National Labor Relations Board cant be allowed to become a National Labor Resistance Board           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
