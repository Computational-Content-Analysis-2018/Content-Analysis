         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Summary of bill belowIn this week of great tragedy and sorrow for our nation  it is difficult to turn our attention to anything other than the unbearable grief of the families who have lost loved ones in the shootings at Virginia Tech  Our hearts and prayers continue to go out to them  even as we turn our attention to other issues Today  our committee considers legislation that affects every American family B the safety of the drugs we take and the medical devices that improve lives and alleviate suffering  Every day  families across America rely on the Food and Drug Administration in ways they may not realize  When they put dinner on the table  they are counting on FDA to see that it is free from contamination  When they care for a sick child  they are trusting FDA to make sure the drugs prescribed are safe and effective  From pacemakers to anti cancer pills to the foods we eat  FDA protects the health of hundreds of millions of Americans  It oversees products that account for a quarter of the US economy  and it does all this on a budget that amounts to less than two cents a day for each citizen An agency that does so much so well deserves to be supported and strengthened  Yet too often  the opposite has been true  FDA s vital mission has been jeopardized by inadequate resources  inadequate legal authority  and absent leadership  Congress has begun to take steps to correct these serious problems  but much more work lies ahead Last year  the Senate approved a new leader for FDA  which had been left without a full Commissioner for more than four of the last six years Effective leadership is essential  but it is not enough  FDA must also have the resources to keep up with the growing complexity of the scientific decisions it makes  Our legislation renews two basic programs at FDA  the user fee program for drugs and the similar program for medical devices  All of us would prefer that FDA rely less on user fees and more on appropriated funds  and legitimate questions have been raised about the agency s need for these programs  But if adequate funding is not supplied by Congress  the user fees are essential for effective and timely reviews of drugs and devices Our legislation makes important changes in the user fee program  authorizing the fees to be devoted to drug safety needs  such as improved surveillance and the review of advertising  Additional resources will help FDA make decisions based on the best available science  But the agency also needs new authority to implement those decisions  The confidence of millions of Americans in the drugs they take was shaken when the pain medicine Vioxx was withdrawn because of its serious side effects  It became clear that FDA s ability to protect the public was hamstrung by weak legal authority that kept it from taking swift and effective action  Inaction by Congress is no longer an option Today  the committee is considering common sense bipartisan reforms to give FDA the authority it needs to protect public health and to expedite the delivery of safe and effective new drugs and medical devices to the patients who need them The legislation before us also includes important provisions to encourage the testing of medicines for children  so that they too may reap the benefits of this new century of the life sciences  Were grateful for the leadership and vision of our colleagues on the committee  Senator Dodd  Senator Alexander  and Senator Clinton for these important measures that will do so much to improve the lives and enhance the health of the nation s children The legislation is based on the drug safety legislation that Senator Enzi and I introduced earlier this year  with important improvements suggested by members of our committee during the discussions that preceded the markup  The bill establishes a new way to oversee drug safety that is flexible enough to be tailored to each new drug  yet strong enough to allow decisive action when problems are discovered  When needed  a new drug may be approved under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy  For drugs with little risk  the strategy might not be required  or it might be as simple as a request to report side effects and a label with safety information  as are currently required for all drugs  For drugs that raise major potential safety concerns  the strategy might require additional clinical trials  a program to train physicians in using the drug safely  or even limits on advertising to the public  We have strengthened the structure by including proposals to encourage the use of electronic databases to detect potential safety problems early  so that FDA can take timely actionsuch as through notice to doctors  warnings on the label  or additional studies to assess the risk A second major element of our legislation is a public registry of clinical trials and their results  A central clearinghouse for this information will help patients  providers and researchers learn more about particular drugs and diseases and make better health care decisions  The public will know about each trial underway be able to review its results  and patients will know about clinical trials in which they wish to participate  Our bill recognizes that innovation is the key to medical progress by establishing a new center  the Reagan Udall Institute for Applied Biomedical Research  to develop new methods to accelerate research for medical breakthroughs Finally  the bill helps preserve the integrity of scientific review by strengthening FDAs safeguards against conflicts of interest on its scientific advisory committees In this new era of the life sciences  medical advances will continue to bring immense benefits for our citizens  To fulfill the potential of that bright future  we need brilliant researchers to develop the drugs of tomorrow  and also strong and vigilant watchdogs for public health to guarantee that new drugs and medical devices coming into use are safe and beneficial  and actually reach the patients who urgently need them  Congress has ample power to restore the luster that FDA has lost in recent years  The legislation we propose represents a bipartisan consensus on the way to get the job done The Food and Drug Administration Revitalization ActTitle IPrescription Drug User FeesTitle I codifies the user fee agreement reached by drug and biotech industries with the FDA  It establishes an overall amount for user fees of nearly  393 million for 2008  which will be adjusted upward based on 2007 workload   It includes the expansion of use of drug user fees by nearly  30 million for post approval drug safety programs Title I also includes the FDA industry proposal to provide for a voluntary user fee program under which drug companies can submit direct to consumer television advertisements to the agency for review before they are distributed Title IIDrug SafetySubtitle ARisk Evaluation and Mitigation StrategiesA system of routine active surveillance for post market drug safety will be established through a public private partnership  The partnership will aggregate data from Federal and private health databases and support the analysis of utilization and safety data from these databases  Active surveillance will occur for every newly approved drug Using a risk based approach  drugs and biologics may be approved with risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  REMS   The REMS will be tailored to fit the safety profile of the drug in question  For drugs with new chemical entities  the REMS will be reviewed at 18 months and three years  For other drugs  review will occur at three years  although for all drugs  FDA has the authority to require a review if there are public health reasons to do so  The mark requires that personnel from offices for drug safety are integrated into the drug review process Minimal Elements of a REMS  FDA approved professional labeling  A timetable for periodic assessment of the REMS Additional Elements of a REMS      For drugs with out of the ordinary risks  the REMS may include additional elements to protect patient safety  such as  Special training for doctors who prescribe the drug  Additional studies conducted after approval Compliance  Civil money penalties for violation of any component of a REMS Resources  Increased drug user fees would be used to review REMS and for FDAs general drug safety surveillance  This subtitle increases user fee revenue by  50 million from the agreement between industry and the FDA to fund drug safety activities and authorizes  30 million for the routine surveillance of drugs once marketed IMPROVING THE SCIENTIFIC ENVIRONMENT AT FDATransparency    The mark includes important measures to promote transparency  such as posting of the action package for approval for drugs  including scientific commentaries   as well as requiring notice of the actions of the Drug Safety Oversight Board  and a report on the involvement of safety staff in drug review activities at FDA  Improving Science    The bill includes additional measures to improve science at FDA  including the establishment of an Office of the Chief Scientist  and putting in statute a required consultation with the Drug Safety and Risk Management committee on priority drug safety questions and on the effectiveness of aspects of the REMS process Subtitle BReagan Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug AdministrationSubtitle B establishes a foundation to lead collaborations amongst the FDA  academic research institutions  and industry directed to improving the process of drug development and evaluation  Collaborative research projects will be selected that are designed to bolster R  D productivity  provide new tools for improving safety in drug evaluation  and in the long term make drug development more predictable and manageable  This institute will be financially supported by both industry and the government Subtitle CClinical TrialsClinical Trials Registry  To enhance patient enrollment and provide a mechanism to track subsequent progress of trials  clinical trials of late Phase II  Phase III and Phase IV would be required to register in a publicly available database  Certain basic pieces of information would be placed in fields in the database entry  while the bulk of the information would be in summary documents Clinical Trials Results  To ensure that results of trials are made public  and that patients and providers have the most up to date information  publicly available information  including the FDAs action package on a drug  will be deposited in a publicly available database  Device clinical trials to support FDA approval or clearance are also included  as well as pediatric postmarket surveillance  FDA will be given regulatory authority to require inclusion of results for trials not covered by publicly available information  Civil monetary penalties will enforce these requirements Subtitle DConflicts of Interest Subtitle D requires pre disclosure of conflicts of interest of advisory committee members  and greater efforts by FDA to identify non conflicted members Title IIIMedical Device User FeesThe legislation included in this section implements the agreement between the Food and Drug Administration and the medical device industry groups  The legislation reflects the notice published in the Federal Registry  Congress was provided this legislation less than 24 hours prior to the required Committee deadline for filling  The Committee will continue reviewing this proposed legislation  Congressional changes  as required  will be incorporated prior to the floor Title IV  Pediatric Medical ProductsSubtitle A  Best Pharmaceuticals for ChildrenSubtitle A would reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and improve its provisions in order to make it more effective at ensuring that drugs for children are safe for pediatric populations BPCA provides increased market exclusivity to drug manufactures to encourage the determination of safety and efficacy of drugs in pediatric populations  The bill contains a three month cap on exclusivity if the annual U S  sales of the drug exceed  1 billion when the written request for pediatric studies is accepted by the drug manufacturer  Products earning less than  1 billion continue to receive six months of exclusivity The bill is a five authorization and will expire in 2012 Subtitle B  Pediatric Research ImprovementSubtitle B would reauthorize the Pediatric Research Equity Act and improve its provisions in order to make it more effective at ensuring that drugs for children are safe for pediatric populations  In order to improve coordination with the pediatric exclusivity provisions of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act  BPCA   PRIA would expand an internal FDA committee to review all issues of pediatric related labeling and assessments  Doing so ensures that a drug under PRIA or BPCA is reviewed by experts with pediatric expertise If a company chooses not to pursue pediatric exclusivity for an already marketed  drug under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act  the Secretary has the authority to require the submission of pediatric data for such drug  This authority has never been utilized  in part due to the lengthy administrative process required to invoke such authority  PRIA would streamline this administrative process and help get essential pediatric data for important drugs  while preserving the ability of companies to meet and discuss testing with the agency  It would also expand the ability of the Secretary to use this authority in cases where such data would represent a benefit to a large number of children  or help us to learn more about risks associated with certain drugs The bill would require two reports  one from the Institute of Medicine and one from the GAO  that would allow us to have better data on the number and ways in which the pediatric rule is used  and evaluate its contributions to ensuring overall pediatric drug safety Subtitle C   Pediatric Medical DevicesSubtitle C modifies the existing humanitarian device exemption  HDE  for medical devices to allow profit for HDE approved devices specifically designed to meet a pediatric need  Maintains existing requirement that a humanitarian use device is limited to one that treats and diagnoses diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 4 000 individuals in the U S  per year  No profit will be allowed for a device used in more than 4 000 individuals  The HDE exemption expansion sunsets in 2013 and a GAO report assessing the HDE exemption expansion and its impact on patients and manufacturers is required The bill establishes a mechanism to allow FDA to track the number and types of devices approved specifically for children or for conditions that occur in children  as well as the approval times for premarket applications and HDEs  NIH will be required to designate a contact point or office to help innovators and physicians access existing funding for pediatric medical device development and directs NIH  FDA  and AHRQ to submit a plan for pediatric medical device research that identifies gaps and proposes a research agenda for addressing them Demonstration grants will be established for non profit consortia to promote pediatric device development  including matchmaking between inventors and manufacturers and connecting innovators and physicians to existing Federal resources  including FDA  NIH  the Small Business Administration  VA and others  The bill grants explicit authority to the FDAs Pediatric Advisory Committee to monitor pediatric devices and make recommendations for improving their availability and safety This approach incorporates several recommendations of the Institute of Medicine including improving the postmarket surveillance of medical devices used in children       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
