         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     As this bill now moves to conference with the House  I strongly urge our Senate conferees to reject an unfortunate amendment adopted by the House prohibiting the allocation of any funds for the District of Columbia to enforce its firearms registration law and its requirement for D C  residents to keep their firearms unloaded and disassembled  or bound by a trigger lock  In effect  the House amendment would repeal the D C  Government s longstanding ban on firearms and would be a disastrous blow to gun safety in the District  For almost three decades  D C  s ban on handguns and assault weapons bans have helped reduce the risk of deadly handgun violence  City residents and public officials overwhelmingly support the ban  and the courts have upheld it  Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton  Mayor Anthony Williams  and Police Chief Charles Ramsey all strongly oppose the House amendment     Mayor Williams has called this effort to repeal the city s gun ban a slap in the face  Chief Ramsey has said that a repeal of DC s gun ban would have a scary impact  Without question  more guns mean more violence  More than half of the robberies and twenty percent of the aggravated assaults in the city are committed with a firearm  In 2004  nearly eighty percent of District homicides were committed with firearms  The youngest victim was only seven years old     It is difficult to understand how weaker gun safety laws will make residents and visitors safer  This effort by Congress to prevent the enforcement of the D C  gun laws will only serve to increase the number of homicides  suicides and accidental shootings  Greater availability of firearms will make it more likely that deadly handgun violence will erupt in public buildings  offices  and public spaces  Over 20 million visitors come to Washington each year  and this amendment puts the safety of all of them at needless risk     The amendment is also an attack upon the well established principle of home rule for the District  It tramples the rights of the city s elected leaders and local residents to govern their homes  streets  neighborhoods  and workplaces  It s an insult to the 600 000 citizens of the District of Columbia     Statistics show that crime prevention is working in the District  Crime decreased 18 percent last year and homicides went down 17 percent  In the first five months of 2005  the Metropolitan Police Department confiscated more than 1 000 firearms on city streets  Only a tiny percentage of recovered firearms are registered in the District  The city continues to face serious concerns about firearms illegally brought into the city from other jurisdictions  and the House amendment would unfairly limit the ability of D C  officials to combat this problem     Congress should respect the public safety efforts of this city s leaders and let the District decide what firearm regulations are best for its citizens  I urge my colleagues to oppose this reckless  special interest amendment that will endanger the safety all who live or work or visit here   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
