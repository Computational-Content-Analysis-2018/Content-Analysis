         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Mr  President  this morning the Iraq Study Group issued a stunning indictment of the Administrations policy toward Iraq   The Study Group has concluded that the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating and that sectarian conflict is the principal challenge to stability The Groups report explicitly rejects the strategy of staying the course     As it states  Current U S  policy is not working  as the level of violence in Iraq is rising and the government is not advancing national reconciliation  Making no changes in policy would simply delay the day of reckoning at a high cost  Nearly 100 Americans are dying every month  Truer words were never spoken  The Study Group calls for new and enhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the region  and a change in the primary mission of U S  forces in Iraq that will enable the United States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq responsibly Significantly  this group of distinguished leaders has called unanimously for change in our military mission of engaging in combat directly to a new mission of supporting the Iraqi Army and beginning to withdraw our combat troops   The report sets a clear goal for achieving this shift in mission and beginning the redeployment of our forces by the first quarter of 2008   The report states clearly that the United States must not make an open ended commitment to keep large numbers of American troops deployed in Iraq  Instead  the report calls for clear commitments from the Iraqi Government on reconciliation  along with clear consequences for our military  political  and economic assistance if the commitments are not met The report also calls for talks that include all of Iraqs neighbors in the region  especially Iran and Syria  and for a new diplomatic initiative to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict  The American people are demanding change in Iraq  Robert Gates  the nominee for Secretary of Defense  has agreed we need change  and now the bipartisan Iraq Study Group has recommended a clear change in the way forward in Iraq   The verdict is in   There can no longer be any doubt that the violence and chaos in Iraq are getting worse  that our current strategy is failing  and that we need to work together on a new strategy that will make it possible for us to bring our troops home  The only question is whether the White House will heed this clarion call and agree to change the perilous course we have been on in Iraq since Saddam Hussein fell and the chaos began  More of the same failed policy that depends on an open ended commitment of our military will not bring America closer to success   It will not stop the violence  It will only continue to undermine our own national security interests  Iraq is the defining issue of our time  and the person who will have a major voice in meeting the enormous responsibility of recommending the new course will be the new leader we are confirming today as the Secretary of Defense The American people are demanding far more than a change of faces at the Pentagon   They are demanding  and they deserve  a comprehensive change in our policy so that we finally have a policy on Iraq that is worthy of the enormous sacrifice  commitment  and valor of our men and women in uniform  Although I voted against the nomination of Robert Gates to head the CIA in 1991  I support his nomination to be Secretary of Defense  because he assured the Committee that he would be an independent thinker and give candid and frank advice to the President about a way forward in Iraq    During the confirmation hearing yesterday  Dr  Gates spoke with candor  a candor that has been sorely missing from the Department of Defense under this Administration   He recognized the high price that our troops are paying for the current policy   He clearly stated that we are not winning in Iraq and that all options for a way forward are on the table  He assured us personally that he would speak candidly  frankly  and boldly to people at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue about what he believes and what he thinks needs to be done   He told us that he is not coming back to Washington to be a bump on a log   He assured us that he will be independent  that he will consider all of the options  and that he is open to dialogue with Iran and Syria  We all hope the Administration will quickly set a new course that will enable our troops to begin to come home    America is aching  aching  for a new policy on Iraq and we now have the greatest opportunity in nearly four years to have one   Our men and women in uniform who have been making the ultimate sacrifice every day in Iraq deserve no less and they deserved it long ago   Im sure that all of us in the Senate look forward to working closely with Dr  Gates on this all important issue in the months and years ahead     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
