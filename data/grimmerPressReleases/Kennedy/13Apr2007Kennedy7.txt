         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C   Today the Department of Labor issued its report on the explosion at the Darby Mine in Kentucky in May 2006 that killed five miners and led to the passage by Congress of the MINER Act   Senator Kennedy said  As this report clearly shows  the tragic deaths at the Darby Mine were preventable  The Darby Mine operator failed to observe basic mine safety practices and violated critical safety standards  Worst of all  they failed to properly train their miners in evacuation procedures and these men needlessly paid the price with their lives   We have seen too many cases of such operator failures leading to miner deaths   If mine operators do not immediately come into full compliance with our laws  more miners lives may be lost      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
