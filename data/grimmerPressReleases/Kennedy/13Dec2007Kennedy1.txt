         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Im pleased that our House and Senate subcommittees have come together today to consider the state of democracy in the American workplace   I commend Senate Subcommittee Chair Patty Murray and House Subcommittee Chair Rob Andrews for holding this hearing   Their strong leadership is making an important difference in the lives of American workers  and I look forward to our continuing work together                  The National Labor Relations Act was enacted as part of FDRs New Deal  at a time of great economic uncertainty and inequality   Our country needed a new direction  and the Act marked the beginning of a new national labor policy to encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining   That Act and their provisions led our nation out of economic desperation and toward a new prosperity                    It was a rising tide that truly did lift all boats   Union membership grew  and unions built Americas strong middle class   From the 1940s to the 1960s  as union membership reached its peak  wages and productivity rose together   Workers shared in corporate gains and our entire society benefited                  That shared prosperity  however  is under attack today  Once again  millions of Americans are suffering from rising economic insecurity and inequality   Union membership has dropped  the middle class has declined  and for millions of families  the American dream is increasingly out of reach           Working men and women have not lost their voice by choice  More than half say they would join a union if they could  which means that 60 million workers want a stronger voice at work    They want to exercise their democratic rights   They want to build a new time of shared economic prosperity        The National Labor Relations Board is supposed to protect the voice of American workers  but the Board is no longer fulfilling that responsibility   Instead of enacting policies that encourage collective bargaining  it seems hostile to the very idea of such bargaining  Each time the Board uses its power to undercut the protections of the law  the nations workers pay the price         In September  the Board issued a series of decisions that tilt the playing field against working people   The Board is taking a result oriented approachand the result is weaker protections for American workers        The Boards decision in Dana Corporation demonstrates this approach   The case attacks the basic principle of majority representation   In a sudden departure from decades of precedent  the Board decided that a minority of workers can overturn the will of the majority  if the majority wants a union   The decision invites the minority to intervene and force a contentious election to undo union recognition  delay bargaining  and obstruct the relationship between workers and management                    As the case clearly shows  the Board clearly believes in the superiority of employer dominated elections to block unions  the result theyre clearly after   In that case  workers wanted a union  but the Board ruled that determining the will of employees from signatures on cards was admittedly inferior to the election process   Yet in another case on the same day  Wurtland Nursing  when workers wanted to get rid of their union  the Board said employees signatures  simply asking for a vote  were objective proof of the employees will to reject the union      The Dana decision suddenly changed the law in order to undercut union organizing   The law has always allowed unions to avoid a management dominated selection process by negotiating voluntary recognition agreements   But overnight  this Labor Board changed all that  allowing a minority of workers to block a union  even if a majority had already said they want the union to represent them        Take the case of Jonathan Upright  a sales consultant with ATT in Winston Salem   Hed been working hard to get a majority of his coworkers to sign cards saying they want a union  and ATT has agreed to recognize the union if he obtained enough cards   Now the Board says those cards arent good enough        Under these new decisions  even after a majority of workers have said they want a union  a minority can force the entire workforce to reconsider that decision   But if Jonathan wanted to get rid of a union  the Board says those cards would be good enough  no election needed     Other recent Board decisions would let employers off the hook for violations of the law  More than 30 000 workers were victims of labor law violations last year   The law  and basic fairness  says that those workers should receive the backpay they lost because they were victims of discrimination  but recent decisions by the Board make it harder for workers to prove theyre entitled to backpay    Thats wrong   The Board should not be protecting lawbreakers at the expense of justice for their victims        We should all  Democrat and Republican  be concerned about the state of collective bargaining in our country   History teaches us that the nations unions and the middle class rise and fall together   Theyve been placed apart in recent years  and we need to bring them back together   Thats why I look forward very much to hearing from our witnesses today           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
