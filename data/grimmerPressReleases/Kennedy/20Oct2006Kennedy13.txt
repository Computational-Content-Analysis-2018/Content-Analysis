         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   WASHINGTON  Friday  October 20    Senators Patrick Leahy   D Vt    and Edward Kennedy   D Mass    sent the following letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales Friday seeking a full report from the Department of Justice on its investigation into allegations of voter suppression targeting Latino citizens in Southern California    This shameful and dishonest scheme to discourage Latino citizens from voting is a blatant violation of the Voting Rights Act  and all those involved should be held accountable as soon as possible  Senator Kennedy said  One of Congresss top priorities when we reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in July was precisely to prevent such notorious vote suppression tactics  Its up to the Justice Department to do all it can to prevent such despicable tactics in election campaigns and to prosecute those who commit them to the full extent of the law   Leahy  the ranking Democratic member of the Committee  and Kennedy  a senior member of the panel  sent the letter following news reports that registered voters in Orange County  California were being warned they could be jailed or deported if they voted in November  The California Attorney Generals office is also investigating the matter   Long civil rights champions in Congress  Leahy and Kennedy led efforts in the 109th session to reauthorize key provisions of the Voting Rights Act   October 20  2006  The Honorable Alberto Gonzales Attorney General United States Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W  Washington  D C  20530  Dear Attorney General Gonzales   We are deeply concerned by recent news reports describing the use of voter suppression techniques targeting Latino citizens in southern California in the mid term elections  We enclose some of those accounts  Registered voters in Orange County  California  apparently are being warned in letters that they could be jailed or deported if they vote in the November election  Although in press reports Republican candidate Tan Nguyen acknowledges that an employee in his campaign was involved in sending out the controversial letter  he claims to have no personal knowledge of the letter  According to a Los Angeles Times article of October 19  2006  however  Orange County Republican Chairman Scott Baugh states that representatives of the Huntington Beach mail house that produced the letter told him that Nguyen was directly involved with the letter  calling and asking that it be sent out as soon as possible  The California Attorney General has launched an investigation into this matter  We ask that you send us and the Senate Judiciary Committee a written response detailing the immediate actions being taken by the Department to investigate this matter  prosecute those responsible  and notify naturalized citizens in Orange County of their right to vote   Our specific concern is that a letter  written in Spanish and sent to an unknown number of Latinos in Orange County  was distributed with the clear purpose of keeping voters from the polls on the basis of their race or ethnicity  According to press reports  the letter states that if       you are an emigrant  voting in a federal election is a crime that can result in incarceration  and possible deportation         The letter also states that the U S  government is installing a new computerized system to verify names of all newly registered voters who participate in the elections in October and November  Organizations against emigration will be able to request information from this new computerized system    During the recent reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act  the 109th Congress acknowledged that our nation has a long and unfortunate history of imposing barriers to voting rights  particularly with regard to racial  ethnic  language  and other minorities  Although many of the most blatant vote suppression tactics of the Jim Crow era have ended  our Committee received an abundance of evidence during the Voting Rights Act hearings documenting that more subtle and sophisticated vote suppression tactics persist  By reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act  the Congress reaffirmed our nations commitment to eliminating all vestiges of voter intimidation  oppression  and suppression  whether overt or subtle    This matter demonstrates the urgent need for vigorous enforcement of our nations civil rights laws  As you know  we have previously expressed concerns regarding the current priorities of the Civil Rights Division and whether those priorities are aligned with recent trends away from vigorous civil rights enforcement  We remain concerned about a reported a sharp decline in the number of traditional civil rights cases filed by the Division under this Administration  particularly in the area of voting rights    Because our nation is less than three weeks away from an important election  the Justice Department must conduct a thorough  complete  and speedy investigation into this matter  We request that you provide us with your report on or before October 27  2006     Sincerely     PATRICK LEAHY  Ranking Member  United States Senator   EDWARD KENNEDY  United States Senator   cc  Chairman Arlen Specter  Rep  Loretta Sanchez     Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
