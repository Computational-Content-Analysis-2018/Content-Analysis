         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  We have an immigration program in this legislation that impractical and fair with an circumstantial element bringing the twelve million men  women and children  hard working people out of the shadows into the sunshine of America  We will not conduct massive roundups and deport 12 million  We do not have the means to do it  It would disrupt our economy and inflict hardships and cost more than  250 billion to have buses all the way from Los Angeles to New York and back to try and do this  if it was even possible  But the Cornyn amendment makes vast numbers of these families ineligible for our program  We are trying to deal with a key element of the program  that families that are here  It would keep them in the shadows where employers abuse and underpay them  That hurts the immigrants  But it hurts American workers  too  by depressing wages  That s what we have seen out there now with the undocumented  the 12 million with a work record which is really even better in terms of percentages than native Americans  the people that are willing to work  want to work hard  But the exploitation of those workers  because everyone knows that their boss  all they have to do is go down and call the immigration service  work 80 hours a week  Well  I don t want to  Well  I m going to go down to the immigration service  And the exploitation of workers in this count industry well understood and we re trying to free ourselves from that kind of a situation  The Cornyn amendment will keep them in the shadows  where employers abuse them and underpay them  That hurts the immigrants  but hurts American workers too by depressing their wages  The Cornyn amendment does this by classifying an array of common  garden variety immigration offenses as crimes that would make them ineligible for the program  For example  the Cornyn amendment that says if you come here  have been ordered out of the country by immigration authorities  but if you failed to leave or you came back  you re ineligible  That s exactly what s been going on with our broken immigration system  People have come to work  Employers want them to come and they have benefited our economy and immigration offices might find them and order them home  but our employers beg them to come back  and our broken borders make that possible  Cornyn says that if you have used false identification  you may be found inadmissible and may be deported  But in our broken system  the people that have wanted to work face the reality of where we are today  Cornyn says that he wants to be tough on gang members  sex offenders  individuals convicted of domestic violence  So do we  We have addressed any provisions not covered by the current law and our amendment goes even further than the bipartisan compromise bill  He wants to exclude gang members  Our amendment does that too  Nobody who has engaged in illegal activity as part of a criminal gang will be allowed to enter or stay in this country  He says we should bar sex offenders from coming here  Our amendment does that  Any convicted sex offender who fails to register will not be allowed back into the country  If they re already here  then those offenders will face deportation  Cornyn says immigrants who commit acts of domestic violence and who endanger their families should be punished  Our amendment does that  He says drunk drivers should be deported  Our amendment does that  Any immigrant with one felony conviction for drunk driving will never be allowed to enter this country and if convicted here  then the drunk driver will be deported  He says there should be consequences for individuals engaging in fraud  Our amendment does that  Our amendment punishes anyone who commits perjury or makes false statements when seek immigration benefits  If any person lies on their application  then the individual will be prosecuted and subject to criminal penalties  He says we should go after immigrants convicted of firearms offenses  Our amendment does that too  Mr  President  who are the people we want to apply under our program  Who are the people that the Cornyn amendment would condemn to the shadows of abuse  We know that the vast majority of the families that have come over here are hard working people  care for their children go to church and contribute to their communities  In America  we respect hard work  Hard work built America  Our program says if your only offense is that you came here to work  you came here to provide for your family  that we ll provide a way that you can atone for that offense and earn the right to stay and work legally  If you re a criminal  then we ll arrest you  If you re a threat to our national security  a terrorist  then we ll lock you up  If you tried to cheat your way into the program through fraud  we ll deport you  But if you came here to work  then you can stay  Build a life  and you can stay  But first you have to meet the tough requirements  You have to pay the  5 000 fine  show a steady work history  learn English  go to the back of the line to get your green card  behind all those who have been waiting legally to get theirs  The Cornyn amendment creates harmful barriers for refugees fleeing persecution  In America  we ve had a long and proud tradition of providing refuge to people who have faced persecution and oppression in their land  whose lives are at risk because they stood up for their beliefs  We took in refuse agrees Cuba  from Vietnam as they fled communism  We ve helped people from Somalia and Bosnia and other areas of conflict and oppression  And now we re beginning to help people whose lives are at risk because they helped our troops in Iraq  But often these persecuted refugees have no choice but to cooperate with their oppressors in order to save their family s lives and enable their escape  The Cornyn amendment says if you do that  if you provide what s called material support to these oppressors and terrorist groups  then we are not going to rescue you from the hands of your oppressors  You have to take your chances and hope your oppressors don t persecute you or even kill you or your family  Consider the case of Helain from Sierra Leone  Revolutionary United Front rebels attacked her home  hacked one of her family members to death with a machete  They set her son on fire  leaving him near dead with severe burns  They held her family captive  raping her and her daughter and forcing them to cook and wash their clothes  The Cornyn amendment would bar legitimate refugees who were forced to assist their oppressors under duress  Under the Cornyn amendment  Helain would be ineligible to come to America as a refugee because she cooked for the rebels and washed their clothes  Under the Cornyn amendment  she and her family are ineligible because they provided material support for a terrorist group  If that s not bad enough  the Cornyn amendment says she can be excluded based on secret evidence  evidence that not only she nor anyone else outside the government can see  She may never know why she was excluded  The Cornyn amendment even bars her from going to court to explain her situation and appeal the denial of her case  The decision of the Secretary or the Attorney General is final  Helain would never get her day in court to explain her tragic circumstances of her case  The door to freedom in America would be closed shut  end of the discussion  you go back into the hands of your persecutors  Madam President  surely by now we have learned that closed proceedings conducted by executive branch officials based on secret evidence  without any possibility of court review  are inconsistent with American traditions and inconsistent with the search for justice  Let s not go down that road again  Madam President  the amendment makes all of its changes retroactive  They apply to the past and future conduct  The Cornyn amendment would change the rules in midstream  That is frowned upon in American jurisprudence  It s unconstitutional in criminal law and disfavored elsewhere  People whose conduct would not have affected their immigration status at the time a crime was committed will suddenly suffer severe consequences  The retroactivity provisions simply bring home the punitive nature of this amendment  It s not designed to contribute to creation of a tough but fair and practical system of immigration  It s designed to be harshly punitive  This amendment would exclude hundreds of thousands from benefits in this bill and undermine the bipartisan compromise that members of this body worked so long and so hard to produce  Mr  President  we will have an opportunity to vote for the alternative  an amendment that I have offered  The amendment expands the already tough criminal gang provisions contained in the bill If you re associated with a gang and that gang is known to be engaged in violent crimes  drug crimes  crimes involving firearms or explosives  drug smuggling or trafficking  you re not going to call for benefits  If you re associated with a gang and the gang has been engaged in crimes  violence  including murder  arson  kidnapping  bank robbery  abuse of children  witness tampering  burglary  racketeering  among other crimes  you re not going to be entitled to receive lawful status in this country and you aren t going to be able to qualify for benefits  This bill also expands the criminal penalties in the current immigration law  We target essentially the same provisions as Senator Cornyn  but then in many instances go further  This amendment bars the admission of sex offenders who don t register as required and makes them subject to deportation as well  It ensures that wife beaters  child abusers  stalkers and others who prey on the vulnerable are inadmissible to the united states  If ensures that a drunk driver who is sentenced to one year in prison cannot be admitted to the U S  and can be removed as well  Our drunk driving positions which require only one felony conviction  even more restrict restrictive than Senator Cornyn  which requires three convictions before a drunk driver becomes inadmissible  We increase the penalties for illegal entry  we ensure immigration fraud is subject to purge charges and we toughen the penalties for firearm offenses We are tough but we are practical too  and that is where this side by side difference from Senator Cornyn  His provisions are bright line rules  He turns many of these criminal offenses into aggregated felonies  That s just immigration speak for you  will never  ever  ever  ever be forgiven  For many offenses such as murder  that s more than a ream consequence  Murderers shouldn t become citizens  Under the current law  they can never become citizens  But most citizens are not murderers  They have entered the U S  illegally  And under the Senator Cornyn amendment  they could be aggravated felonies too  As a practical matter  Senator Cornyn doesn t want us to distinguish between murder and illegal entry  but that s not practical nor does it reflect our criminal justice system  So it is true that we built in small but important waivers that in extraordinary circumstances would give someone a second chance  Not murderers but someone who had long ago    who long ago has made a mistake  Just this week I received a letter from a young man named Adrian  a former gang member in Massachusetts who s turned his life around  Adrian went from that of juvenile delinquency to that of a dedicated student  one who works full time now and hopes to go to college  Go to college  Adrian s principals and his teachers praise him for his hard work  his commitment to family  and his newfound motivation to go to college  They want him to have a chance to stay in this country  The author of the letter then says  it is very  very hard thing to leave the gang life behind  There are other Adrians out there as well who have made the same decision regardless of the difficulty  It is the message this country wants to send them  that them  that what they have done is unforgivable  Regardless of whatever changes they have courageously made  Is that the message  Wouldn t the country gain by having an incentive in law that might attract young people to leave gang life and move their lives forward to a very different way  Wouldn t it be helpful to the country to have a waiver that a person who can apply for can prove they ve left a game and can provide evidence on how they ve moved on  Every change in our immigration law represents a statement about who we are as a country  Are we a country that takes individual circumstances into account  or are we a country that punishes with no regard for individual circumstances  We can be tough on crime and yet retain a level of discretion in our immigration laws  This is the crux of the difference between what I am suggesting to the Senate and what Senator Cornyn has proposed  That makes a major of distinction  That measure of distinction is every bit as much a tool of law enforcement as the strictest ban  I see my friend who has been waiting here so I d like to yield and I will yield time       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
