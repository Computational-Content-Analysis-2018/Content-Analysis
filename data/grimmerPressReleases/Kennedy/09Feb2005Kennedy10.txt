         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      The Committee s off to a good start  We ve already had a hearing on bioterrorism  and another scheduled on drug imports    Today s agenda is trauma care  the Foundation for the NIH  children s hospitals  and insurance pools for serious health conditions    I m particularly pleased the committee is considering the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act  Two years ago  a breakthrough occurred that once seemed unimaginable   deciphering the entire sequence of the DNA code  It may well affect the 21st century profoundly in all aspects of the prevention  detection  and treatment of diseases    But the extraordinary promise of biomedical research for improving health is in jeopardy if our laws fail to provide adequate protections against misuse of genetic information    Our bipartisan legislation prohibits health insurance companies from using genetic information to deny health coverage or raise premiums  It bars employers from using genetic information to make employment decisions    President Bush recognizes the seriousness of this problem  and supports the ban  In his words  genetic information should be an opportunity to prevent and treat disease  not an excuse for discrimination  Just as our nation addressed discrimination based on race  we must now prevent discrimination based on genetic information  I commend the President for his support  and I look forward to working with all of you and our colleagues in the House to see that a strong bill on genetic discrimination clears Congress and is signed into law very soon    I commend Chairman Enzi for his swift action on the important legislation we consider today  and I look forward to working with him on all the other issues  Let s keep up the good pace we ve begun   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
