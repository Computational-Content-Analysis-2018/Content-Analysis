         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington DC  While President Bush is in the Gulf Coast today  Senator Edward  M  Kennedy  Chair of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee   put out the following statement about the need for better leadership for the  schools in the region While there has been some progress in  rebuilding New Orleans  school system  the Administration has failed to provide  the leadership necessary to break down the barriers to recovery  FEMA red tape  has delayed school reconstruction  and teachers can t return to the schools if  they have no place to live  I was extremely concerned by the disturbing news  that in recent months hundreds of children had been turned away from the public  schools    it s simply unacceptable for children and families to be met with a  no vacancy sign at the school house door  We need leadership and a  coordinated  sustainable plan to ensure that families can return to New Orleans  and put their lives back together without the added burden of struggling to find  classrooms for their  children      LAURA CAPPS MELISSA WAGONER  202 224 2633
