         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today in the confirmation hearings of Robert Gates  Senator Edward M  Kennedy questioned him about the role of contractors in Iraq  Below is Senator Kennedys statement  as prepared for delivery  Mr  Gates  todays Washington Post reports that according to the US governments first official census there are over 100 000 contractors in Iraq  not counting subcontractors  We have more contractors in Iraq than active duty Army personnel  In many cases  the role of these contractors is not clear  and abuses by contractors can easily be misattributed to US military personnel  As General Nash said in the article  If youre trying to win the hearts and minds and the contractor is driving 90 miles per hour through the streets and running over kids  thats not helping the image of the American Army  In Abu Ghraib  some of the worst abuses were committed by contractors who had been hired as translators and interrogators  Yet the detainees will make no distinction between civilian contractors and US military personnel  Do you believe it is appropriate to have such a large contract force in Iraq  What plans do you have to hold these contractors accountable for their actions and ensure they are accountable to the taxpayers     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633
