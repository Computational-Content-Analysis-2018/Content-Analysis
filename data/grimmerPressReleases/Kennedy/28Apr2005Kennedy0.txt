         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I commend the Chairman for holding this hearing and for our bipartisan work on the Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act     The need to improve higher education is greater than ever  The challenge of globalization is increasingly serious  Economic growth is surging in Asia and other parts of the world  We continue to lose manufacturing jobs  In the last 30 years  the U S  has fallen from 3rd to 15th in the world in our production of scientists      The only realistic way to meet the challenge of globalization is by raising our skills  not by lowering our wages      In the last decade  college access in America actually went down  while access in 16 other nations went up  according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  More than half of those nations now rank above the United States in college access  Yet 200 000 college ready low income American students could not attend college because of financial barriers     We should have a College Access Contract for every young American  If you work hard  if you finish high school ready for college  if you are admitted to a college  we should guarantee that you can afford the cost of college  Cost should never be a barrier to postsecondary education     We also need to see that once students reach college  they go on to complete college  Over 40 percent of students who go to college fail to earn a bachelor s degree within six years of their enrollment  For minorities  the percentage is far worse  Five key principles should guide us in this reauthorization  more grants  cheaper loans  greater support for working students  greater support to enable minority and low income students to go to college and complete college  and more and better teachers  particularly in math and science     During the recent budget debate  the Senate approved an amendment I offered to protect and increase grant aid  I hope that this increase will be retained in the final budget  But even if we re successful  we need to deal much more fully with these issues in this reauthorization    Some of us have urged steps to reduce the inefficiency in the college loan program and use the savings to increase college grants  The key is competition  which is already widely used in many federal programs  and can be highly successful on student loans too    For both loans and grants  however  I m concerned that our current financial aid formula penalizes working students  Students shouldn t lose 50 cents of their grant aid for every dollar they earn working  We should make work pay for college students    The two current programs known as TRIO and GEAR UP are successful in hundreds of communities across the country in expanding access and ensuring completion of college for thousands of disadvantaged students  We should strengthen those programs in the reauthorization  Yet the President wants to eliminate both of these important programs  I hope we will send a strong message of support for TRIO and GEAR Up in our bill  and help two and four year colleges coordinate  so that more students who make the transition from two to four year colleges can earn their college degree on time    We also need to strengthen the ties between preschool  elementary  and secondary education and higher education  We should encourage efforts on the state level to do this through innovations such as P 16 councils and other means  For higher education to be truly available to all children  both elementary and secondary schools have do their part in making it possible for all students to go to college  That means an elementary and secondary education that puts them on a track to meet college expectations     The higher education community also has a critical role to play by producing the high quality teachers in the nation s public schools  Teacher preparation programs have a huge impact on the quality of education  As part of this reauthorization  we should make a new effort to support and improve those programs  and I look forward to working with the Chairman and my colleagues on this important issue    So we have our work cut out for us  We know that meeting this challenge is enormously important for the nation and its future     We are fortunate today to hear from Kati Haycock  Trinity Thorpe  Brian Bosworth from Massachusetts  Bob Shireman  and Phil Van Horn  Several of you have traveled a long way  Thank you very much for joining us  We look forward to your testimony   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
