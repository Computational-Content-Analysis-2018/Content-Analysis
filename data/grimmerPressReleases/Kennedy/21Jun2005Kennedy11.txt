         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and his colleagues sent two letters on behalf of Massachusetts shellfisherman to FEMA and to the USDA In their letter to FEMA  the Massachusetts delegation has asked for a meeting as soon as possible in Washington D C  or Boston with all of the federal agencies that could offer aid to the industries affected by the red tide disaster  Kennedy and colleagues continue to urge FEMA to declare affected Massachusetts counties disaster areas so that unemployment insurance can be administered through the state to shellfisherman In their letter to the USDA  Kennedy asks that aquaculturists and fish farmers in Barnstable  Bristol  Dukes  Essex  Nantucket  Norfolk  Plymouth  and Suffolk counties receive emergency assistance under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Kennedy said  The red tide has caused severe economic hardship for our shellfishing industry and it s a problem that needs our continuing attention  We re doing our best in Congress to urge the Department of Agriculture to help the aquaculture industry get through this disaster  and urging FEMA to coordinate federal agencies in providing emergency disaster relief Senator Kerry said  Massachusetts shellfishermen shouldn t be blocked from receiving low interest loans because of bureaucratic red tape  Government should be making things easier not harder for hard working men and woman facing difficult times  We need the Department of Agriculture and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act rapidly to get this assistance to shellfishermen and their families in need Congressman Delahunt said  We appreciate the SBA loans  but also need the Bush Administration to immediately authorize FEMA unemployment relief and assistance from the Agriculture Department  Our shellfishermen are going broke and time is of the essence Massachusetts is currently enduring the worst outbreak of red tide in decades and scientists are concerned it could last for weeks  severely impacting the shellfishing industry during the critical summer season  The economic impact of this outbreak is being felt  not just by the shellfishing industry  but by seafood buyers  restaurants and the tourism industry  It is critical that all avenues of federal assistance are explored  stated Congressman Capuano Congressman Frank said  When innocent citizens are facing a natural disaster  it s the obligation of government to do everything possible to assist them Congressman Stephen F  Lynch said  With so many federal agencies involved in this effort  it is imperative that they communicate with one another and work together effectively  Delays and bureaucracy will needlessly stall meaningful relief for local fishermen and their families  and the Delegation is working to ensure that we cut through the red tape as quickly as possible Congressman Tierney said  We continue to press federal agencies  such as FEMA and USDA  to provide immediate relief for the shellfishermen and their families affected by the red tide  The disaster has already had a devastating impact on the livelihoods of these families and the local economy  We insist that FEMA and USDA heed our call  and provide the assistance these families need Congressman Markey said  In Kansas they have tornados  in New England we have Red Tides  We wouldn t think twice about calling on FEMA for assistance in a tornado  or hurricane or flood disaster and we must make sure that the families and businesses of Massachusetts  that have been devastated by this national disaster  are provided with the services that they need and in are not left in the dark I am particularly concerned about the Red Tide s impact on the Southeastern Massachusetts aquaculture industry  Rep  McGovern said  Aquaculture is an important and growing sector of our economy  I urge the Secretary of Agriculture to consider this request as quickly as possible  I also urge FEMA to act in an expedited way June 21  2005The Honorable Mike Johanns Secretary of Agriculture United States Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Avenue  SW Washington  D C  20250Dear Secretary Johanns Under the provisions of the Emergency Programs for Disaster Assistance Act  we are writing to urge you to make emergency financial assistance available to aquaculturists and fish farmers in Barnstable  Bristol  Dukes  Essex  Nantucket  Norfolk  Plymouth  and Suffolk counties in Massachusetts  As a result of the current massive outbreak of red tide  these coastal counties have been hurt by the worst red tide disaster in Massachusetts in over thirty years  The outbreak has shut down the shellfish industry  and there are few signs of improvement  If the red tide continues for eight to ten weeks during the busy season  which is by all accounts realistic  then these fishermen will lose almost half of their entire income for the year The red tide results from an unusually severe combination of environmental conditions that caused toxic algae to cover entire coastal areas  The tide has shut down over 1 700 commercial shell fisherman and 250 shellfish aquaculturists The Governor of Massachusetts has declared the crisis is of such severity that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and local governments  and has implemented the State Emergency Operations Plan  We have requested FEMA to declare a major disaster in the counties listed above Last week  the Administrator of the Small Business Administration and the Secretary of Commerce declared that the affected Massachusetts counties are disaster areas  However  aquaculturists are not eligible for Small Business Administration disaster loans  and instead must seek your assistance under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance program  We appreciate your prompt attention to this important issue of vital importance to the hard working men and women of the aquaculture industry  and we look forward to hearing from you With respect and appreciation Sincerely June 21  2005Michael D  Brown Under Secretary of Homeland Security For Emergency Preparedness and Response 500 C St  S W  Washington D C  20472Dear Secretary Brown The Massachusetts coast and the islands are suffering from the worst red tide outbreak in over thirty years  As a result of the crisis  the shell fishing and related industries have been greatly harmed  We are writing to you to ask for a meeting as soon as possible in Washington D C  or Boston with all of the federal agencies that could offer aid to these industries The red tide has prevented over 1 700 commercial fishermen from working during the busy summer season  The economic impact to the industries from these closures is nearly  3 million a week  Experts predict the closures will last at least for three months  which means that the shellfishermen alone will lose half of their annual income because of the crisis Last week  the Administrator of the Small Business Administration and the Secretary of Commerce declared that the affected Massachusetts counties are disaster areas  We sent a letter to President Bush urging him to declare a disaster too  so that FEMA can provide economic relief  As the President assesses the impact of the red tide  we ask for your expertise in coordinating the efforts of the various federal agencies FEMA has the expertise and the history of coordinating the federal relief when disasters hit  We have great respect for FEMA s accomplishments in past disasters  and we know that this meeting will have great benefit for the thousands of people who are suffering as a result of the red tide crisis We look forward to hearing from you about this important meeting and working with you to provide the relief that our constituents need and deserve With respect and appreciation Sincerely   Melissa Wagoner 202 224 2633
