         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to President Bush s comments on an independent judiciary    I commend the President for distancing himself from the current Republican rhetoric on retaliation against judges  The deplorable words conveyed by Republican leaders give even more reason for the President to put a stop to their efforts to blow up 200 years of constitutional history in order to rubber stamp his own judges  The President should stop the insanity of the nuclear option  He should also give federal judges the protection they ve asked for and deserve by supporting additional funding for courthouse security    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
