         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement I m pleased the President is finally talking about the growing crisis in health care  however I am concerned that taxing health benefits may undermine the good coverage that many Americans already have  while inadequate credits will do little to make health care more affordable for those who are struggling to pay their premiums now  Americans need real solutions and effective action  so that quality affordable health care can be a reality for all  just as it is for the President and members of Congress  The bold health plans in Massachusetts  California  and other states have shown that when all sides work together  there is no limit to what we can accomplish   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
