         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC    Today  as the Senate begins debate on the budget  Senator Edward M  Kennedy will call for a budget that reflects the generosity of spirit and the commitment to fairness and opportunity that characterize the American people  To make the budget less about giving more to those who already have the most  Senator Kennedy will offer in the days ahead at least two amendments  one aimed at strengthening education and the other geared towards eradicating child poverty   This budget turns its back on the values of the American people  It assumes that Americans are selfish by cutting back on access to higher education and job training  instead of enhancing our strength and competitiveness so that more of our citizens can fulfill the American dream in the global economy  It assumes that Americans are selfish by increasing investments in defense without also increasing our commitment to reducing child poverty in America  It assumes that Americans are selfish    that they prefer more tax breaks for wealthy individuals than greater opportunity for everyone  Senator Kennedy said   Kennedy s education amendment will help middle class families pay for college and help all Americans by ensuring that our citizens are equipped for the jobs of the global economy  This measure includes a three part strategy that bolsters our strength in math  science  and technology  secures resources for making college more affordable  and restores cuts to job training and vocational education  Never before has the financial challenge of attending college been greater for low income students  Last year 400 000 college ready students were unable to attend 4 year college because they couldn t afford to do so  Kennedy is addressing the achievement gap in math and science   America ranks 29th in the industrialized world in math and science   by providing incentives for more young Americans to study  and even more importantly  teach these subjects in our public schools   Kennedy will also declare that cutting child poverty in half is an attainable    and moral    goal to achieve within this decade  To meet this commitment his poverty amendment would enact a one percent surtax to be paid by our wealthiest citizens in order to take care of the needs of our most vulnerable citizens  Today  nearly one child in five is living in poverty  Nearly 36 million men  women  and children in the United States now live below the poverty linean increase of over 4 million since President Bush was first elected   While Republicans tout an anti poverty agenda  the President s budget includes severe  yet often hidden  cuts from programs that most directly impact America s poorest familiesin education  nutrition  child care  health care  affordable housing  job training  heating and cooling assistance  and in community and rural development  For example  it cuts the Women  Infants  and Children Program  which provides health information and nutritious meals to low income pregnant women and their children  And the budget would cut Medicaid  which ensures that more than 50 million children  pregnant women  the elderly  and people with disabilities have access to the medical services they need        Statement by Senator Edward M  Kennedy on the Budget March 15  2005  as prepared for delivery   Americans are a strong and generous people  but this is a weak and selfish budget  It gives more to those who already have the most  and further deprives those who have the least  It gives the rich and powerful what they want  while denying our families  our communities  and our nation what they need most   Our national budget should reflect the generosity of spirit and the commitment to fairness and opportunity that characterize the American people  Instead  this budget lacks the courage of America s convictions  It betrays our most fundamental values as a nation   As religious leaders of many faiths wrote to Congress  This budget turns its back on our nation s oldest and most enduring values of compassion  justice and honesty  It demands an unequal sacrifice  and so it is unworthy of who we are  as children of God   As Americans  we are known for our rugged individualism  We are stirred even today by the heroic images of pioneers pushing westward to build new lives for themselves and their families   But we are also good neighbors  The settlers traveled to the West in wagon trains because they knew that the survival of their families depended on strong communities working together for the common good  They lived by the Golden Rule not only as a moral mandate  but as a necessity   That is our American heritage  Neighbor helping neighbor  All of us contributing to our communities and to our nation to make them stronger   But this budget turns its back on the values of the American people  It assumes that Americans are selfish    that they prefer more tax breaks for wealthy individuals than greater opportunity for everyone   It assumes that Americans are selfish by giving a higher priority to the profits of corporations than meeting the health care needs of our families   It assumes that Americans are selfish by cutting back on access to higher education and job training  instead of enhancing our strength and competitiveness so that more of our citizens can fulfill the American dream in the global economy   It assumes that Americans are selfish by increasing investments in defense without also increasing our commitment to reducing child poverty in America   It assumes that Americans are selfish by borrowing billions more each year from Social Security to cover President Bush s distorted priorities  instead of paying back the trillions of dollars that the White House has already taken from Social Security to pay for its tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations   It assumes that Americans are selfish by providing 70 billion dollars more in tax breaks  primarily benefiting the wealthiest taxpayers  while cutting billions from Medicaid that would go to provide health care for our poorest citizens  The tax cuts on dividend and capital gains income provided for under this budget will give millionaires an average annual tax break of over  35 000  while families with incomes under  50 000 will receive only six dollars per year in tax savings   To assure continuing opportunity for our citizens  we must strengthen our commitment to education and health care   Without these commitments  we weaken the American middle class  and the challenge of poverty will continue to grow   In just the past four years  middle class families have seen their health insurance premiums jump 59   college tuition payments rise 35   housing costs go up 33   and gasoline prices up 22    At the same time  their good jobs are being shipped overseas  And the new jobs created in today s economy make it harder and harder to provide for their families and plan for their future  The new jobs provide lower wages  less health care  and fewer opportunities to save for a good retirement   The answer to this challenge is not to lower our wages  but to raise our skills  We must invest more in education and job training   But when it comes to equipping our citizens for the job opportunities for the future  this budget actually cuts back our national commitment to education for the first time in a decade   The cuts to education over the next 5 years will total over  40 billion   The cuts to student loans and the tiny increase to Pell Grants will mean that college is less affordable next year for 673 000 young Americans   The cuts to the GEAR UP  TRIO  and Upward Bound programs    initiatives that have opened college doors for millions of young Americans    will do grave harm to our national commitment to equal opportunity   Cuts to vocational education  adult education  and job training mean that millions of our citizens will be unable to obtain the jobs they need to provide for their families and contribute to their communities   This budget leaves more than three million children behind in our public schools  It sends our children to schools with crowded classrooms and with fewer teachers than are needed to help them prepare for the future   Republicans will claim that this budget increases their commitment to education  They will point to a new  6 5 billion fund for higher education in the budget  But it s a phony  Elsewhere  their budget requires  12 billion in higher education cuts   We must also make quality  affordable health care available to all of our citizens  Health care should be the birthright of every American  Americans should never go to bed at night worried that a family illness will leave them destitute  But this budget cuts our commitment to health care   It will cripple Medicaid  which is a lifeline for 50 million poor women  children  elderly and disabled Americans  In fact  one third of all newborns in America  and their mothers  rely on Medicaid for care  The Republican Party and the Bush Administration say they are for a culture of life  But this action makes that an empty claim  Cutting Medicaid is one of the most damaging actions to a culture of life that any Administration could take   This health budget fails to reduce by a single person the 45 million Americans who are without health insurance today  It s a number that s growing  when it should be a high priority for Congress and the Administration to ensure that no American goes without adequate health care   I believe that we should expand the Medicare program to cover every single American  so that no American has to worry about health care again  and our employers are no longer burdened with the increasingly unaffordable obligation to provide health insurance for their employees   But there s nothing  nothing  in this budget to address this priority   And it fails to provide funding for urgently needed legislation to make affordable health insurance available to families with disabled children  Senator Grassley and I have introduced legislation to make this possible  and more than half the Senate has cosponsored it for the last four years  And Congressman Pete Sessions is leading companion legislation in the House  So I hope that in the course of this budget debate  we can include funding to make this important legislation possible   The Republican health budget also reduces our commitment to finding new cures   It does nothing to increase efforts to find lifesaving answers to disease and injury through stem cell research   It freezes funds for health research at the National Institutes of Health  and cuts our commitments for disease prevention  for controlling the flu and other epidemics  for minority health  for women s health  for children s hospitals  for AIDS  for rural hospitals  for training nurses  and for bioterrorism preparedness   The one bright spot for health care in this budget is its funding for reducing the cost of health care by modernizing our health care system with information technology  We are working on a bipartisan basis to make this a reality  This priority was not included in the President s budget  and I m grateful to Senator Gregg and Senator Enzi for their leadership in including it in this budget   I also want to commend the Budget Committee for its work on pensions  Our defined benefit pension system is struggling  Workers  benefits are at risk  companies are having difficulty meeting their pension plan payments  and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is facing a record deficit   This bill establishes a workable framework for us to develop pension policy that focuses on protecting America s workers and retirees and creating a strong pension system  I urge the Budget Committee to strongly defend the Senate s position in conference   We must ensure that no American lives in poverty    especially our children  We are the wealthiest nation on earth  but we have the highest rate of poverty of any industrialized country  Nearly 36 million Americans struggle below the poverty line  Even those with jobs are facing hunger  as the number of Americans who face hunger each day has gone up by three million in the past five years   It s one of the great moral failures of our nation  The Administration says it s guided by compassionate conservatism  But there s nothing compassionate about a budget that will drive even more of our citizens into poverty   As a young boy  I was taught to live by the words in the 25th chapter of St  Matthew s Gospel where the Lord said that when we care for the least of those among us    the hungry  the thirsty  the sick  and the destitute    we are also caring for Him   I believe those words should guide this budget as well  Yet  in addition to cutting Medicaid  this Republican budget cuts Food Stamps  cuts meals to low income pregnant mothers and to children  and cuts low income housing   But equally harmful to less fortunate Americans is the fact that this budget does nothing    absolutely nothing    to give them the tools they need to raise their families from poverty  It does nothing to make our economy work for them  It fails to invest adequately in the education of low income children to improve their chances of winning the good jobs of the future  It does nothing to provide more job training opportunities for low income fathers and mothers  Nothing   In the course of the debate this week  Democrats will offer amendments to bring this budget more in line with enduring American values and the real priorities of our citizens   In recent weeks  the Senate has failed to meet their needs   We passed a class action bill that made it harder for working families to challenge the abuses of big corporations   Last week  we passed a bankruptcy bill that helped credit card companies at the expense of hard working Americans who fall on hard times   And we have a President stumping across the country wanting to give Social Security to Wall Street   It s about time that we did something for ordinary citizens  and I hope the Senate will change this budget for them   Over the course of this week  I plan to offer several amendments which will bring this budget more in line with our nation s needs and better serve hard working men and women   I will discuss two of them today  One addresses education and our efforts to remain competitive in the global economy  The other will commit us as a nation to the moral goal of ending child poverty        FACT SHEET ON POVERTY IN AMERICA   The number of Americans living in poverty has increased by 4 3 million during the Bush Administration    Today  36 million people live in poverty  And many of those living in poverty have children    13 million children are in poverty    Since the late 1970s  the number of full time workers in poverty has doubled    from 1 3 million then to 2 6 million today  An unacceptably low minimum wage is part of the problem    Poverty is particularly acute for women and children  Indeed  more than 40 percent of young children who live in households headed by women live in poverty    New data from the Census Bureau shows that poverty has hit minorities especially hard  The poverty rate for African Americans is 24 percent  twice that for all Americans  For Hispanic Americans it is 23 percent    The number of African Americans who were poor increased by more than 800 000 in the last four years and the number of poor Hispanics increased by more than 1 3 million    America s children are more likely to live in poverty than Americans in any other age group    Nearly one in five children lives in poverty    The poverty rate for children in the United States is substantially higher    often two to three times higher    than that of most other major Western industrialized nations  Sweden s child poverty rate is a fifth of America s  Poland s is a little more than half of America s    African American and Latino children are much more likely to live in poverty than white children  One third of African American children are low income  as are nearly a third of Latino children     Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
