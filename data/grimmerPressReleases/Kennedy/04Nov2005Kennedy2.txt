         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The war against terrorism is as much a contest of values and ideals as it is a military conflict  In this struggle  America should lead as it always has    setting an example by treating others as we would want to be treated ourselves  even in times of war    This golden rule has been tarnished and abandoned by the Bush Administration  As a result  for much of the world  the American face in the war on terror is represented by images of torture and abuse  The anything goes attitude at the highest levels of the Bush White House has made the war on terror much harder to win  And it has placed our own soldiers at risk throughout the globe  should they be captured    How can we demand that the rest of the world abide by standards of common decency when we abuse prisoners ourselves      So I come to the floor today in strong support of the McCain amendment to protect American honor by ensuring clear rules for the interrogation of prisoners  This common sense proposal ensures that we have one standard of interrogation for our government  and it makes sure the rules are clear so that our interrogators and case officers know what the limits are     Before September 11th  2001  everyone knew what the limits were  They were clearly laid out in the Army Field Manual  our laws  and our treaty obligations  Yet this Administration began systematically taking those rules apart     Col  Larry Wilkerson  the chief of staff to Secretary Powell  said on NPR yesterday  The Secretary of Defense  under cover of the Vice President s office began to create an environment       of allowing the President in his capacity as Commander in Chief to deviate from the Geneva Conventions    William Taft  the State Department Legal Advisor in President Bush s first term  knew the consequences of that fundamental shift  In an address at American University  he said that the decision to violated international standards unhinged those responsible for the treatment of the detainees       from the legal guidelines for interrogation       embodied in the Army Field Manual for decades  Set adrift in uncharted waters and under pressure from their leaders to develop information on the plans and practices of al Qaeda  it was predictable that those managing the interrogation would eventually go too far     The Judge Advocate Generals from the Air Force  Navy  Army and Marines    in other words  the chief lawyers for every one of the uniformed services    warned that the adoption of interrogation policies contrary to the Geneva Conventions would result in grave harms  These are all professional military lawyers who have dedicated their lives and distinguished careers to serving the men and women in uniform and protecting their Nation  In an extraordinary set of memos they strongly opposed the legal theories foisted on them by the Administration s lawyers  The JAGS warned that the policies would harm not only our efforts to stop terrorism  but would also put U S  forces at risk who were themselves detained in this and future conflicts  One legal scholar called the Administration s case some of the worst legal reasoning he had ever seen     As Air Force Major General Jack Rives said  We need to consider the overall impact of approving extreme interrogation techniques as giving official approval and legal sanction to the application of interrogation techniques that U S  forces have consistently been trained are unlawful    Yet  despite the condemnation of these new interrogation policies by experienced diplomatic and military personnel alike  the Administration persists in pursuing these disturbing practices  Just last week  Vice President Cheney himself suggested that the CIA should be exempt from the prohibitions against cruel  inhuman  and degrading treatment  As of this week  it is clear why  The CIA apparently is holding more than a hundred detainees in secret prisons around the world to interrogate them with the techniques roundly rejected by the military lawyers    This is unacceptable  In America  no one is above the law  There is no reason the CIA    or any other agency of our government    should be immune from American norms and standards of conduct    This amendment will make our message clear  As Americans  not only do we fight for our ideals  but we live by them  We can no longer tolerate ambiguity when it comes to the very standards we are trying to enforce around the world     In the first Gulf War  our compliance with the Geneva Conventionsthe international gold standard for treatment of captiveswas called the best of any nation in any conflict in the history of the Conventions by the International Red Cross  the organization charged with overseeing compliance with the conventions     There are good reasons that we should abide by the Geneva Conventions  They protect our own troops  The Conventions require that all captured combatants or prisoners of war must be visited by the Red Cross to help assure the world that their treatment is humane  The International Red Cross visited US servicemen held prisoner in Kosovo in the 1990s  They visited our troops held in the first Gulf War     As Milt Bearden  a former CIA official  wrote in this morning s New York Times  the treatment of prisoners generally reaches symmetry in any war  In other words  if we abuse prisoners in a war  others will abuse our soldiers if they are taken prisoner     As Mr  Bearden pointed out  our actions make a difference  even in extreme situations  He wrote  The policy of three presidents    Jimmy Carter  Ronald Reagan  and George H W  Bush    was that both the Afghan mujahedeen insurgents we supported and their Soviet adversaries would be treated within the precepts of the Geneva Conventions when taken prisoner  I can state without reservation that the United States used its influence consistently to promote that policy    with overwhelmingly positive results     Sadly  our treatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib  in Afghanistan  Guatanamo  and other sites  makes it far more difficult for us to guarantee the protections of the Geneva Conventions for our military if they are captured  and degrades the international consensus against such abuse     America must lead by example  After the abuse of the detainees at Abu Ghraib  President Bush said  Their treatment does not reflect the nature of the American people  That is not the way we do things in America     Let s make the President s bold words into a reality and adopt the McCain Amendment   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
