         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy introduced legislation to enhance stem cell research and to strengthen anti cloning provisions  Kennedy  joined by his colleagues and co sponsors of the Human Cloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act  highlighted the key provisions that separate this bill from similar pieces of legislation currently before Congress  Senators Hatch  Feinstein  Specter and Harkin join Kennedy in recognizing the importance and necessity of providing vital research into the use of stem cells    The bill makes human cloning of any kind a felony and punishable by immense monetary fines and ten years in prison  Currently there are no federal laws banning human cloning  The bill also allows for the increased use and creation of unfertilized eggs  which is referred to as therapeutic cloning for research that could provide cures for some of today s most debilitating diseases and disabilities  More research into the power of stem cells will only unlock unknown treatments for diseases that cause America s families to endure both physical and emotional pain  as well as economic hardship    It s wrong to deny the great potential of medical research using the remarkable new techniques of stem cell research  which can save lives by preventing  treating  and curing a wide range of severe diseases and disabilities  Senator Kennedy said  The misguided fears of today can t be allowed to deny the cures of tomorrow    This legislation will continue to give biotechnology room to grow by lifting stifling provisions on stem cell research and on access to unfertilized eggs by scientists  In Massachusetts alone  this legislation will enable some of America s tops universities and research institutions to continue their life altering work that has contributed to cures and treatments for patients around the world     Background on Hatch Feinstein Human Cloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act   The Hatch Feinstein bill bans the abuse of stem cell research techniques to produce a baby  reproductive cloning   but allows the use of SCNT in stem cell research  so called therapeutic cloning   It establishes strict ethical guidelines for the research and tough penalties for violations     Makes it a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison to clone or attempt to clone a human being  without exception         Establishes fines of  1 million or three times any profits made  whichever is greater  on any person who clones or attempts to clone a human being  This financial penalty is in addition to the 10 year prison term      Allows the most promising form of stem cell research  somatic cell nuclear transplantation  to be conducted on a human egg for up to 14 days only  under strict ethical standards and federal regulation  This 14 day requirement is consistent with the standard established in the United Kingdom and recommended by the California Advisory Committee on Human Cloning     This stem cell research can take place on unfertilized eggs only     Bans profiteering and coercion by requiring that all egg donations for this stem cell research be voluntary  and that women who donate eggs can only be compensated minimally    large payments to induce donation are prohibited     Prohibits the purchase or sale of unfertilized eggs  oocytes or blastocysts      Requires that nuclear transplantation occurs in labs completely separate from labs that engage in in vitro fertilization  to prevent a blurring of the lines and avoid the risk that eggs used in legitimate and important nuclear transplantation research would then be implanted in a woman     Prohibits the export of eggs that have undergone nuclear transplantation to any foreign country that does not ban human cloning  This prohibition is designed to avoid the risk that valuable research in the United States will result in a human clone anywhere in the world     Includes strong ethics requirements that mandate informed consent by egg donors  review of any nuclear transplantation research by an ethics board  and safety and privacy protections     Any researcher who violates the bill s ethics requirements  even without attempting to clone a human and becoming subject to the 10 year prison term and  1 million fine  will face civil penalties of up to  250 000 per violation    STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY   It s a privilege to join Senator Hatch  Senator Feinstein  Senator Specter and Senator Harkin on this bipartisan proposal to outlaw human cloning and open the way to proper  ethical cures for our most feared diseases     Using cloning to reproduce a child is improper and immoral    and our legislation will make it illegal  Medicine must advance hand in hand with ethics  and the legislation we introduce today will make certain that American research sets the gold standard for ethical oversight     But  it s wrong to deny the great potential of medical research using the remarkable new techniques of stem cell research  which can save lives by preventing  treating  and curing a wide range of severe diseases and disabilities  We see the benefits of investment in biotechnology all around us  50 years ago last week  Jonas Salk announced the first polio vaccine  Imagine a world without that extraordinary discovery    where peoples everywhere lived in fear of the polio virus and the devastation it brings    Thirty years ago  Congress was considering whether to ban research on recombinant DNA    the very foundation of biotechnology    Time after time  we heard of the medical advances that this new field of research would bring  Then    as now    some dismissed this promise as a pipe dream  and urged Congress to forbid it  We chose instead to vote for new hope and new cures  Today  countless Americans and persons throughout the world are already benefiting from the new treatments that biotechnology has brought  Why call a halt  In the 1980 s Congress made the right choice  again  by rejecting attempts to outlaw in vitro fertilization  a technique that has fulfilled the hopes and dreams of thousands of parents who would never have been able to have a child    Our debate today is no different and Congress should do all it can to support lifesaving research  not prohibit it    Other nations are more than willing to leave us behind  The potential of this research is so immense that some of our best scientists are already leaving America to pursue their dreams in research laboratories in other countries  We need to stop that exodus before it becomes a nightmare  Do we really want to wake up ten years from now and hear that a former American scientist in another land has won The Nobel Prize in Medicine for a landmark discovery in stem cell research  The misguided fears of today can t be allowed to deny the cures of tomorrow  I commend my colleagues for their leadership on this important legislation  and I hope the Senate will act quickly to approve this urgently needed bill    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
