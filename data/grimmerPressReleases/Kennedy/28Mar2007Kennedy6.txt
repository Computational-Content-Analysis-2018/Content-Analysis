         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  After more than four years of war in Iraq  a timeline for the redeployment of our combat troops out of Iraq is necessary to encourage the Iraqis to take responsibility for their future   This Administration supported deadlines for three Iraqi elections and for the writing of the constitution in a clear effort to ensure that the Iraqis would make essential decisions     Yet  it remains emphatically opposed to any timeline for the redeployment of our military   The Administration should follow the logic of its past actions and embrace  rather than reject  a timeline   And it should stop defying the will of the American people who want us to begin to bring our troops home to the heros welcome they have earned    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
