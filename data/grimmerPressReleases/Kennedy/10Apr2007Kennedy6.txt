         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Seven months ago  I stood here and called for passage of legislation to overturn the Bush Administrations unreasonable restrictions on embryonic stem cell research  At that time  I emphasized the hope that stem cell research can bring to patients across America   But the Presidents rejection of our bill has generated new outrage that the promise of stem cell research has been denied to so many for so long Stem cell research brings hope to millions of Americans who seek better treatments and even the possibility of cures for cancer  diabetes  spinal injury  and many other serious conditions Patients across America are right to feel hope that stem cell research may lead to treatments and the discovery of cures  And they are also right to feel outrage that President Bush cast his veto last year on our bipartisan bill that offered so much hope to so many Americans That veto has added another year to the five years of missed opportunities and squandered opportunities that the Presidents arbitrary and ill founded ban on embryonic stem cell research has cost patients across America     The veto is another despicable example of science taking a back seat to politics in this Administration   Whether the issue is stem cell research  or climate change  or the battle against HIV AIDS  the story is the same   Policies that should rest on science are decided instead by crass political calculations of what is needed to appease the most intransigent elements of the Republican base     The time has come to say  Enough   No more   Surely  if last Novembers election means anything  it means we must spare the country from policy calculations based solely on politics and a mentality that never admits the possibility of errors  and therefore refuse to correct them when they are made      Today  we renew our hope that the President will start anew  and consider the merits of this new legislation  instead of automatically picking up his veto pen  When Congress passed the bipartisan stem cell bill last year  we voted for hope  for progress  and for life  But President Bush chose to dash those hopes by vetoing the legislation     Now  were taking up the cause once again   Our legislation again brings together conservatives and progressivesmembers of Congress on both sides of the debate over a womans right to chooserepresentatives from big cities  small towns and rural areas  We all agree that stem cell research must go forward  I commend Senator Reid for his leadership in giving the Senate this new opportunity to act on this The legislation before us is only six pages long  Its a short  simple bill with enormous goals and vast potential  It overturns the unrealistic and unreasonable restrictions on embryonic stem cell research imposed by the Presidents Executive Order five years ago  His unilateral action bypassed Congress and froze progress in its tracks by barring NIH from funding research using any stem cells derived after August 9th  2001an arbitrary date chosen solely to coincide with the President s speech    Many of us warned at the time that this policy would delay the search for new cures and put needless barriers in the way of medical progress   At a Health Committee hearing just days after the Executive Order was issued  many of us raised concerns about the new policy  and urged the President to reconsider   Our concerns were dismissed by the Administration  but time has shown that each of the drawbacks we feared of then has become a real barrier to progress today At the time of the Executive Order  the Administration claimed that over 60 independent stem cell lines would be available to NIH researchers  NIH initially listed 78 such lines in its registry  But time and the unalterable facts of science proved that two thirds of those lines are useless  or that claims about them proved to be an illusion   Today  only 22 stem cell lines are available to NIH researchersand all of these were obtained using out of date methods and outmoded techniques      Two months ago  Dr  Story Landis  the Chair of the NIH Stem Cell Taskforce  came before our committee and told Congress that all of these lines have genetic instabilities        Each of the 22 lines is contaminated with animal tissue  because each was cultured on a so called feeder layer of mouse cells   Techniques developed since 2001 have allowed scientists to grow stem cells without mouse cells  but the Executive Order prevents American patients from reaping the full benefit of these new discoveries because these new lines are off limits to NIH funded scientists   As a result  in Dr  Landis words  we are missing out on possible breakthroughs Dr  Landiss grim assessment of the Presidents order was confirmed by the nations top biomedical researcher  Dr  Elias Zerhouni  Director of the NIH   His judgment on the failure of the Administrations policies could not be clearer   It is in the best interest of our scientists  our science and our country that we find ways and the nation finds a way to allow the science to go full speed across adult and embryonic stem cells equally   But thats exactly what is not happening because of the Administrations harsh restrictions     Imagine what advances might have occurred if NIH had not been handcuffed and prevented from funding the best research efforts  As Dr  Zerhouni testified  To sideline NIH in such an issue of importance  in my view  is shortsighted  I think it wouldn t serve the nation well in the long run    And it obviously hasnt served the nation well Both Dr  Landis and Dr  Zerhouni serve the Bush Administration  but they serve a higher calling too  the responsibility of all scientists to speak the truth   Congress and the American people owe them our gratitude for their courage and integrity to state in public that the policies of the Administration they serve are harming patients and delaying the search for new cures for serious diseases         Our legislation makes the basic change needed to reverse this policy   But science without ethics is like a ship without a rudder   For this reason  our legislation also establishes essential ethical safeguards for stem cell research  By bringing NIH to the forefront of stem cell research  we place far more research under the strong ethical protections that are part of every NIH grant   The bedrock principles of such research are informed consent and the requirement that all research be approved by an ethics committee before it is conducted   Our legislation prohibits payment for donation of cells   It forbids improper inducements to donate cells  and it mandates that all cells used must come from embryos that would not have been used to initiate a pregnancy Even with the intense debate on stem cells that has occurred in recent years  some people still believe that the cells are derived from fetuses  or from embryos that might otherwise have been used to start a pregnancy  Both of these beliefs are wrong   Our legislation specifically requires that stem cells be derived from human embryos that  have been donated from in vitro fertilization clinics  were created for the purposes of fertility treatment  and were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such treatment   In fertility clinics across the country  thousands of embryos are simply discardedthrown away   We believe it is better to salvage embryos that would otherwise be destroyed  so that they can make the gift of life to patients who are suffering   Life is too precious to allow an opportunity to cure serious illness to be simply thrown in the trash  Our legislation also authorizes new initiatives for obtaining stem cells from sources other than embryos   We strongly support the ongoing search for alternatives to embryonic stem cell research  But its fundamentally wrong to shut down the promise of new cures while that search is underway In the end  this debate is not about abstract principles or complex aspects of science  It s about the people who look with hope to stem cell research to help them with the challenges they face             During last years debate  I read from a letter sent to me by 15 year old Lauren Stanford  who has juvenile diabetes  In her letter  she wrote of her hope for what stem cell research means to her and her family  She wrote me again this year  and while she is still full of hope you can also hear her frustration   These are her words I am now wearing what is called a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System  It has a wire probe that I insert under my skin every few days  on my own When I first held the wire probe to my thigh  I was scared to death  The needle was huge  and I was going to be plunging it into my body  Would it hurt  What if it didnt work  Was it worth the risk   After about 20 minutes of sweating and shaking  I stopped chickening out and found the guts to do it And then  as soon as I did it I knew almost immediately it was the right thing to do  It went in fine  It didnt hurt that much  And its helping me Those were her words  She goes on to write to each of us about our decisions on how to vote on this legislation now  Heres what she writes  Some of you might be scared to vote yes  You know its the right thing to do  after all  if embryos are being discarded  how can it not be right to use them to help people like me  Your hand is lingering over the yes lever  just like mine was over that insertion device  You can see it might do some good       but you are afraid  Someone might get mad  It might hurt a little  But follow my lead  Be brave  Do something that might hurt at little or scare you for a second  but after will make so many things so much better  Vote yes to allow scientists to do this valuable research to free kids like me from horrible diseases  Vote yes and take another step along with me to finding cures No one ever said doing the right thing  the brave thing  and the thing to make the world better would be easy  Ive learned that the hard way  Vote yes  Free me from the machines that keep me alive  Clear away my future of kidney damage  blindness and fear of a shortened life  Those are Lauren Stanford s words  and they compel us to act   Tomorrow  we can cast a vote of conscience and courage  By approving the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  we call upon the President of the United States to think anew  and decide not to veto hope      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
