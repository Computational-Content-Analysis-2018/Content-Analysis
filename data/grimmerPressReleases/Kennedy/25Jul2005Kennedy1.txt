         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Thank you  President John Sweeney  for that generous introduction  I have enormous respect for John s leadership  He s dedicated his life to the cause of labor  and he battles every waking minute for working families across our nation  I ve worked with him for many years now  and I know we ll continue to do all we can to see that working families are truly and fully and fairly represented in everything Congress does  John Sweeney is my kind of President     What an honor to be here on this auspicious day    the 50th Anniversary of the AFL CIO  50 years of fighting for working families  50 years of fighting for better jobs and better opportunity  50 years of fighting for the American dream    Time and again over the past half century  unions have given workers the voice they need to obtain the fairness and dignity they deserve in the workplace  Whenever there s been progress toward social and economic justice in our country  it s hard working union members who ve always been at the heart of the battle     You ve led the effort on every piece of progressive legislation in our country for almost a century  Without you  the New Deal would have been more of the same Raw Deal  From Social Security to Medicare to the Family and Medical Leave Act  from worker safety to civil rights    you ve been on the ramparts and in the trenches  wherever the front lines are found  It was union members who were at the forefront of all the great battles    for the 40 hour week    for health insurance and pension rights    for the minimum wage    and for many other basic achievements    But we re here today to say  you ain t seen nothing yet  We re just getting started  The Republican Right always tries to stand in the way  But we know we re right    and they better get out of the way now  or we ll get them out of the way in the 2006 elections    One thing is clear    we re going to keep on keeping on    until all Americans have good jobs with good pay  fair benefits  and a decent retirement    I know that these are trying times for labor  We all know that families have their differences  We all know that disagreement can sometimes be painful  But  always remember that ancient proverb    Me against my brother  but my brother and me against the world  Together we will take on that world because what divides us pales in comparison to what unites us  We stand together in our founding purpose    to improve the lives of workers and their families achieve social and economic justice  We will emerge from these times bigger and stronger than before  and better prepared to take on the challenges of the global economy and guarantee that America s workers are always put first    Make no mistake    there s an organized movement against organized labor  This organized movement is called the Bush Administration  and it stands against working families    against fair wages    against decent health care    against Social Security    against the 40 hour work week    and against over time pay  It stands against all the progress we ve made in bringing fairness and justice to hard working families across America  Together  we will make clear that we have only just begun to fight     So  let the word go forth today from this famous city of Big Shoulders    we are one  We are one in the battle for good jobs and good pay  We are one in the battle for affordable health care and safe workplaces and a fair retirement  We are one in the fight against an Administration that sends America s jobs overseas but sends America s workers pink slips     50 years from now  you ll be celebrating another 50 years of accomplishments for labor  with the AFL CIO leading the way  And  50 years from now  expect the Kennedy family to be here again to say thanks for standing together and fighting for the working men and women who make this country great     Over the years  the labor movement has meant so much to my family  When my brother Jack came back from the war and won election to Congress  they asked him which Committee he wanted to be on  And he said  I want to be on the Labor Committee  so I can work on the issues that really matter to working families  And six years later  when he was elected to the Senate  they asked him  What Senate Committee do you want to be on  And he said  I want to be on the Labor Committee  so I can do even more for working families across America     And when Jack became President and I came to the Senate  they asked me  What Committee do you want to be on  I made it three in a row  I said The Labor Committee too    because I knew it by heart  and I felt it in my heart     It was the same with my brother Bob when he came to the Senate in 1964  and we served together on the Labor Committee for four great years     Later  my nephew Joe was elected to the House and he always voted with labor  And my son Patrick serves today in the House and he always votes with labor     If you add it all up  that s 79 years of Kennedys in Congress    voting with labor      President Kennedy brought his compassion and commitment to working families to the White House as well  One of his first Executive Orders sent aid to West Virginia  because he had seen first hand the tragedy of poverty in mining town after mining town  The New Frontier was also a new era for the labor movement  We need a President and a Congress today who stand with working families too     We all know the difference you make in the lives of average families  Union workers earn 25 percent more than non union workers  They re 40  more likely to have health insurance  They re four times more likely to have a solid pension plan  These and many other long standing advantages of union membership are undisputed  But too many employees who want to become members of a union are unable to do so today  and the reason is shamefully clear  Our labor laws are too weak  Employers don t hesitate to use illegal union busting tactics to intimidate workers  And when they re caught red handed  they simply write off the minor penalties they face as just another cost of doing business  That s wrong    and it s doubly wrong that this GOP Congress won t fix it  Too often  employers discourage it in any way they can  For years  illega l employer tactics have been common whenever employees attempt to form a union  Each year  employers are charged over with over 20 000 instances of violating workplace workers are illegally discriminated against for exercising their labor rights in the workplace  labor rights   In over half of these claims  a worker was punished or even fired for union activity  In a quarter of all organizing campaigns  a worker is fired for supporting the union  Even employees who manage to form a union often can t get a contract  because employers refuse to bargain  America s workers deserve better  American democracy deserves better  As President Kennedy said  Those who would destroy  or further limit  the rights of organized labor    those who cripple collective bargaining or prevent organization of the unorganized    do a disservice to the cause of democracy  Those words hold true today more than ever  At a critical time like this  when we are fighting for our own security and for the basic freedoms of other peoples in other lands  how can we possibly fail to stand up for the basic freedoms of the millions of American workers who depend on us to protect their rights here at home   add more that unions much organize more workers  The key reform I m pushing now in Congress is the Employee Free Choice Act  The issue is very clear    are we willing to level the playing field for employees trying to organize a union or obtain a contract  Wal Mart says no  so Republicans say no  But the American people say yes  and we intend to prevail  When we do  the labor movement will be able at long last to reach out to new communities and organize new members    for this is where the future of the labor movement lies  As we all know too well  the American dream is increasingly at risk for millions of families across the country  But Iin an economy battered by globalization  hard work is not enough to guarantee decent jobs and a decent future     In fact  America s men and women are working harder and harder  And it s time all that hard work started showing up in their paychecks     One figure says it all  Since late 2001  worker productivity and employee wages have both grown  But here s the rub  Labor s productivity has grown 53 times faster than labor s wages  How can anyone possibly call that fair  Hardworking Americans Work Wal Mart wants you to believe that s just the way it is  But we know the truth  All your hard work on the shop floor is going straight into the executive suite  Corporate profits have soared by an astonishing 70 percent since 2001    70 percent  The suits at the top are raking it in  But we say  it s long past time that a fair share started showing up in workers  pay  too  Enough is enough is enough    Look what this White House and its lap dog Republican Congress have done to the minimum wage  It s been stuck at five dollars and fifteen an hour for eight long years  During those eight years  Congress has voted itself seven increases in its own pay  Yet somehow it can t find time to give the hard working Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder the raise they deserve  That s wrong  wrong  wrong     A minimum wage employee working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  makes only  10 700 a year     5 000 below the poverty line for a family of three  I say  in the richest country on the face of the earth  no one who works for a living should have to live in poverty    Every year  We know that wemployees workers are struggling harder and harder hard to balance their family needs and their work responsibilities  But the Bush Administration and the Republican Congress keep putting their thumb on the wrong side of the scale  They make the work family balance even more unfair  by cutting overtime protections for more than six million Americans     You know it  I know it  The American people know it    overtime cuts are pay cuts  When workers lose their overtime protections  employers can force them to work longer and longer hours for no extra pay at all     President Bush and the Republican Congress have even worse up their sleeves  They have been trying want to end the 40 hour work week for millions more Americans  They call their proposal comp time or flex time    we call it a shameful attempt to abolish overtime pay altogether  I say  No way    We have many problems in this country  but one of them is NOT that we re paying our workers too much    Even abolishing overtime pay isn t enough for the Far Right  The President now wants to roll back the protections of the Family and Medical Leave Act  a cornerstone of the nation s support for working families  The hard work of the AFL CIO and the labor movement a decade ago made it possible for President Bill Clinton to sign that Act into law  I intend to fight any and all efforts to weaken family and medical leave  No American should ever be forced to choose between the job they need and the family they love     Wherever we look  the pressures are heavier than ever  Family expenses are soaring  College tuition is up 35 percent  Housing s up 36 percent     Health insurance is up 59 percent and becoming more and more unaffordable for the vast majority of our citizens  On the GOP s watch  the number of uninsured has now climbed to a total of 45 million Americans  We have a moral responsibility to see that all citizens have access to health care    not just any health care  but good health care  Every American should have the same quality of care that s available to the President and every Member of Congress    Every American loves Medicare  Except maybe George Bush  And Karl Rove  And Tom Delay  But the rest of America loves Medicare  So let s stop fiddling while the health care crisis burns so many millions of our people  Instead of handing out more and more tax breaks to the wealthiest corporations and multi millionaires  let s expand Medicare and make it available to all Americans     I call the idea Medicare for All  Let s say it and mean it    no man  woman or child in America should ever again have to worry about the cost of health care  Will you join me in passing Medicare for All     The list goes on  Working families also deserve retirement security  But it s under severe threat  President Bush thinks workers should roll the dice on their retirement  He loves the idea of privatizing Social Security and making workers bet on the stock market  I say  we should have privatized President Bush in the 2004 election  and we ll privatize this GOP Get Old People Congress in 2006    Our private pension system too is in jeopardy  Companies are using the bankruptcy courts to shed their pension plans  Top executives bail out in luxury with their solid gold parachutes  But in this Bush economy  private  Private savings are at an all time low  If we let the President have his way  the three legged stool of a decent retirement    Social Security  private pensions  and individual savings    won t have a leg to stand on savings are at an all time low  and now private pensions are in great jeopardy  too  Companies are cutting employees  pensions by switching to cash balance plans  or even going into bankruptcy  Workers who have dedicated their whole lives to a company have a right to their pensions  Executives shouldn t get a new yacht when their employees are left with a leaky rowboat  Last  but far from the least  I want to mention the coming big decision by the Senate that may well determine what kind of future we have for our own generation  and for our children and our grandchildren  In September  the Senate will be voting on whether John Roberts should have a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court  It s one of the most solemn responsibilities of the Senate  and I take it very seriously    Our generation and generations before us have sacrificed and given their lives for the rights and freedoms we enjoy today  For worker s rights  For women s rights  For civil rights  For disability rights  For immigrants  rights  For the fundamental rights of all our fellow citizens    We ve made real progress  often at great pain and hardship  We need a Supreme Court that will not turn its back on all that s been accomplished at such great prices     I love America  and I know you do  too  We know there is still much work to be done to strengthen our nation    to expand the range of opportunity and progress  and to prepare every American to compete in this global economy and live the American dream anew    I ve met John Roberts  He s a pleasant man and brilliant lawyer  But the Supreme Court is the last line of defense for our freedoms  It has the final say on our fair labor laws and our pension laws     We need a court that understands our history and the role of Congress in dealing with national problems and improving people s daily lives     In recent years  we ve seen the current Court begin to impose new restrictions on the power of Congress to pass laws that protect civil rights  worker s rights  and disability rights  They ve rolled back protections for our seniors  for our children and for our environment  Few things would be worse than to put someone on the highest court in the land who would put these protections at even greater risk     We went through this kind of debate before  It s what the New Deal was all about  The Supreme Court of that day tried to stand in the way  and a huge fight erupted between Congress and the White House over what should be done about The Court  FDR is thought to have lost the battle over his court packing plan but the Supreme Court dramatically changed its mind  and FDR s plan was no longer necessary  Because of the the switch in time that saved nine  we have minimum wage laws  Social Security and Medicare laws  cleaner rivers and lakes  safer workplaces and stronger communities     Now  though  some Justices again want to restrict the power of Congress to ensure basic fairness and protect basic fundamental rights  The question of how Supreme Court Justices interpret Congressional power is not an abstract legal issue  It makes a huge difference in millions of Americans  daily lives  and it s a huge factor in the hearings of John Roberts     For our future    for our children s future    for our nation s future    we need to know whose side Mr  Roberts is on       We know nothing about his real views  and the hints we have so far are not reassuring     In the Senate hearings  we ll question him at length about his views  Will he stand for workers rights and women s rights and civil rights     Will he stand with the workers of America or the Wal Marts of America        When a worker is injured  will he stand with corporations    or with average Americans     When insurance companies deny health care    will he stand with the HMOs or with average Americans     When polluters poison our water and our air  will he stand with the polluters    or with the people    And when Benedict Arnold companies use tax loopholes to send jobs overseas  will he stand with corporations    or will he stand with hard working Americans    That s what we want to know  Whose side is he on  I believe that every American deserves an answer  And I promise you that I ll be there at those hearings every single day  fighting for acceptable answers for every working family in America  Are you with me    Unions have brilliantly brought tens of millions of men and women to reach common goals for the common good  You ve given us the help we need to fight for a better life for all Americans  We have many battles before us  and we need your energy and commitment more than ever  We need you to be a strong and united voice to defend our hard won victories of the past  and bring greater fairness and prosperity in the years ahead  I look forward to our work together in the coming weeks  and I m proud to be by your side  Thank you very much for all you do so well for America and for all Americans     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202
