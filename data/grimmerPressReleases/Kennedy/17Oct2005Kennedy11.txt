         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The following letter was sent to Governor Mitt Romney today by the entire Massachusetts Congressional delegation  Last week  lawmakers urged Governor Romney to declare a state of emergency in Massachusetts due to the massive flooding that has affected Western Massachusetts and the Merrimack Valley  Massachusetts lawmakers urged the governor to request a federal disaster declaration so that federal funds may become available to affected Massachusetts residents and communities    The text of the letter is below  PDF with signatures available upon request    Dear Governor Romney    We are writing to respectfully urge you to make an expedient request for a federal disaster declaration under the Robert T  Stafford Disaster Relief Act  It is urgent for Massachusetts to obtain this declaration as soon as possible  and we believe it is warranted because of the historic nature of this flooding    A federal disaster declaration will provide critical support to those in need of individual assistance  such as temporary housing  home repair  unemployment assistance and crisis counseling  Because of the magnitude of these storms that resulted in flood alerts on all of the Commonwealth s rivers  many communities may be in need of federal public assistance  such as financing the renovation of flood damaged schools  hospitals  municipal buildings  and roads  With a federal disaster declaration  these municipal costs can be reimbursed by the federal government     This declaration will be particularly important to families and communities which may not have the resources to bear the expense of meeting the recovery needs of victims and providing essential repairs to public facilities  Springfield alone has estimated damages of  3 million  and cities across Massachusetts from Taunton to Worcester have incurred substantial expenses  An estimated 30 communities were forced to evacuate some residents as a result of the flooding    You will have our full support in making the federal disaster declaration request to President Bush  and we look forward to working with you to help our communities recover from the storms and resulting flood damage     Many thanks for your consideration of our request    With respect and appreciation                                                     Sincerely   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
