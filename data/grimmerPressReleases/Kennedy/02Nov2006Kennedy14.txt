participate in the Leadership for Social Change Lecture Series   Among our states wonderful higher education institutions  Lesley has emerged as a leader in promoting the values of public service and the idea that each and every one of us can make a difference          The fact that nearly 90  of Lesley graduates enter public service is an inspiration to all of us who believe we have the power in our own hands to build stronger communities  and a more perfect nation for our people          As Robert Kennedy said when he spoke to the students in South Africa in 1966  Each time a person stands up for an ideal  or acts to improve the lot of others  or strikes out against injustice  he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope  and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring  those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance          We know its true  because weve seen it happen time and again   We saw it in the simple and powerful act of defiance by Rosa Parks  who helped ignite the civil rights movement fifty years ago          We see it every day in countless small acts of conscience and courage that prove a truth  that each of us could make a difference  and all of us should try          Thats why they called my brothers generation the Greatest Generation  hundreds of thousands of young men and women came home from World War II  grateful that good had triumphed over evil and committed to helping America live up its highest ideals at home and abroad          They believed in giving of themselves in a world of hope and opportunity   They believed that America could be a beacon to other lands  that there was nothing we couldnt accomplish          They challenged dictators everywhere  so that all peoples could be free   They achieved far reaching nuclear arms control agreements to protect our nation and the world from those devastating weapons          They broke down the walls of racial discrimination through the Civil Rights Acts and the Voting Rights Act  They attacked all forms of discrimination  prejudice  and bigotry in our society          They lifted up tens of millions of fellow citizens weighed down by the crushing burden of poverty   They created Medicare and Medicaid so that senior citizens and low income families would no longer be denied the basic health care they need          They believed education was the key to the American dream  and they did all they could to improve our schools and make college affordable for all          They even found a way to put a man on the moon          That was truly the politics of hope   America lived by the motto of the Army Air Force in World War II  The difficult we do immediately  the impossible takes a little longer          Too often now  we seem to have lost sight of those ideals   We see cynicism replacing hope in the electorate  and political leaders specialize in sowing fear and division          Young men and women are sent off to an endless war that America never should have fought          Hundreds of thousands of fellow Americans were needlessly left behind in the wake of Hurricane Katrina          The rising tide no longer lifts all the boats   Working families and the middle class fall farther behind  as the economic gulf between the haves and the have nots widens out of control          Every day  when children across the country put their hands on their hearts and say the Pledge of Allegiance  they conclude with these majestic words  liberty and justice for all          Is a nation where the top 1  now control more wealth than the bottom 90  of our people the just society we honor in that pledge of allegiance                Is a nation where more of the nations total income flows to the top tenth of 1  of our people than to the entire bottom third of our people the just society we pledge our allegiance to          All around us  we see the politics of hope being replaced by the politics of fear  and we ask  how we can change things          There is a way  and its called committing ourselves to the public square  becoming involved in our communities  speaking out for whats right  whats fair  whats just          Time and again throughout our history  weve learned that we have the capacity to find solutions to our problems   All we have to do is try          Our founders had no model for creating the worlds most enduring democracy   Abraham Lincoln had no formula for preserving the Union during the Civil War          There was no manual for FDR to follow to lift us out of the Great Depression   Harry Truman had no handbook for preventing Western Europe from descending into chaos and communism after World War II          But what they did have at each of these critical moments in our history was Americans ready  willing  and able to serve their fellow citizens and reach out to others  men and women just like all of you today          None of us has all the answers to the challenges that confront us today  but we each have the ability to make a difference   All we need is the will          We do have great challenges before us    How to end this misguided war  bring our courageous forces home in dignity and honor  and provide real security for our people          How to deal with the worsening crisis in health care that now has 46 million Americans without health insurance          How to keep our economy strong in the 21st Century  when other nations are so vigorously challenging our economic leadership          How to make sure that every child has the opportunity to obtain the education they need for the jobs of the future          How to deal with festering energy problems that now threaten the very health of our planet itself          Each of these challenges is daunting  but all of them can be met if we truly devote ourselves to the task          Youre blessed to attend such a wonderful university  with an extraordinary faculty that pushes you to fulfill your potential for yourself  your country  and your planet          In the years ahead  the lessons youve learned here at Lesley  and the people youre meeting and reaching through your coursework and public service  are laying a strong foundation for the lives of public service that so many of you will lead           Our community  our Commonwealth  and our country need you   We need your time  your commitment  your energy  and your enthusiasm  and with them  we will not fail   Thank you all very much
