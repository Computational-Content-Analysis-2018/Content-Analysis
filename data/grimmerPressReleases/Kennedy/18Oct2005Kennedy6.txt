         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today in the second Judiciary Committee hearing on his bill  Senator Edward M  Kennedy discussed the urgent need for comprehensive reform to secure our borders and strengthen our national security  The bipartisan McCain Kennedy bill  Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act is co sponsored by Senators Brownback  Lieberman  Graham  Salazar and Representatives Kolbe  Flake and Gutierrez and has broad support from both labor and business organizations     The U S  Chamber of Commerce  a strong backer of the bill  is hosting Kennedy and McCain in a forum after today s hearing  Because of its common sense approach that addresses the economic realities of our underground immigrant economy  the McCain Kennedy legislation has received strong and diverse support since it was introduced on May 12  2005  Along with the Chamber  over 60 groups have endorsed it and it has received over 60 positive editorials from newspapers across the country  many touting its realistic approach of both strengthen border protection and enforcement while reflecting our best values as a nation    of fairness  equal opportunity  and respect for the law     Especially in these troubling times  our national security and economic vitality are too important to pass half way repairs that look and sound tough  but offer no real solutions or protections  said Senator Kennedy referring to those proposals that only deal with enforcement  We need to mend our broken system once and for all  We need realistic solutions to the huge problem we face  The American people don t want open borders    but they don t want closed borders either  They want fair and effective immigration laws that can actually be enforced  that protect our security  respect our ideals  and honor our heritage as a nation of immigrants     A poll released Monday by the Manhattan Institute demonstrated that eighty four percent of Republican voters believe that it is impossible to deport the 11 million illegal workers who care for our children and our elderly  harvest our crops  and build and clean our homes and office buildings  These voters soundly reject the enforcement only approach  Seventy eight percent support an enforcement plus package combining stricter border security  higher penalties on employers  registration for temporary workers  and a path to eventual citizenship for today s illegal workers  An executive summary of the poll is available at http   www manhattan institute org html immigration_pol_pr htm     Below is Senator Kennedy s full statement in today s hearing  a fact sheet  description of the bill  and the lists of groups and newspapers supporting   Editorials and Letters available upon request     Statement of Edward M  Kennedy Hearing by the Judiciary Committee  Comprehensive Immigration Reform II October 18  2005    As Prepared for Delivery    Congress needs to deal as soon as possible with the problems and challenges of our broken immigration system  and we need to tackle these problems as a whole  Especially in these troubling times  our national security and economic vitality are too important to pass half way repairs that look and sound tough  but offer no real solutions or protections     Yet that is exactly what we will end up with if Congress deals with border security and interior enforcement alone  and fails to reform other huge problems in our immigration laws  As Secretary Chao and Secretary Chertoff both correctly state in their testimony  the effectiveness of border security and interior enforcement is tied to creating legal avenues for workers our economy needs     We need sensible solutions  not feel good empty gestures  Effective reforms must address these three issues together  If we re serious about repairing what s broken  we need to combine increased enforcement and increased legality  Better border control and better treatment of immigrants are consistent with each other  and both are necessary for success    We ve tried enforcement alone in the past and it s failed  In the past 10 years  the government has spent more than  20 billion  tripled the number of border patrol agents  built fences  and adopted other border enforcement laws  Yet  none of our efforts have ever been adequate to halt illegal immigration  for the simple reason that vast numbers of American firms have made a practice of hiring illegal workers to reduce costs and bolster profits  That culture of illegality has become so deeply embedded in our society that to uproot it now would do irreparable damage to our economy     In fact  as a recent report by Professor Douglas Massey of Princeton finds  our border enforcement strategies have backfired  In 2002  we spent  1700 to make each arrest  compared to  300 in 1992  The probability of being caught fell from 20 percent or higher in the mid 1990s to 5 percent in 2002  We re catching fewer people  and it s costing more  Even more perverse  these policies have helped to increase the illegal population  Workers who once came here temporarily and periodically went home are now staying and sending for their families  So those already here are not leaving  and new illegal immigrants keep coming in     We need to mend our broken system once and for all  We need realistic solutions to the huge problem we face  The American people don t want open borders    but they don t want closed borders either  They want fair and effective immigration laws that can actually be enforced  that protect our security  respect our ideals  and honor our heritage as a nation of immigrants    A poll of Republican voters released yesterday emphasizes this point  Eighty four percent of them believe that it is impossible to deport the 11 million illegal workers who care for our children and our elderly  harvest our crops  and build and clean our homes and office buildings  These voters soundly reject the enforcement only approach  Seventy eight percent support an enforcement plus package combining stricter border security  higher penalties on employers  registration for temporary workers  and a path to eventual citizenship for today s illegal workers     The only realistic way for us to know who is here and who is coming here is to combine strict enforcement with realistic reforms in admissions  The best way to help all workers is to eliminate the culture of illegality that undermines wages and working conditions for all workers  We can be both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws    In February  Senator Craig and I introduced the AgJOBS bill  In May  Senator McCain and I introduced the Secure America Act  Both of these bills are offering practical solutions to the difficult problems we face  We combine tough  targeted enforcement with adequate legal channels and proper screening for workers and family members crossing the border     Our goals are consistent with the President Bush s proposal    to bring immigrants out of the shadows  shut down the black markets  and restore the rule of law at our borders  in our workplaces  and in our communities     Our bills offer a genuine alternative    not an amnesty  not a free pass  not an automatic pardon  We offer sensible plans to encourage unauthorized workers to come forward to receive work permits and earn legal status  They will pay a substantial fine and go through rigorous security and criminal background checks  Those who want permanent legal status must pay all their back taxes  learn English  maintain a strong work record  stay out of trouble  and wait their turn     A bipartisan effort is essential to achieve comprehensive immigration reform now  I look forward to working with the Administration  this committee  and my other colleagues to enact responsible and long overdue reforms to solve these difficult problems    Immigration Fact Sheet    The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that our economy requires some 485 000 full time  year round new immigrant workers each year  But current immigration laws provide just 5 000 visas for such workers annually     In the last 10 years  the federal government has spent more than  20 billion to enforce our immigration laws     In the last decade we have tripled the number of border patrol agents and quintupled the enforcement budget  Yet the number of undocumented immigrants living and working in the United States has steadily increased to 10 million     In terms of undocumented immigrants  the United States government does not have the resources to deport the millions who are here  The Center or American Progress tells us that this futile effort would cost at least  206 billion  That s  41 billion a year over five years  This exceeds the entire  34 billion DHS budget for FY 2006     Many sectors of our economy today rely heavily on the hard work and contributions of immigrants  Documented and undocumented immigrants comprise 40  of the jobs in farming  fishing  and forestry  33  in building and grounds maintenance  22  in food preparation and related occupations  and 22  in construction    SECURE AMERICA AND ORDERLY IMMIGRATION ACT  at a Glance 5 12

in addition to application fees  and clear all security  medical  and other checks  Requires updating of America s Job Bank to make sure job opportunities are seen first by American workers  Initial cap on H 5A visas is set at 400 000  but the annual limit will be gradually adjusted up or down based on demand in subsequent years  Visa is valid for three years  and can be renewed one time for a total of 6 years  at the end of the visa period the worker either has to return home or be in the pipeline for a green card  Visa is portable  but if the worker loses his job he has to find another one within 60 days or return home  Ensures that employers hiring temporary workers abide by Federal  state and local labor  employment and tax laws  Prohibits the hiring of temporary workers as independent contractors  Protects temporary workers from abuse by foreign labor contractors or employers   Gives temporary workers and U S  workers remedies for violations of their rights  An employer

Backlog Reduction  Immediate relatives of U S  citizens are not counted against the 480 000 annual cap on family sponsored green cards  thereby providing additional visas to the family preference categories  The current per country limit on green cards is raised slightly to clear up backlogs  Income requirements for sponsoring a family member for a green card are changed from 125  of the federal poverty guidelines to 100   and other obstacles are removed to ensure fairness  The employment based categories are revised to provide additional visas for employers who need to hire permanent
