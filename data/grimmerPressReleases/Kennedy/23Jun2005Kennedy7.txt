         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  this morning in the Armed Services Committee  Secretary Rumsfeld and Generals Myers  Casey  and Abizaid briefed us on the status of the war effort Secretary Rumsfeld said once again that it s a tough road ahead  but that we must persevere  and he sees reasons to be hopeful Secretary Rumsfeld was describing a different war than most Americans are concerned about  The war In Iraq they see is one of mistake after mistake after mistake Whatever our position on the Iraq war  we should all be concerned that the Administration has not handled it competently Secretary Rumsfeld needs to see what the American people see very clearly    the President does not have a winning strategy in Iraq Our troops have been asked to do more with less  Our current strategy isn t working  and the Congress and the American people know it Secretary Rumsfeld insisted today that it s false to say that the Administration is painting a rosy picture  But that s exactly what he continues to do It s time for Secretary Rumsfeld to take off his rose colored glasses and admit to the American people and to our men and women in uniform who are paying the price with their lives for his failures that he has no realistic strategy for success  It s time to level with the American people  instead of continuing to paint an optimistic picture that has no basis in reality because of his failed strategy  It s time for Secretary Rumsfeld to resign Despite the elections last January and the formation of a new transitional Iraq government  many of us are increasingly concerned that the Administration has no effective or realistic plan to stabilize Iraq  It continues to underestimate the strength and deadly resilience of Iraqi insurgency  and it has failedfailed shamefully to adequately protect our troops  More than 1700 American service men and women have been killed in Iraq  so far and over 13 000 more have been wounded  The families of these courageous soldiers know all too well that the insurgents are not desperate  or dead enders  or in their last throes    as Administration officials have repeatedly claimed Indeed  General Casey indicated that the insurgency is around 26  000 strong  an increase over the 5 000 the Pentagon believed were part of the insurgency one year ago As General Myers said in April  the capacity of the insurgents is where they were almost a year ago  General Abizaid told the Committee today that the overall strength of the insurgency is about the same as it was six months ago  Looking ahead  as General Vines said this week  I m assuming that the insurgency will remain at about its current level In the last two months  America has lost an average of three soldiers a day in Iraq and no end is in sight  As General Myers said on May 12  I wouldn t look for results tomorrow One thing we know about insurgencies is that they last fromthree  four years to nine yearsBecause of the war  our military has been stretched to the breaking point  The Department of Defense has had to activate a stop loss policy  to prevent service members from leaving the military as soon as they fulfill their commitment Nearly 50 percent of the persons serving in the regular Armed Forces have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since December 2001  and nearly 15 percent of them have been deployed more than once Thirty six percent of all those serving in the Armed Forces  including in the National Guard and the Reserves  have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since December 2001 The alarm bell about the excessive strain on our forces has been ringing for at least a year and a half  In January 2004  Lieutenant General John Riggs said it bluntly  I have been in the Army 39 years  and I ve never seen the Army as stretched in that 39 years as I have today As Lieutenant General James Helmley  head of the Army Reserve  warned at the end of 2004  the Army Reserve is rapidly degenerating into a  broken  force and is in grave danger of being unable to meet other operational requirements  These continuing deployments are taking their toll not only on our forces in the field but also on their families here at home  The divorce rate is in the active duty military has increased 40 percent since 2000  The war in Iraq and the casualties and the strain on families have seriously undermined the Pentagon s ability to attract new recruits and retain members already serving  Both the regular and reserve components of the Armed Forces are increasingly unable to meet recruitment goals  Major General Michael Rochelle  head of the Army Recruiting Command  stated the problem succinctly in May when he said that this year is the toughest recruiting climate ever faced by the all volunteer Army The severe strain the war is placing on our Armed Forces and on our ability to protect our national security interests in other parts of the world concerns us all The Army has been forced to go to all time new lengths to fill its ranks  In May  it began offering a fifteen month active duty enlistment  the shortest enlistment tour in the history of the Army To recruit and retain more soldiers  the National Guard has increased its retention bonus from  5 000 to  15 000  The first time signing bonus has gone up from  6 000 to  10 000  General Steven Blum  Chief of the Army National Guard  said  Otherwise  the Guard will be broken and not ready the next time it s needed  either here at home or for war In March  the Pentagon announced it was raising the maximum age for Army National Guard recruits from 34 to 39  and was also offering generous new health benefits for Guard and Reserve members activated after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks Despite these facts  Secretary Rumsfeld insisted today that we will not have a broken army as a result of the war We all know that these problems of recruiting and retention cannot be fixed through enlistment bonuses  health benefits  and raising the age of service  These are short term Band Aids on the much larger problem of the war  Only progress in bringing the war to an honorable conclusion will lead to a long term solution to the problem  which is clearly undermining our ability to respond to crises elsewhere in the world Despite claims by the Administration of progress  Iraq is far from stable and secure  We have made very little progress on security since sovereignty was transferred to the interim Iraqi Government one year ago Today  Secretary Rumsfeld insisted we are not stuck in a quagmire in Iraq  He insisted that the idea that what s happening over there is a quagmire is so fundamentally inconsistent with the facts  What planet is he on  Perhaps he is still living in the Mission Accomplished world By last June  852 American servicemembers had been killed in action  Today  the number has doubled to more than 1700 By Last June  5 000 American servicemembers had been wounded in action  Today  the number has more than doubled  to over 13 000 Jacoby told the Armed Services Committee in March that the insurgency in Iraq has grown in size and complexity over the past year  Attacks numbered approximately 25 per day one year ago  Just Last week  General Pace said  the numbers of attacks country wide in Iraq each day is about 50 or 60 A year ago  the United States had 34 Coalition partners in Iraq  Nine of those partners have pulled out in the past year  Today  we have just 25  By the end of the year  another five countries that are among the largest contributors of troops are scheduled to pull out  One year ago 140 000 American troops were serving in Iraq  Today  we have the same number of troops The training of the Iraqi security forces continues to falter  The Administration still has not given the American people a straight answer about how many Iraqi security forces are adequately trained and equipped  They continue to overestimate the number of Iraqis actually able to fight  In the words of the General Accounting Office  U S  government agencies do not report reliable data on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped In February last year  Secretary Rumsfeld preposterously said  We accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces  now more than 200 000 strong  In fact  the numbers of Iraqis who are adequately trained is far lower  As General Meyers conceded a year later  only about 40 000 Iraqi security forces can go anywhere and do anything It is still far from clear how many Iraqi forces are actually capable of fighting without American help and assistance Our reconstruction effort has faltered as well over the last year    and faltered badly  The misery index in Iraq continues to rise  As of June 15  only  6 billion    one third    of the  18 billion provided by Congress last summer for Iraq reconstruction had been spent  The Iraqi people desperately need jobs  But we are unable to spend funds quickly  because the security situation is so dire  Of the amount we do spend  it is far from clear how much is actually creating jobs and improving the quality of life  We need greater focus on small projects to create jobs for Iraqis  not huge grants to multinational corporations that create more profits for corporate executives than stability in Iraq By the State Department s own accounting  up to15  of reconstruction funding is being used to provide security for the reconstruction  That estimate itself may be too low  A Department of Energy analysis this month says that perhaps 40  or more is actually being spent on security  as opposed to actual reconstruction These costs have increased    not decreased    over the past year as insurgent attacks have continued to escalate  We are spending ever increasing amounts of assistance on security to guard against an insurgency that the Vice President insists is in its last throes A joint survey by the United Nations Development Program and the Iraqi Government released last month shows Iraq is suffering from high unemployment  widespread poverty  deteriorating infrastructure  and unreliable water  sewage  sanitation  and electricity services    despite its immense oil wealth and access to water Estimates of the number of unemployed range between 20 and 50  of the population  Every unemployed person is ripe for recruiting by the insurgents  who offer as little as  50 a person for those willing to plant explosives on a highway or shoot a policeman Iraq still suffers heavily from severe electricity shortages  According to the Department of Energy assessment  the causes are numerous  including sabotage  looting  lack of security for workers  disruptions in fuel suppliesA year ago  Iraqis had an average of 12 hours of electricity per day  Today  they have just over 10 hours a day Almost all Baghdad households suffer from an unstable supply  In parts of the city  electricity is turned on for three hours and then turned off for three hours  As a result  29  rely on private generators for electricity  In areas with high incidences of poverty  many families have no alternative supply to turn to Water and sanitation are enormous problems as well  Just this week  water was unavailable in many parts of Baghdad because insurgents blew up the water pipes According to the United Nations Development Program  only 54  of families in Iraq have safe drinking water  and 80  of families in rural areas use unsafe drinking water What happened to all of the oil that was supposed to pay for the costs of reconstruction and drive the recovery of Iraq s economy  Last year  the Iraqi Oil Minister said that 642 attacks on the oil system had cost the economy  10 billion  In 2005  pipelines are still under attack  and analysts believe it will be two to three years before Iraq is able to increase its oil production The Administration has been consistently wrong about Iraq  They wrongly insisted there was no guerilla war  They repeatedly    and wrongly    called the insurgents dead enders who are in their last throes  They repeatedly    and wrongly    sent our service men and women on patrol without proper armor  a shortage that continues in the Marines even today  When Secretary Rumsfeld was challenged about it by a solider to huge applause from the troops on the Secretary s visit to Iraq last December  he arrogantly and callously responded  You go to war with the army you have  They re not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time That response from the troops says it all  Surely  no Secretary of War or Secretary of Defense in our history has ever been so humiliated by his troops or received such a resounding vote of no confidence The Secretary s failed strategy has created an impossible situation for our forces  The Administration has undermined our national security and undermined our ability to protect our national security interests elsewhere in the world Our colleague  Senator Hagel  summed it up brilliantly when he told U S  News and World Report last week  Things aren t getting better  they re getting worse  The White House is completely disconnected from realityIt s like they re just making it up as they go along  The reality is that we re losing in Iraq  Mr  President  next Tuesday marks the one year anniversary of the transfer of sovereignty in Iraq  and to mark the occasion  President Bush will address the nation When he does  all of us hope that he will state a new more realistic and more effective strategy for the United States to succeed in Iraq The war has clearly made America less safe in the world  It has strengthened support for Al Qaeda and made it harder to win the real war against terrorism    the war against Al Qaeda The President needs an effective strategy to accelerate the training of a capable Iraqi security force The President needs an effective strategy to rescue the faltering reconstruction effort and create jobs and hope for the Iraqi people  and neutralize the temptation to join the insurgents The President needs effective strategy for serious diplomacy to bring the international community into Iraq  to support the adoption of a constitution that protects all the people of Iraq He needs an effective strategy is to repair the damage the war has caused to reputation in the world and to our military  Our men and women in uniform deserve no less We are muddling through day by day  hoping for the best  and fearing the worst  Our men and women in uniform deserve betterand so do the American people
