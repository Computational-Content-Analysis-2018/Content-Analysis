         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    The Voting Rights Act was adopted to address systematic and egregious discrimination that endured for over 100 years  We heard testimony yesterday regarding the unfortunate fact that in numerous ways  this discrimination still endures today  Laughlin McDonald  the director of the ACLU s Voting Rights Project provided very recent examples  He testified about a TRO that was just issued last month to potentially discriminatory voting changes made in Randolph County  Georgia  that were not submitted for preclearance  Regrettably  it is not surprising that it may take more than 40 years to eliminate the blight of racial discrimination in voting     The Voting Rights Act combats the ills that are at the core of the 14th and 15th Amendment    racial prejudice  While the remedy is strong  it is appropriate  given the fundamental importance of the right to vote and participate in the political process  As the Supreme Court has held  the electoral franchise is a fundamental right that is preservative of all other rights  We cannot discard lightly the safeguards adopted in the Voting Rights Act  particularly in Section 5 of the Act  The progress we have made has been great  but it has not been complete  and we cannot allow it to be jeopardized or diminished     Today we will be hearing about the Justice Department s efforts to enforce the Voting Rights Act  While I have some concerns about the Justice Department s recent approach to implementing the Act  today we will hear from the Assistant Attorney General about the Justice Department s efforts  and the continuing need for vigorous enforcement  Section 5 has been the Federal Government s most effective tool against voting discrimination  Even after the Act was passed  there was a real and substantial danger that discriminatory decisions by jurisdictions covered by Section 5 would deny or abridge the right to vote  And in fact jurisdictions did adopt a host of voting devices and changes  some subtle and some overt  with the intent to shut minorities out of voting power  Some of those decisions had a discriminatory purpose  some had a discriminatory effect  and others had both  It was because of the work of the Justice Department under Section 5 of the Act that those invidious voting changes were not implemented  and that any progress in political participation was not undone     Taking a long view  historically  the Justice Department has vigorously carried out its Section 5 responsibilities precisely as Congress intended it to  The record we will be examining  and which the House hearings examined closely  indicates that there is a continuing problem with discriminatory decision making with respect to voting by jurisdictions covered by Section 5     Today we will also hear from witnesses who will describe in more detail the concerns about continuing discrimination in some of the jurisdictions covered by Section 5 and Section 203    the minority language sections of the Voting Rights Act  As we have noted  compiling this record is one of the most important purposes of these hearings  and will provide a sturdy foundation for our actions in this most important piece of legislation     In addition  we will specifically be hearing about the role that Section 203 has played in ensuring the right to vote and having that vote counted fully and fairly  Section 203 requires that certain jurisdictions provide for language assistance to American citizens who are limited in their English proficiency  Section 203 directly addresses barriers to voting for Asian Americans  Latinos and Native Americans  and it too is a provision that should not be allowed to expire          I thank the Chairman  and I look forward to hearing today s testimony   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
