         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today we celebrate the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act  one of the great civil rights laws in the nations history  Seventeen years ago  Congress acted on the fundamental principle that people should be measured by what they can do  not what they cant do  The Americans with Disabilities Act began a new era of opportunity for millions of disabled citizens who had been denied full and fair participation in society  For generations  people with disabilities were treated with pity and as persons who deserved charity  not opportunity  Out of ignorance  the nation accepted discrimination for decades  and yielded to fear and prejudice  The passage of the ADA finally ended these condescending and suffocating attitudes  and widened the doors of opportunity for all people with disabilities The anniversary of this landmark legislation is a time to reflect on how far weve come in improving the real life possibilities for the nations 56 million people with disabilities  In fact  the seeds of action were planted long before 1990  In 1932  the United States elected a disabled person to the highest office in the land  and he became one of the greatest Presidents in our history  But even Franklin Roosevelt felt compelled by the prejudice of his times to hide his disability as much as possible  The World War II generation began to change all that   The 1940s and the 1950s introduced the nation to a new class of Americans with disabilities  wounded and disabled veterans returning from war  and finding a society grate for their courage and sacrifice  but relegating them to the sideline of the American Dream  Even before the war ended  however  rehabilitation medicine had been born  Disability advocacy organizations began to grow  Disability benefits were added to Social Security  Each decade since then has brought significant new progress and more change In the 1960s  Congress responded with new architectural standards  so we could have a society everyone could be a part of  No one would have to wait outside a new building because they were disabled   The 1970s convinced us that greater opportunities for fuller participation in society were possible for the disabled  Congress responded with a range of steps to improve the lives of people with mental disabilities as well  We supported the right of children with disabilities to attend public schools  We guaranteed the right of people with disabilities to vote in elections  and we insisted on greater access to cultural and recreational programs in their communities  The 1980s brought a new realization however  that in helping people with disabilities  we cant rely only on government programs  We began to involve the private sector as well  We guaranteed fair housing opportunities for people with disabilities  required fair access to air travel  and made advances in technology available for people hard of hearing or deaf The crowning achievement of these decades of progress was passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  and its promise of a new and better life for every disabled citizen  in which their disabilities would no longer put an end to their dreams   As one eloquent citizen with a disability said  I do not wish to be a kept citizen  humbled and dulled by having the state look after me  I want to take the calculated risk  to dream and to build  to fail and to succeed  I want to enjoy the benefits of my creations and face the world boldly  and say  this is what I have done   Our families  our neighbors  and our friends with disabilities have taught us in ways no books can teach  The inclusion of people with disabilities enriches all our lives  Every day  my son Teddy  who lost his leg at the age of 12  continues to teach me everyday the greatest lesson of all  that disabled does not mean unable  As the saying goes  when people are excluded from the social fabric of a community  it creates a hole  and when there is a hole  the entire fabric is weaker  It lacks the strength that diversity brings  The fabric of our nation is stronger today than it was 17 years ago  because people with disabilities are no longer left out and left behind  And because of that  America is a greater and better and fairer nation  Today  in this country  we see the many signs of the progress that mean so much in our ongoing efforts to include persons with disabilities in every aspect of life  the ramps beside the steps  the sidewalks with curb cuts to accommodate wheelchairs  the lifts for helping disabled people to take a bus to work or the store or a movie  Disabled students are no longer barred from schools and denied education  They are learning and achieving at levels once thought impossible  They are graduating from high schools  enrolling in universities  joining the workforce  achieving their goals  enriching their communities and their country    They have greater access than ever to the rehabilitation and training needed to be successfully employed and become productive  contributing members of their communities  With the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act in 1999  we finally linked civil rights much more closely to health care  It isnt civil and it isnt right to send a disabled person to work without the health care they need and deserve  These milestones show that we are continuing the way to fulfilling the promise of a new  better  and more inclusive life for citizens with disabilities  but we still have a way to go  Today  as we rightly look back with pride  we also need to look ahead with hope and dedication  We still face many challenges  especially in areas such as health care and in home based and community based services and support  Many persons with disabilities still do not have the services and support they need to make choices about how best to live their lives  Many are unwillingly confined to institutions or unable to have a financial plan for their future A strong Medicare prescription drug benefit is essential for all people with disabilities  Today  about one in six Medicare beneficiaries  over six million people  are persons with disabilities under aged 65  Over the next ten years that number is expected to increase to 8 million  These persons are much less likely to be able to obtain or afford private insurance coverage  Many of them are forced to choose between buying groceries  paying their mortgage  or paying for their medication    Families raising children with significant disabilities deserve health care for their children  No family should be forced to go bankrupt  live in poverty  or give up custody of their disabled child in order to get needed health care for disabled child  They deserve the right to buy in to Medicaid  so that their family can stay together and stay employed  Congress did its job  and now every state should do its part under the Family Opportunity Act  adopted in 2005  People with disabilities and older Americans need community based assistance as well  so they can live at home with their families and in their communities  We need to pass the CLASS Act to ensure this support is available  without forcing families into poverty  Its a challenge for the nation  and we need to work together to meet it   The Americans with Disabilities Act was an extraordinary milestone in the pursuit of the American dream  Many disability and civil rights leaders in communities throughout the country worked long and hard and well to achieve it   To each disabled American  I say thank you  It is all of you who are the true heroes of this achievement  and who will lead us in the fight to keep the ADA strong in the years ahead Sadly  the Supreme Court has not been on our side  In the past seventeen years  it has restricted the intended scope of the ADA  Suppose youre a person with epilepsy in a job you love and you get excellent personnel reviews  Youre taking medicine that controls the seizures and you have no symptoms  But your employer finds out you have epilepsy and fires you  Should you be able to sue your employer for discrimination   Or suppose youre a person with Down Syndrome  doing a fantastic job at the local Wal Mart  but the manager really doesnt want someone with Down Syndrome greeting the public  Should you be able to sue for discrimination  or are you no longer even covered under the ADA  Congress intended full protection from discrimination  but the courts are ruling differently  It is time now to restore the intent of the ADA   The Supreme Court continues to carve out exception after exception in the ADA  But discrimination is discrimination  and no attempt to blur that line or write exceptions into the law should be tolerated  Congress wouldnt do it  and its wrong for the Supreme Court to do it  The ADA was a spectacular example of bipartisan cooperation and success  Passed by overwhelming majorities in both the House and the Senate  Republicans and Democrats alike took rightful pride in the goals of the law and its many accomplishments    I know that the first President Bush  Senator Bob Dole  Senator Harkin  and many other Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle consider their work on the ADA to be among their finest accomplishments in public service  Its widely regarded today as one of the giant steps in our ongoing two centuries old civil rights revolution The need for that kind of bipartisan cooperation is especially critical today as Congress embarks on restoring the ADA to its original intent  so that the rights of those with disabilities are protected  not violated  Today  more than ever  disability need no longer mean the end of the American dream  Our goal is to banish stereotypes and discrimination  so that every disabled person can realize the dream of working and living independently  and becoming a productive and contributing member of our community That goal should be the birthright of every American  and the ADA opened the door for every disabled American to achieve it A story from the debate on the ADA eloquently made the point  A postmaster in a town was told to make his post office accessible  The building had 20 steep steps leading up to a revolving door at the only entrance  The postmaster questioned the need to make such costly repairs  He said  Ive been here for thirty five years  and in all that time  Ive yet to see a single customer come in here in a wheelchair  As the Americans with Disabilities Act has proved so well  if you build the ramp  they will come  and they will find their field of dreams   So lets ramp up our own efforts across the country  We need to keep building those ramps  no matter how many steps stand in the way  We will not stop today or tomorrow or next month or next year  We will not ever stop until America works for all Americans I ask all of us in Congress join today in committing to keep the ADA strong  It is an act of conscience  an act of community  and above all  an act of continued hope for a better future for our country as a whole
