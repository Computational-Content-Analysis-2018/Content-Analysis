         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                  CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633   Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy urged college students nation wide to consolidate their student loans before interest rates jump almost 2 percentage points on July 1st  This increase will be one of the largest single year increases in the 40 year history of the federal student loan programs  Because changes in law that will limit loan consolidation options for student borrowers will also become effective on July 1  Senator Kennedy urges students to consolidate to take advantage of current law and interest rates    As the costs of college continue to skyrocket  more and more students are graduating deep in debt  Congress must do more to reduce interest rates and expand benefits for students and families in order to make college more affordable for all Americans  In the meantime  I urge students to lock in today s lower rates by consolidating their student loans before July 1st    Currently  over nine million people are borrowing Stafford loans  and 73  of graduates from private 4 year colleges and 62  of graduates from public 4 year colleges have student loan debt  Loan consolidation enables students to pay off their current loans  which may have different and variable rates  with the proceeds of a single  new loan at a fixed interest rate instead of multiple payments  Consolidated loans also allow students to lock in today s lower interest rates for the duration of the loan     Below is a letter Senator Kennedy released to students nationwide    May 11  2006   Dear Student Loan Borrower    On July 1st  interest rates on variable rate federal student loans will rise by nearly 2 percentage points  one of the largest single year increases in the 40 year history of the federal student loan program  Changes in the law will take effect on that date as well  which will limit the option of loan consolidation for student borrowers  If you have not already consolidated your student loans to lock in a fixed interest rate  I strongly urge you to consider doing so quickly  before the rates go up and the changes take effect    The loan consolidation option was enacted by Congress in 1986 for students who leave college with multiple student loans  The consolidated loan benefit enables them to pay off their current loans  which may have different and variable rates  with the proceeds of a single  new loan at a fixed interest rate     Under a consolidated loan  instead of making multiple payments  a borrower makes only one payment a month  The consolidated loan also locks in today s lower interest rate for the life of the loan  The combination of these two advantages makes it easier for students to keep loan payments on track and avoid costly delinquency or default charges     For most recent borrowers who consolidate their student loans before July 1st  the relevant fixed interest rate is 5 38   If you are considering consolidation and complete your application while still in college or within 6 months after graduation  but before June 30  you are entitled to an additional reduction under the Direct Loan Consolidation Program  which could bring your interest rate down to 4 75   You can reduce that rate by an additional 0 25 percentage point if you enroll in the automatic payment program     The Direct Loan Program also offers an Income Contingent Repayment Plan  which enables you to link loan repayments to your salary  to help you manage the repayments more easily  Many Federal Family Education Loan lenders offer the same generous interest rate as the Direct Loan Program and other benefits for borrowers     I opposed the changes Congress made in the law in February to restrict the consolidation options that borrowers now have  I m working in Congress to reverse these changes before they take effect on July 1st  and to provide additional options to reduce the cost of student loans  Current law  for example  does not allow borrowers to reconsolidate    i e   refinance    a consolidated student loan  but it should  Borrowers who consolidated their loans at higher interest rates in the past deserve to be able to refinance their loans again when interest rates go down  just as homeowners take advantage of lower rates by refinancing their mortgages    I m also working to reduce interest rates for all student loan borrowers  Lenders are making record profits under the government s college loan program  and restricting student loan benefits is an unfair way to reduce the federal budget deficit     According to the Congressional Budget Office  federal student loan interest rates are projected to rise this July and remain at that level each July in the near future  According to the Congressional Research Service  the fixed interest rate benefit today saves over  2 100 for typical  new student borrowers over the life of their college loans    Please take a few minutes to see if student loan consolidation is an option for you  Even borrowers who have only one federal student loan may be eligible to use the loan consolidation benefit to lock in today s lower interest rate  You can call 1 800 557 7392 or TDD 1 800 557 7395 or go to http   www ed gov offices OSFAP DirectLoan consolid2 html to obtain specific information about your potential savings  I urge you to take advantage of this important opportunity while there is still time to do it      With best wishes for the future        Sincerely        Edward M  Kennedy  Laura Capps
