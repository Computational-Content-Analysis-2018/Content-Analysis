who are under threat of persecution     WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senators Edward M  Kennedy  Gordon Smith  Sam Brownback  and Joe Lieberman were joined by Grover Norquist  President of Americans for Tax Reform  David Keene  Chairman of the American Conservative Union  and Sgt  Joe Seemiller  to urge Senate action on an amendment to assist Iraqi refugees     Senator Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration  Border Security  and Refugees  held the first Congressional hearing on Iraqi refugees in January of 2007 and has led the charge for the U S  to help solve this emerging crisis        America has a strong obligation to keep faith with the Iraqis who have worked so bravely with us  and have often paid a terrible price for it   Regardless of where we stand on the war with Iraq  we are united in our belief that America has a fundamental obligation to assist the Iraqis who have courageously supported our forces and our effort in Iraq and whose lives are in peril as a result  The target of the assassins bullet is now on their back  and our government has a responsibility to try to save their lives    Senator Kennedy said   We cannot afford to continue to jeopardize the lives of one of our most valuable and essential partners in Iraq     the Iraqi people who bravely support us in the face of constant fear and danger                        The bill addresses the massive refugee crisis unfolding in Iraq  Already more than 4 million Iraqis have fled the country  and nearly 2 million more have been displaced internally    Senator Kennedy believes that while the U S  cannot take all of these refugees  we have an obligation to lead an international effort to solve this crisis      The amendment is cosponsored by Senators Kennedy  Smith  Brownback  Lieberman  Biden  Hagel  Leahy  Snowe  Durbin  Feinstein  Obama  Menendez  Levin and Voinovich      Senator Kennedys remarks  a summary of the legislation  a section by section  letters of support  and recent press accounts supporting the bill are below       As Prepared for Delivery      Its an honor to be here with my Senate Colleagues  Senators Brownback  Smith  and Lieberman  Sgt  Seemiller  and with Grover Norquist and Dave Keene of the American Conservative Union      Regardless of where we stand on the war with Iraq  we are united in our belief that America has a fundamental obligation to assist the Iraqis who have courageously supported our forces and our effort in Iraq and whose lives are in peril as a result     The target of the assassins bullet is now on their back  and our government has a responsibility to try to save their lives       These brave men and women are Iraqi nationals who work alongside our military  who staff our Embassy  and who work with American firms and non governmental organizations to support the diplomatic  military  political and economic reconstruction of Iraq   Their support and loyalty have cost too many lives already  and their families have been threatened as well   They have lost their homes  their livelihoods  their families and friends   Millions have been forced to flee their communities or even their country because of the danger        The United  States has a clear responsibility to support these brave Iraqis who have stood by us and who want to come to the United States   America owes them immense gratitude  and many American servicemen and women and government employees owe them their lives as well       Our response to their urgent need has been far too slow and halting      Earlier this year  State Department officials pledged to the world that 25 000 Iraqi refugees could be processed this year   Then they said America would resettle 7 000   Later  the promise was reduced to 2 000   With only a few days remaining in the fiscal year  less than 1 000 refugees have been admitted to the United States   We need a far more effective and expeditious response       Obviously  America cannot resettle all Iraqi refugees   But America must keep the faith with the brave Iraqis whose lives are in mortal danger because of their association with the United  States in Iraq       Our amendment eliminates the current requirement that Iraqi refugees associated with the United States must apply to the United Nations before our government will consider their applications   It enables them to apply for refugee status in Iraq  and it expedites the process for those in danger because of their association with the United States       It does not require the Administration to admit a specific number of Iraqi refugees   That number will be determined annually through consultation between the Administration and Congress  All Iraqi refugees seeking admission must be screened through new Department of Homeland Security procedures      Our proposal also acknowledges the sacrifices of Iraqi men and women working directly for the United States by making 5000 special immigrant visas available to those who have worked with our government for a year  In addition  the bill requires the establishment of appropriate mechanisms at the State Department to coordinate Iraqi refugee applications and to monitor progress in resolving the overall Iraqi refugee crisis      We cannot afford to continue to jeopardize the lives of one of our most valuable and essential partners in Iraq     the Iraqi people who bravely support us in the face of constant fear and danger                                  Summary Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act S  1651  amendment  2872      More than 2 million Iraqis have fled Iraq  facing extended waits for the chance to apply for resettlement in the United States and elsewhere  and another 2 million Iraqis have been displaced in Iraq  Host countries  such as Jordan and Syria  are straining to maintain basic services  but the sheer volume of refugees has made it increasingly difficult to continue to provide assistance   Much of the problem lies in bureaucratic delays and red tape   The Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act would cut through that red tape  ensuring that resolving the Iraqi refugee crisis becomes a higher priority   The legislation does not change any eligibility requirements or change the already rigorous security screenings conducted before the U S  grants refugee status   It also requires enhanced reporting to Congress on many refugee issues to ensure that resolving this crisis remains a priority      Prioritizing Refugee Claims where Persecution is Based on U S  ties    The current refugee processing program requires Iraqis to go through a lengthy referral process conducted by the United Nations   They must flee Iraq and apply in Jordan  Syria  or elsewhere   The bill would give Iraqis whose persecution is based on their service or ties to the United States the ability to apply directly to our government in Iraq  eliminating months of delay and saving lives in the process      Special Immigrant Visa  A special immigrant visa is established for Iraqis who were employed by or worked for or directly with the United States government in Iraq for at least a year in or after 2003   Five thousand special immigrant visas are available to principal applicants in this program for five years beginning after date of enactment   The program is modeled on the existing program run through the Department of Defense         Enhanced Visibility and Coordination   The State Department is required to establish minister counselor positions in Baghdad and other locations to coordinate the SIV and P 2 refugee program   State is also charged with assisting those countries currently hosting refugees and working with the international community to assist in the resettlement of refugees      Denial or Termination of Asylum   An asylum applicant whose claim was denied solely on the basis of changed country conditions on or after March 1  2003  when U S  military action was initiated  is given six months to file a motion to reconsider      Section By Section Summary  Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act Senate Amendment   2872   to H R  1585 Department of Defense Authorization     CO SPONSORS   Kennedy  Smith  Lieberman

who are members of a religious or minority community and identified by the Department of state as a persecuted group and have sons  daughters  parents  spouses  or children in the United   States           Other groups the Secretary of State may identify     Section 1544  Special Immigrant Visa  A special immigrant visa is established for Iraqis who were employed by or worked for or directly with the United States government in Iraq for at least a year in or after 2003   The Iraqi must document his her faithful service through a positive evaluation or documentation   5 000 special immigrant visas are available to principal applicants in this program for five years beginning after date of enactment   These 5 000 visas do not count against worldwide numerical limitations   Visas that are not used in a fiscal year are carried over   Spouses and children or principal applicants are not counted against the 5 000 cap         Iraqis who receive special immigrant visas under this program receive the same resettlement benefits as refugees and are not subject to public charge provisions   Applicants under this SIV program are not charged application fees and the State Department  in consultation with other relevant agencies  must ensure that those who receive special immigrant visas are provided with an Iraqi passport appropriate for them to enter the United States   If applicants to the program are in imminent danger  the State Department  in consultation with other appropriate agencies  must provide them protection or immediately remove them from Iraq   Iraqis may not participate in the program if they do not fulfill the security criteria set out in the INA   This SIV program does not affect separate the SIV program for Iraqi and Afghan translators and interpreters      Section 1545  Minister Counselors for Iraqi refugees and Internally Displaced Persons   The State Department is required to establish a minister counselor position in Baghdad who is responsible for the SIV and P 2 refugee program  including in country processing   This minister counselor would also have the authority to refer individuals to the U S  refugee resettlement program   The State Department would be required to designate minister counselors in Cairo  Amman  Damascus and Beirut to oversee the P 2 program      Section 1546   Countries with Significant Populations of Displaced Iraqis   The State Department is charged with consulting with other countries regarding resettlement of vulnerable Iraqi refugees and assisting countries hosting large Iraqi refugee populations as appropriate  except where prohibited by U S  laws  in developing mechanisms in and providing assistance to ensure the well being and safety of Iraqi refugees in their country   In drawing up the annual presidential determination on refugee resettlement  State is also required to consult with NGOs that have a presence in Iraq or have experience in assessing the problems facing Iraqi refugees   Iraqis remain eligible for refugee status even if they have filed a special immigrant visa or immediate relative petition       Section 1547   Denial or Termination of Asylum   An asylum applicant whose claim was denied solely on the basis of changed country conditions on or after March 1  2003  when U S  military action was initiated  is given six months to file a motion to reconsider      Section 1548   Reports   Within 90 days from enactment of the legislation  DHS must report to the Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees of the House and Senate regarding 1  plans to expedite processing Iraqi refugees for resettlement including through temporary expansion of the USCIS Refugee Corps and 2  plans for enhancing background and security check systems for Iraqi SIV and Iraqi Priority 2 refugees to support immigration security and provide for the orderly processing of applications without delay      Within 90 days after enactment of the legislation and annually thereafter  the President must submit a report to Congress on 1  the resources necessary to implement the act  2  the number of Iraqis who were employed by or worked directly for or directly with the United States government in Iraq  3  and the number of these Iraqis who have applied for special immigrant visas  the date of their applications  and an explanation of why any of these visas pending for more than six months have not been expeditiously processed      Section 1549  Appropriations   Authorizes appropriations necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act   The Refugee Crisis  The Washington Post  Sunday  August 12  2007  Page B06  AS MANY AS 110 000 Iraqis may be targeted as collaborators for helping U S   coalition or foreign reconstruction efforts  These Iraqis and their families are frequently at risk of kidnapping  murder and persecution  At least 257 translators have already been killed  according to Human Rights First   As a result  the U N  High Commissioner for Refugees  UNHCR  has referred more than 8 000 Iraqis to the United States for resettlement this year alone  Yet fewer than 200 have been admitted  This embarrassingly slow trickle of resettled refugees    Sweden takes more than 1 000 each month    motivated Ryan C  Crocker  the U S  ambassador in Baghdad  to write a cable last month urging the administration to guarantee visas for all Iraqis helping the United States      The obstacles Iraqis face to be recommended by the UNHCR make these low resettlement rates all the more astonishing  Iraqis cannot apply for refugee status from within Iraq  they must first brave the dangers of crossing a border  If they make it  those fleeing violence and persecution may also find that because of a broad legal provision disqualifying refugees who have provided material support to terrorist organizations they can be denied resettlement in the United States if they have paid ransoms for kidnapped relatives  According to Human Rights First  in some cases involving kidnappings the UNHCR has decided not to refer even deserving applicants to the United States out of concern that the irrational material support provision will bar them from entry   Bills introduced by Rep  Earl Blumenauer  D Ore   and Sen  Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   could help oil the American refugee processing machine  The bills would set up processing facilities in Iraq  establish Iraqi refugee coordinators at U S  embassies in the region and authorize more funding  Both would create a special immigrant visa category for Iraqis who have worked for the United States  allowing them to apply for resettlement from within Iraq and without having to go through the UNHCR  The House bill also revises the material support provision to exempt cases in which the support was provided under duress   Both bills also would require the United  States to better assist Iraq s neighbors  which have absorbed more than 2 million refugees at great cost to their own economic and social stability  The State Department has taken some steps in this direction  including its recent pledge to help fund a UNHCR UNICEF program subsidizing schooling for displaced Iraqi children   We urge legislators to support these bills  No matter one s opinion on the war  this humanitarian crisis needs to be confronted and fixed      http   www nytimes com 2007 09 01 opinion 01sat2 html _r 1oref slogin  Editorial  Published  September 1  2007  Of all the Iraqis jaded by the failure of the United States invasion  few are more fearful than the tens of thousands who worked loyally for the American war effort but now find themselves hunted as traitors by militant gunmen    The Bush administration only lately stepped up the effort to offer them special refugee status  but it turns out that very few are able to safely apply  Its too dangerous to process them within Iraq  so these harrowed workers must risk expensive trips to Jordan and Syria to apply at American Embassies  It is a classic Catch 22 that has many hiding in terror in their home neighborhoods    The existing program should be open to the 69 000 Iraqis who work on Pentagon contract jobs  from interpreters to cleaners to security guards  But only a few hundred have been able to run the gantlet to sign up  The plight of the hounded Iraqis was graphically reported in The Times this week by Sabrina Tavernise and David Rohde    They found no comprehensive tally of those slain for working for the war effort  but they tracked grisly chunks of the death toll  280 murdered interpreters at one Pentagon contractor  more than 120 Iraqis slain in Baghdad for working on local government and neighborhood efforts to realize the American promise of democracy  Ali Saleh  an interpreter who saw eight colleagues slain during his four years on an American job  quavered with his family in Baghdad  terrified to leave the house  let alone Iraq  He feared being fingered by guards at the borders to Jordan and Syria  where the tide of two million Iraqi refugees already on the road is overwhelming    Washingtons debt to its war employees is profound  Administration officials concede this moral obligation  but so far a mere trickle is the result  Only 190 Iraqis of any sort were settled in the United States since last October  and 2 000 more is the goal by the end of September  The administration and Congress must quickly find safer  faster ways to get more of the targeted American workers to sanctuary  This obligation is on a par with the combat soldiers commitment to abandon no buddy on the battlefield      Crocker Blasts Refugee Process     Iraqis Could Wait 2 Years for Entry  Ambassador Says  By Spencer S  Hsu and Robin Wright  Washington Post Staff Writers  Monday  September 17  2007  A01     The U S  ambassador to Iraq warned that it may take the U S  government as long as two years to process and admit nearly 10 000 Iraqi refugees referred by the United Nations for resettlement to the United States  because of bureaucratic bottlenecks      In a bluntly worded State Department cable titled Iraqi Refugee Processing  Can We Speed It Up  Ambassador Ryan C  Crocker noted that the Department of Homeland Security had only a handful of officers in Jordan to vet the refugees      Bush administration officials in Washington immediately disputed several of Crocker s claims      Still  the sensitive but unclassified memo  sent Sept  7  laid out a wrenching  ground level view of the U S  government s halting response to Iraq s refugee crisis  Human rights groups and independent analysts say thousands of desperate Iraqis who have worked alongside Americans now find themselves the targets of insurgents and sectarian militias  prompting many of them to seek residency in the United States or Europe      Although the subject was little addressed during Crocker s and Gen  David H  Petraeus s public testimony to Congress last week on the state of the war  the envoy has raised the issue in two cables in the past two months  The subject is likely to be discussed when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice meets this week with congressional leaders to outline the administration s refugee admissions goals for 2008 and when the Senate resumes its Iraq war debate      About 2 million Iraqis are displaced inside Iraq  and an estimated 2 2 million more have fled to Syria  Jordan and other neighboring countries  where they are straining local resources and threatening to destabilize host communities  the United Nations has reported  With 60 000 Iraqis fleeing their homes each month  Jordan largely closed its borders to Iraqis earlier this year  and Syria said yesterday that it will begin requiring visas for Iraqis at the conclusion of Ramadan next month  essentially closing off exit routes from the country      In response  the U S  government has provided more than  122 million in refugee aid to Iraq s neighbors this year  and U S  allies are accepting tens of thousands of refugees  Washington also has expanded from 50 to 500 an annual quota on visas for Iraqis working as interpreters and translators for the U S  Embassy and military  and in February it promised to process 7 000 refugees by Sept  30  although U S  officials later said they expected only 2 000 to be admitted to the United   States by then      In his missive  Crocker said the admission of Iraqi refugees to the United States remains bogged down by major bottlenecks resulting from security reviews conducted by the departments of State and Homeland Security  Applicants must wait eight to 10 months from the time they are referred to U S  authorities by the U N  refugee agency before they set foot in the United   States  he said      Resettlement takes too long  Crocker wrote      Each DHS case officer in Jordan can interview only four cases a day on average because of the in depth questioning required  and just a handful of officers were in the region  partly because Syria refuses to issue visas to DHS personnel  Crocker said  It would take this team alone almost two years to complete interviews on 10 000 U N  referrals  he estimated      As more Iraqis flee  he noted  delays are likely to grow considerably      Refugees who have fled Iraq continue to be a vulnerable population while living in Jordan and Syria  he wrote  The basis for       resettlement is the deteriorating protection environment in these countries      Crocker suggested fast tracking security checks for Iraqis  doubling the number of interviewing officers in Jordan and continuing to push Syria to issue visas  But he also suggested what he called real alternatives  such as allowing State Department officers to conduct interviews  arranging DHS interviews by video from Washington or allowing Iraqis who work for the U S  Embassy to go through the process in Iraq  instead of outside the country      In a letter to Crocker the following day  Emilio T  Gonzalez  director of U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  wrote that the ambassador s cable does not reflect an accurate picture of DHS s commitment or performance to date  Gonzalez disputed many of Crocker s points and blamed the State Department  which has overall responsibility for the U S  refugee program  and its partner agents  called Overseas Processing Entities  They handle initial security screening  medical examinations  sponsorships and orientation for applicants      It is the OPE s capacity to prescreen the Iraqi cases       that has been driving the pace of the Iraqi program  Gonzalez wrote  I can assure you categorically that USCIS has sent refugee officers to conduct every interview requested by State      Gonzalez acknowledged that Syria is a problem  but he said authorities have cut processing time for cases to four to six months  not the eight to 10 months cited by Crocker  Paul Rosenzweig  a DHS deputy assistant secretary for policy  also disputed the idea of a two year backlog  saying the administration expects to be able to process 12 000 refugees next year and has ramped up operations quickly      But progress to date has been slow  Since February  the office of the U N  High Commissioner on Refugees has referred about 10 000 Iraqis to the U S  refugee program   The State Department  however  has admitted just 829 Iraqis this fiscal year  which ends Sept  30  and officials caution that they may admit only about 1 750 by the end of the year      Since 2003  the year of the U S  invasion  the United States has admitted 1 521 Iraqi refugees      A spokesman for Ellen R  Sauerbrey  the assistant secretary of state for population  refugees and migration  declined to comment on internal deliberations  In an e mail obtained by The Washington Post  she agreed with DHS s corrections to many errors in Crocker s cable      Several State Department officials said Crocker s intention was to galvanize Washington to meet expectations and called any mistakes honest misunderstandings based on his perception in the field      The numbers are not where we hoped they d be  a State Department diplomat said      Amelia Templeton  spokeswoman for Human Rights First  which provided a copy of the cable to The Post  praised Crocker s clear sighted analysis of the plight faced by Iraqis whose lives are in limbo and who are running out of money  but expressed disappointment about talk and not much substance from the administration on refugee resettlement      What we ve seen consistently in all of this is State trying to point to  the U N  refugee agency  as the point of delay  DHS pointing to State    everyone is sort of pointing fingers  and nobody is taking responsibility for getting people here in a timely fashion  she said      In the Senate  Sen  Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   will propose attaching legislation backed by a dozen lawmakers in both parties to a defense authorization bill this week  it would expand refugee and immigrant visa programs for Iraqis  including those threatened because they helped U S  reconstruction efforts      Ambassador Crocker s plea for help is the latest reminder that the administration has failed to adequately address the enormity of this situation  Kennedy said in a statement  vowing to cut through the red tape  He added  While we can t solve the problem alone  the least we can do is our part to allow those at risk to resettle here         Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
