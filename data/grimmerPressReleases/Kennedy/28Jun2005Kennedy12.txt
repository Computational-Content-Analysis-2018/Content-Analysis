         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Our men and women in uniform are serving ably in Iraq under enormously difficult circumstances  The policy of our government must be worthy of their sacrifice  Unfortunately  it is not  It is adrift  and the American people know it Our soldiers in Iraq need more than assurances of progress from the President  They need an effective plan to end the violence  bring peace and stability to Iraq  and return home with dignity and honor Unfortunately  the President did not level with our troops and the American people and offer an effective strategy for success Reality is hard medicine to swallow  Facts  as John Adams once said  are stubborn things  President Bush refuses to face the facts and accept them I say this with deep sorrow and regret for our servicemen and women  their families  and friends  They deserve more    much more SCORECARDIMPLEMENTATION OF KENNEDY S POLITICAL AND MILITARY PROPOSALSSince the fall of 2002  during the Administration s ramp up to the war in Iraq  Senator Kennedy has called on the President to not rush to war but take the time to put forth an effective strategy to assure success in Iraq  Out of sorrow and grief for our military family and friends  and out of concern for the national security of this country  Senator Kennedy has consistently called on the President to offer an effective strategy to win in Iraq and to bring our troops home with honor  Senator Kennedy has put forth policies to accelerate the training of a capable Iraqi security force  to rescue the faltering reconstruction effort  and to bring the international community that protects all the people of Iraq Below is a scorecard of the political and military proposals Kennedy has made and the results of what has occurred Political Strategy KENNEDY PROPOSAL  Unless the Sunni and all the other communities in Iraq believe they have a stake in the outcome and a genuine role in drafting the new Iraqi constitution  the election could lead to greater alienation  greater escalation  and greater death    for us and for the Iraqis RESPONSE  The Bush administration is now encouraging Europe  the Arab World and the United Nations to pressure the Baghdad government to include minorities in the political process  There was a meeting on June 22 in Brussels that was attended by Envoys from 80 countries  including a 40 plus member Iraq delegation   the United Nations  the World Bank  Rice also went to Iraq on May 15th  Her message  to greatly increase the involvement of Sunni Arabs in writing the Iraqi Constitution KENNEDY PROPOSAL  The United Nations  not the United States  should provide assistance and advice on establishing a system of government and drafting a constitution  An international meeting    led by the United Nations and the new Iraqi Government    should be convened immediately in Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East to begin that process RESPONSE  In accordance with Resolution 1546  a technical assistance support team at the UN is helping with the Iraqi constitution  On June 10th  they reiterated their support for the process  saying that UN will play a legal role and will back up the Iraqi National Assembly in drafting the constitution  They also recently pledged to set up a consultancy office in Baghdad to assist in the process KENNEDY PROPOSAL  If we want Iraq to develop a stable  democratic government  America must assist    not control    the newly established government RESPONSE With the support of the United States Government  in a May 24  letter to the President of the Security Council  the Iraqi Foreign Minister Hohyar Zebari asked for an extension of the mandate for troops in Iraq writing  the Transitional Government of Iraq formally request the council to allow for the confusion of this mandate until the completion of the political process endorsed by the Council in this same resolution  or until Iraq can provide for its security on its own KENNEDY PROPOSAL The Shiites must also understand that America s support is not open ended and that America s role is not to defend an Iraqi government that excludes or marginalizes important sectors of Iraqi society  It is far too dangerous for the American military to take sides in a civil war RESPONSE We have an open ended commitment  In terms of how long we ll be there  as long as necessary  and not one day more  President Bush April 13  2004KENNEDY PROPOSAL America must adjust to the reality that not all former Baathists will be excluded from Iraqi political life in the new Iraq RESPONSE Some former Baathists are now being allowed back with proper vetting  On May 15  Secretary Rice cautioned the Iraqis that de Baathification    the process Shiite hard liners favor of purging the government and the new armed forces of all who served at senior levels under Saddam Hussein    should not be so severe as to impede the creation of an   inclusive   government KENNEDY PROPOSAL If Iraqis wish to negotiate with insurgents who are willing to renounce their violence and join the political process  we should let them do so RESPONSE The U S  military in Iraq has been holding face to face meeting with some Iraqi leaders of the insurgency  Other parts of the U S  government including the State Department and the CIA  have also been holding secret meeting with Iraqi insurgent factions in an effort to stop the violence and coax them into the political process  On June 26  2005  Rumsfeld acknowledged that there is no military solution to ending the insurgency and that the talks with the insurgents were part of a search for political solution to the war Military StrategyKENNEDY PROPOSAL The President should do more to make it clear that America intends no long term presence  He should disavow the permanence of our so called enduring military bases in Iraq RESPONSE On February 17  2005  Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said  I can assure you that we have no intention at the present time  of putting permanent bases in Iraq  The Administration asked for and Congress approved have the  560 million for military construction in Iraq  including permanent construction in the supplemental appropriations act KENNEDY PROPOSAL He should announce that America will dramatically reduce the size of the American Embassy    the largest in the world RESPONSE The Supplemental Appropriations Act included  1 28 billion for a new embassy compound in Iraq KENNEDY PROPOSAL President Bush should immediately announce his intention to negotiate a timetable for a drawdown of American combat forces with the new Iraqi Government  America s goal should be to complete our military withdrawal as early as possible in 2006 RESPONSE Our commitment is open ended  In terms of how long we ll be there  as long as necessary  and not one day more  President Bush April 13  2004On June 19  Eighty two Iraq lawmakers including Shiites  Kurds  and Sunni Arabs  called for a clear timetable for withdrawal of coalition forces in a letter sent to the Speaker of Parliament Hajem Al Hassani  The letter was sent by Falah Hassan Shansal of the United Iraqi Alliance  With 275 members  the letter was signed by 1 3 of the parliament KENNEDY PROPOSAL At least 12 000 American troops and probably more should leave at once  to send a stronger signal about our intentions and to ease the pervasive sense of occupation RESPONSE The US government reduced its military presence after the election  I think we ll be able to come down to the level that was projected before this election  As you know  Senator  we overlapped our deployments and extended  I guess it was OIF 3  so that we d get a bump up of about 50 000 to cover the elections  Which I think was  in hindsight  a prudent thing to do  We believe that we can come down by that 15 000  which I think would bring us    General Myers knows the numbers better than I    I think about 17 brigades  about 135 000  Paul Wolfowitz Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing  February 3  2005KENNEDY PROPOSAL While American troops are drawing down  we must clearly be prepared to oppose any external intervention in Iraq or the large scale revenge killing of any group  We should begin now to conduct serious regional diplomacy with the Arab League and Iraq s neighbors to underscore this point  and we will need to maintain troops on bases outside Iraq but in the region RESPONSE In the last several weeks  there have been bilateral meetings between Iraq and Iran  Jordan and Turkey  Jafari plans to meet with Assad very soon  High level Bush Administration officials  Including Rice  and Rumsfeld have threatened Syria  Rice accused Syria of   standing in the way of the Iraqi people s desire for peace      There are very deep concerns about Iraq s neighbors    she said    and I heard particular concerns about Syria  about the gathering of terrorist networks there and the transiting of those networks across the Syrian border   KENNEDY PROPOSAL The United Nations could send a stabilization force to Iraq if it is necessary and requested by the Iraqi government  But any stabilization force must be sought by the Iraqis and approved by the United Nations  with a clear and achievable mission and clear rules of engagement  Unlike the current force  it should not consist mostly of Americans or be led by Americans  All nations of the world have an interest in Iraq s stability and territorial integrity RESPONSE There is no talk of a stabilization force by the UN  The current mandate expires with the end of the political process KENNEDY PROPOSAL Finally  we need to train and equip an effective Iraqi security force  We have a year to do so before the election of the permanent Iraqi government RESPONSE U S  government agencies do not report reliable data on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped  The departments of State and Defense no longer report on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are equipped with their required weapons  vehicles  communications  equipment  and body armor  Rebuilding Iraq Preliminary Observations on Challenges in Transferring Security
