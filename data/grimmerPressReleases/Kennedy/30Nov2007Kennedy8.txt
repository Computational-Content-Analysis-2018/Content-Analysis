         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   D C Today  the Christian Science Monitor printed the following opinion editorial by Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Congressman John Lewis on hate crimes legislation currently pending in Congress  The legislation is included in the Department of Defense Authorization bill      The op ed follows below       We Must Not Tolerate Hate Crimes    By Edward M  Kennedy and John Lewis   Reprinted with permission of the Christian Science Monitor     Washington    The recent troubling controversies in Jena  La   at Columbia University  and at the University of Maryland highlight the disturbing increase in the number of violent attacks and hate motivated incidents in schools throughout the country  The nations schools and universities have often been a battleground on civil rights  After all  they lay the foundation for a civil society  If we silence the history of intolerance in the classroom  if we fail to discuss the brutal and peculiar institution of slavery  the lawlessness and lynching of the Jim Crow era  the horrors of the Third Reich  then our children will not truly comprehend the significance of contemporary acts of genocide  such as the atrocities in Rwanda or Darfur     Unfortunately  there are some who wish to undo the worthwhile progress made in recent decades to guarantee equal rights and equal protection for all  regardless of race  religion  ethnic background  gender  sexual orientation  or gender identity  There has been a sharp increase in the number of nooses sighted across the country since September  The Southern Poverty Law Center also reports a recent rise in the number of hate groups  Just last week  the FBI reported that nearly 10 000 Americans were victims of hate crimes last year  an 8 percent increase from 2005  This upward trend in the number of hate crimes may be the tip of the iceberg since many state and local jurisdictions dont participate in the data collection  In light of these trends  its essential to send a strong message that America will not tolerate crimes fueled by hate      Education is an important part of prevention  but we also need strong federal legislation to punish those who engage in hate motivated violence and to expand federal resources available to investigate  prosecute  and prevent these vicious crimes      For this reason  we hope President Bush will support our efforts to enact the federal hate crimes legislation now being considered in Congress  The bill passed the House of Representatives in March  and it was also approved by the Senate as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill in September  Both the House and Senate are expected to act upon the Defense Authorization bill before the end of the year  The next few weeks represent a historic opportunity to make this bill the law of the land      The Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act makes clear that victims of hate crimes based on their gender  sexual orientation  disability or gender identity should be protected under federal law  The legislation also updates current law by removing the outdated requirement that a victim be engaging in one of a limited number of activities  such as traveling in interstate commerce  in order for the federal government to intervene  The legislation will also amend current law to cover crimes occurring in private residences  so that the federal government can investigate and prosecute hate crimes  regardless of where they occur      The White House has threatened to veto this legislation  questioning Congresss constitutional authority to strengthen federal hate crimes law  Prominent constitutional scholars disagree  because the pending legislation is clearly within the power that the Constitution grants to Congress and properly respects the principles of federalism  Claims that the bill will allow prosecutions of hate speech are also misleading  The Act punishes violent acts that result in death or bodily injury  not speech  Nothing in the bill will trump any individuals right to free speech      We urge the president to do the right thing and sign this measure into law  In doing so  he can send an important message that all victims of hate crimes should be protected  reinforcing our founding ideals of liberty and justice for all      Democracy is not a plateau on which to rest  It is a series of continuous actions  and each citizen  each organization  each business  each local  state or federal government must do its part to confirm our commitment to build a truly inclusive nation  Failing to teach children the history of the struggle for civil rights is a mistake we cannot afford to make  We must also reinforce our educational efforts by enacting and enforcing tough laws against hate crimes to make clear that our country will not tolerate hate motivated violence      Edward M  Kennedy is a Democratic senator from Massachusetts  John Lewis is a Democratic
