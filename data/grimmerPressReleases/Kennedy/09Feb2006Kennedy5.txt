         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Thank you  Senator Enzi  for scheduling today s hearing on the role of education in keeping our nation globally competitive  It s a privilege to join in welcoming Secretary Spellings back to our Committee to discuss this important topic Globalization is one of the most important and far reaching challenges facing our country and our economy today  and it s already leading to massive transformations of our industries and our workforce There is no quick fix to this challenge  But we have a choice  We can continue to allow the swift currents of globalization to sweep us away  Or we define America s own destiny with policies that create new opportunities for our people I believe that America can rise to the challenge  We can do it not by lowering our wages  but by raising our skills and equipping every American to compete and win in the new global economy  And we can do it by creating in America a new culture of innovation and creativity that keeps our nation in the lead in the global market place  Only then will our economy continue to grow and prosper  and only then will the good jobs of the future be made in the U S A That must be our goal  Surely education is one of the major keys for doing so  More than ever  we must begin at the beginning    by ensuring that each and every young person receives a high quality early childhood education  from the very earliest years  We ve long focused on K 12 and college and post graduate education  but we need to give comparable attention to the earlier years as well  because they have such a profound impact on each child s later performance in school and in life That means standing behind our commitment to leave no child behind  so that public education works for every single child  Five years ago  we acknowledged that reforms and resources were the right formula for improving our public schools  High standards  well qualified teachers  smaller classes  and extra help for students who fall behind are undoubtedly the right reforms  But we also need the resources to get the job done  and to guarantee the financial support they need for college or for workforce training programs I welcome President Bush s call to focus on math and science  We need to strengthen the teaching of math and science at every level    from public schools on through colleges and universities    not only to produce more scientists and engineers  but to guarantee that America continues at the cutting edge of innovation and progress In order to accomplish this  Congress and the Administration must help the states to align their curriculums in these critical subjects with the needs of the economy and the workforce  With adequate incentives  we can recruit and retain excellent math and science teachers in high poverty schools  We can encourage investments to adapt state of the art technology for classroom use  We can enable more of our best students to pursue college degrees in math  science  technology  and engineering Each of these investments is an investment in America s future  Anything less will shortchange the nation and its future Perhaps the best greatest obstacle is the current fiscal climate  Frankly  we simply cannot win in the global economy and create the good new jobs of tomorrow on the budget that the President presented this week  The budget cuts that the President proposes compromise the quality and availability of education that is so key to our progress The fiscal year 2007 budget announced on Monday underfunds the No Child Left Behind Act by  15 billion  It would leave behind nearly 4 million students who need essential services under the federal Title I program of aid to disadvantaged students  It would leave behind 2 million children who could benefit from after school programs  29 states would have reduced Title I funding It eliminates 42 education programs currently funded at a level totaling  3 5 billion  even though many of those programs on this blunderbuss chopping block are important investments in America s future It seems particularly shortsighted for the President to further reduce funding by 27 percent for the Math and Science Partnerships program at the National Science Foundation at a time when we need the best possible training for math and science teachers  Also  the budget should not have proposed again to eliminate our current investments in technology education under the No Child Left Behind Act It s impossible to justify such reductions  We need to do more    not less    to advance these priorities in education  I hope that we can work together this year with this Administration to re think the budget and provide the funding needed to these critical programs Secretary Spellings  thank you for being here today  We look forward to hearing from you about the President s plan for Global Competitiveness  All of us on the Committee want to work with you to see that the nation s students  schools  and colleges can adapt to this new age of global competitiveness and rise to new heights THE BUSH BUDGET SHOULD MAKE A REAL AND SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AS A KEY TO MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF GLOBAL COMPETITIONResearch and development is the cornerstone of innovation and the key to strength and prosperity in the global economy  We have long been a global leader in research and development  But increasingly fast growing countries like China  Ireland and South Korea are recognizing the immense potential RD has for stimulating economic growing and are ramping up their investment in it  To maintain our position as global leader in research and development  we must charge ahead and redouble our efforts to fund and encourage research and development both in the private sector and at federal agencies  Innovation is important for its own sake  but it also creates jobs and is what drives our economy forward Overall the President s budget includes respectable increases in research and development  But the devil is in the details and there are glaring omissions that are consistent with last year s proposal  The NSF budget increased  328 million almost all of it went to increase nanotechnology research investment  The NSF is the third largest source of RD funding in Massachusetts    5  of federal RD funding goes to Massachusetts  The President s budget cut Biological and Environmental Research funding at the Department of Energy by nearly  70 million  or a reduction of 12  from its 2006 appropriated level  BER includes a broad range of research activities that can impact energy  homeland security  human health  the environment  and agriculture  For Massachusetts  the 2007 budget proposal would result in a 66  cut from the  15 4 million for 2006 to  5 million in 2007  The overall DOD Research  Development Test and Evaluation Budget increased 3    2 2B  but basic and applied research would decrease by 12 6  or  867M to  5 995B  The Department of Defense is the largest source of RD funding for Massachusetts    50  of total federal RD funding in Massachusetts  Although the President s budget for NASA s Science  Aeronautics and Exploration increases funding by 8 8  or  860 M  it also includes the elimination of funding for space science  earth sciences  biological and physical research and decreases aeronautics research by almost 30   Bush s budget increases the National Standards and Technology Institute s funding by  61 million or 15  but virtually eliminates the Advanced Technology and Manufacturing Extension partnership programs under the Department of Commerce The President s Track Record on Research and Development is One Broken Promise after the Next  2006 Federal research and development spending  outside of defense weapons and human space exploration technologies  fell nearly 2 percent after adjusting for inflation  And the President s 2006 budget request included  2 5 billion more in cuts than what was approved by Congress  On the President s watch  federal research investment is shrinking as a share of the U S  economy    federal RD investment has plateaued at 1 1 percent of U S  GDP  NIH  NSF  DOE  and USDA all have less basic research funding in real terms in 2006 than they had in 2003 The National Institutes of Health s 2006 budget fell for the first time in 36 years  Although NASA s RD funding increased it only increased for human space vehicle development  Aeronautics research is down 3 4   Earth sciences research funding is down 8 3   and Biological and physical sciences research funding is down 14 4  from last year  Since 2001 the Bush Administration and the Republican Congress decreased funding and sought to eliminate critical programs at the Department of Commerce  Manufacturing Extension Partnership funding from  145M in 2001 to  106M in 2006  In 2006  the Advanced Technology Program has less than half the amount of funding it did in 2001  The President s budget sought to eliminate the program entirely If President Bush is true to his promises to keep America competitive and move the economy forward  he should Make the Research and Development Tax Credit permanent  o RD leads to greater employment growth as compared to overall private sector employment  From 1994 to 2000  research and development employment grew 5 4  annually  compared with 2 7  in total employment  Across the board increases of at least 10  per year in the RD budgets of every Federal agency particularly at the National Institutes of Health which invest in critical life science research that leads to life saving treatments and cures  Increase investment in the earth and physical sciences and computer technologies engineering at the National Science Foundation  Department of Energy  the Department of Commerce and other major federal research agencies  Increase investment in the Department of Commerce RD and other critical programs that facilitate the transfer or application of new technologies from the lab into the marketplace  Special attention should be given to application of manufacturing technologies in energy and the promising field of nanotechnology BUSH EDUCATION BUDGET JEOPARDIZES AMERICA S FUTURE Proposes Largest Cut to Education in the History of the Department of Education Senator Edward KennedyOur ability to compete in the global economy hinges on providing a strong education from birth through adulthood  We must provide a top notch teacher in every elementary and secondary school classroom  We must provide incentives to bring high quality math and science teachers into high poverty schools  and make significant investments in state of the art classroom technology  To ensure our workforce is prepared to compete in the global economy  we must ensure our high school graduates can afford a college education or have access to high quality job training programs  Instead of meeting these goals with new investments in education  the budget released by President Bush today shortchanges our competitiveness  shortchanges our opportunity  and shortchanges our future Less than a week after touting his State of the Union commitment to improving education to meet the challenge of global competition  President Bush s Fiscal Year 2007 budget proposes the largest cut to federal education funding in the 26 year history of the Education Department    a  2 1 billion reduction  and a 3 8  cut below last year  His budget proposal  Underfunds the No Child Left Behind Act by  15 4 billion  o Leaves behind 3 7 million children by freezing Title I grants to school districts at  12 7 billion  As a result  29 states  including Massachusetts  are projected to lose funding  In Massachusetts  54 478 children would be left behind  o Leaves behind 2 million students who are eligible to receive after school services  by flat funding the program at  981 million  o Flat funds the Math and Science Partnership teacher training program  Provides  100 million for a new voucher program for students in schools identified for restructuring under NCLB  After 5 years of being starved of the  2 5 billion in school improvement grants they were promised  public schools would receive  200 million in grants to help them meet the goals of NCLB and avoid the need for restructuring  Retreats on the government s commitment to students with disabilities  by providing a smaller share of States  total costs for special education for the second year in a row  o IDEA funding would increase by only  100 million  for a total of  10 7 billion o This would provide 17  of the average per pupil cost  less than half of the federal government s commitment  and down from 18  last year and 19  in FY 2005  Eliminates the Perkins Loan program  and freezes the Pell grant at  4 050 for the fifth year in a row  despite the fact that tuition has increased 46  since 2001  In 1975  the Pell Grant covered 80  of the cost of a four year public education  today it covers only 40  President Bush s modest proposed increases in funding for the No Child Left Behind Act  IDEA  math and science instruction  and new funding for another run at his high school initiative are paid for by eliminating 42 programs   3 5 billion   many of which the President proposed eliminating last year  including vocational and technical education  education technology state grants  safe and drug free schools state grants  and programs to improve college access and retention including GEAR UP  TRIO Talent Search and Upward Bound  Once again robbing Peter to pay Paul The President s FY 2007 Education Budget Continues his Track Record of Broken Promises  In 2001  President Bush said he would leave no child behind  But since the No Child Left Behind Act passed  the President and the Republican Congress have shortchanged funding for the law to the tune of  55 7 billion  The Republican budget bill passed in December cuts funding to  1 billion below last year s level  This is the second year in a row that President Bush called to end federal funding for key programs that support family literacy  classroom technology  dropout prevention  and smaller learning communities  For the fifth year in a row  the maximum Pell grant remains a thousand dollars lower than the President promised in 2000  This is the second year in a row that the President called to end the Perkins Loan program and eliminate federal funding for vocational education and programs that support college access and retention  In December the Senate passed a bill that would have leveled the playing field for needy college students  by adding an additional  6 billion to help all Pell grant recipients  but the program was rejected in the final Republican budget  The President s budget includes no increase in the maximum Pell grant If President Bush were truly committed to helping America meet the challenge of global competition he would  Fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act at  39 4 billion  as promised  His proposed  529 million increase is one fifth the  2 6 billion increase promised in the law  o Fully fund Title I at  25 billion  as promised  o Fully fund after school programs at  2 5 billion  as promised  o Fully fund the math and science teacher training programs at the Department of Education at  450 million  as promised  o Fully fund education technology grants at  1 billion  as promised  o Fully fund school improvement grants at  500 million  as promised  Stay on track to meeting the federal government s commitment to fully fund its share of special education services by 2011  by providing  6 3 billion to meet the FY07 funding level promised in the law  Provide  1 3 billion for key NSF programs to improve K 12 and postsecondary math and science education  including  400 million for the Math and Science Partnership program that trains teachers in cutting edge instruction  Raise the maximum Pell grant to  5 100 as he promised in his 2000 election  and increase funding for vocational education and programs that improve college access and retention   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
