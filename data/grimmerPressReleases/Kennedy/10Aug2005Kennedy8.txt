         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FACT SHEET INCLUDED FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                 CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633    Washington  DC  Today  Senator Specter sent a letter to Senator Leahy explaining his position on the documents related to Judge Roberts  work in the Solicitor General s office under President George H W  Bush  Senator Kennedy issued the following statement to respond and below is a fact sheet on the points raised in Senator Specter s letter    I have a high regard for Senator Specter but I do not share his opinion that the Judiciary Committee should not be allowed to review the papers from Judge Roberts s work in the Solicitor General s office under President George H W  Bush  It is the job of the Senate to conduct a very thorough review of a nominee s fitness to receive a lifetime appointment to sit on the Supreme Court  and we are taking that job very seriously  John Roberts has a very limited public record and paper trail  and the limited information disclosed to date from his time working for President Reagan in the early 1980 s reveals that Roberts was heavily involved in attempts to roll back progress on civil rights  women s rights and other fundamental rights important to the American people  The White House arguments of attorney client privilege don t hold up  particularly since Roberts  clients were the American people and there s ample precedent for their release    FACT SHEET  Senator Specter is correct that the Senate has received a number of significant documents regarding the views of nominee John Roberts  However  the documents he cites demonstrate precisely why the American people need to know more before the Senate votes whether to confirm Roberts to our nation s most powerful court      The documents Specter referenced show that Roberts advocated several extreme and very troubling views hostile to civil rights in the 1980s  Unless we receive information about his views while a policy maker in the first Bush Administration  it is difficult to know the extent to which his later work reflects his own thinking    although many of his later positions raise grave questions      Sen  Specter cites a 1981 memo in which Roberts seeks to support the constitutionality of proposals to divest the Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction  That memo is deeply disturbing  because it asserts    contrary to firmly established Supreme Court precedent at the time    that discrimination against women because of their gender is not suspect under the law  and therefore not entitled to heightened judicial review  This radical view requires that the Senate look very carefully at Roberts  record on women rights    which is why we requested the documents in cases Roberts litigated on issues important to women s rts    Franklin v  Gannett  Rust v  Sullivan  and Bray v  Alexandria Women s Health Clinic      The American people are entitled to know whether Roberts was voicing his own beliefs when he filed a brief in Rust v  Sullivan stating that Roe v  Wade was wrongly decided and should be overturned  The best way to evaluate that question is for the Senate to see Roberts  memoranda written about the case      In addition  Roberts  brief in the Bray case  which adopted a position advanced by activists who threatened violence at clinics providing abortion services  has received a great deal of attention  Roberts argued that the activists  intimidation of women seeking abortion services was not a form of gender discrimination that violated women s right to equal protection under the law  We know that Roberts had a role in crafting the argument in Bray  and in a related decision to adopt the activists  position in a Kansas case involving threats of violence so severe that U S  Marshals had been called in to keep the peace  We cannot assume we know Roberts  personal views on the Bray case  but we also cannot accept the Administration s attempt to deny information that would shed light on those views      Sen  Specter also refers to Roberts  August 31 1982 memo showing that Roberts took a very narrow view of Title IX  the landmark law against gender discrimination in federally funded programs    a view so radical and clearly erroneous that much of it was eventually rejected by the conservative Reagan Administration   Specter s characterization of that memo is wrong  however  Roberts urged the Attorney General not to appeal a decision which would have severely limited the scope of Title IX  not expanded it as Specter claims  A federal District Court had rejected the longstanding interpretation  and the DOJ s argument   and held that Title IX was meant to cover only programs receiving federal financial assistance  not entire institutions  Roberts concurred with AAG Brad Reynolds in recommending DOJ not appeal this new and limited interpretation of Title IX       In light of Roberts  documented opposition to the Civil Rights Restoration Act which restored Title IX coverage   it is vital that we explore Roberts s current view of Title IX  We know that in the 1990s  Roberts filed a brief again seeking to limit Title IX  by restricting remedies available under to girls who suffer even the most egregious forms of sexual harassment  The Supreme Court rejected that view unanimously  But Roberts is sure to claim that this position didn t represent his own thinking  and that he was simply filing on behalf of DOJ  Perhaps that s so  But the only way for the American people to evaluate such a claim is for the Senate to receive documents would shed light on that issue      Senator Specter says that we already have a lot of Roberts material  Yet almost all the items he lists were written in the early 80 s  so long ago that the White House says we should not use them to judge him on  Thus  the SG materials may be the only real source that reflects his own mature personal thinking  Further  the kind of deliberative process privilege he discusses does not preclude turning over the SG documents  especially when the Senate is fulfilling its constitutional responsibility to find out all it can about a Supreme Court nominee  It is clear that an attempt to assert such a privilege falls when there is a legitimate need for internal documents  and time and time again the Senate has obtained such documents  which do after all belong to the SG s real clients  the American people     Senator Specter s reference to the letter from the former Solicitor General s in the Estrada case is simply outdated  One of the most prominent members of that group    Walter Dellinger    has stated that the Roberts case is clearly distinguishable from the Estrada case  since Roberts was a high level political appointee    the number 2 man in the SG s office who personally made final decisions in hundreds of important cases  while Estrada was a lower level career lawyer in that office  Moreover Estrada was nominated to be one of the hundreds of judges on the 13 lower level appellate courts  while Roberts is a candidate for one of only nine seats on the Supreme Court    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
