         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  the asbestos legislation which is before the Senate is both unfair and unworkable  It is unfair because many seriously ill victims of asbestos are completely excluded from compensation under the trust fund  and it is unworkable because the bill does not have adequate funding to ensure that all the victims who are eligible for compensation under the trust fund will actually receive what the legislation promises them  These are fundamental flaws that cannot be corrected by a few last minute amendments  They go to the heart of the bill  This bill will end up hurting the seriously ill victims of asbestos disease whom we are trying to help  S  852 fails the test of fairness for many of those most in need of assistance  Now is the time to take a serious look at how the proposed trust fund would operatenow  before it is too late  Who would be excluded from receiving compensation even though they are seriously ill from asbestos exposure  Who would be left in legal limbo  ineligible for the trust fund and unable to pursue their claims in court  I have said many times that the real crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation crisis  it is an asbestos induced disease crisis  We cannot allow the tragedy of these workers and their families enduring to become lost in a complex debate about the economic impact of asbestos litigation  The litigation did not create these costs  Exposure to asbestos created them  They are the cost of medical care  the cost of lost wages  incapacitated workers  the cost of providing for the families of workers who died years before their time  Those costs are real  No legislative proposal can make them disappear  All legislation can do is shift those costs from one party to another  Unfortunately  S  852 would shift more of the financial burden onto the backs of injured workers  That is unacceptable  Lets look at what this legislation would really do to victims  It would close the courthouse doors to asbestos victims on the day it passes  long before the trust fund will be able to pay their claims  Their cases will be stayed immediately  Seriously ill workers will be forced into legal limbo for up to 2 years  Their need for compensation to cover medical expenses  basic family necessities  will remain  but they have nowhere to turn for relief  Under this legislation  even the exigent health claims currently pending in the courts  will be automatically stayed for 9 months as of the date of enactment  These cases all involve people who have less than a year to live due to mesothelioma or some other disease caused by asbestos exposure  Nine months is an eternity for someone with less than a year to live  Many of them will die without receiving either their day in court or compensation from the trust fund  The stay language is written too broadly  It would stop all forward movement of a case in the court system  A trial about to begin would be halted  An appellate ruling about to be issued would be barred  Even the deposition of dying witnesses cannot be taken to preserve their testimony  The stay would deprive victims of their last chance at justice  I cannot believe the authors of the bill intended such a harsh result  but that is what the legislation does  I strongly believe  at a minimum  all exigent cases should be exempted from the automatic stay in the legislation  Victims with less than a year to live certainly should be allowed to continue their cases in court uninterrupted until the trust fund becomes operational  Their ability to recover compensation in the court should not be halted until the trust fund is open for business and they are able to receive compensation from the fund  It is grossly unfair to leave these dying victims in legal limbo  For them  the old adage is especially true  Justice delayed is justice denied  We should not deprive them of their last chance  their only chance to receive some measure of justice before asbestos induced diseases silence them  They should be allowed to receive compensation in their final months to ease their suffering  They should be allowed to die knowing that their families are financially provided for  S  852 in its current state takes that last chance away from them  I intend to offer an amendment that allows these severely ill victims to have their day in court  I am particularly upset by the way lung cancer victims are treated in this bill  Under the medical criteria adopted by the Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly 2 years ago  all lung cancer victims who had at least 15 years of weighted exposure to asbestos were eligible to receive compensation from the fund  However  that was changed in S  852  Under this bill  lung cancer victims who have had very substantial exposure to asbestos over long periods of time are denied any compensation unless they can show asbestos scarring on their lungs  The committee heard expert medical testimony that prolonged asbestos exposure dramatically increases the probability that a person will get lung cancer even if they do not have scarring on their lungs  Deleting this category will deny compensation to more than 40 000 victims suffering with asbestos related lung cancers  These victims  many of whom will have their lives cut short because of asbestos induced disease  will not receive one penny from the fund  They are losing their right to go to court  They are being denied any right to compensation under the fund  They are  in essence  being told to suffer in a legally imposed silence with no recourse whatsoever  One of the arguments we hear most frequently in favor of creating an asbestos trust fund is that in the current system too much money goes to people who are not really sick and too little goes to those who are seriously ill  Lung cancer victims who have had years of exposure to asbestos are the ones who are seriously ill  They are the ones this legislation is supposed to be helping  Yet they are  under this legislationnot the previous legislation but under this legislationcompletely excluded  Any person who was exposed to asbestos for 15 or more years and now has lung cancer should be eligible for compensation from the trust fund  Their cases would be reviewed individually by a panel of physicians to determine whether asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to their lung cancer  These 40 000 victims of asbestos should not be arbitrarily excluded from receiving compensation  They were included in the original legislation  It was agreed to by medical experts for both business and labor  That provision should be restored to the bill  I will be proposing an amendment to rectify this serious injustice  Another major shortcoming of this legislation is its failure to compensate the residents of areas that have experienced large scale asbestos contamination  S  852 simply pretends this problem does not exist  It fails to compensate the victims of all asbestos induced diseases  other than mesothelioma  whose exposure was not directly tied to their work  There is very substantial scientific evidence showing that the men  women  and children who lived in the vicinity of asbestos contaminated sites  such as mining operations and processing plants  can and do contract asbestos induced diseases  The reason this legislation needs a special provision to compensate the residents of Libby  MT  is because it does not compensate victims of community contamination generally  The residents of Libby are certainly entitled to compensation  but so are the residents who live near the many processing plants from my State of Massachusetts  in western Massachusetts  to California  that received the lethal ore from the Libby mine  The deadly dust from Libby  MT  was spread across America  W R  Grace shipped almost 10 000 pounds of ore to processing facilities in the 1960s through the 1990s  including Easthampton  MA  in western Massachusetts  where the operations of an expanding plant spread the asbestos to the surrounding environment  into the air and onto the soil  I intend to discuss this problem in great detail as the debate moves forward  I raise it now as a dramatic example of the unfairness caused by the arbitrary exclusion of a large number of asbestos victims from compensation under the trust fund  These red spots on this map are in States all across the country with similar problems  Yet every one of them is excluded  Page S1055  Community asbestos contamination can result from many different sources  Medical experts  for example  say it may result from exposure to asbestos after the collapse of the World Trade Center  Because of the long latency period  we often do not learn about community asbestos contamination until long after it occurs  Certainly these victims of asbestos are entitled to fair treatment  as well  They should not be arbitrarily excluded from compensation  as if somehow their suffering is somehow less worthy of recognition than the suffering of asbestos victims  Yet that is what S  852 does  There are many of those victims  I have talked with the extraordinarily brave and courageous workers who came to the sites of the Trade Towers on September 11  working on those areas for days and weeks for an intense period of time  and their exposure to asbestos fibers during that work will pose an enormous health threat to them in the years to come  We all know there can be a significant period of latency  Are we going to exclude those extraordinary men and women who were out there trying to do an incredible job for the people  not just of New York but for our country  This legislation excludes them  The asbestos trust fund is being presented as an alternative source of compensation for victims suffering from asbestos induced disease  If that alternative runs out of money and can no longer compensate those victims in a full and timely manner  their right to seek compensation through the judicial system should be immediately restored with no strings attached  There is no principle more basic  Yet this bill violates that principle  Our friend and colleague from Delaware intends to offer an amendment that if we run out of money  the provisions will be there for them to go back into the tort system  Just accept the Biden amendment  It makes it extremely clear and eliminates the roadblocks for going back into the tort system  as the current legislation does  As I understand it  there is not a willingness to accept the Biden amendment  Another major flaw in this legislation is it lacks adequate funding  Putting it bluntly  S  852 does not provide sufficient money to compensate the victims of asbestos diseases that it promises to cover  That is the essence of the budget debate we are having about the bill  The sponsors claim the budget point of order against the bill is technical  but the financial inadequacy of the trust fund to meet its obligation is very real  Should the trust fund fail  both asbestos victims and the taxpayers will pay a heavy price  A broad range of experts have analyzed S  852 and concluded that the asbestos trust fund created by this legislation is seriously underfunded  Senator Conrad has addressed this in great detail  I certainly hope our colleagues will read his remarks carefully  If S  852 is enacted  the United States will be paying a commitment that hundreds of thousands of seriously ill asbestos victims will be compensated  but it will not have to ensure that adequate dollars are available to honor its commitment  That will precipitate a genuine asbestos crisis and this Congress will bear the responsibility for it  Since the trust fund will be borrowing from the U S  Treasury in the first few years of operation  if it becomes insolvent it will have a direct impact on American taxpayers  Let me point out  we do not do very well in setting up these trust funds to compensate individuals  We certainly have not done it with regard to the downwinders in other trust funds  There is little reason to believe we are going to do it or would do it in this circumstance  either  The argument that there are serious inadequacies in the way asbestos cases are abjudicated today does not mean that any legislation is better than the current system  Our first obligation is to do no harm  We should not be supporting legislation that excludes many seriously ill victims from receiving compensation that fails to provide a guarantee of adequate funding to make sure these injured workers covered by the trust fund will actually receive what the bill promises them  This bill will do harm to these asbestos victims  I intend to vote no  There is no reason  if we reject this legislation  we cannot come back with legislation that builds on a trust fund that is adequate and will do the job  That is what many Members believe is the way we ought to go  This is not such a bill
