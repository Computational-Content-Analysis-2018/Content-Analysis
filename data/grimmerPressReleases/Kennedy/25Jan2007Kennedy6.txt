         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement While Im glad that President Bush is traveling the country to talk about our health care crisis  his proposal falls far short of solving the problem    I find the plan troubling because it does nothing to help people get insurance  hurts those who already have it  and provides a tax break that benefits the wealthiest Americans   Republicans and Democrats alike should come together to build on the  lessons from the states to see that all Americans have quality  affordable  health care  just as the President and members of Congress have  already Fact SheetThe Health Care Crisis Health care in America is in crisis   Over the last six years  the cost of health insurance premiums has soared 87 percent  while wages have grown only 20 percent   Over the same period  the number of Americans without health insurance has increased by over 6 million  and millions more worry that their existing coverage is inadequate to meet their medical needs   Bold action is needed to address the crisis  and states have begun to answer that call   Massachusetts  California  Pennsylvania  and other states have all proposed major health reforms designed to make coverage more affordable and more accessible   Serious reform is needed at the national level to see that every American has quality  affordable health care  just as the President and members of Congress receive now  Presidential leadership is important  but we must make sure that the reforms we undertake are the right course   The Presidents Proposal Health benefits are not currently taxed   President Bushs proposal would tax health benefits for the very first time   At the same time  the President proposes creating a new tax deduction for health benefits  This would be set at  15 000 a year for a family policy  and  7 500 for an individual    This policy would immediately impose a new tax on nearly 7 5 million Americans who now have good employer sponsored coverage   It penalizes workers with good health care  many of whom are middle or lower income    and creates a disincentive for employers to provide comprehensive coverage  particularly those whose employees are older or sicker   The tax deduction that the President has proposed would disproportionally benefit upper income Americans  since its value increases for those in higher tax brackets   It taxes middle class Americans to benefit the wealthiest   The Presidents proposal also does nothing to improve access to health coverage for those who cannot obtain it now  either because their employer does not offer it or because they cannot obtain policies on the individual market due to a history of illness   Placing the entire burden of health care on individuals and working families is no solution to the crisis   Real reform involves a shared responsibility among individuals  government and business   The Bottom Line  Presidential leadership on health care is crucial to addressing the major problems the American people face in affording quality health care   While the Administrations current proposal is deeply flawed  the attention that the President is devoting to the issue could signal real progress in addressing the health care crisis      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
