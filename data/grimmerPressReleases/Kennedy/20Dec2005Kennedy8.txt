         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The President was right to talk to the nation this evening about the rough road ahead in Iraq  He was right to tell them of the pain of sacrifice  and the tough decisions he makes each day to send our men and women in uniform into battle  It s good for the country that he s done so  and not a moment too soon  But  it s wrong for him to attempt to silence his critics by calling them defeatists  And  it s wrong for him to gloss over the cherry picking of intelligence that led us to this war     Every American    including those that thought this war should never have been fought    understands that we have no choice for own security but to win in Iraq  While speeches help to reassure the American people  they do little to advance our goals toward victory  The President should acknowledge  as his own generals do  that the Iraq war has emboldened the terrorists and increased their ranks  He should acknowledge  as his own generals do  that our overwhelming presence in Iraq is putting our soldiers  and American citizens  at greater risk  This week s election should be a turning point  for the Iraqi people to take control of their country so our troops can begin to come home  The emergence of a democracy in the Middle East is a historic moment  But  as we fight for democracy abroad  we must also protect it at home  The President s domestic spying scheme plays fast and loose with the law and our constitutional protections  How can we be credible in helping Iraq form its democratic government when our President acts in conflict to fundamental democratic ideals at home  The President should have taken the opportunity tonight to explain to the American people how his actions fit within the confines of the constitution as our founding fathers saw them      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
