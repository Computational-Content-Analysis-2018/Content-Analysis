         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     As we consider Judge Roberts  nomination  we must never forget that Supreme Court justices wield enormous power over the daily lives of all Americans  We must be conscious of our duty to ensure that the next Supreme Court Justice is fair  independent  and firmly committed to upholding individual rights     Supreme Court justices serve for life  Currently  the average term of service for Supreme Court justices is twenty five years  If confirmed  John Roberts will influence the law for decades to come    impacting the lives of our children and grandchildren in serious and important ways    Nine justices sit in Washington    in a pillared building overlooking the United States Capitol    deciding the intent of our founding fathers in terms of what kind of democracy we would continue to be  We must never forget the human impact of the Court s decisions     Just last year  the Court decided the case of Beverly Jones  a court reporter who uses a wheelchair who had trouble finding work because many county courtrooms in her state were inaccessible to the disabled  Ms  Jones challenged her exclusion from public courtrooms under the Americans with Disabilities Act  She was joined in the case by George Lane  who also uses a wheelchair  and who had been forced to crawl up two flights of stairs just to reach a public courtroom  The Supreme Court upheld Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act  ensuring that Ms  Jones and other persons with disabilities have equal opportunities in our society     Justice O Connor cast the deciding vote in Ms  Jones  case  Over the course of the next several weeks  we must determine whether John Roberts also respects the power of Congress to protect the rights of the disabled    Two years ago  the Court ruled in favor of Patti Phillips  a mother who needed time off from work to care for her sick child  Americans have a right to know whether Judge Roberts would uphold Congress  power to enact the Family and Medical Leave Act  as Justice O Connor did  allowing mothers and fathers to care for sick children and loved ones without worrying about their next paycheck     When we consider whether to confirm John Roberts as a successor for Justice O Connor  we must also remember Americans like Roderick Jackson  who was fired from his job as a high school coach because he opposed discriminating against girls in the school s athletic program  Earlier this year  Justice O Connor wrote the Supreme Court s 5 4 decision affirming that Title IX  the landmark law against sex discrimination in education  prevents retaliation against those who stand up for the rights of our daughters  our sisters  and our friends     Americans deserve to know whether Judge Roberts would uphold the established interpretation of Title IX and other civil rights laws as Justice O Connor did  or if he would seek to roll back these protections  As a Justice Department lawyer  in Franklin v  Gwinnett County  he argued to narrow Title IX and limit relief to victims of even the most severe gender discrimination  His brief in the case even suggested new limits on the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  which prohibits race and ethnic discrimination with federal funds  and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973  which prohibit discrimination against the disabled  Fortunately  a clear majority of the Supreme Court rejected his views     These issues are vitally important to the American people  These issues go the very heart of our commitment to equal opportunity  While we will not prejudge John Roberts views  the American people want us to ask about those views before casting a vote on his nomination     Some of the Americans whose cases I have mentioned here today feel so strongly about the Court s importance to all Americans that they have come to the Capitol today  Beverly Lane  whose case will help ensure that persons with disabilities can work with dignity in our public courthouses  is here  Patti Phillips is here as well  because of the Supreme Court s impact on her ability to care for her sick child     Also with us is Dr  Scott Spear  from the University of Wisconsin Health Center  who will speak about the importance of safe health care and medical privacy  He sees patients every day  and understands how vital privacy is in personal medical and family decision making     Their presence is a powerful reminder of the importance of our responsibility in deciding whether to confirm nominees to the nation s highest court      There are few debates more important than this one     I d now like to introduce Congressman Mel Watt     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
