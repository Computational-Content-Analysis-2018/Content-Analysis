         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Kennedy questioned the Administration about their decision to terminate the Joint Strike Fighter Alternative Engine program  This program was designed to provide a second source for the engine of the military s next generation fighter  Canceling the engine would reduce the future work for GE s Lynn facility in Massachusetts  which currently does work on military fighter engines and other military programs Senator Kennedy urged the Senate Armed Services Committee to reject this decision and restore the funding for the Joint Strike Fighter alternative engine Senator Kennedy s remarks at today s hearing are attached as well as a letter Kennedy and colleagues sent to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner and Ranking Member Carl Levin JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER HEARING STATEMENT  As prepared for delivery Mr  Chairman  I commend you for holding this hearing to review the Defense Department s decision to cancel competition for the Joint Strike Fighter Engine  The Department says the decisions will achieve savings of  1 8B over the next five years  but estimates suggest that the savings from competition could be as much as ten times that amount  So the economics of the decision are far from clear Annual costs are important  but we also need to assess the overall value of the engine program and the policy implications of its cancellation  The life cycle costs to support these engines are well in excess of 50 billion dollars  and some estimates run upwards of 100 billion dollars  It s hard to imagine we would support a 50 or 100 billion dollar program without competition I take issue with a number of points in the Pentagon s analysis in support of the cancellation decision  Our experience from the Great Engine War for F 15 and F 16 engines shows that competition brings real value to military in terms of reliability and improved performance  and to the nation in terms of overall savings This decision also raises other questions about the viability of the industrial base  The Joint Strike Fighter will be the largest acquisition of fighter aircraft for the future  It is designed with the needs of all four services in mind  No other program will result in such a sizeable demand for large military aircraft engines over such a long period of time If we cancel the competition  we are essentially creating a winner take all monopoly  not just for the Joint Strike Fighter  but for any future fighter aircraft engine  Over time  we ll be reducing our industrial base to a single supplier  We need to consider the long term effects on the industry and our national security  not just the 1 8 billion dollars that will be saved over the next five years  We need to reverse this shortsighted decision    the sooner the better  30 March 3  2006The Honorable John Warner The Honorable Carl Levin Chairman Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services Committee on Armed Services 228 Russell Senate Office Building 228 Russell Senate Office Building Washington  D C  20510 Washington  D C  20510Dear Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin We write to oppose the proposed termination of the F136 Joint Strike Fighter  JSF  engine program recommended by the President s Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense budget request Several years ago  we worked to have the Pentagon strengthen the JSF engine program by fighting for a second manufacturer  General Electric  to participate  We fought for this on the premise that competition would enhance performance of the general contractor and serve as a back up plan against any primary contractor problems  We believed that this strong policy was in the best interest of our national security  We do not think anything has occurred in the interim to alter that premise Eliminating the second engine for the JSF at this time would leave the U S  with a single supplier of large fighter engines and could ultimately lead to a reduction in overall engine quality and non competitive pricing  Further  the President s budget proposal to eliminate the JSF s dual source competition program could potentially be a severe loss to the economy and the defense capability of this country Accordingly  we request that you oppose the President s Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense budget recommendation with respect to the F136 JSF engine program We appreciate your consideration of this request and look forward to continuing to work with you on this important national security issue Sincerely John F  Tierney Edward M  Kennedy John F  Kerry Richard E  Neal Martin T  Meehan William D  Delahunt James P  McGovern Michael E  Capuano Stephen F  Lynch  Kennedy calls for analysis as to why integral program was eliminated from budget
