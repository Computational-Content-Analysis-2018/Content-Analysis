         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                 AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY BEFORE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE   For two centuries  the Bill of Rights has stood as a guarantee of peoples basic rights and freedoms  The First Amendment  which protects freedom of speech  is the centerpiece of those protections  Never in American history has Congress amended the Bill of Rights  It certainly has never limited the protections of the First Amendment  and now is no time to start    Burning or desecrating the flag in other ways is a despicable act  The flag is a symbol that embodies all that is great and good about America  But the First Amendment protects not only speech we admire  but also speech we abhor  If freedom of expression means anything  it means that we must tolerate not just views we approve  but views we oppose as well  This fundamental principle is what gives America its true strength  and what sets it apart from regimes like Cuba  Iran  China  and Nazi Germanyall countries that did or do punish flag burning   This amendment would send the message to future generations that speech is protected only when Government does not find it offensive or disagreeable  This amendment would politicize our Constitution and punch a hole in the First Amendmentall to prohibit an act that is exceedingly rare    Millions of Americans have fought and died for our flag and the freedom it represents  We honor the flag most when we keep those freedoms strong  We should remember the words of James Warner  a Washington lawyer and former Marine flyer who was a prisoner in North Vietnam from 1967 to 1973  During an interrogation  one of his guards taunted him with a picture of American war protesters burning the flag  Warner turned the tables on the guard by telling him  That proves that I am right  In my country  we are not afraid of freedom  even if it means that people disagree with us   We know there are pressing issues that deserve the Senates attentionthe war in Iraq  dangers to national security  soaring health care costs  and the upcoming hurricane seasonthese are all issues we need to act on to protect the American people  Now is no time to start undermining their rights and freedoms         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
