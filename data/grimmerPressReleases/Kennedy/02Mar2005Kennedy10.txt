         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Actions speak louder than words  The words we hear today from the Republican Leadership are about their anti poverty agenda  But at this very moment their actions on the Senate floor belie those hopeful words  Instead of extending a helping hand to those struggling hardest to make ends meet  they are pushing hard for a bankruptcy bill that robs the poor to fill the already brimming pockets of the credit card industry   The typical family seeking relief in bankruptcy is below or near the poverty level at the time they file  and it is particularly cruel to impose harsh new burdens on them    especially when no such burdens are imposed on the corporations and CEOs who are the principal abusers of the bankruptcy laws   The Republican bankruptcy bill will especially hurt children  women  and minorities  who make up a disproportionate share of our fellow citizens living in poverty  The bankruptcy bill is not fair  and it is certainly not anti poverty   The agenda they announced today includes a welfare bill that forces single moms to work longer hours without giving them support to care for their children during those hours  It includes a tiny hunger relief program  at a time when we should be increasing eligibility for food stamps  and school breakfast and lunch programs  It says they prioritize low income housing assistance  yet the President s budget cuts housing and community programs by at least  2 billion  or 35 percent   We should be talking instead about how to extend compassion and fairness to the most vulnerable in our nation  If the Republican Leadership is serious about an anti poverty agenda  we would be on the Senate floor today debating job creation  debating better health care and not cuts in Medicaid  and debating better education instead of denying adequate funds for the school reforms  debating a fair increase in the minimum wage instead of anti worker poison pills  In the last Congress  the Republican Leadership abandoned the State Department bill  the welfare bill  and the class action bill  rather than allow the Senate to vote on an amendment to increase the minimum wage   This new Republican proposal is little more than smoke and mirrors  It will help fewer than 2 million Americans  and the anti worker poison pills attached to it shows they are not serious about giving the lowest income employee a hard earned raise   A serious anti poverty agenda would say no to an Administration budget that cuts low income housing  cuts Medicaid  cuts nutrition programs  cuts education programs  and cuts job training programs  No anti poverty agenda worth its name would harm the most vulnerable in our society in so many ways  Today  the President spoke of the importance of job training programs  But the fact is  the biggest cuts he makes to the Department of Labor budget are in job training programs    a  500 million  or 6  cut    at a time when nearly 8 million workers remain unemployed  It s like we ve walked down the Yellow Brick Road to see the Wizard of Oz  But in this version  there s nothing behind the curtain    just a smokescreen in front  We all know a true anti poverty agenda is necessary and long overdue  The number of Americans living in poverty has increased every year since President Bush took office  Nearly 36 million men  women  and children in the United States now live below the poverty linean increase of over 4 million since President Bush was first elected  The number of Americans living in hunger and malnutrition has soared to almost 36 million   If the Senate is serious about an anti poverty agenda we will end the hypocrisy of easy rhetoric and take the long overdue actions that are so obviously needed as part of a genuine anti poverty agenda  Let s start by raising the minimum wage    30   Democratic Anti Poverty Agenda  Opportunity and Compassion for All   Raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in just over two years   Invest in good jobs by putting resources into education and job training  research and development  broadband technology  infrastructure  and building schools    Save Social Security from Republican Cuts    Provide access to affordable  high quality health care    Enact a welfare bill that will truly help lift people out of poverty and into self  sufficiency    Ensure funding for hunger programs like food stamps and school breakfast and lunch programs    Provide opportunities for affordable housing    Invest in Head Start and child care    Fully fund No Child Left Behind    Guarantee that every student in America can go to college    Support the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance Program    Fully fund the Community Services Block Grant and the Social Services Block Grant   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
