         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following two statements commemorating the anniversaries of Medicare and Medicaid  Tomorrow marks the 40th anniversary of the passage of these two landmark pieces of legislation    Below are his statements     STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY  ON THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF MEDICARE    Medicare has changed the lives of millions of senior citizens over the past four decades  Before Medicare  vast numbers of elderly Americans were unable to afford the health care they needed  Since then  Medicare has made a real difference in their lives  Medicare has also made a real difference in the lives of millions of disabled persons  who became eligible for Medicare in 1972    Today  Medicare means good health care for more than 42 million Americans across the country  It is one of the most popular government programs ever enacted  The number of senior citizens living in poverty has declined dramatically as seniors because of Medicare  Our seniors are able to get the health care they so desperately need    Many important changes have been made over the years to improve the program  One of the most important changes was extending coverage to disabled persons  Another important change is moving Medicare s focus from caring for beneficiaries when they became sick to one that not only treats illnesses but also emphasizes preventive care and the management of chronic illnesses that affect so many senior citizens and disabled persons     While Medicare has accomplished so much over the past four decades  there are still improvements to be made  The lack of coverage of prescription drugs is the most obvious problem  and many of us are deeply concerned that the new prescription drug benefit enacted by the last Congress will not in fact benefit many seniors who need and deserve the coverage  We had a real opportunity to provide all seniors with a good drug benefit  but politics won out     Another significant failure has been privatization  which has forced many of the elderly into HMOs that cost more than traditional Medicare    The lack of long term care in Medicare is another shortcoming  Too many Medicare beneficiaries must impoverish themselves in order to obtain the long term care they need through Medicaid     A further serious problem affects the disabled  who often have no coverage during the two year waiting period before Medicare is available     We can do better  Bills pending this year will modernize health information technology  and improve the quality of care  We need to provide stronger incentives to reward quality and encourage the availability of the best possible care  We can improve treatment and achieve better coordination of care for those with multiple chronic conditions  And we can use the purchasing power of Medicare to make sure that prescription drugs are priced reasonably    Medicare was a landmark achievement in its day  and we in Congress who revere it now have a responsibility to see that it continues to meet the needs of both current and future beneficiaries in our own day and generation  Putting beneficiaries first is what has made Medicare so popular and successful over the past four decades  and if the same fundamental priority is respected by Congress today and in the years ahead  Medicare will have forty more years of brilliant accomplishment in meeting the needs of our seniors and our fellow citizens with disabilities    STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY  ON THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF MEDICAID   This Saturday marks the 40th anniversary of Medicaid  Over the past four decades  Medicaid has provided quality health care to millions of the most vulnerable members of our society    low income children and parents  pregnant women  disabled persons  and senior citizens  While anniversary should be a time to celebrate the progress we have made in improving the health of those who are less fortunate    but instead  we find ourselves defending the program against harsh cuts that will destroy the health security of many of our fellow citizens     Medicaid has served the nation well over the past 40 years  It provides a critical safety net for those with nowhere else to turn for health care  The majority of Medicaid beneficiaries are too poor or too sick to buy coverage in the private market  Many have disabilities or multiple chronic conditions  or need long term care  Others have severe mental health problems  More than 50 million people receive health coverage under Medicaid today  and most of them would be uninsured and uninsurable without it  States have significant flexibility to design Medicaid programs that meet the needs of their residents  with important federal oversight to make sure that minimal standards are maintained    Today  Medicaid covers nearly 40 percent of all births  It provides health coverage for one in four children  It s Early and Periodic Screening  Diagnosis  and Treatment benefit has been a success in making sure that children receive the care they need     Medicaid also provides prenatal care for many low income women  and it fills in the gaps in coverage for low income seniors and disabled persons  covering long term care services that are not covered by Medicare  It is also a major source of coverage for mental health and substance abuse care and is the largest payer of services for AIDS patients    Medicaid enrollment has grown rapidly over the past few years as more and more Americans not only lost their jobs but lost the health care their employers offered  Low income working families increasingly lost coverage as employers dropped coverage or couldn t afford it  because health costs soared while wages stagnated  It s true that Medicaid costs have risen over the past few years  but this growth is driven primarily by increased need  Medicaid does it s job well    responding to economic downturns and providing a health safety net for those with nowhere else to turn    Yet Medicaid is once again under attack by some who want to undermine the progress we have made  This year s budget mandates mean spirited cuts in the program under the guise of balancing the budget  even though the very same budget includes large new tax breaks for the wealthy  These cuts were ordered even though a bipartisan majority of Senators voted against them     Any changes in Medicaid should be made to improve the care offered to its beneficiaries  not to pay for even greater tax breaks for the wealthy  We need to consider ways to improve Medicaid and make it function more effectively  and we can t accept reforms that do otherwise  Cutting benefits or increasing costs for the poor will keep them from getting the care they need  and cost the nation far more in the long run     Cutting health care for those who rely on Medicaid has real consequences   We know what limiting their access to care will do      It will result in more pain and suffering       It will lead to more deaths because treatable diseases will be diagnosed too late       It will lead to emergency rooms overcrowded with patients with no where else to turn  and      It will lead to increased costs for those with health insurance  as they are charged more to make up for the cost of covering those with no insurance     I look forward to celebrating many more Medicaid anniversaries  My hope is that we will continue to improve and modernize the program  not abandon it  We need to make it work for those it serves  especially the millions of low income children who will grow up to healthy adults tomorrow  because we kept the faith with Medicaid today   Laura Capps Melissa
