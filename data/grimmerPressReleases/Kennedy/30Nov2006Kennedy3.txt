         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement Americas next Secretary of Defense will face the greatest challenges of any Secretary in decades Iraq is the defining issue of our time  The American people are demanding far more than a change of face at the Pentagon  They are demanding  and they deserve  a change in our policies so that we have a plan in Iraq that is worthy of the enormous sacrifice of our men and women in uniform  Although I voted against Mr  Gates nomination to be the head of the CIA in 1991  I will approach the confirmation hearings next week with an open mind  Mr  Gates must persuade Congress and the American people that he will be a strong leader  that he is firmly committed to working within the Administration and with the Congress toward a new course in Iraq  and that he deserves the trust of our nation  and especially our men and women in the Armed Forces  More of the same failed policy that depends on an open ended commitment of our military will not bring America closer to victory  It will not stop the violence  and it will not protect our national security interests I was pleased to have the opportunity to meet with Mr  Gates earlier today  and I look forward to the confirmation hearings and to a hearing on how Mr  Gates will address this monumental challenge    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
