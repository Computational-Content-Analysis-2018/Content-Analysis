         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Year after year weve had borders that arent secure and a system that is brokenYear after year weve had people dying in the desert because they want a better life for themselves and their families Year after year weve had millions of people living in fear day after day  worrying that they could be deported like the hundreds of people were in New Bedford Year after year weve had an underground economy that hurts American workers and abuses hard working families Year after year weve heard talk about reforming our system  Weve heard the bumper sticker solutions  the campaign ads  and we know how divisive it is  Well now it is time for action  2007 is the year we must fix our broken system We must strike while the iron is hot  Ive been around here long enough to know that opportunities like this dont come often  the American people are demanding a solution  the President is committed  Senator Reid has made this a priority  and Senators from both parties are now determined to solve this crisis Politics is the art of the possible and the agreement we just reached is the best possible chance we will have in years to secure our borders and bring millions of people out of the shadows and into the sunshine of America We all want to secure our borders and strengthen our national security  There is broad agreement on the doubling of border guards  securing our perimeter  increasing the number of inspectors  cracking down on smugglers and employers who break the law There is also broad consensus that the 12 million undocumented workers who are here should be offered the chance to earn their legalization  immediately  If this agreement becomes law it will provide a historic opportunity for millions of people right away On family immigration  as someone who comes from a large family I couldnt be more committed to upholding our policy of supporting families that want to stay together  This proposal includes family backlog reduction in 8 years for most of the 4 million in the family backlog  a backlog that currently stretches some 22 years It also maintains that more than a majority of future immigration will be based on family ties  That couldnt be more important  Family reunification has been the cornerstone of our immigration policy for decades and under this proposal it still will be  About 20 per cent will be given to the refugees who desperately need asylum in our country And the remaining third will be based on a point system that factors in preferences for both high skilled and low skilled workers  as well as extended family ties The agreement includes temporary workers that will have strong labor protections  This will help people who risk their lives crossing the border for a job will have the chance to apply for good jobs in the United States  And it helps strengthen the backbone of our economy This plan isnt perfect but it is a strong agreement and a good solution  Only a bipartisan agreement will become law and I believe we owe it to the American people to stop talking about immigration and start acting  We owe it to them to solve this crisis in a way that upholds our humanity and our tradition of a nation of immigrants       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
