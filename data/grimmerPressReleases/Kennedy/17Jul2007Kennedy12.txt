         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  We should have an up or down vote on the Levin amendment The American people have spoken  They want us to end this war  They want to know where each of us stands  Its time to vote This is a blatant abuse of the filibuster  We all know whats going on  Republicans dont want to see their names supporting the vote tally sheet in support of the Presidents reckless and misguided war They dont want to see their names on the tally sheet of an up or down vote  and they dont want to see their names on a tally sheet on a vote to end their filibuster  So theyre delaying these votes as long as possible The Senate rules do protect the minority  But rarely are they used to delay and delay and delay even more  The minority is abusing the rules by seeking an endless delay to prevent these issues from coming to a vote  Its irresponsible to abdicate our responsibility on this issue  Its an insult to our soldiers and does not serve our national security  Lets stop the delay and have the vote Republican filibusters cannot stop progress on this issue any more than they stopped progress on other issues that consumed our nation in past years  Civil Rights Act of 1964In 1964  the Senate debated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for 57 working days  including six Saturdays  Finally  on June 10  the Senate ended the filibuster by a vote of 71 29  and the legislation was approved  Equal Employment Opportunity    1972In 1972  the Senate considered legislation to provide enforcement powers for the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission  This was one of the unfinished issues of the Civil Rights debate from nearly a decade before  After a 23 day filibuster and three votes to end the debate and vote on the issue  the Senate approved the legislation  Rights of Institutionalized Act    1980In 1980  the Senate considered legislation to protect the rights of persons confined in state institutions  The conference report was filibustered in the Senate for 8 days  with four attempts to end the debate  Finally  on the fourth try  the filibuster was ended  Fair Housing Amendments    1980The Fair Housing Amendments  which contained the enforcement provisions largely absent from the original law  came to the Senate floor during the lame duck session of 1980  The bill was filibustered by Republicans for six days  and Democrats fell six votes short of ending the debate  Although similar legislation was introduced in each subsequent Congress  the bill was blocked largely Republican Congresses until 1988  when the Democrats were back in charge in the Senate  Martin Luther King  Jr  Holiday    1983In 1983  the Senate considered legislation to create a federal holiday honoring Martin Luther King  It was filibustered by Republicans for four days  The debate was bitter and emotional  but eventually  the legislation prevailed  Civil Rights Restoration Act    1984In 1984  the Senate considered legislation to prohibit discrimination against women in colleges following the Supreme Courts decision in Grove City v  Bell  The bill was filibustered by Republicans  but eventually it was enacted in 1988 Anti Apartheid Act of 1985In 1985  legislation to impose sanctions on South Africa was filibustered for three days  Although similar legislation was filibustered for 12 days the following year  it became law Family and Medical Leave Act  1988 In 1988  the Family and Medical Leave Act was brought to the Senate floor  and was filibustered for 9 days  It passed in 1990 and 1991  but was vetoed both times by President Bush  and Congress was unable to override the vetoes  We made it the first order of business in 1993 with Bill Clinton in the White House  and it was promptly signed into law  The filibuster did not stop the march of progress on any of these important issues  and it will not prevent Democrats from making progress in enacting a phased and orderly timetable for the redeployment of our troops from Iraq  We will continue to press this issue because it is right for our soldiers  right for our national security  and right for Americas respect in the world  I urge my colleagues to vote to end the debate on the Levin Reed amendment  Its time to vote  so the American people will know where each of us stands      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
