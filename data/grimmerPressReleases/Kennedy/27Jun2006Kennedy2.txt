to say that comprehensive immigration reform is neither conservative nor liberal  Republican nor Democratic  but is a vital necessity for America   The immigration crisis is massive and requires comprehensive solutions  We need new approaches that preserve our security  strengthen our economy  and uphold our humanity    First and foremost  we must keep America safe  But we cannot do that just by building more fences  We must also provide a path for those who are here already to come out of the shadows and earn citizenship  And we need new laws that not only protect American workers  but allow employers to get the workers they need to help our economy prosper    Were here today to make clear that business leaders  religious leaders  community leaders  and political leaders all understand this  and President Bush and the American people understand it  too   Im pleased to announce that the grass roots organizations that organized those historic marches this year involving over 4 5 million participants  will kick off its Democracy Summer campaign this weekend    Their goal is to register hundreds of thousands of new voters and mobilize them to vote in the November elections  They plan to also hold citizenship workshops to help legal permanent residents become citizens and educate voters about what is at stake in the immigration reform debate    The campaign will begin on July 1st in more than 50 cities all across the country  including Chicago  Los Angeles  Indianapolis  Milwaukee  and cities in South Carolina  Idaho  Florida  Oregon  and Nebraska  The Democracy summer campaign will culminate Labor Day weekend with back to back to back million person marches in Los Angeles  Chicago  and Washington  DC    Congress must act this year  the sooner the better  Each day we delay  more than a thousand more people join the underground economy as undocumented immigrants  They come here to work and help their families  but as underground workers they hurt American wages and American jobs   Yet House leaders now tell us theyd rather delay than roll up their sleeves and get to work  The more people learn about the immigration crisis  the more they realize that the House enforcement only bill wont work and that the comprehensive approach supported by President Bush  62 Senators  business and labor is the thoughtful way to go   As with every immigration debate throughout our history  emotions run high and passions run deep  just as they have since our first Independence Day  That is because it is a debate not only about where America has been but also about where America is going  And we believe that America is strongest when we not only keep out those who would hurt us  but also welcome those who would help us   We believe that the Senate bill is a sound blueprint for progress  But there is no single way to meet this great challenge  There are other reasonable voices in this debate as well  and we look forward to the opportunity to work together with the House and White House to achieve a bill thats good for all Americans                                                        Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
