         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Many of us continue to be concerned that the Administration has no effective or realistic plan to stabilize Iraq  They continue to underestimate the strength and deadly growth of the Iraqi insurgency  and month after month they have shamefully failed to take the obvious steps to adequately protect our troops More than 1700 American service members have been killed in Iraq  and nearly 13 000 more have been wounded  Their families know all too well that the insurgents are not desperate  dead enders in their last throes  as Administration officials have repeatedly claimed  As General Myers said in April  the capacity of the insurgents  is where they were almost a year ago In the last two months  America has lost an average of three soldiers a day in Iraq and no end is in sight  As General Myers said last month  I wouldn t look for results tomorrow One thing we know about insurgencies is that they last from three  four years to nine years Because of the war  our military has been stretched irresponsibly thin  and our ability to respond to crises elsewhere has been jeopardized The alarm bell on the strain of our forces has been ringing for at least a year and a half  In January 2004  Lieutenant General John M  Riggs  tasked with creating a high tech army for the 21st century  said  I have been in the Army 39 years  and I ve never seen the Army as stretched in that 39 years as I have today Lieutenant General James Helmley  head of the Army Reserve  warned eleven months later that the Reserve is rapidly degenerating into a  broken  force and is in grave danger of being unable to meet other operational requirements Both the regular and reserve components forces are failing to meet their recruitment goals  The severe strain of the war in Iraq on the armed forces and the ability of the United States to protect our other national security interests in other parts of the world concerns us all Secretary Rumsfeld has been consistently wrong about Iraq He was wrong in September 2002  when he told the House Armed Services Committee that knowing what we know about Iraq s history  no conclusion is possible except that they have and are escalating their WMD programs  He was wrong when he told this Committee  no terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people than the regime of Saddam Hussein and Iraq When General Shinseki estimated we would need several hundred thousand soldiers  he scoffed and said  the idea that it would take several hundred thousand U S  forces I think is far from the mark  When massive looting occurred after Baghdad fell because we didn t have enough troops for security  he callously said  stuff happens He wrongly insisted after Saddam fell that there was no guerilla war  even though our soldiers continued to be killed  In June 2003  you said  the reason I don t use the phrase guerilla war is because there isn t one  He s wrongly called the insurgents dead enders even though they ve now killed more than 1700 American soldiers and wounded another 13 000 He wrongly sent our service members into battle without proper armor  When asked by a soldier about inadequate equipment  he arrogantly and callously said  You go to war with the army you have  They re not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time He s exaggerated our success in training capable Iraqi security forces  In February 2004 he told this committee  We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces  now more than 200 000 strong  In fact  far fewer were actually capable of fighting then  and far fewer are capable of fighting even now  Our effort is floundering  and everyone knows it He s been wrong dozens of times  He s mismanaged the war  and created an impossible situation for our military recruiters and put our forces and our national security in danger In his testimony Secretary Rumsfeld concedes  there are mistakes  setbacks  and hardships  Yet  he continues down the same failed course  Questioning the prosecution of this war is every Senator s duty  But when you are forewarned about the consequences and still proceed down the same failed course  it s an abdication of the Secretary s duty  Our soldiers need more than a PR campaign from the Administration to win this war  They need honesty and new leadership  Fact sheet below RUMSFELD  JUST PLAIN WRONG ON IRAQWMD He stated that we were under threat from a state that had weapons of mass destruction   There are a number of terrorist states pursuing weapons of mass destruction    Iran  Libya  North Korea  Syria    to name but a few  But no terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people and the stability of the world that the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq  Senate Armed Services Hearing  September 19  2002    K nowing what we know about Iraq s history  no conclusion is possible except that they have and are accelerating their WMD programs  House Armed Services Hearing  September 18  2002 No terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people than the regime of Saddam Hussein and Iraq    Senate Armed Services Hearing  September 19  2002 Iraq poses a threat to the security of our people and to the stability of the world that is distinct from others  In both word and deed  Iraq has demonstrated that it is seeking the means to strike the United States  our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction for a reason  so that it can acquire the territory of its neighbors  Reserve Officers Association  January 20  2003Troops needed for the war  What is  I think  reasonably certain is the idea that it would take several hundred thousand U S  forces I think is far from the mark  Media Availability with Afghan President Karzai  February 27  2003 Because Rumsfeld underestimated the amount of troops needed to fight the war  massive looting occurred after Baghdad fell  In response to the mass chaos  he said stuff happens  Interview on CNN  April 11  2003HumveesHe failed to provide enough armored vehicles for our troops in Iraq  It isn t a matter of money  It isn t a matter on the part of the Army of desire  It s a matter of production and capability of doing it  Kuwait  December 8  2004  You go to war with the army you have  They re not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time  Kuwait  December 8  2004 The Army never asked the companies producing armored humvees to work at maximum capacity  The Army s contracts didn t provide enough funds to keep Humvee production at maximum production  In August 2003  only fifty one Up Armored Humvees were being produced a month  It took the industrial base a year and a half to work up to making 400 a month  Now the Army says they can now get delivery of 550 a month  On June 20  2005  a report from the Marine corps Inspector General was published for Congress stating that about a quarter of the Second Marine Expeditionary Force s Humvees lack sufficient armor to protect troops against roadside bombings  including 1 000 vehicles that have yet to be fitted with armor plates to protect the undercarriage  The report also says that if the current demands in Iraq continue  the Corps will need another 650 Humvees  which have been logging an average of 480 miles a month  mostly over rough terrain  And despite an agreement with the Army to repair broken vehicles at a maintenance facility in Kuwait  the Marine Corps had not scheduled any repairs as of last month  Meanwhile  those Humvees that have received full armor    which the report says have significantly improved the safety of troops    are suffering excessive wear and tear because they were never designed to carry the additional weight  Boston Globe  June 20  2005InsurgencyHe denied the existence of a guerilla war and repeatedly called the insurgents dead enders  Until the regime is gone  until it s finally tipped  until there s absolute certainty that Saddam Hussein is not there any more  I suspect that some of these dead enders will be down there shooting people and doing that type of thing  That s basically what s going on  Department of Defense News Briefing  March 25  2003 They re making progress against the dead enders who are harassing coalition forces  Department of Defense News Briefing June 24  2003 I don t use the phrase guerrilla war is because there isn t one  and it would be a misunderstanding and a miscommunication to you and to the people of the country and the world  Department of Defense News Briefing  June 30  2003 The dead enders are still with us  those remnants of the defeated regimes who ll go on fighting long after their cause is lost  Lackland Air Force Base  August 25  2003 Coalition forces are continuing to root out dead enders and criminal gangs and foreign terrorists that are in Iraq  Department of Defense News Briefing  September 16  2003 It s not been a pacified country  if you will  but in a country where regime dead enders are still violently trying to stop progress    Department of Defense News Briefing November 25  2003 The dead enders  threatened by Iraq s progress to self  government  may believe that they can drive the coalition out through terror and intimidation  and foment civil war among Sunnis and Shias or block the path to Iraqi self rule  But they re badly mistaken  Defense Department Operational Briefing  April 20  2004 There is no popular uprising going on in Iraq right now  This violence  in my view  is a desperate attempt by frustrated  isolated groups  such as the insurgents in Fallujah and Sadr s thugs in Najaf  to derail the progress that we ve been making  Secretary Rumsfeld and Republic of Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan Media Stakeout  April 21  2004 The battle in Iraq today is not a fight between Iraqis and foreign forces    it is a battle between free Iraqis and the last remnants of a defeated regime  who still do not realize that their cause is lost    Department of Defense News Briefing December 3  2004There are 1 700 Americans killed and 13 000 wounded  This is not a passing phase from a few dead enders  this is a full blown insurgencyTroop TrainingHe overstated the number of trained Iraqis We re increasing international military participation in Iraq  We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces  now more than 200 000 strong  Senate Armed Services Committee  February 4  2004U S  government agencies do not report reliable data on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped The departments of State and Defense no longer report on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are equipped with their required weapons  vehicles  communications  equipment  and body armor  GAO Report  Preliminary Observations on challenges in Transferring security Responsibilities to Iraqi Military and Police  March 14  2005   Laura Capps
