         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Last week  Congress took bold action on behalf of American families by sending an appropriations bill to the President that has important new investments in the every day needs and hopes and dreams of the American people  Its the bill that funds our investments in education  in health care and in American jobs      These are not optional investments  Theyre not just nice little programs that can be funded one year and cast aside the next     These investments are about hope and opportunity for our children  They are about the dignity of middle class and working families all across America  They are about our national strength      Unfortunately  it appears once again that the every day concerns of the American people have fallen on deaf ears in the White House  This morning  the President vetoed this pro family  pro child  pro worker legislation     In fact  the White House says this bill is irresponsible and reckless       Well I ask President Bush     What is irresponsible and reckless about making sure our children receive the best education in the world     What is irresponsible and reckless about finding a cure for cancer  so that families no longer see the disease claim their mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters before their time     What is irresponsible and reckless about giving our workers the training and skills they need to get good jobs and support their families     If anything is irresponsible and reckless  its the Presidents choices     The President insists on continuing to spend billions of dollars on failed policy in Iraq  but he refuses to deliver the relief that Americas families need  This morning the President signed a Defense Appropriations bill that includes a 10 percent increase in funding compared to last year  But he vetoed a bill that includes an increase half that big that would fund cancer research  investments in our schools  job training  and protections for our workers     Lets take a closer look at just what President Bush has vetoed     The bill provides long overdue funding for education  Year after year  the White House and the Republican leadership in Congress have failed to make needed new investments for better teachers and stronger schools  In fact  Under Republican control  commitment to the education of our children has continued to go down      This bill finally reverses that course  It delivers the largest increase in Title I funding since we passed the No Child Left Behind Act  Thats the funding that goes to the children who have fallen the farthest behind and need the most help  It pays for teachers  improved curriculums  tutors and a whole array of actions that can help children do well in school  It provides  4 5 billion in additional funding for education compared to the Presidents budget     How can the President of the United States say he will leave no child behind when he has vetoed the very bill that will enable us to do that     Were working in Congress to renew the No Child Left Behind reforms and to make them work better  But we cant do that on a tin cup education budget  But this President seems to think that we can improve our schools on the cheap     The President says  4 5 billion more for students is too much  Yet he is proposing 35 times that much more for the war in Iraq  He wants us to say yes to  158 billion for Iraq while he says no to  4 5 billion for American school children     In Iraq  anything goes  The sky is the limit  Billions and billions and billions of dollars for Iraq  But here in America  right here at home  a modest investment in our school children gets a veto     The bill includes  1 billion for high quality programs that help children after school      Those funds will help 1 4 million needy children who need a place to go after the school day ends  Programs that help hard working parents  improve students lives  and that keep communities safe by decreasing drug use and violence      We can help these school children after school for the cost of two and a half days in Iraq       But the President says no     The bill includes  3 billion to improve the quality of our teachers      Those funds will be used to hire 30 000 more teachers in order to reduce class sizes so that teachers can spend more time teaching individual students and less time on crowd control in the classroom  They will be used for mentoring for 100 000 beginning teachers and professional development for an additional 200 000 teachers  We could do all that for the cost of a single week in Iraq      But the President says no     The bill includes  500 million to help our struggling schools to turn around      Improving our schools means supporting them  We can provide support to our neediest schools for about the cost of a day in Iraq     But the President says no     The bill includes  7 billion to provide high quality early education through Head Start      This week  Congress will pass a Head Start bill that will strengthen the program to make Head Start even better  Those funds will be used to ensure that nearly one million children are ready to learn when they enter kindergarten  These funds build a basic foundation for learning that will help these low income and minority children for the rest of their lives  We can fund this for the cost of a little more than two weeks in Iraq      But even as we work in Congress to improve this vital program  the President says no     This same misguided rationale applies to the other investments in the bill as well  The Presidents veto means squandered opportunities for progress on the major health challenges the American people face      I recently spoke to a gathering of leading cancer researchers who are making extraordinary progress against this deadly disease  They have helped cancer become  in many cases  a treatable illness instead of a death sentence  Every day  they are fighting to help Americans with cancer live longer  healthier lives     The bill before us would provide nearly  5 billion to fund more than 6 800 research grants to help win this fight  The Presidents veto tells Americans battling cancer that their fight for life is not a priority for the nation  It tells patients that they must wait a little longer  dream a little less  and hope a little more faintly for the breakthroughs that this research can bring      On and on down the line  the President has vetoed urgently needed research in heart disease  diabetes  asthma  infectious disease  mental health  and many other areas  The President would rather squander billions in Iraq than invest in the research that could bring progress against these diseases and relief for millions of our fellow citizens      But the damage does not stop with the impact of this veto on the cures of the future  Patients today will feel the bite of the Presidents veto      Community Health Centers make quality health care possible for millions of Americans who cannot afford health insurance  A veto of the  2 billion for community health centers included in this bill means that 15 million low income people would be denied their opportunity for health care      The Centers for Disease Control are on call to protect our health 24 hours a day and 7 days a week  When theres an outbreak or a disaster  CDC is there  The Presidents veto will mean that our nations health readiness will be weakened and our progress against disease will be halted      Training of new doctors and nurses  assistance to hospitals in rural and underserved communities  improving health information technology  immunization programs  and on and on  The President has the same response to each of them  veto  veto  veto      The Presidents veto will also be devastating to American workers  With globalization and layoffs and corporations cutting benefits  Americans are worried enough about their jobs  The least we can do is make sure theyre safe on the job and treated with dignity  This bill provides the funds needed to enforce the labor laws that keep our workers safe and give them a level playing field       Just last week three workers were killed in an explosion at a power plant in Salem  Massachusetts  Terrible incidents like this are all too common  Every year  more than 5 700 workers are killed and over 4 million are injured or made ill on the job  Workers everywhere  at power plants  coal mines  hospitals  and construction sites  rely on our federal agencies to protect them and make sure they can return home to their families each night      But the Presidents veto takes bad employers off the hook and puts American workers at risk  We wont have the needed funds this bill provides to inspect workplaces and enforce our safety laws  Millions of workers safety and very lives will be at risk       The veto of this bill is also devastating to veterans  We just observed Veterans Day  Each year  nearly 320 000 brave service members return to civilian life  many coming from Iraq and Afghanistan  Sadly  our hearing in the Labor Committee last week showed they face daunting challenges     Tens of thousands of Reservists and National Guard members have lost their benefits and even their jobs because they served their country  Thats why this bill provides  228 million to help our veterans find jobs  receive trainingand protect their right to return to their former jobs  President Bushs veto takes away this modest welcome mat and slams the door shut in our veterans faces      And what about other American workers who want to upgrade their skills to compete and win in the global economy  This bill says we should not cast workers and their dreams aside  It rejects the Presidents cuts and includes  2 9 billion for job training  But a presidential veto again leaves these hardworking Americans out in the cold      This appropriations bill is about the strength and well being of Americas families  By vetoing the bill  the President is turning his back on the priorities of Americas families  their hopes  their dreams  their opportunities  But we will not give up on providing the solutions that are so desperately needed  We will continue to work with our colleagues in the Senate and the House and chart a new course and fight for the real needs of all Americans          Melissa Wagoner  202  224
