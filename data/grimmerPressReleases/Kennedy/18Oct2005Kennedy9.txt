         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is a shameful  special interest bill to protect gun manufacturers and sellers  even if they recklessly make guns available to criminals and terrorists  If the House votes to give the gun industry this unprecedented legal immunity  more and more guns will be readily available to terrorists and criminals  There will be more killings and more innocent victims     This bill was bought and paid for by the NRA  and it s a disgrace for the Republican Congress to try to pass it    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
