         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  Im pleased to be a cosponsor of the Feingold Reid amendment       I strongly support our troops  but I strongly oppose the war        Our military has served nobly in Iraq and done everything we have asked them to do   But they are now caught in a quagmire   They are policing a civil war and implementing a policy that is not worthy of their enormous sacrifice         The best way to protect our troops and our national security is to put the Iraqis on notice that they need to take responsibility for their future  so that we can bring our troops back home to America       As long as our military presence in Iraq is open ended  Iraqs leaders are unlikely to make the essential compromises for a political solution         The Administrations misguided policy has put our troops in an untenable and unwinnable situation   They are being held hostage to Iraqi politics  in which sectarian leaders are unable or unwilling to make the difficult judgments needed to lift Iraq out of its downward spiral   Were spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a failed policy that is making America more vulnerable and is putting our troops at greater risk      Our policy in Iraq continues to exact a devastating toll   Nearly 4000 American troops have died  and 30 000 have been injured   The toll on Iraqis is immense   Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed or injured and more than four million Iraqis have been forced to flee their homes   Nearly a half trillion dollars have been spent fighting this war        Now the President wants to use the supplemental spending bill to pour hundreds of billions of dollars more into the black hole that our policy in Iraq has become   Its wrong for Congress to continue to write a blank check to the President for the war   Its obvious that President Bush intends to drag this process out month after month  year after year  so that he can hand his Iraqi policy off to the next President        Its time to put the brakes on this madness        We have to change our policy now   Until we do  our troops will continue shedding their blood in the streets of Baghdad other parts of Iraq and our national security will remain at risk      This amendment makes the change we so urgently need     It sets a clear timeline for the safe and orderly withdrawal of our troops  and it requires most of them to come home in nine months      Its up to us to halt the open ended commitment of our troops that President Bush has been making year after year   The Iraqis need to take responsibility for their own future  resolve their political differences  and enable our troops to come home      We need to tell the Iraqis now that we intend to leave and leave soon   Only by doing so  can we add the urgency that is so clearly necessary for them to end their differences        We cant allow the President to drag this process out any longer  This war is his responsibility and its his responsibility to do all he can to end it  Its wrong for him to pass the buck to his successor  when he knows that thousands more of the courageous members of our armed forces will be wounded or die because of it  and when everyday this misguided war goes on  our servicemen and women and their families continue to shoulder the  burden and pay the price       I urge my colleagues to support this amendment            Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
