         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     On immigration reform  President Bush has given two speeches in two days    but five years of no action  His trip to the border is a welcome move that now needs to be backed up with real leadership  It is time for President Bush to resist those on the right who rely on fear tactics to prevent our broken system from being fixed    Americans don t want closed borders or open borders  they want smarter borders that effectively and efficiently secure our country and policies that enforce our laws  As business leaders and experts understand  true immigration reform must be realistic and comprehensive  strengthening our security while bringing an underground economy above ground   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
