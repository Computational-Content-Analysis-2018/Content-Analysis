         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Mr  Chairman  thank you for convening these hearings and for your continued commitment to keeping us on track to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act during this Congress         We all understand that English is the common and unifying language of the United States   Becoming proficient in English is important to becoming part of American society and pursuing the American dream   Theres no disagreement here        We also all understand that voting is a fundamental right   Its the right from which all other rights derive   Again  there is no disagreement among us on this point        But we must also understand that not all citizens of the United States know English well enough to participate in an English only election   Without bilingual ballots and assistance at the polls  there are millions of our fellow citizens who would be unable to vote effectively         These include many native born American citizens  who because of poverty and unequal educational opportunities have high rates of illiteracy and limited English proficiency       They also include many Puerto Ricans  who are U S  citizens by birth and who have given so much to this country      65 000 Puerto Ricans served in World War II  48 000 in Vietnam   As of November 2003  3 500 Puerto Ricans were serving in Iraq or Afghanistan and as of last February  48 of them had died fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan   Since World War II  Puerto Rico has suffered more military casualties per capita than any other U S  jurisdiction     Puerto Ricans  educated in classrooms where the instruction was in Spanish  should not be denied a ballot they can understand and voting instructions they can understand   Yet some states tried to do that   In the Voting Rights Act of 1965  Congress prohibited states from conditioning the right of Puerto Ricans to vote on their ability to read and write in English  and the Supreme Court in Katzenbach v  Morgan upheld the constitutionality of that prohibition   The same principle applies to Native Americans and Alaskan Natives   On many Indian Reservations and in Alaskan villages  translators are necessary to translate ballots into unwritten languages for Native Americans and Alaskans who cannot read their ballots and could not vote effectively without that assistance       We owe it to these Americans to provide them the help they need to cast their votes        The same principle should apply to naturalized U S  citizens   They were attracted to our country by opportunity and the promise of democracy  and they are no less worthy to exercise their right to vote     Its wrong to equate knowing enough English to become a naturalized citizen with knowing enough English to participate responsibly in an election   According to current federal law on naturalization  persons must be able to read or write simple words and phrases in English to become naturalized citizens   Naturalization law also exempts some Americans over 50 from having to satisfy an English language requirement to become a citizen     Even under the more demanding English language requirement of the recent Senate immigration bill  applicants for naturalization would need to demonstrate a sufficient understanding of the English language for usage in everyday life    But many elections require more than an understanding of everyday usage to participate effectively   Often  ballots contain complex referenda and initiatives   Heres one example   Its an initiative that appeared on the ballot in Denver County  Colorado in 2004   The county is required to provide voting materials in Spanish under Section 203    Even those of us who think we can speak English would probably ask for the Cliffs Notes version of this ballot   Our limited English proficient fellow citizens know the importance of learning English   Access to the franchise in their native language is not a disincentive to learn English   Their lives and struggles are a daily reminder of how important learning English is to succeeding in this country  It should upset all of us here today that were not meeting our obligation to help them learn English   They want to learn English     In Boston  the waiting list to learn English is nearly 17 000 students long and the waiting period is as long as 3 years   3 years   In New York City  its estimated that 1 million residents need English language instruction  yet there are only 41 000 slots     The problem is national    In Albuquerque  Catholic Charities reports 1 000 people on their waiting lists  and a waiting time of 12 months for services   In Phoenix  the waiting list at the Rio Salado Community College is over 1 000  and the waiting time is up to 18 months       Lets not punish American citizens who want to learn English by conditioning the fundamental right to vote on an ability to read and write in English   If were sincere about including naturalized citizens in the American way of life and promoting American values and traditions  there is no better way than through the ballot box  and we need to continue Section 203 to make it possible
