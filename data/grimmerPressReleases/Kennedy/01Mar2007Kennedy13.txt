         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Senator Gordon H  Smith  introduced the Laboratory Test Improvement Act  The legislation will mandate  that all providers of homebrew laboratory tests provide the FDA with evidence  that verifies their analytical and clinical validity  All of the information  submitted to the FDA will be compiled into a database  which will subsequently  be made available to the public on the Internet  Presently  an overwhelming  majority of the laboratory tests employed by health care facilities are homebrew  tests that have not been approved by the FDA  In some instances  homebrew tests  are used to diagnose Huntingtons disease and susceptibility to breast cancer   As such  the results of homebrew tests affect the lives of thousands of  Americans and their families each and every year  Senator Kennedy  said  Our goal is to ensure the quality of clinical tests used everyday in  hospitals and doctors offices across the country  Physicians often base  medical decisions on the results of such tests  and patients deserve confidence  that they will not be wrongly diagnosed or given the wrong pill because of a  faulty test  Senator Smith said  Genetic science holds great promise   and with that promise  a hope for a better understanding of human health and  disease  Recent advances in genetic science have fueled the growth of a poorly  regulated direct to consumer genetic testing industry which can often shock and  misinform consumers  The federal government has an obligation to conduct  vigorous oversight to ensure the safety  accuracy and usefulness of these  tests Laboratories will be given time to comply with the regulations  and provide the FDA with needed information  To further ensure that health care  providers and consumers are well informed  homebrew tests and test results must  indicate whether or not the test has received FDA approval  A  summary of the legislation is below  Summary of the Laboratory Test  Improvement Act The vast majority of tests used by health care  providers and patients every day to make significant medical decisions are  homebrew testslaboratory developed assays offered as services  Examples of  homebrew tests include those for diagnosis of Huntingtons disease and  susceptibility to breast cancer  Currently  the FDA does not clear or approve  these homebrew tests  In addition  homebrew tests are offered in competition to  test kits that FDA has cleared or approved  For example  one company markets an  FDA cleared DNA chip that looks for mutations in genes important for the  metabolism of many common prescription drugs Clinical laboratories that  perform homebrew tests are regulated by CMS under the Clinical Laboratory  Improvement Amendments  but CMS does not ensure that all of these tests are  performed accurately  analytical validity   nor does CMS examine whether tests  results have any clinical meaning  clinical validity  The Laboratory  Test Improvement Act will require providers of homebrew laboratory tests to  submit to the FDA evidence to support their tests analytical and clinical  validity for inclusion in a database available to the public on the Internet   The bill allows FDA to require tests to go through the clearance or approval  process only under specified circumstances  after giving the laboratory the  opportunity to correct the information  Such circumstances include if the  information on the test in the database is inadequate  if it shows the test is  not comparable to an FDA cleared or approved test kit  or if the test is a  direct to consumer test As is the case now  new homebrew tests will come  on the market without FDA review  so innovative  new tests will be available to  patients without delay  Labeling for homebrew tests would have to  indicate if they have not been FDA cleared or approved  and health care  providers and patients will receive results noting if the test used is not FDA  cleared or approved  A mechanism would be developed for the enhanced  reimbursement of cleared and approved in vitro diagnostic products and  laboratory developed tests   CONTACT Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy   202 224 2633  Kimberly Collins  Smith  202 224 3932
