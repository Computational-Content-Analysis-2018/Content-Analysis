         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I m very pleased that Secretary Thompson  in one of his last acts  today approved Massachusetts  Medicaid waiver Approval of this waiver means that Massachusetts will not face a devastating cut in Medicaid funds  Two hundred and fifty thousand people will be able to keep their Medicaid coverage  Our safety net hospitals and community health centers will continue to receive essential funding  And we will be able to use these funds to take our health system a giant step forward to the day when every citizen of our Commonwealth is guaranteed health insurance coverage I commend Governor Romney and the members of his Administration who have worked so hard to achieve this result  and I thank Secretary Thompson for his support and for his understanding of the great importance of this issue for our state   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633
