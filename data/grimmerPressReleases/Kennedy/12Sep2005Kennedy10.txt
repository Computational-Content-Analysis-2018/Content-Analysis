         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner                202  224 2633    The resignation of Michael Brown is an opportunity to turn things around and get it right  We owe that to the people of the Gulf  and we owe it to all Americans to reform FEMA under new leadership and restore it to cabinet level status     We must rebuild  and we must not hesitate to act in large ways to meet this massive challenge FEMA cannot perform this function  as it has to respond to an average of 30 disasters every year  It cannot provide the kind of leadership and exclusive focus that the people of the Gulf Coast deserve  I have proposed a Gulf Coast Regional Redevelopment Authority  modeled after the Tennessee Valley Authority  to focus our full energies on the challenge of rebuilding the Gulf and ensuring new and continued economic prosperity for all that live there  It should allow governors and mayors and citizens and communities to work together to plan  help fund  and coordinate for the reconstruction of that damaged region  It should be led by an eminent American with cabinet rank who has the trust of the American people and can get things done  The American people deserve no less   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
