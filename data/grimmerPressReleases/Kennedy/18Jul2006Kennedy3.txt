         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      This afternoon  the debate on stem cell research will draw to a close  For Senators  life will move on  Next week  the Senate will deal with other issues and other questions    But millions of Americans don t have that luxury  For them  the struggle against disease isn t something they think about for a few brief days  It s something they confront every day of their lives    A child coping with endless injections of insulin and constant worries about blood sugar cannot simply turn away from this debate    Someone watching helplessly as a parent or spouse succumbs to the tremors of Parkinson s Disease cannot simply move on to other concerns    For us  a vote on stem cell research may take only a few minutes in a busy day  but for millions of Americans  the consequences of our vote may last a lifetime    And should this life saving legislation pass through Congress  President Bush has said he will veto it  The President may believe that ends the debate  But it does not  This debate will continue as long as lives are diminished and cut short by diseases and injuries that stem cells might cure  This debate will go on as long as there are those of us who believe that rather than discard unwanted embryos  we should embrace them to bring fuller lives to millions of people     For their sake  our battle continues  tomorrow  next week  next month and into the days ahead  To those who suffer and cling to hope  we promise that we will never give up  The promise of a better day that embryonic stem cell research brings cannot be denied forever    I want to take a moment to address some of the arguments our opponents on this issue have made during this debate  Dr  Thomas Murray  one of the nation s leading scholars in bioethics has a simple saying  Good ethics start with good facts  Sadly  on this most important ethical issue  we have heard some very questionable allegations     We have heard that adult stem cells have conquered disease after disease  and therefore our legislation is not needed  But the facts tell a different story  The nation s leading scientific society  the American Association for the Advancement of Science  recently published an extensive study that disputes these claims    Contrary to the allegations of opponents of our bill  adult stem cells have not treated Parkinsons Disease  cancer  lymphoma  brain tumors  multiple sclerosis  arthritis  lupus  sickle cell anemia  heart damage  spinal cord injuries  and many  many other conditions  The Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation was so concerned about the misleading claims that adult stem cells are curing cancer that they sent Congress a letter setting the record straight  Their letter states that the studies used to support these claims are not extensive and by no means prove that adult stem cells are effective in treating these cancers    In fact  out of the hundreds of diseases and injuries that our legislation might address  only nine have shown promise for treatment with adult stem cells     Let s hope that in time  this situation changes  If adult stem cells can cure cancer or Parkinson s Disease or spinal injury in the future  we will all rejoice    But we must not foreclose the chance of progress with embryonic stem cells while this possibility is tested  No matter how deeply held the convictions are of those who oppose our legislation  they cannot erase the facts  The objective evidence has convinced the nation s leading medical experts that embryonic stem cell research has unique potential and unparalleled promise    Our opponents have also said that because there have as yet been no cures from embryonic stem cells  we should continue to restrict the research     Is it truly a surprise that a discovery made only a few years ago has yet to move to the clinic  especially when NIH has been prohibited from funding the most promising areas of research     Knowledge about the function of DNA is the foundation of modern medical science  It underlies the development of every major new drug and medical treatment today    In 1973  scientists discovered how to splice pieces of DNA together  the fundamental breakthrough that led to the biotechnology wonder drugs of today  But there were no clinical trials or new cures based on that historic discovery for years that followed    Human embryonic stem cells were discovered in 1998  Of course they have not led to a range of new cures in the brief time since then    just as discovering how to splice DNA did not lead to immediate clinical breakthroughs    But it would be just as foolish to keep restricting stem cell research today as it would have been to stop basic DNA research in the 1970 s because it did not produce instant cures    The ethical debate surrounding stem cell research is not unique  Such debates have accompanied many breakthrough new therapies  And it is essential for researchers to be bound by strict ethical guidelines  especially in the early days of a new science as we seek to understand its potential    Such controversy also accompanied other lifesaving and beneficial medical developments  such as DNA research and in vitro fertilization  But now  DNA research has saved lives and alleviated suffering  IVF has brought the joy of parenthood to couples across America     Would any of us turn back the clock and shun the new medicines that DNA research has brought  Would any of us deny the joy of children to those able to conceive only through IVF  Of course not     In a few short minutes  the Senate will decide whether to open the extraordinary promise of stem cell research to millions of Americans who look to it with hope for new cures and a better day    I urge the Senate to vote for hope by supporting lifesaving embryonic stem cell research      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
