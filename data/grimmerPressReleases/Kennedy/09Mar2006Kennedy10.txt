         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   and 10 House and Senate colleagues wrote the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  seeking additional time for the public to review a major new rule proposal on the Northeast fishery The new rule proposal  which is expected to begin May 1  is highly detailed and will force major reductions in the number of days at sea fishermen may be in the fishery  The Senator and his colleagues are seeking a 30 day  or more  comment period Senator Kennedy said  For simple fairness sake  NOAA should grant our request  This is a very significant rule proposal that would have a major impact on the livelihoods of families in New England s fishing communities  It s important that they have a chance to comment on the rule  and this deadline doesn t cut it  It s unacceptable that our fishermen only have 10 days to comment on changes that would have a huge impact on their day to lives and the way they work   said Senator John Kerry  It s dead wrong to rush through a policy change of this magnitude  If the agency knows what s right and fair  they ll extend the comment period  On Friday  NOAA published a new rule proposal that  if enacted  would result in an across the board reduction in the number of days at sea fishermen may be in the Northeast fishery  The rule proposal would charge each day as 1 4 days at sea The draft rule s public comment period is set to expire on March 9  unless NOAA acts upon the Senators  and Representatives  request  30  The Honorable Conrad C  Lautenbacher  Jr  NOAA Administrator Herbert Hoover Building  Room 5221 14th St  and Constitution Ave   NW Washington  DC 20230 Dear Vice Admiral Lautenbacher We re writing to respectfully request that you extend the comment period for NOAA s recently proposed emergency secretarial action on the Northeast Multispecies Fishery  Docket No  060209031 6031 01   This major rule proposal will have an enormous impact on the Northeast s groundfish fishery  and to have a fair and open rulemaking process  additional time is needed for interested parties to analyze and submit their comments NOAA published its Proposed Rule in the Federal Register on March 3  2006  and set a comment deadline of March 9  A proposed rule of this magnitude should have 30 days  at a minimum  for public comment  The Proposed Rule includes major changes for the fishery  such as applying an across the board reduction in the number of days at sea in which permit holders are allowed to fish  It would force a net reduction of 34 5 percent in Category A DAS for all NE multispecies vessels  and the cumulative impact of the Amendment 13 DAS reductions and the Proposed Rule would result in a net reduction of approximately 61 percent from 2001 to 2006  Additional time is needed to assess the profound economic impacts of making such major DAS reductions  An alternative proposal  the TAC alternative  which the New England Fishery Management Council has already voted to analyze as a possible alternative to the Northeast Fishery s Framework 42  could also be applied to the emergency regulation As you know  the emergency regulation was proposed as a bridge until Framework 42 is approved after May 1  2006  The TAC alternative would likely take a more precise approach to achieving the necessary biological objectives and fishing mortality rate reductions  and it would achieve those objectives in a way that will have far less harmful economic impact  Extending the public comment period will allow more time for this alternative to be reframed for providing comment on the Proposed Rule We believe it is essential for additional time to be provided for public comment on this extremely serious issue  which will have a major impact on all of our states  economies and particularly on our fishing communities  We hope that you will agree  and that you will provide additional time for public comment on the Proposed Rule as soon as possible  With respect and appreciation  and we thank you for your consideration of our request  Signed  Edward M  Kennedy John F  Kerry Jack Reed Barney Frank Jeb Bradley William Delahunt Michael Michaud Patrick J  Kennedy James R  Langevin John F  Tierney James P  McGovern   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
