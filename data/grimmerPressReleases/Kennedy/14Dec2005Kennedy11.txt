         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy praised Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings  announcement to recognize the progress of certain students with disabilities for their achievements under the No Child Left Behind Act  Kennedy believes that it s especially important for students who for years were excluded from high standards and opportunity in America s classrooms to be given fair standards for achievement     Senator Kennedy said  Teaching children with disabilities is no longer just an issue of access  but of quality  Every school should have the resources needed to identify special needs children early  deliver quality instruction to those children  and help them make the transition to higher education and life opportunities once they finish school  I m confident that today s policy will move us closer toward that goal  by establishing rigorous standards for instructing students with disabilities and by improving the benchmarks that measure their progress    Currently under NCLB  the achievement of students with disabilities is measured in one of 3 ways   1  regular assessment based on grade level standards   2  regular assessment  with accommodations  based on grade level standards  or  3  alternate assessment for the most severely disabled  This third category is based on functional criteria and states may include up to 1  of their students in this last category for NCLB purposes    But NCLB s current regulations leave some students out  particularly those with less severe disabilities  These students are still learning to the academic standard in their grade  but often don t do well on the regular assessment  even with accommodations  because of their cognitive limitations  With a modified state assessment of their standards  these students will be given a chance to succeed     The regulation would allow states to develop and use modified achievement standards  with modified tests  for approximately 20 percent of students with disabilities a  The regulation permits this  as long as states ensure   1  students are still instructed in grade level content and tested on that content   2  students are still encouraged to graduate with a regular diploma  and  3  guidelines are developed and used at the IEP meeting to determine whether a student should be included in this new category  The major difference from the current policy is that the achievement standard would be modified for these students  but not at the functional level  as it is with the most severely disabled      30    SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY STATEMENT ON IMPROVEMENT TO NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND TO RECOGNIZE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES   Today s policy moves us closer toward the goal of ensuring that the No Child Left Behind Act works for students with disabilities  and I commend Secretary Spellings on her dedication to the sound implementation of the law    We ve done well to ensure that children with the most severe disabilities are recognized under No Child Left Behind  and I m hopeful that today s action will help acknowledge the skills and capabilities of an even greater number of students through modified standards and assessments  I m pleased that the Secretary has struck a fair balance between the academic challenges facing special needs children and the accountability necessary to ensure their success    Earlier this year  I proposed legislation to improve assessments for students with disabilities under the No Child Left Behind Act  Today s announcement is an important step forward toward meeting that charge  but more must be done to help states measure the progress of students with disabilities in the most appropriate manner  It s clear that the states need resources to get the job done and implement the most accurate  valid  and reliable measures     Teaching children with disabilities is no longer just an issue of access  but of quality  To improve progress for students with disabilities  we must invest resources in reform  So far  the Bush Administration and this Republican Congress have committed to less than half of our fair share of special education funding  and short changed the No Child Left Behind Act by  13 billion in this year alone     Our students with disabilities deserve more    not less    to meet the high standards of the No Child Left Behind Act   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
