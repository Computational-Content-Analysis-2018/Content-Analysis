         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senators Edward M  Kennedy  Debbie Stabenow  and Amy Klobuchar joined members from the National Organization of Women  Institute for Womens Policy Research  and the National Womens Law Center to discuss the much needed increase in the minimum wage  More than seven and a half million American women would benefit from a raise in the minimum wage  More than half of these women have children  Almost 40  are women of color  Senator Kennedy said  These women arent just numbers  Theyre your friends and neighbors  your sisters and your daughters  working hard each day to improve their lives and provide for their families This week  the Senate is debating Kennedys bill to give Americas workers the raise they deserve  Sixty per cent of minimum wage workers are women  and 1 4 million single parents  most of whom are women  would benefit from the increase  After almost 10 years with no increase in the minimum wage  the value of the current wage has dropped more than 20  and continues to plummet  Each year we fail to raise the minimum wage marks a year that families across the country fall farther behind in the struggle to make ends meet STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON MINIMUM WAGE AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY  Workers are continuing to struggle in the Bush economy  Americans are putting in more hours  and more effort  Our productivity is soaring  but workers arent seeing the benefits of their efforts  Instead  theyre struggling with rising prices and stagnant wages  with no hope of relief in sight  This economic insecurity is particularly affecting women  The lowest paying jobs in our society are overwhelmingly dominated by women  Half of all women in America work in low paying jobs that leave them with little security  Women serve our food  They clean our houses and hotel rooms  They care for the sick and the elderly  and help our children learn and grow  Today  too many of these women are struggling to survive on poverty wages that do not reflect the dignity or value of their work   More than seven and a half million American women would benefit from a raise in the minimum wage  More than half of these women have children  Almost 40  are women of color These women arent just numbers  Theyre your friends and neighbors  your sisters and your daughters  working hard each day to improve their lives and provide for their families In my 44 years in the Senate  I have been fortunate enough to meet many of these women  and I have heard from many more  Yesterday  I heard from Tonya Schmidt  Tonya is a single mother with two children  ages 8 and 11  She works at Little Ceasars pizza  its hard work  but she likes her job and shes good at it  Tonya talked about how hard it is for her to get by each month  Her family lives in a converted motel room  but she still has trouble making rent  She doesnt have a car  but relies on friends and family to take her to the grocery store to buy food for her kids Tonya talked about the difficult choices she has to make  how she cant afford basic necessities for her children  Clothes  she said  are the hardest  She often cant afford to buy her children the clothes they need for school  Tonya says a higher minimum wage would help her provide her kids with these basic necessities  And it might help her get a few steps ahead  to buy a used car and pay for car insurance so that she could get to the grocery store on her own And then theres Constance Martin of Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  Constance used to have a good job that paid a decent wage  But then her son got cancer  She was forced to choose between that job and taking care of her child  So now she works for  5 50 an hour at a Kentucky Fried Chicken  Her job has no healthcare or other benefits  She can barely afford to pay the rent and the utilities  much less to give her son the care he needs  When Pennsylvania raised its minimum wage at the state level last year it was a help  but still not enough to keep pace with the cost of living  A federal raise would allow her to pay off her bills and provide for her sons future  instead of living day to day  hand to mouth just to get by  There are millions of American women like Tonya and Constance all across the country  They are working hard and playing by the rules  They are workers and they are caregivers  They are the foundation of this great nation  and they deserve a fair wage that will give them real security  and hope for a better future Im proud to be joined today by two Senators who know firsthand the challenges that working women are facing  Its always a pleasure to share the stage with my good friend Debbie Stabenow  and its an honor to welcome one of our newest Senators  Amy Klobuchar    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
