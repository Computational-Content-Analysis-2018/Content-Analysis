         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I strongly support the Levin  Biden  Reid amendment on Iraq      There are important differences between our amendment and the Republican alternative     Our amendment expresses the clear sense of the Senate that U S  military forces should not stay in Iraq indefinitely  The Republican amendment ducks that issue and endorses President Bush s open ended commitment of our forces  saying that our troops should not stay in Iraq any longer than required     Although many of us disagree with the President about the war  we all honor the service and sacrifice and heroism of our brave men and women in Iraq  More than 2 000 American soldiers have been killed in combat in Iraq  and more than 15 000 have been wounded  The youngest was 18  The oldest was 59  Nearly three quarters were under 30    They re the best of America  and we re proud of each and every one  Our armed forces are serving courageously in Iraq under enormously difficult circumstances  and the policy of our government must be worthy of their sacrifice  Unfortunately  it is not  and the American people know it  An open ended commitment in Iraq is not in America s interest  and it s not in Iraq s interest either  The goal of our military should be to establish a legitimate functioning government  not to dictate it  If we want the new Iraqi government to succeed  we need to give Iraq back to the Iraqi people  We need to let Iraq make its own political decisions  without American interference  We need to train the Iraqi security forces  but we also need to reduce our own military presence  There is widespread recognition that our overwhelming military presence is inflaming the insurgency    After the election of a permanent Iraqi Government  we should begin a substantial and continuing drawdown of U S  forces    If additional forces are necessary during our drawdown or when our drawdown is completed  they should have the support of the Iraqi people and United Nations and come from the international community  American troops can participate  but unlike the current force  it should not consist mostly of Americans or be led by Americans  All nations of the world have an interest in Iraq s stability and territorial integrity     Defenders of President Bush s failed stay the course policy pretend that alternatives like this are a cut and run strategy  They are not     Last February  General Abizaid said  What makes it hard for the United States is that an overbearing presence  or a larger than acceptable footprint in the region  works against you         No one has accused him of cut and run     Last July  General George Casey  Commanding General of the Multi National Forces in Iraq talked about fairly substantial reductions of troops in 2006  No one has accused him of cut and run     Just last month  America s Ambassador to Iraq  Zalmay Khalilzad  said  It s possible that we could adjust our forces  downsizing them in the course of next year  No one has accused him of cut and run    This month  Melvin R  Laird  Secretary of Defense in the Nixon Administration  wrote in the current issue of the journal Foreign Affairs  Our presence is what feeds the insurgency  he writes  and our gradual withdrawal would feed the confidence and the ability of average Iraqis to stand up to the insurgency  No one has accused him of cut and run    Former Secretary Colin Powell s Chief of Staff has called foreign policy in the Bush Administration a cabal between the Vice President and Secretary of Defense  He said they made decisions in secret about Iraq  and that we are now paying the consequences  There was no plan for post war Iraq  and we re now paying the consequences    In the latest display of secrecy  the Administration negotiated a one year extension of our UN mandate without informing the Congress  That resolution was approved last week    It hardly means the Administration feels we can accomplish our military objectives by the end of 2006  The UN action was clearly an attempt by the Administration to avoid a debate at this time about the duration and goals and effectiveness of our strategy in Iraq    As our Ambassador to the U N   John Bolton  said  the United States sought to extend the mandate far in advance of the Iraqi election  so it didn t become an issue in the election    Secretary Rice testified in the Foreign Relations Committee on October 19  and she briefed members in closed session  Surely she could have mentioned that discussions about the fate of 150 000 American servicemen and women were under way with the international community    Our Ambassador to Iraq briefed members in closed session on November 2   Surely  he could have addressed this issue as well    We need to have an open and honest debate about our future military presence in Iraq  An open ended commitment of our military forces does not serve America s best interest  and it does not serve the Iraqis  interest either     The Administration cannot run from this debate forever    Now that the UN mandate has been extended  the President needs to tell the American people the extent to which the international community will participate in the military operations in Iraq    Ambassador Bolton said  We thought it was also important to show the continuing international commitment to progress in Iraq    I agree  But the American people want to know that the troops of the international community will be a part of that commitment as well  The international community is now contributing only 22 000 troops  U S  forces comprise nearly 90  of all forces on the ground  and are suffering more than 90  of all coalition casualties  Our current misguided policy has turned Iraq into a quagmire with no end in sight  It s urgent for the Administration to adopt an honest and effective plan to end the violence and stabilize Iraq  so that our soldiers can begin to come home with dignity and honor    Our men and women serving in Iraq need more than happy talk about future progress from the President  They need more than a public relations campaign    Last Friday  President Bush outlined a new bumper sticker slogan for his misguided policy in Iraq    Strategy for Victory  But it s still the same failed strategy  He should have called it Strategy for Quagmire    Our men and women in uniform deserve better    much better from this President  and so does the nation     I urge my colleagues to support the Levin  Biden  Reid amendment       Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
