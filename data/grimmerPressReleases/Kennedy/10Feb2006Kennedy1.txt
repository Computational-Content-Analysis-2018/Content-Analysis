         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  I will talk for a few moments about the budget that has been submitted by this administration in the last few days and how it fails to address those needs  Effectively  in the budget the President has set up  we are going to see a very serious and significant decline in supporting some enormously needed programs that help to provide opportunities for so many of our people in this country  such as educational programs and health programs  all in order that we provide a tax break for individual Americans at the cost of  45 billion or  46 billion this year  That is what a budget is about  priorities  When I go back to Massachusetts  one of the first orders of business people are talking to me about is  What in the world did the Congress ever do in passing that prescription drug program  I take pride in the fact we passed in the Senate a very good prescription drug program with Senator Bob Graham from Florida  We received over 70 votes in the Senate  We built that program using the Medicare system  which is tried  tested  and depended upon by millions of Americans  Medicare was defeated in 1964 and accepted in 1965 in the Senate  Right after that  we accepted the Medicaid Program to look after the neediest people in our societyprimarily children  women  and disabled individualsto take care of the poorest of the poor  Those programs were implemented in 11 months11 months  It has been over a year for this program to be implemented  And they did not have a computer in 1965 to implement it  but it worked on the principle of building the Medicare system similar to Social Security  American people had confidence in it  and it worked  Well  we went to conference with the House of Representatives  and that is when the influence of the insurance industry and the drug industry came to play  They basically hijacked what was going to be a Medicare prescription drug program for our senior citizens  in a way  and drafted that program to serve not the senior citizensnot the senior citizensbut to serve the special interests  I opposed that on the floor of the Senate  Our Republican friends forced that on through  And now it is chaos in my State of Massachusetts with that prescription drug program  Why  at least  didnt our Republican friends say  All right  lets have some real competition  lets put the private sector and Medicarelet them compete and let our senior citizens make the choice  Do you think they would do that  No  They would not bring a program back here that was built on the Medicare system  They would not permit the seniors in my State to be able to make a choice  But they will say  We trust Medicare  It provides for our doctors bills  It provides for our hospitalization  The PRESIDING OFFICER  The Senator has 5 minutes  Mr  KENNEDY  In 1964 and 1965  when you passed that  you did not include prescription drugs because 97 percent of the private sector did not include prescription drugs  Why didnt we do the prescription drug program just like we did the Medicare Program  Simple  workable  understandablefinished  No  no  we cant do that  We have to do it a different way  We are going to haveinstead of the Medicare system  which is tried and tested and people understandwe are going to give the seniors in Massachusetts 45 different programs with different copays  different formularies  different deductibles  There is mass confusion with that program  Not only is there mass confusion  but you have the extraordinary circumstance that when a senior says  OK  I like this formulary  I can afford this deductible  I can afford this copay  I think I will go into this because of the cost of prescription drugsand they sign on to it  There is an enormously interesting fact  that is  the company they sign up with can change their formulary  can change the deductible and copay  Do you think the senior can get out of that program without paying a penalty  Of course  they cannot  What kind of business is it  They feel  if the private sector can do it so well  why dont we have the competition  Page S1056  Why did we have to provide a 9 percent inflater cost for all the HMOs  when people who are in the HMOs are 18 percent healthier than they are in Medicare  Add that together  my friends  and it is 25 percent more if you are in the HMO than if you are in the Medicare system  Why  Well  if that is the private sector  why isnt the private sector able to compete  Because this amounts to about a  40 billion subsidy  Do you hear me  A  40 billion subsidy  just like it is about a  170 billion subsidy for the drug industry  People wonder why the copayments are higher  Would people wonder why the doughnut is there  There it is  my friends  And with all the reforms we hear talked about  do you think we are going to get a chance to support a change in that program by adding abuild it on Medicare  Lets do that  Lets add that  Have a real even competition and see what happens out there  But many of my colleagues feel that way  We are going to press to try to do it  The point I am making is  I care deeply about these asbestos victims  It is enormously important we get it right  This bill does not do it  But we are in this Congress  on a Friday  at 10 minutes of 11  with an empty Chamber  Why arent we dealing with the challenges and the problems of the people back home  I can tell you what they are concerned about  Why arent we debating this Medicare today  this afternoon  Why are we so busy in what we are doing that we are not dealing with this issue  Why arent we dealing with their home heating oil and the priorities  We have the President in his budget recommending  for this year   500 million less for home heating oil than even last year  with record profits for the oil industryunconscionable profits for the oil industry  Paid for by whom  Average Americans  Unconscionable  Why doesnt this President today  on this Friday  bring in the heads of the oil companies all over the country and say  You have drunk at that trough long enough  There are people up in New England and the upper Midwest and around this country who cannot afford itwho are on a fixed incomewith the explosions in the cost  Because of the war in Iraq  oil costs  60 a barrel  They did not have anything to do with it  The oil companies are reaping profits because we have turmoil in the Middle East  And we are doing virtually nothing about that this afternoon  except facing a budget that is going to make it even more difficult  In my State  the average home owner uses three tankfuls a yearthree tankfuls a yearof oil  And the neediest people in our State who qualify for this program are going to get  this year  about one tankful  And what is the prospect for next year with the home heating oil price that we have today  They are not even going to get a full tank for the next year  unless we arewell  Mr  President  I am going to seek recognition in my own right at the present time  My time has expired  The PRESIDING OFFICER  The Senators time has expired  Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  I ask for recognition  The PRESIDING OFFICER  The Senator is recognized in morning business for up to 10 minutes  Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  we are talking about priorities  We are giving examples of what has been happening in terms of the cost of LIHEAP and the fuel assistance programs  Shown on this chart are all the costs going right up through the roof  We have the challenges we have been facing out in the Middle East  Education  Why are people so concerned about a culture of corruption that has taken over in Washington  Why are they so concerned about lobbyists  Why are they so concerned about special interests  We have that debate  We are going to try to get action on this  which I will certainly support  What we have not talked about is what those lobbyists have been doing  what the impact has been on various programs that affect working families in the middle class  I will give you one of them  Higher education  The bill that came out of the Senate had  8 billion in student assistance  The bill that came out of the House had  3 8 billion in student assistance and provided  12 billion in tax breaks for the wealthy people of this country  I call that a tax on middle class people  my friends  in order to give a tax break to the wealthiest individuals  Do you understand what I am saying  The lobbyists were able to make the student loan program work for the banks and the wealthy in this country at the expense of the middle income families who are paying those debts now for their children to go on to education  In my State  67 percent of the children who go to those schools and colleges in my State get student aid and assistance  That does not include what they earn at summer jobs and what their parents contribute  They need these programs  We have seen an explosion in student loans over the period of the last 5 or 7 years  Who has been working and who has been profiting  It has been the banksthe banks  Do you think this Senate would stand for a competition for who would provide the lowest rates for students so we could take the total student loan program and put it out for bidfor bidsimilar to competition  free enterprise  Absolutely not  Absolutely not  There is that cozy relationship that exists now with Sally Mae and the loan industries that pay their executives hundreds of thousands of dollars  contribute millions and millions of dollars  And they are getting it their way  The American people ought to understand that the lobbying has direct results  President Bush  in his last campaign and his campaign previously  said  We are going to get the Pell grants up to  4 500 4 500  Do you think it is in that budget  Do you think it is even in his budget requesting  4 500  No  I have read the space  Do you think that is in there  No  That is not even in there  So if you are talking about what is bothering people  pick up todays newspapers  Here it is  Mining fines among smallest  Laws limit size and allow reduction  This is the difference between the mines penalties and the fines that are paid for other consumer product safety violations of the FCC  SEC  EPA  even OSHA  The bottom is on mine safety  That might not have saved all the lives  That might not have even saved half of the lives of those miners who have been lost  but why arent we debating what is on the minds of the people in West Virginia  Pennsylvania  and other States today  Why arent we dealing with their business  Here we have on the front page of another newspaper  White House knew of Levees Failure on Night of Storm  This is all about Katrina and what has been going on  Sure  we have had some hearings  but why arent we talking about some of this that is on the minds of the people  Certainly  it is on the minds of the people of Louisiana  Mississippi  and Alabama  Why arent we talking about that this afternoon  Why arent we doing some of that business  And then  if you look in the Washington Post  Ex CIA Official Faults Use of Data on Iraq  The former CIA official who coordinated U S  intelligence on the Middle East until last year has accused the Bush administration of cherry picking intelligence        And this goes all the way through  basically saying  Our official intelligence on Iraqi weapons programs was flawed  but even with its flaws  it was not what led to the war        Instead  he asserted  the administration went to war without requestingand evidently without being influenced byany strategic level intelligence assessments on any aspect of Iraq  People want to know  American sons and daughters are dying over there  Why arent we talking about this  My point is  this budget the President has put forward is not what the American people expect  It is not what they deserve  not what they are entitled to  Many of us are going to work every possible way  It is the allocation of resources  Money does not solve everything  but it is an indication of a nations prioritiesa nations priorities as to lower heating oil costs  a nations priorities in terms of lower drug costs  a nations priorities in terms of education costs  a nations priorities in having an increase in the minimum wage  These are the things that are of concern to people  I would hope we would get back to the Nations business and get back to it soon  Americans are entitled to it  and we have waited too long to be able to do it  Page S1057  Mr  President  I suggest the absence of a quorum
