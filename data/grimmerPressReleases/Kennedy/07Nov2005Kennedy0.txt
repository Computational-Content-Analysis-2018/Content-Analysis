         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  It is time that we restore openness and honesty in our government  yet Bush s comments today and Cheney s determination to exempt the CIA from McCain s prohibition on torture only demonstrate that the White House learned nothing from Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo  This Administration has consistently sought legal justifications for harsh techniques and their contradictory denials and stonewalling only make the war on terrorism harder to win and put our soldiers in further danger   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
