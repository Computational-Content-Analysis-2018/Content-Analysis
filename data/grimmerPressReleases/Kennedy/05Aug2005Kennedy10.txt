         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE         CONTACT  Laura Capps              202  224 2633    On this 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act  we honor the courage and commitment of all who worked so long and hard and well to open the doors of opportunity in our American democracy to all our citizens  regardless of their race  Voting is one of the true blessings of liberty  That s why people have died for it  and our democracy is diminished when even one American is denied that right    The landmark march from Selma to Montgomery in March of 1965 electrified the nation and enabled the Senate and House to come together under the leadership of President Lyndon Johnson to pass the Voting Rights Act on August 6th of that year  Enactment of the legislation was an historic step to guarantee that racism and its bitter legacy would never again bar the ballot box to any citizen anywhere in America  A century after the Civil War  Congress finally exercised its constitutional power under the Fifteenth Amendment to guarantee every American the right to vote    This year s 40th Anniversary celebration is a poignant reminder that the work of civil rights is still the unfinished business of America  and that the Voting Rights Act is still urgently needed to prevent discrimination in all its ugly forms against minorities in exercising their fundamental right to vote     The anniversary is also a reminder to Congress and the country that the Supreme Court has an essential role in upholding this important civil right  It is vital for the Senate to be sure that Justices confirmed to the Supreme Court understand the Act s importance and respect the power of Congress to protect the right to vote  It s therefore very troubling to learn from his recently released memoranda that nominee John Roberts had a role in opposing efforts by Congress to restore the Act s original intent in 1982    Too many Americans have sacrificed too much in blood  sweat  and tears for us to halt or turn back the progress that has enabled tens of millions of our fellow citizens to exercise the right to vote and revitalize our democracy  now and in the years to come   Laura Capps  202  224 2633
