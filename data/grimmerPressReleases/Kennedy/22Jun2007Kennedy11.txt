         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senators Kennedy  Hatch  Clinton  and Enzi announced an agreement on legislation authorizing the FDA to approve a follow on version of biologic therapies   The legislation includes standards for FDA to approve follow on biologics  a mechanism to resolve patents in an expedited way  and strong but responsible incentives to encourage innovation and the development of new therapies  A summary of the legislation will follow Senator Kennedy said  This century of the life sciences offers unlimited promise of new hope and new help for millions of patients   Congress has a responsibility to encourage the innovation that leads to these new medical miracles  and to see that they are affordable for the patients who need them   The bipartisan legislation we announce today achieves these two important goals   Just as generic drugs have helped bring down the costs of medicines for millions of Americans  new follow on versions of breakthrough biologics will make these innovative treatments more affordable for the patients who need them   Our bipartisan legislation also includes strong and responsible incentives to encourage dynamic new biotechnology companies to invest in the innovations that will produce the cures of tomorrow  Our legislation also includes strong safeguards to ensure patient safety Senator Hatch said  Its crucial that Congress get this right because biologics are the future of medicine  Its taken a lot of effort  but weve achieved a good balance in this bill  Just as we did with Hatch Waxman in 1984  were giving incentives for both pioneer and generic drug firms  Were ensuring that we continue to get the latest medical breakthroughs while creating a clear pathway to get less expensive biologics on the market quickly Senator Clinton said  Allowing generic versions of biologic drugs will help fulfill the promise of these cutting edge medicines   By breaking the pharmaceutical industrys monopoly on these medications  we will improve healthcare and reduce costs dramatically for seniors  families and employers  We will stretch precious healthcare dollars further in Medicare and Medicaid  And we will enable more Americans access to affordable treatments that could improve or even save their lives  This is truly a win win for consumers and our country Senator Enzi said  This legislation captures a delicate balance between access and innovation while maintaining the highest standard of safety   I predict that very shortly  Senators Kennedy  Hatch  Clinton  and I will look back at this legislation with great pride  as it will be seen as a vital part of insuring our aging population has access to innovative  reliable  and safe medicines   Biologics already are making it possible for thousands of Americans to live productive lives and changing the way we treat deadly diseases like cancer and infectious diseases   The agreement weve reached today holds new hope that we can further expand access of these remarkable medicines to more patients who need help combating deadly diseases   Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2007  This Act amends section 351 of the Public Health Service Act to provide for an approval pathway for safe biosimilar and interchangeable biological products  relying in part on the previous approval of a brand product  while preserving the incentives that have fueled the development of these life saving medicines  Approval Process A biosimilar applicant is required to demonstrate that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety  purity and potency between its product and the brand product  A demonstration of biosimilarity includes analytical data  animal testing and 1 or more clinical studies  unless such a requirement is determined by the FDA to be unnecessary FDA may approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable  meaning it can be substituted for the brand product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed it  Showing interchangeability requires evidence that the biosimilar product will produce the same clinical result as the brand product in any given patient and that it presents no additional risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy if a patient alternates or is switched between products The legislation allows  but does not require the FDA to issue guidance documents to inform with the public of the standards and criteria the agency will use in approving biosimilar and interchangeable products  Development of these guidance documents will require public input  Applications can be filed in the absence of guidance documents Exclusivities The Act provides incentives for the development of both new life saving biological products and interchangeable biosimilar products  12 years of data exclusivity for the brand company during which a biosimilar product may not be approved  and 1 year of exclusivity for the first interchangeable biological product Patent Resolution The legislation includes a multi step process to identify and resolve patents that the biosimilar product may infringe  The biosimilar applicant must provide its application and information about its manufacturing process to the brand company  A series of informational exchanges then occur in which the biosimilar applicant and the brand company identify patents in question and explain their views as to their validity or infringement  The two parties then either agree to a list of these patents to be litigated first or exchange lists when they cant  and the brand company must then sue the biosimilar applicant within 30 days to defend them  If the brand company wins a final court decision that a patent is valid and infringed by the biosimilar product before the 12 year data exclusivity has run  the court must enjoin infringement of the patent until it expires  For identified patents not included in this initial litigation  the biosimilar applicant must give the brand company notice 180 days before it intends to launch its product  and the brand company may then seek a preliminary injunction to block the launch  If the brand company fails to identify a patent  it cant later enforce it against the biosimilar product  If it fails to defend a patent identified for initial litigation  the brand company may only later receive a reasonable royalty  If the biosimilar applicant fails at any step to do what it is required to do  the brand company may immediately defend its patents        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224
