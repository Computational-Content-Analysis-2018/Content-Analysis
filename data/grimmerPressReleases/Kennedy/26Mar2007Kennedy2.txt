Edward M   KennedyMonday  March 26  2007  A15As it appears in todays Washington  Post Five years ago  Congress and President Bush made a bold and  historic promise  We pledged in the No Child Left Behind Act that the federal  government would do all in its power to guarantee every child in America   regardless of race  economic background  language or disability  the opportunity  to get a world class education  We have made progress toward fulfilling  that commitment  Before the act was passed  most states lacked ways to track  student progress and teacher effectiveness  Many state accountability  requirements had no commitment to improving education for every child  Only four  states had approved assessments that tracked and reported the achievement of  every group of students in their schools  Today  all 50 states have  standards  assessments and accountability procedures that enable us to track the  achievement of every group of students  Every school measures performance  based  not on overall student population but on progress in closing achievement gaps  and getting all students to meet high standards  Schools across the country are  using assessments under the No Child law to identify weaknesses in instruction  and areas of need for their students  These are significant reforms  and  we can t simply ignore them  But to fulfill our promise  much more  remains to be done  The No Child Left Behind Act is up for  reauthorization  Some in Congress feel the challenge is too great and want to  turn back the clock on reform  One Republican proposal would even let states  avoid accountability requirements and still receive federal funds  Most  of us in Congress know that a retreat to mediocrity is wrong  To meet the  demands of the 21st century  we have to expand opportunity for all and keep our  commitment to leaving no child behind  We know the law has flaws  but we  also know that with common sense changes and adequate resources  we can improve  it by building on what we ve learned  We owe it to America s children  parents  and teachers to reinforce our commitment  not abandon it  We need to  strengthen our academic standards and assessment methods to ensure that students  have the knowledge and skills necessary for today s knowledge based global  economy  We can improve accountability by helping states modernize their  curriculums from prekindergarten through high school so that all students  graduate with the education they need to pursue a college or technical degree   participate in the workforce or serve in the armed forces  We should also help  states develop better assessments to track the progress and growth of all  students  including students for whom English is a second language and students  with special needs  We must expand and fortify the teacher workforce   Researchers agree that teacher quality is the most important factor affecting  student achievement  Good teachers can make all the difference in closing  achievement gaps for low income and minority students  The same research also  shows  however  that our most at risk students are often taught by the least  prepared  least experienced and least qualified teachers  The No Child Left  Behind Act made a commitment that every child would be taught by a highly  qualified teacher  To reach that goal  a greater federal investment is  needed  Finally  we can t just label schools inadequate  We must help  them improve  States and localities need to initiate and support school  improvement  Part of the act s promise was that greater accountability would be  accompanied by greater support  We knew that federal resources would be critical  to achieving the goals  When the law was adopted in 2002  Congress delivered  22  billion to support public education    an increase of 20 percent over the  previous year  This was an unprecedented federal investment  The law promised  increased funding levels over the life of its provisions  in step with the  increase in targets for student performance  Yet year after year  the federal  government has failed to provide the resources that states and school districts  need to improve struggling schools  Assessment and accountability without the  funding needed to implement change is a recipe for failure  In the weeks  ahead  those opposed to doing what it takes to leave no child behind will do  everything in their power to impede our progress  Don t let their rhetoric fool  you  Local control means nothing without the resources for improvement   Increasing flexibility without preserving accountability is fiscally  irresponsible and educationally unwise  No Child Left Behind is not just  a slogan  It s a national commitment  inspired by our fundamental values and  aspirations  It s a promise to do all we can so that every American child  receives the high quality education he or she needs and deserves  We may never  achieve that lofty goal  but if we hope to keep America strong and just   prosperous and free  we can never stop trying  The writer  a Democratic  senator from Massachusetts  was a lead author of the Leave No Child Behind  Act   Laura Capps
