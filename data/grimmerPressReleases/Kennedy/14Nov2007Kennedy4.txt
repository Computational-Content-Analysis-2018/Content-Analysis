         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy made the following remarks on the floor of the United States Senate as it considered the Head Start Reauthorization Conference Report and the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act  The Senate is expected to vote on the measure this afternoon      The Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act increases eligibility and focuses on our neediest children  as well as improving local programs and establishing new goals for the teaching workforce  It also provides for health care screening and the authorization of  7 3 billion in funding for the program        As Prepared for Delivery      I welcome the Senates action today on the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act   For 42 years  Head Start has brought disadvantaged children the assistance they need to arrive at school ready to learn and the building blocks they need to succeed later in life   This Conference Report builds on all of the lessons learned from Head Starts past and sets an even greater course for the future                  The legislation before us is a culmination of hard work by many Members over several years   I commend my colleague Senator Enzi and all of the Members of the HELP Committee for their work in the past two Congresses and this Congress to strengthen and improve the program      Planning for Head Start began in the early 1960s  before we knew all that we know today about how to best intervene and support the lives of young children living in poverty   At that time  as Attorney General  my brother Robert Kennedy decided to tackle the problem of juvenile delinquency   Research pointed to poverty as the root of the nations social and economic challenges   It was agreed that a strategy based on early education could be a significant part of the answer        In August 1964  President Johnson and Congress launched the War on Poverty by passing the Economic Opportunity Act   The nations poor numbered 10 million  with nearly half under the age of 12        In the fall of that year  my brother in law  Sargent Shriver  convened a panel of experts in child development  education  public health  and social work to lay a foundation for the Head Start program   He envisioned a bold national commitment to prepare our neediest children for kindergarten and first grade   He conferred with experts like Dr  Edward Zigler  and they agreed that a comprehensive approach was needed   Preschool was the centerpiece of the plan  but a major emphasis was placed on health care and parent involvement  too      The following year  Head Start came into being as an 8 week summer program  With the help of thousands of volunteers  it served 560 000 children through preschool classes  medical and dental care  and health services   Over the years  it would reach over 24 million                Today  the face of poverty and of Americas neediest families has changed   The American workplace has changed  and our education system is being challenged to keep up with the global economy   Head Start has always adapted  finding new ways to respond to the demands on low income  working families   But its mission has remained the same  to help our most vulnerable children succeed in school and in life      When parents are asked what they most want to accomplish in life  their answer undoubtedly includes a desire to open the doors of opportunity for their children   They want a fair chance for their children to grow up healthy and safe  to graduate from high school and go on to college  and to achieve the American dream      That dream should be available to every child in America   But far too often  families are still struggling to put food on the table  buy clothes for their children  pay the rent  or see a doctor   Poverty is again on the rise  Today  one out of every five children in America grows up poor                  Poverty has many dimensions   Its a labor issue  because pay is so low and workers are exploited   Its a civil rights issue  because so many African American and Latino families are often the ones left behind   Its a health care issue  because the health care that families in poverty receive is so sub standard  Most of all  its a childrens issue  because the children of the poor have done nothing wrong   But they still pay the price      Its our responsibility as a nation to help those in need   And the federal bedrock of that commitment is Head Start   It has always been an important symbol of our responsibility to others   At its core are the values that shaped our democracy  equity  opportunity  community empowerment  and economic progress      Head Start is based on the premise that education is the key to the future and to breaking down the destructive forces of poverty      It provides the starting point for a childs day  with a healthy meal each morning and a promise to parents that while they are at work and balancing two jobs  their children will see a doctor and dentist  and receive immunizations      It provides children with the building blocks they need to enter school ready to learn   It teaches the social and emotional skills needed by children to pay attention in the classroom and get along well with others   It expands their vocabulary  gets them excited about reading  and teaches them to count      It welcomes parents into its programs  gives them opportunities to make decisions about their childs learning and development  and sometimes helps families find a roof for over their head      Over the years  with each new educational and developmental advance in research  weve learned more about how Head Start can be improved   And with that learning  modifications have been made to enable the program to be even more effective           In 1972  the Child Development Associate program was established  to provide a standard of quality for Head Start teachers and aides        In 1974  the reauthorization of Head Start established the comprehensive Program Performance Standards to guide Head Start Centers in providing essential educational  health  and social services  and achieving parental involvement   The reauthorization also paved the way for a network of training and technical assistance activities to help Head Start agencies enhance the quality of their programs       In the 1980s and early 1990s  the Indian and Migrant Head Start programs were formed  and Family Service  Centers were established to combat illiteracy  substance abuse  and unemployment in Head Start communities   At that time  Head Start also began its important focus on improving transitions for preschool children to public schools        In 1994  we created Early Head Start to serve low income infants and toddlers in the first three years of their development   That legislation also led to the development of improved performance measures to assess outcomes in Head Start  and new guidelines for monitoring Head Start programs          The current reauthorization applies the lessons learned from the past with the new knowledge of child development and early education to enable Head Start to be even more successful in the years ahead      Theres no question that Head Start is effective   Our own federally mandated study of Head Start found that it expands childrens vocabularies  and makes the greatest difference for those with the greatest needs  Head Start improves childrens writing skills  and helps children grow in their social skills and behavior        By the time Head Start children complete their kindergarten year  their skills and developmental abilities are near the national average  with scores of 99 in early literacy  98 in early writing  95 in early math  and 95 in vocabulary      This reauthorization maintains high standards and comprehensive services in Head Start   It upgrades educational components of the program  and ensures that it delivers the skills and support that children need to succeed in kindergarten and the early grades   It promotes greater partnerships between Head Start programs and local schools  and ensures that services continue to be framed by the highly effective Head Start Child Outcomes Framework   It also provides a needed bridge for parents to their local schools  to promote greater coordination and ease the transition of children from preschool to kindergarten      We also terminate the flawed National Reporting System  and ensure that new educational standards and measures used in Head Start will be informed by the National Academy of Sciences   Two years ago  the Government Accountability Office confirmed many of our long standing concerns with this assessment  concluding that the test is not valid to make determinations about programs and students   The study also confirmed that the test was inconsistent with nationally recognized testing standards  and unclear in its purpose      This reauthorization ensures that any assessments used in Head Start will be valid and reliable  fair to children from all backgrounds  and measure the whole child   Head Start children and their families deserve nothing less      Head Start teachers and staff are the heart and future of the program   They help children learn to identify letters and arrange the pieces of puzzles   They teach them to brush their teeth  wash their hands  make friends  and follow rules        This reauthorization sets important and unprecedented goals for enhancing the skills and qualifications of Head Start teachers and staff   In this reauthorization  were striving to help all teachers earn their Associates Degree over the next 6 years  help half of all teachers in Head Start earn their Bachelors Degree  and help all assistant teachers work toward completing a CDA or another early education credential      These are ambitious goals   But we know that learning and development of young children require good teachers  and that theres a strong link between educational qualifications and the quality of programs          The quality of a program doesnt just depend on the educational background of its teachers  which is why we are also calling for professional development and a career advancement plan for every Head Start employee  including family service workers  assistant teachers  and curriculum coordinators   Weve established new partnerships to increase staff in Head Start who are prepared to serve the diverse children enrolled in the programs      Most of all  weve worked to ensure that Head Start agencies have a dedicated stream of funds to provide needed training for teachers   The reauthorization dedicates  2 million this year to local training and improvement efforts  much of which will be used to improve and strengthen the Head Start workforce   We commit to confronting the persistent challenge of compensating Head Start teachers as the professionals that they are   Head Start teachers earn half the salary of kindergarten teachers  and turnover is about 11 percent per year        This conference report commits 40 percent of new funds in Head Start to program quality and teacher salaries  to do more to attract and retain caring and committed leaders   It ensures that each Head Start Center will receive an annual cost of living increase to keep up with the rising costs of operation and overhead      We grant additional flexibility in this reauthorization for Head Start to serve thousands of additional low income children in need  by including families just above the federal poverty level   Its essential for Head Start to prioritize its services to the neediest families in their communities   But this new flexibility enables those living near poverty and earning less than what they need to get by to receive assistance too   Its the right thing to do  and its what Head Start is all about       The reauthorization also makes a long overdue commitment to expanding Head Start programs in Indian country  and programs for migrant and seasonal farmworkers   By reserving up to  20 million annually to expand services in these programs  we can hopefully reach an additional 5 500 migrant children and an additional 5 100 Native American children living in poverty   New provisions are also included to enhance services for homeless children  children who are English language learners  and children with disabilities in order to ensure that these populations receive the care and attention they deserve         Accountability is a cornerstone of excellence and should start early   Head Start should be accountable for its commitment to provide safe and healthy learning environments  to support each childs individual pattern of development and learning  to build community partnerships in services to children  and to involve parents in their childs growth      This reauthorization makes significant progress in increasing accountability and investing in excellence in Head Start   It continues the comprehensive monitoring that has become a hallmark of Head Start  and ensures that reviews are fair and balanced in order to account for challenges and strengths in programs   It also establishes a new system for the designation of Head Start grants  to be phased in over the next several years        We know that the vast majority of Head Start programs provide outstanding services  fewer than 20 percent of programs are found to be deficient each year   But where serious deficiencies exist  we must see that substantial problems do not languish at the expense of children    If a local program is unable to meet Head Starts high standards of quality  timely action should be taken   This new system will facilitate accountability and funding decisions  and do so in a manner that is transparent  fair  and responsive to the local needs of families and children        Weve established greater accountability for enrollment in programs  and delineated a clear system of governance in Head Start            The reauthorization also takes important steps to expand Early Head Start   Since its inception  results have proven that Early Head Start is one of the most effective programs of the Department of Health and Human Services   In this legislation  we improve the training and assistance network serving Early Head Start  and guarantee a dedicated expert in each state to work with programs to meet the needs of infants and toddlers   We also expand the screening available to infants exposed to trauma  violence  or other circumstances detrimental to their development   We commit to expanding Early Head Start to serve an additional 8 000 low income infants and toddlers over the next five years           As in elementary and secondary education  reform in early childhood education requires resources   Today  half of all children eligible for Head Start have no access to it  Early Head Start however  serves only 3 percent of eligible infants and toddlers  we leave behind a shameful 97 percent        When Sergeant Shriver discussed the War on Poverty  he said You have to put immense resources into winning a war   He was right  and he wasnt talking about wars like Iraq   He was talking about the war on poverty   This Conference Report increases authorizations for Head Start to  7 3 billion in fiscal year 2008   7 6 billion in fiscal year 2009  and  7 9 billion in fiscal year 2010   On a bipartisan basis  the conferees have signaled a commitment to invest more in our youngest children  and to assist Head Start in responding to the changing and evolving needs of the communities it serves                    Research shows that the first five years of life make an immense difference for a child   Those who attend high quality early education programs are more likely to do well when they reach elementary school  are less likely to be held back a grade  and are more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college                   Our federal investment in early childhood education clearly pays off  for every dollar invested in high quality early education  there is a 16 dollar return later in life       All children  regardless of their background  deserve to learn and develop   We need to strengthen early childhood for young children  in order to help them succeed later in school and in life       A comprehensive curriculum and a stable and well qualified workforce are cornerstones of a good early education  Im especially pleased that this reauthorization of Head Start includes a blueprint to strengthen the array of early childhood programs and services for young children        The bill establishes an Early Childhood Advisory Council to examine needs of early childhood programs  develop a plan to improve professional development  upgrade standards  enhance collaboration among programs  and improve data collection        More than 40 states have early learning standards in place or under development  States like Massachusetts  Connecticut  and Illinois have developed the systems needed to improve program quality and expand access to programs in the early years   We need to build on that progress   States that are ready to take on the challenge of implementing needed improvements in their early education programs will qualify for incentive grants to get such improvements underway      One of our highest priorities in Congress is to expand educational opportunities for every American   In this age of globalization  every citizen deserves a chance to acquire the skills needed to compete in the modern economy   That challenge begins at birth  and accelerates in the early years of life  well before children even begin kindergarten      This reauthorization helps us reach this essential goal   It keeps Head Start on its successful path  and enables it to continue to thrive and improve      We still havent won the war on poverty in America   But thanks to Head Start  were getting closer   Day by day  and one child at a time   This conference report continues that indispensable progress  and I urge my colleagues to approve it
