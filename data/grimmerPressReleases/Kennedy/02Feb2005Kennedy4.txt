         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The President gave an effective speech tonight  and clearly laid out his agenda  We now have before the American people two very different and contending beliefs about the future    We all share the goals of spreading freedom and democracy and ending tyranny around the globe  There s no disagreement about these goals  and the importance of these ideals  America has been a beacon of democracy  freedom  and human rights for more than two centuries    But  America is at its best and our voice is clearest when our deeds match our words  The President hasn t done that in Iraq  America is bogged down in Iraq  which had no weapons of mass destruction  Meanwhile  the President has failed to work cooperatively with the international community to prevent Iran and North Korea from pursuing nuclear weapons  America has paid a high price for the President s misleading us into Iraq  including losing its focus on the real threat _    Osama Bin Laden and the war on terrorism    Four years ago  the President promised Americans that he would cut  2 trillion from the federal debt  but instead turned record surpluses into record deficits  Tonight  the President again promises to pay down the debt and balance the budget  yet his plans to privatize Social Security will add  2 trillion to the mounting national debt  Now more than ever  America must listen not only to the President s words  but beware of his deeds     Democrats fight for opportunity for all Americans    _ the opportunity for Americans to own their future  That s what the American dream is all about  So we have a duty to equip our citizens to compete in the global economy  not by lowering their pay  but by raising their skills  battling for their jobs  and making their health care more affordable    I look forward to working with the President to put his words into action  specifically on making our immigration laws more fair  improving our schools  and providing Americans with affordable and accessible health care  But  I will not stand by while he hides behind speeches and rhetoric while the American people wait for action that really improves their lives  instead of just improving the profits of HMOs or big corporations  More than words  we need actions that really make America more competitive instead of shipping more jobs overseas  and really keep us safe instead of taking our eye off the real threat of terrorism    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
