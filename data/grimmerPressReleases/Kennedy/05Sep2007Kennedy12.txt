         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC Today  the Appropriations Committee held a hearing on the investigation into the Crandall Canyon mine tragedy  Continuing the Congressional inquiries into this tragedy  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  and Ranking Member Michael B  Enzi sent the following letter to Dick Kempthorne  Secretary of the Interior  requesting information from the Bureau of Land Management concerning the Crandall Canyon mine  Senator Kennedy said  Even as our hearts remain with the grieving families of the fallen miners  our Senate Labor Committee has begun to conduct its own investigation of the Crandall Canyon disaster  There are many questions that key federal agencies must answer about their actions both before and after the mine collapse  On August 23rd  I requested key documents from the Mine Safety and Health Administration  and today Senator Enzi and I submitted a request  attached  for documents from the Bureau of Land Management  which owns the property where the mine is located  The disaster at Crandall Canyon didnt begin on August 6th with the collapse of the mine  Events leading up to that tragic day will tell the story of why six miners died there  We will keep pursuing our investigation until we get the answers we need  The families of the fallen miners  and all miners  deserve to be assured that Congress is doing all it can to make the mining industry as safe as possible The tragic events in Utah reminded all of us of the dangers that our nations miners face  Senator Enzi said  As we prepare to hold a hearing later this month to review the tragedies at Crandall Canyon  we want to leave no stone unturned  Our request to the Bureau of Land Management is part of that effort  We remain committed to a thorough  bipartisan effort to address the causes of the Crandall Canyon tragedies and to prevent future accidents from occurring  No aspect of mining is more important than protecting the health and safety of those whose hard work fuels this key part of our nations economy The letter appears below  September 5  2007The Honorable Dirk
