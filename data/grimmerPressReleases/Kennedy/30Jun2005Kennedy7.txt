         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The President spoke on Tuesday night about the hard work of our troops  He urged Americans to send them letters and raise flags in their honor  and to help the military family down the street  But he did not assure them that they will have the equipment they need to fight the war  He should have More than 400 of our troops in Iraq have died in military vehicles hit by roadside bombs  grenades  and other so called improvised explosive devices  Yet  our troops don t have the protective equipment they need  The Marines are still waiting for the 495 armored humvees they ordered last year  There is no excuseabsolutely no excuseto send our military into battle unprotected The war in Iraq is putting a very high demand on the military  Multiple tours of duty in Iraq  relentless violence  and continuing mismanagement of the war is taking its toll on our military Recent reports from senior military officers indicate that the insurgency is not weakening in Iraq  General Abizaid told us last week that the insurgency is about the same as it was six months ago  General Vines has said he assumes the insurgency will remain at about its current level  Last weekend  Secretary Rumsfeld said that the insurgency could last  five  six  eight  ten  twelve years Military commanders recently told a Congressional delegation in Iraq that it would take at least two years to train and equip Iraqi security forces to fight the insurgency Meanwhile  our own forces are increasingly strained  General Riggs gave us an alarming description of the problem when he said I have been in the Army for 39 years  and I ve never seen the Army as stretched in that 39 years as I have today  That was a year ago  and the strain has obviously increased since then  Our troops are required to leave their equipment in Iraq for use by their replacements  which mean they can t train as well at home for the next rotation General Helmley  head of the Army Reserve  believes the Army is rapidly degenerating into a broken force  and is in grave danger of being unable to meet other operational requirements  The numbers tell the same story  currently almost 50  of our active duty forces have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan  That s 10 percent higher than in Vietnam  and 17 percent higher than in Korea Since the beginning of the war  we have lost over 1700 troops in Iraq  More than 400 have died in military vehicles hit by roadside bombs  grenades  and other improvised explosive devices Month after month  the Pentagon failed to do enough to prevent many of these deaths and injuries  because their vehicles didn t have adequate armor General Paul Kern of the Army Materiel Command said  In retrospect  if I had it to do all over  I would have just started building up armored Humvees  The most efficient way would have been to build a single production line and feed everything into it The Department set too low a rate for the production of up armored Humvees and armor kits  even though it was obvious that additional production capacity was available Last week s New York Times reported that the Marines are still waiting for the 495 Up armored Humvees they ordered last year  The manufacturer said the Marine Corps never asked it to rush the order The President spoke about the hard work of our troops on Tuesday night  He urged Americans to send them letters  raise flags in their honor  and to help military families down the street  But he did not assure them that they will have the equipment they need to fight the war  and he should have The Pentagon s failure here is extremely disturbing  and our troops are dying because of it Recruitment is another serious problem  The Army missed its goal by 25  in May  and if it hadn t already reduced its goal  it would have missed by almost 40   General Rochelle  chief of Army recruitment  called it the toughest recruiting climate ever faced by the all volunteer army In light of this dire situation  the recent changes in Army recruitment policy amount only to tinkering at the edges  Retention and signing bonuses were raised  The maximum age to join the Guard was raised  A 15 month short enlistment option was added  But is that enough to meet the goal  If recruitment is now so difficult after two years in Iraq  and new enlistments end in 15 months  what will happen when we have been there for three years  and recruitment goals are even higher To correct these problems and get back on track  President Bush needs to level with our troops and the American people  The President s address to the country this week did not give the nation an effective strategy to win the war in Iraq Our men and women in uniform are serving ably under enormously difficult circumstances  They need more than just vague assurances of progress from the President  They need an effective plan to end the violence  bring peace and stability to Iraq  and bring them home with dignity and honor   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
