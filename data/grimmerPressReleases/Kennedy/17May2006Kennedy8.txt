         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     CONTACT  Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy   202  224 2633WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Edward Kennedy  D MA  and Rep  George Miller  D CA   joined by Senator Richard Durbin  D IL  and Congressman Dale Kildee  D MI  have asked U S  Education Secretary Margaret Spellings to help college loan borrowers save millions of dollars in interest costs by providing them with as much flexibility as possible in consolidating their loans  The lawmakers made the request in response to a policy change announced by the Education Department on March 17 that it would no longer provide borrowers with the same flexibility that it has in the past   a move that could cost them millions of dollars in additional interest costs On July 1  2006  the variable interest rate on outstanding loans is expected to jump by two percentage points   one of the largest increases in history  Kennedy and Miller said that  in light of this fact  it is urgent that students and parents have maximum flexibility in consolidating their college loans  Consolidation allows borrowers to combine their outstanding loans at a low fixed interest rate Senator Kennedy said  In today s rapidly shrinking world  a college education is a lifeline to the American dream  We must do more to reduce interest rates and expand benefits to make college affordable for struggling students and families  Millions of borrowers have reduced the cost of their student loans through consolidation  Now  on the eve of one of the largest interest rate hikes in the history of the program  the consolidation benefit is more important than ever Students are graduating from college today with unmanageable levels of debt  No other generation in American history has been asked to swim in so much red ink in order to further their education  said Miller  the senior Democrat on the House education committee  We should do everything we can to free today s young college graduates from the shackles of outrageously high student debt At a time when borrowers are trying to lock in an affordable interest rate for their college loan  the action by the Bush Administration could spell out more out of pocket expense for students  The Bush administration should get its priorities right and recognize the value of investing in higher education and providing the assistance needed for our students  Senator Durbin said   The best investment we can make in our nation is in our students and in access to education Congressman Kildee said  With rapidly rising tuition too often forcing student to face crushing debt upon graduation  it is imperative that we use every tool in our power to ease this burden  I hope that the Department of Education will consider Congress  overwhelming rejection of this anti consumer law and act in the interests of students The full text of the letter is below  30 May 16  2006Honorable Margaret Spellings Secretary of Education 400 Maryland Avenue  SW Washington  DC 20202Dear Secretary Spellings We re writing to express our concern about the March 17 decision by the Department to limit consolidation options for student loan borrowers as of March 31  The timing of your decision  and the confusion it has caused among student and parent borrowers  could cost borrowers millions of dollars in excessive costs over the life of their loans  We urge you to do everything in your power to ensure borrowers are not harmed by these actions We know that you appreciate the increasing importance of a college education in today s economy  Federal support for students and families  however  has not kept pace with rising costs  The average student borrower now graduates with  17 500 in debt  over  5 000 higher than 10 years ago  The burden is pricing students out of college and preventing many from entering public service careers like teaching and social work  Students obviously need additional support and options to help them afford college  not more restrictions in an already limited market In recent years  the Department has provided borrowers in the federal student loan program considerable flexibility in consolidating their loans  As you know  on July 1  2006  the variable interest rate on outstanding student loans is projected to rise by nearly 2 percentage points  one of the largest single year increases in the 40 year history of the program  Student and parent borrowers need flexibility now more than ever The Department originally suspended implementation of the so called single holder rule in April 2004 because of the potential harm this change in policy could bring to borrowers who were in the process of applying for consolidation loans  Since then  the Department has continued to provide borrowers with flexibility in consolidation due to impending action by Congress to repeal the single holder rule  Congress has not yet completed action on reauthorization of the Higher Education Act  but both the Senate and the House have passed legislation to repeal the provision so that borrowers can freely shop among lenders for the best consolidation terms available  It is difficult to understand why the Department would now choose to change its policy on this provision  at a time when borrowers need as much flexibility as possible  In light of the July 1 interest rate hike and the brief implementation timeframe of your March 17 decision  we respectfully request that you reconsider the serious and costly consequences it may have for borrowers  particularly those who were in the process of consolidation when the new rules took effect  Thank you for your consideration of this important request With respect and appreciation Sincerely Edward M  Kennedy     George M  Miller Richard J  Durbin     Dale E  Kildee  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
