         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      As Prepared for Delivery   Thank you  Senator Durbin and Senator Coburn  for calling this timely hearing   For generations  refugees have sought the protection of the United   States  They have come here seeking haven and hope and the American dream  and they have transformed their own lives and our entire country in the process         Too often in recent years  however  the Administration has thrown up needless barriers to refugees and asylum seekers  as the slow response to the Iraqi refugee crisis in the Middle East now so vividly demonstrates    Despite the existence of over 2 million refugees who have fled Iraq and two million more who have become refugees in their own countries  only 942 Iraqis have been admitted to the United States this year        I have introduced The Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act to address the numerous barriers generated by bureaucratic delays and red tape  and particularly to help the courageous Iraqi refugees who have a target on their backs because of their association with the United States      Todays hearing on material support  however  highlights another barrier  one that is caused primarily by narrow legal interpretations governed by a guilt by association mentality   Under these interpretations  anyone who uses a weapon against a brutal regime  anyone who assists such a person  directly or indirectly  and anyone forced to serve such a regime or organization  becomes a terrorist or becomes guilty of providing material support to a terrorist organization        As American Jewish leaders wrote to the President last year  under todays laws  Jews who bravely resisted and survived Nazi terror would be excluded from refuge in the United States      Montagnard and Hmong communities who fought alongside our troops in Vietnam are considered members of terrorist organizations    The very Iraqis who have supported the U S  government could be considered terrorists for past activity against Sadaam Husseins regime or for paying ransom today to bring home a kidnapped child         Waivers are available  but until recently  the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security have delayed issuing them  relying on overly burdensome and bureaucratic procedures that have left many eligible and deserving refugees trapped in unstable and deteriorating conditions in other countries and many asylum applicants suffering in detention in the United States  The material support bar has harmed people all over the world  including Colombians  ethnic Burmese refugees  Laotian Hmong  Vietnamese Montagnards  and Cubans   Although some progress has been made this year  the process is still too long and the path too difficult for anyone seeking a waiver      The Senate has recognized the ironic nature of these policies  taking action recently to specifically exclude groups such as the Montagnards and Hmong from the category of terrorist groups        But much more must be done   I urge the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to re assess their current policies   The basic question is whether or not an individual actually poses a threat to our nation   Waiver procedures should be simplified  and greater discretion should be given to adjudicators who understand the dimensions of the problem and who can assess an individuals circumstances        Procedures must be put into place to resolve the many cases currently foundering in immigration court   Immigration advocates insist there is no efficient way to resolve the material support issue   Some of these problems ultimately may require legislation  but it is clear that much more can be accomplished through reasonable and balanced interpretations of the law that are not driven by false presumptions of guilt      Professor David Cole  an expert on the prosecution of terror suspects  has characterized much of the immigration litigation since 9 11 as based on the principles of secrecy and guilt by association    He notes Guilt by association   allows the government to rely on inferences and assumptions that are unsupported by fact   Where it seeks to show danger or liability based on association  the government need not show that the individual did anything wrong  or is planning to do anything wrong  It is enough to show that he is associated with the wrong group  But that kind of group based culpability is exactly what lies at the root of stereotyping and prejudice  it treats people not as individuals in their own right  but as suspect for their group association and identity      This failure to distinguish between the individual and the group has tragic consequences   Consider Helene  a woman from Sierra Leone persecuted by the Revolutionary United Front   The rebels attacked her home  murdered one family member with machetes  and set another on fire  leaving him covered with severe burns   For four days  Helene and her family were held captive in their own home  and she and her daughter were raped repeatedly   Helene was forced to wash the rebels clothes and cook their meals   Yet her enslavement was held to constitute material support for terrorism  and she has been barred from seeking protection in the United States   Surely  a woman like Helene poses no threat to our national security        The Department of Homeland Security must shed its fear of Helene and many other innocent victims of war and persecution    In todays hearing  we hope to explore a reasoned approach that respects our national security  without further harming those who deserve protection           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
