         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy met with Irish Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern to discuss Kennedy s plan for comprehensive immigration reform as well as the ongoing peace progress in the Northern Ireland  The Irish Parliament recently endorsed the McCain Kennedy bill because of its common sense approach to fixing our broken immigration system  The McCain Kennedy legislation has received strong and diverse support  from business and labor  from Republicans and Democrats  across the country and also from President Fox  It would strengthen our borders  protect our security  require more cooperation in enforcement from other countries  and bring an underground economy above ground by replacing an illegal flow with regulated  legal immigration     Kennedy  a longtime advocate of peace in Northern Ireland  welcomed Minister Ahern and praised his work on behalf of the people of Ireland  Ahern  who recently said Kennedy s actions on behalf of the peace process focused minds like no one else and that without the Senator s actions  the decommissioning would not have happened    Kennedy and Ahern spoke about the vested interest the Irish have in immigration reform  citing that there are between 25 and 50 000 Irish in the United States who would benefit from immigration reform     When asked about President Bush s recent immigration speeches  Senator Kennedy said  Americans deserve better than the broken immigration system that we have in this country  But so far all we ve heard from President Bush is talk and no action  It s time for a new and comprehensive strategy  like the plan that Senator McCain and I propose to secure our borders  strengthen our economy  and respect our history as a nation of immigrants  President Bush must do more than give speeches   he must demonstrate leadership by standing up and saying no to his right wing allies who just want to close up our borders  As business leaders agree  what America needs is not closed border or open border  but smart borders    and common sense immigration policies that make us secure and promote our progress  It is time to show that America can be both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws     Attached is the summary of the Kennedy McCain Immigration bill  as well as the Resolution passed by the Irish Parliament in support of the
