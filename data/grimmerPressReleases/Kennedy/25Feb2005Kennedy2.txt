         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Washington  DC  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Senator Tom Harkin have sent a letter to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics urging them not to discontinue the data series on production and nonsupervisory workers that is currently used to understand how the economy is hurting working Americans  The Bush Administration has recently announced that this most reliable source of employment data on women workers will come to a halt by removing the women worker series from the Current Employment Statistics program at the Bureau of Labor Statistics     Kennedy believes the Administration continually hides the facts in order to make the economy seem stronger  this decision is just par for the course  This is the second letter Senator Kennedy has sent to Bureau of Labor Statistics in opposition to its elimination of this important data just this month  The Bureau recently announced that they will no longer collect data on migrant farm workers and will stop collecting separate data on the employment and wages of managers and non managers  After 2001 they stopped collecting data on temp workers  part time workers  and independent contractors  and in 2002 they tried to stop collecting data on workers who lost their jobs in mass layoffs or plant closings  and only continued collecting the data after Congress forced them to do so  And last August  they released the Census Bureau s poverty and health insurance numbers a month early to avoid delivering bad economic news during the fall election campaign    In a statement separate from the letter  Senator Kennedy said    This decision is another demonstration of the Bush Administration s low regard for the hardworking Americans on whom the economy so heavily depends  These employees obviously aren t getting their fair share of the nation s growth   in 2004  their wages actually fell  Now  instead of rewarding workers fairly for their work  the Administration is trying to hide the facts from them  It s part of a cynical cover up  In the past four years the Administration stopped collecting data on temporary workers  part time workers  and independent contractors  It recently announced that it will no longer collect data on women workers and migrant farm workers  In 2002 they tried to stop collecting data on workers who lost their jobs in mass layoffs or plant closings  but Congress for once said no           February 22  2005     Kathleen P  Utgoff   Commissioner   U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics   Postal Square Building   2 Massachusetts Ave NE   Washington  DC 20212 0001    Dear Commissioner Utgoff     We are writing to express our concern about your planned discontinuation of the data series on production and nonsupervisory workers as part of your revisions to the Current Employment Statistics  CES  program  These data are vital to our understanding of how the economy is affecting working Americans  and we strongly urge you to continue to collect them     In recent years  workers have not been getting their fair share of what they produce  According to the series you propose to eliminate  the nominal wages of production and nonsupervisory workers grew in 2004 by 2 1 percent the lowest growth since you began keeping these data in 1964  Since inflation grew by 2 7 percent in 2004  real wages actually fell  At the same time  corporate profits are skyrocketing     Without the CES wage data  Congress  researchers  and the media will not be able to follow these trends  We will have no way of comparing wages today to wages in the past  and no way of knowing how the economy is rewarding the low wage and middle class Americans whose effort is the heart of our economy  This is an unacceptable loss    In addition  the series with which you will replace the production and nonsupervisory series will inevitably give the impression that wages have risen  when they have not  The 20 percent of the workforce you would add to your calculation are mostly at the higher end of the earnings spectrum  and adding them will drive up the average wage  And the hourly wages of most of the salaried managers that you will add will be artificially inflated  since they will be calculated based on a 40 hour workweek  when in fact they work considerably more  In fact  your new series might have easily proclaimed 2004 to be a banner year for wages  even though  in fact  wages fell for four fifths of the workforce    A series that covers only four fifths of the workforce is not perfect  and we appreciate your efforts to expand your data to cover more workers  But that expansion cannot come at such a cost  By eliminating the production and nonsupervisory series instead of collecting the two series side by side you will be obscuring our ability to follow the progress of low wage and middle class Americans as they struggle to make ends meet in our economy    In view of the tremendous importance of this series  we strongly urge you to continue to collect it alongside your new series covering the whole workforce  and to continue to make it a prominent part of your analyses of the workforce         Sincerely      Edward M  Kennedy        Tom Harkin  Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
