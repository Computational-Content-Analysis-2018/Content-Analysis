         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  DC  Today Senator Kennedy responded to the comments made by Vice President Cheney in Milwaukee    Cheney s words are proof positive that it s not only time to change course in Iraq  but at home too  Just yesterday  we learned that the nations intelligence agencies have unanimously concluded that the war in Iraq has made us less safe from terrorists  In the face of that news  the Vice President decided to attack Democrats instead of recognizing that it is time to attack terrorism more effectively  One place to start would be to finally implement the full recommendations of the 9 11 Commission  But instead of changing course  we just get more of the same tired rhetoric that does nothing to make us safe or fix the mess the Vice President has helped create  Vice President Cheney has been too wrong about too much and thats why the American people arent buying this act any more     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
