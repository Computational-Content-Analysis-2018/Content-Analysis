         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I m saddened to learn of Bill s death and will always remember him as a friend and outstanding Senator  He was a constant profile in courage on countless issues  continually insisting that the Senate live up to its ideals and always willing to wage lonely battles for noble causes  He was appalled that it took so long for America to join the rest of the civilized world on the Genocide Treaty  His Golden Fleece Awards ridiculing special interest pork were legendary  I wish we had more like him   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
