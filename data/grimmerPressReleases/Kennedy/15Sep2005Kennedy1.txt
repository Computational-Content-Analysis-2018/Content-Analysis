         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I applaud the President for his announcement of federal funds to serve the educational needs of the children displaced by hurricane Katrina  But I am extremely disappointed that he has proposed providing this relief using such a politically charged approach  This is not the time for a partisan political debate on vouchers  We need to focus on getting these kids into the classroom as quickly as possible  and the public school safety net has responded  But equally important  we need to focus on rebuilding the public school systems which are the cornerstones of the Gulf Coast communities and economies  I have been working on a bipartisan package that will get assistance to these families as quickly as possible  These families need real relief  not ideological battles that threaten to slow down their recovery
