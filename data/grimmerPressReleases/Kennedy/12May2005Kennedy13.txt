         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I m very pleased to see that the Pentagon proposed moving the Air Force s Air and Space Information Systems RD center to Hanscom  This is an acknowledgement of the excellent work that is done at Hanscom  It will bring over 1100 new jobs to Massachusetts  and new high tech mission  It will make Hanscom  in their words  a multi functional center of excellence in the rapidly changing technology area of command and control technologies  It will provide our Air Force with a more efficient structure for developing the needed information network to keep our military s technological advantage    I am concerned to see that the list proposes closing Otis Air Guard Base and proposes moving those planes to Atlantic City  New Jersey  We need to look carefully at that proposal and determine its effect on national security    This list is not the final step in the process  It s the Pentagon s proposal  The BRAC Commission will now consider it over the summer  with a final vote in Congress in the Fall  We ll continue to fight for our bases as we ve done all along  We have a team of experts scrutinizing the results now to find out whether the Pentagon s analysis properly evaluated our bases  We ll use that information to make the strongest arguments we can that our bases are needed for national security  and we will continue to make that case before the commission    This BRAC round has been a long journey  Since the initial legislation was passed in September 2001  we ve been hard at work to ensure that Massachusetts  bases are not closed  As soon as it was enacted  Governor Jane Swift and I began discussing our BRAC strategy  Governor Romney joined the effort when he was elected in 2002 and has been strongly committed preserving our bases ever since     We ve looked carefully at past BRAC rounds to determine which bases were most vulnerable  For high tech research and development facilities like Natick and Hanscom  we found that past BRACs couldn t properly analyze the complex factors that make them so successful  We worked hard to see that the Pentagon understands what is needed to maintain high tech military advantagea skilled workforce  and access to the best research institutions and industry  We ve got that here in Massachusetts for our bases  Other bases in other states don t have that advantage    We enlisted the support of Senator Sununu and Senator Gregg because of the impact that base closings would have on southern New Hampshire  We brought senior BRAC officials up to Hanscom and Natick to see firsthand the impressive work being done there    We offered the government the opportunity to do even more in the state  and worked hard on an expansion plan  We visited senior military officials in the Pentagon and Ohio  We worked hard in the state to back up the expansion plan with a bond bill to pay for it     Our communities have rallied around our bases in an unprecedented show of support  We ve made sure that the BRAC officials know how strongly Massachusetts supports them  And we ll continue to do that as the process continues    The results today show that our efforts have paid off           AUDIO STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY AVAILABLE   Senator Edward M  Kennedy today recorded an audio statement on the release of the Base Realignment and Closure list      You may access this audio statement by dialing 1 800 511 0763  the pin number is 7327   You may also listen to the MP3 file at    http   democrats gov actualities kennedy kennedy050513 mp3    Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
