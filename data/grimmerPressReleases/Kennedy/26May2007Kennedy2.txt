         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CLast night  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to the President signing the minimum wage increase into law  While I know that many Americans are deeply troubled about the bill the President has signed today  there is one thing in this legislation that we can all celebrate  a long overdue increase in the minimum wage  Minimum wage workers have been waiting for this raise for ten long and difficult years  They have worked more than one job  They have saved every penny they can for the future of their children  They have decided each day what food they can afford to buy and what bills they can afford pay Today  these hardworking Americans have hope for a brighter future  And we are one step closer to becoming the America we want to be  where anyone who works hard and plays by the rules can build a better life for their family       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
