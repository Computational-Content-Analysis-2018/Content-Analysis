         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  As we all know  a major debate may soon be underway in the Senate and the country if there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court  It is clear that the Bush Administration is well along in choosing its nominee for the vacancy  and the Senate must be well prepared as well The initial major question is whether  for the highest judicial position in the land  President Bush will choose consultation and consensus  or confrontation and conflict  I urge the President not to cede this important constitutional responsibility to a narrow faction of his own party    and to groups so extreme they have called for the impeachment of six of the current nine justices because those justices refuse to make the law in accord with the groups  wishes In the landmark May 23rd agreement  the bi partisan group of 14 Senators spoke clearly for this body on two vital points  First  we intend to remain the world s greatest deliberative body  where the rules  not raw power  prevail  and where the rights of the minority are respected    not silenced  Second  the agreement sent a strong reminder to the President that the Constitution requires him to obtain both the advice and consent of the Senate before appointing judges  and that we expect him to do so in good faith When the framers of the Constitution adopted our system of checks and balances 218 years ago  they focused intently on the process for selecting judges  They wanted judges to be independent  so they gave them lifetime positions and prohibited any reduction in their compensation Initially  they were so concerned that Presidents might abuse the power to select judges that they gave the Senate the sole power to appoint federal judges  But some delegates argued for a Presidential role  and they debated the issue at length Benjamin Franklin  always ready with new ideas  pointed to the Scottish system  where the lawyers themselves selected the judges  Invariably  he said  the best and smartest candidates were selected as judges  because the other lawyers wanted to remove their toughest competitor and divide his business among themselves In fact  in three separate votes in July 1787  the framers refused to give the Executive any role in judicial selection  because they did not believe the President could be trusted with that responsibility  They again placed the entire appointment power in the Senate Later  as the Constitutional Convention was ending in September  they agreed to a compromise  based on the procedure that Massachusetts had used successfully for over a century  To get the best possible judges  the President and the Senate would have to agree on appointments to the federal courts  The President was powerless to appoint judges without considering the Senate s advice and obtaining its consent For over two centuries that system has worked well  At the Supreme Court level  Presidents have nominated 154 Justices  Most of them were confirmed by the Senate  but some 20  were not  Some could not get Senate consent because the Senate did not feel they were qualified for the job  some because they were selected for reasons of politics or ideology with which the Senate did not agree  and some because they were perceived as being too close to the President to be independent A few of us who have been here in the Senate for all of the confirmations of the current nine justices know that most of them were consensus choices  Seven of them    including all six whom the right wing wants to impeach    were confirmed with such strong bipartisan support that no more than nine Senators voted against them  and  of those  four received unanimous Senate support We learned many things from past debates  One of the most important is that there are large reservoirs of excellent potential nominees among the many capable judges and lawyers in the United States  and that  if they are chosen for the High Court  they will receive overwhelming support in the country and in the Senate  Presidents who have listened to the Senate s advice and selected such candidates have had no problem obtaining Senate consent  President Bush can do that  too  If he takes our bipartisan advice  he will have no trouble obtaining our bipartisan consent Presidents who have had the most trouble with the confirmation process are those who listened to erroneous advice about the process  As recently as this week  a member of this body argued in print that Senate practice and even the Constitution contemplate deference to the president and a presumption in favor of confirmation That s not what the Constitution says  Since the days of George Washington    whose nomination of a Justice was denied consent by the Senate of that day  there has been no presumption in favor of confirmation of lifetime judicial appointees  In general  many of us do give some deference to a President s nominees to the Executive Branch  since they are not lifetime appointments  But even there  if the President overreaches  we act to fulfill our constitutional responsibility Three times in my experience  Presidents have pushed the Senate too far on Supreme Court nominations  and the Senate has said no  Each time  the White House argued for Senate deference and the Senate  each time with bipartisan support  refused to defer  Two of those rejections were of consecutive nominations for the same vacancy  with members of the President s own party providing the majority for rejection each time  In the second of those two  the selection was so plainly an arrogant affront to the Senate  that the best argument the proponents could make was that mediocrity deserved representation  too  on the High Court  a proposition the Senate soundly rejected Clearly  Senators should not support a nominee just because a President of their party proposed the nomination  The framers relied on each of us to make independent and individual judgments about the President s nominees  We do not fulfill our constitutional trust if we merely play placate the President  I have seen repeated examples of Senatorial courage when numerous members of the President s party    even members of his leadership team    have refused to go along with plainly inappropriate presidential selections We should do exactly what the framers intended us to do    be joint and co equal defenders of the rule of law and the fairness and quality and independence of the federal courts  We must listen to their voices now  summoning us across the centuries  to uphold that basic ideal  with full devotion to our role in the checks and balances that have served the nation so well  We fail them if we march in lock step with the White House As past experience shows  nominees selected for their devotion to a particular ideological agenda are likely to have the most difficulty being confirmed  because that kind of choice rarely achieves a consensus  History shows plainly that the better course is to search for the highest quality candidates who have demonstrated their respect for the rule of law  They respect core constitutional principles  especially those that define the rights of each citizen  They have demonstrated their commitment to finding the law  not making the law  They respect stare decisis  the deference to well accepted past decisions that have kept the nation strong by reconciling traditional principles with new needs and challenges  They show respect for the basic structure of government  especially for Congress when it acts within its established powers  They have demonstrated the ability to subordinate their own ideological and result oriented preferences to the rule of law Especially at the Supreme Court level  the choices should not be partisan choices based on today s partisan issues  The Justice we may select this year could well be providing justice to our children and grandchildren for decades to come  It is more important that the nominee have a strong dedication to principles of justice than a strong position on controversial issues of the day It is a disservice to the Court to attempt to install ideological activists bent on making sudden and drastic shifts in the Court s careful  gradual jurisprudence  The Supreme Court is at its worst when it splits into extreme  contentious sides  and reaches extreme results that make much of the nation cringe and leave only the ideological activists satisfied Like sausage and legislation  the confirmation or rejection of a Supreme Court nomination is not always something pleasant to watch or be part of  The course is set by the President  If the President submits an in your face nomination to flaunt his power  it takes time and effort and sweat and tears before the truth about the candidate is fully discovered and explained to the public and voted on We are fortunate to have had a dress rehearsal for the process  Before the White House decided to threaten the Senate with the nuclear option  few Americans had any idea what was happening here and how important it was  It took some time  but eventually the public understood the seriousness of the threat to break the rules in order to change the rules  so that for the first time in Senate history  a bare majority of the Senate could impose a gag rule on every other Senator and enable the President to exercise absolute power over the courts without meaningful review by the Senate  Fortunately  the Senate stepped back from that brink  and the Senators who reached that bipartisan agreement to make it possible deserve great credit Those who want the Senate to be a rubber stamp for a White House nominee to the Supreme Court will undoubtedly try to rush us through our duty  But if we are to do our job for the American people in good faith  the process of considering a Supreme Court nominee cannot be rushed  It will take time to obtain the necessary information and documents  and to review and understand them  It will take time to gather witnesses and prepare for hearings  If the nomination is not a consensus nomination  the hearings will be intensive and extensive  If the nominee is evasive  there will be longer hearings and follow up questions  which will also take time to analyze  Only when all the information is available and fairly considered  can the nomination go forward If President Bush resists his fringe constituencies  and seeks the advice of the Senate as he should  the nomination process can have a happy ending  I hope our colleagues across the aisle will urge the President to respect the May 23rd bipartisan agreement and its memorandum of understanding  and take to heart its serious request that he consult with Senators from both parties before proposing a Supreme Court nominee We already have in place a process for doing so  In selecting district judge nominees in our states  the White House sends us the list of persons being considered seriously  and asks for our comments on each  as well as our suggestions for additional names to consider  When they have narrowed down the list  they share the short list with us  so that we can give our final advice as to which ones are best and which ones would raise problems  Almost always  our advice is considered and respected  As a result most District Judges go through the confirmation process quietly and expeditiously  and obtain the consent of the Senate Article II  Section 2  Clause 2  of the Constitution clearly says  with the advice and consent of the Senate  not the advice of anyone else  just 100 of us here in the Senate  who speak for all the American people  It doesn t take much to get our consent  All the President has to do is seek out his preferred non ideological choices  ask us about them  and listen to our answers   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
