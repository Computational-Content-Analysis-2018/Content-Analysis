         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE             Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on amendments to begin to redeploy American troops from Iraq   Todays vote demonstrates the extent to which Republicans have become a rubber stamp for the Presidents failed policy  Its wrong to affirm that stay the course is a strategy for success  It s wrong to abdicate our responsibility to our men and women in uniform who are paying for the administration s failed policy with their lives  Its wrong to allow mindless determination and foolish consistency to base our policy on hope  and hope alone  We must not forget that ultimately this is a debate about real people who are risking their lives every day   America was wrong to go to war in Iraq in the way we did  when we did  and for the false reasons we were given  There was no imminent threat  There was no persuasive link to Al Qaeda  Saddam Hussein was not close to acquiring a nuclear weapon  Our military forces have now been deployed in Iraq for 39 months    more than three years  Thats longer than the 37 months of combat in the Korean War  By the end of this year  it will be longer than it took to fight and win World War II   The American people want a realistic strategy for our troops to redeployed out of Iraq  Both Democratic amendments make clear that we are united in our belief that its time to shift to the Iraqis the responsibility for their own future and begin to withdraw our troops from Iraq  Democrats have sent a clear message  now that a democratic government has been elected by the Iraqi people  its time for American troops to begin to come home         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
