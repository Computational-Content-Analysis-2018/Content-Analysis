         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to the passage of the FDA Revitalization Act  This landmark legislation creates a stronger Food and Drug Administration and sets forth a new and better direction for the safety of drugs we take and the food we eat  Almost half of all Americans take at least one pill a day  so this legislation will make a difference in the life of every American family  From prescription drugs to pacemakers to chemotherapy to the food we eat  the FDA protects the health of hundreds of millions of Americans     often in ways we barely realize  The FDA should be the gold standard for safety but its luster has been tarnished in recent years by failure to protect the American people from unsafe drugs  Congress has ample power to restore the luster that FDA has lost in recent years and the bill we just passed represents a bipartisan consensus on the best way to get the job done Safety and better access are at the core of the bill  It greatly improves the way the FDA oversees the safety of the drugs  It recognizes that when patients are in danger  the FDA should not have to wait to get legal opinions to decide how to protect health  It should be able to act immediately  and our bill gives it that authority  The bill also contains an important first step to better protect the food we and our pets eat by strengthening FDA oversight and establishing strong new quality standards for pet food  It addresses the important issue of prescription drug advertising  by providing a constitutionally sound  effective  workable way to see that ads targeting consumers provide accurate information to patients  It will end the abuse of so called citizen petitions  while preserving FDAs ability to review any such petitions that have public health merit In this new era of the life sciences  medical advances will continue to bring immense benefits for our citizens  To fulfill the potential of that bright future  we need not only brilliant researchers to develop the drugs of tomorrow  but also strong and vigilant watchdogs for public health to guarantee that new drugs and medical devices are safe and beneficial  and that they actually reach the patients who urgently need them      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
