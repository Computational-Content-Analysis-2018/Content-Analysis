         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     All who care about the nation s security should thank Senator Reid for calling a closed session of the Senate today  Facts are stubborn things  and the facts speak truth to power  the Bush Administration distorted and misrepresented the intelligence to justify a war America never should have fought  There were no weapons of mass destruction  and there was no convincing link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda  There was no reason whatever to go to war when we did  in the way we did  and for the false reasons we were given    The Senate Republican Majority has obediently stifled any serious investigation about how this happened  We need an investigation  not a cover up  and its long past time to conduct it fully  fairly  and honestly  I look forward to the report on this extremely serious problem by the bipartisan group of Senators that resulted from today s closed session   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
