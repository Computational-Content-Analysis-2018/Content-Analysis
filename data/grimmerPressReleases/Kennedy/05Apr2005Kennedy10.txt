         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I commend Chairman Enzi and Senator Alexander for scheduling today s hearing on Head Start  which gives us an opportunity to consider effective ways to improve and strengthen all aspects of this vital program    One thing is clear    Head Start is a lifeline for the neediest families and children across the nation  For 40 years  it has given disadvantaged children the assistance they need to arrive at school ready to learn  Its balanced curriculum to help them develop the intellectual skills they ll need to meet high academic standards later in school  Equally important  it helps them learn to get along with their fellow students  and delivers the social and emotional building blocks they ll need to keep up once they reach kindergarten     Head Start also makes it possible for these children to see doctors and dentists  and be immunized against childhood diseases  It teaches children to eat healthy meals  Every Head Start center is grounded in the community in which it operates and supports  Parents are welcomed into their children s classrooms and urged to participate actively in the local programs     These services are backed by impressive research  Children who participate in the program make gains in vocabulary  and develop early reading and math skills  By the end of their kindergarten year  Head Start children are typically performing at or above national averages  That s a remarkable achievement  given the devastating effects of poverty on children     Our challenge in reauthorizing Head Start this year is to build on the program s many strengths  identify the problems it faces  and enable administrators  teachers  parents  and families to deal with them  We welcome the opportunity today to hear more about Head Start s oversight  and discuss ideas to improve its management    Our goal is to ensure that Head Start s services reach as many children and families as possible  The need for Head Start is still miles from being met  Today it serves fewer than 6 out of every 10 eligible children and only 3 out of every hundred infants and toddlers through its sister program  Early Head Start     President Bush s budget proposes to increase funds for Head Start by only  45 million  and would set aside those funds for 9 states willing to turn Head Start into a block grant  Block grants are the wrong direction for Head Start  They don t guarantee medical check ups  healthy meals  dental visits  or medical screenings for children  They don t guarantee support to families and parents  Lower quality and lower standards are not the way to strengthen Head Start  We need to invest more    not less    in the families and children the program serves     We can do more to see that every dollar invested in Head Start delivers the highest quality of services in the most effective manner  New resources for Head Start should be accompanied by effective steps to genuinely improve the program     We welcome the testimony today from the GAO and other witnesses on the oversight and management of Head Start  especially on ways to measure risks and potential problems more accurately and adopt more effective strategies to meet them  We know what works in Head Start and it s time to put these practices into place    For years  Head Start has had one of the most comprehensive monitoring systems in early childhood education  Over the years  it has been revised and improved  based on Head Start s actual services  Annual auditing  reporting  and financial accounting are critical for the quality of the programs and the most effective level of services     It s clear that the number of Head Start programs with serious problems is small    15 percent or fewer of all programs  by the Department s own calculation  But clearly  when any problem is identified in a program    no matter what the issue    it must receive appropriate attention and follow up from those responsible at the federal level     Thanks to the bipartisan cooperation of Committee members in the last Congress  we made good progress in working together on these improvements  We did more to enhance the skills and qualifications of Head Start teachers  upgraded the educational components of the program  and increased coordination at the state level with other programs     I look forward to continuing our bipartisan work this year  We are fortunate to begin that work today by hearing from witnesses who will share their expertise and insights from the federal and local levels  Thank you all for joining us this morning    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
