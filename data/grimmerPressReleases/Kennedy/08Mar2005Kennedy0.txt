         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C     Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy will put forth a plan to protect single parents from the harsh provisions aimed at them in the bankruptcy legislation currently being debated in the Senate  Just as this bill unjustly targets veterans  low income families  and those with high medical costs families  if passed as written it will also hurt single parents    overwhelmingly mothers    owed child support by who file for bankruptcy  Senator Kennedy s amendment would protect single parents who are working hard to make ends meet and take care of their children yet aren t receiving the child support or alimony they deserve  The bankruptcy courts are filled with cases of hard working single mothers who were pushed over the financial brink because they failed to get the child support they deserve  Yet this bill would only tighten the screws  looking to squeeze out a few more dollars for the credit card companies  Today I am asking my colleagues to extend a little compassion to these single mothers struggling to raise their children  said Senator Kennedy   The poverty rate for single mothers is nearly 40 percent and most single moms work in low wage jobs without benefits  Single moms are more now more likely to go bankrupt than any other group    more than the elderly  divorced men  minorities  or people in poor neighborhoods  Last year nearly 100 billion dollars in child support was unpaid  leaving single parents in a deep financial hole through no fault of their own  Despite the magnitude of these challenges  this bill will make it more difficult for single moms to collect child support because credit card companies will have greater claims to the debtor s resources both during and after bankruptcy   Senator Kennedy s amendment would protect those who face financial hardship because they failed to get the child support or spousal support that he or she was entitled to  If a single parent does not receive court ordered support totaling over one third of her household income she would be exempted from the onerous means test imposed in this legislation   FACTS ON SINGLE PARENTS AND BANKRUPTCY  The proponents of this bill argue that people file for bankruptcy because they want to get out of their obligations  because they re untrustworthy  because they re dishonest  because there is no stigma in filing for bankruptcy  But any look at the data tells you otherwise    The statistics for single mothers living in poverty are startling  The poverty rate for single mothers is nearly 40  as compared to just 19  for single fathers    The employment rate among single mothers fell from 73  in 2000 to 69 8  in 2003    a larger decline than among other parents  or the population overall    And even when single mothers are working  they are working in low wage jobs without good benefits    in the wake of welfare reform  well over three fourths  78   of single mothers were concentrated in four typically low wage occupations    Single mothers are 50 percent more likely than married people to go bankrupt  and 3 times more likely than childless people  married or single    If things continue as they are  one in six single mothers will file for bankruptcy by the end of the decade     95 Billion in child support was uncollected in 2004    Moving child support claims to a first priority in Chapter 7 may sound good  but it is meaningless  Supporters of this bill say they put child support first in Chapter 7  but 95  of debtors have no resources to pay unsecured creditors  Essentially  this bill lets single mothers and children wait at the head of the line in Chapter 7to receive nothing    Also  in Chapter 13  the bill would require larger payments to be made to many commercial creditors  resulting in smaller payments of past due child support over a longer period of time  This increases the risk that child support debts will not be paid in full   Statement By Senator Edward M  Kennedy Protection for Single Mothers and their Children  prepared for delivery   My amendment is designed to protect single mothers and their children  who are forced into bankruptcy because they did not receive the child and spousal support they were entitled to  from the harsh provisions of this bankruptcy bill  Single mothers are 50  more likely than married people to go bankrupt  and three times more likely than childless people to go bankrupt  That statistic tells a great deal about the reality of why people are in bankruptcy   The proponents of this bill argue that people file for bankruptcy because they are spendthrifts looking to escape their financial obligations  But this stereotype is terribly wrong  The bankruptcy courts are filled with the cases of hard working people who were pushed over the financial brink because of a family health crisis  a lost job  or a failure to receive child support  These are the people this bill would turn the screws on  looking to squeeze out a few more dollars for the credit card companies   The amendment focuses on this last group    single parents trying to raise their children without the financial support they were supposed to receive from the absent parent  It would exempt from the onerous means test a single parent who failed to receive child support or spousal support that she was entitled to receive pursuant to a valid court order  totaling more than 35  of her household income within a 12 month period  No wonder such a person ended up in bankruptcy  She was never paid more than one third of the income she expected over an entire year to help raise her children  to provide for their basic needs and wellbeing  Under those circumstances  she had no choice but to fall back on borrowing to support her family  She was not irresponsible  What she did was unavoidable   Few people realize the magnitude of this problem   95 billion in child support was uncollected in 2004  Failure to receive that child support put millions of single parent families in a deep financial hole through no fault of their own  and it is the children who suffer most in these situations  Why on earth would we want to make things even more difficult for these families   Most single moms have to struggle to make ends meet  They are working in low wage jobs without good benefits  Over three quarters  78   of them are concentrated in four typically low wage occupational categories  When the economy is tough  they are often the first ones let go  The poverty rate for single mothers is nearly 40  as compared to just 19  for single fathers  It is no wonder that single mothers are now more likely to go bankrupt than any other demographic group    more than the elderly  more than divorced men or married couples  more than minorities or people living in poor neighborhoods   Yet  this legislation would deny traditional bankruptcy relief to many single parent families who never received the child support they were owed  Instead  they would have to keep paying those credit card bills for another five years  Is that fair  I cannot believe that a majority of my Senate colleagues think it is  I am asking them to extend a little compassion to these single mothers struggling to raise their children  Please adopt this amendment   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224
