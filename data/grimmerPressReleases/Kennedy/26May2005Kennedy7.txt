of hate crimes based on race  ethnicity  religion  gender  sexual orientation  and disability  Today s legislation addresses gaping loopholes and excessive restrictions requiring proof victims were attacked because of engaging in federally protected activities and does not include violence committed because of sexual orientation  gender  or disability     Hate crimes are basically acts of domestic terrorism  Senator Kennedy said  they have an impact far greater than the impact on the individual victim  They re crimes against entire communities  against the whole nation  and against the fundamental ideals on which America was founded    Senators Kennedy and Smith first introduced this measure last year as part of the Defense Authorization Bill and received overwhelming bi partisan support when it passed in a nearly 2 1 vote of 65 33  By a vote of 213 186  the House instructed its conferees to support it in the conference report on the bill  only for it to be dropped when House leadership insisted the provision be left out of conference     The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act would close flagrant loopholes to include protections for those victimized because of sexual orientation  gender  and disability  In addition to removing the federally protected activity requirement and expanding the class of protected people   The bill protects state interests with a strict certification procedure that requires the federal government to consult with local officials before bringing a federal case   It offers federal assistance to help state and local law enforcement investigate and prosecute hate crimes in any of the categories   It offers training grants for local law enforcement   It amends the Federal Hate Crime Statistics Act to add gender to the existing categories of race  religion  ethnic background  sexual orientation  and disability    According to FBI statistics  in 2003 there were over 9 000 reported victims of hate crimes in the United States almost 25 victims a day  Sadly  many hate crimes go unreported and the Southern Poverty Law Center estimates the actual number of hate crimes each year is closer to 50 000     Below is a joint statement by Senators Kennedy and Smith followed by Senator Kennedy s full statement on the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2005     JOINT STATEMENT BY SENATORS EDWARD M  KENNEDY AND GORDON SMITH INTRODUCUNG THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005 It is long past time for Congress to demonstrate its commitment to ending brutal  hate motivated violence  Today  we re introduce the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act to strengthen the ability of law enforcement to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race  ethnic background  religion  gender  sexual orientation  and disability  The Act is a constructive  overdue response to the serious festering problem of violence motivated by biogotry that continues to plague our nation    Hate crimes are a violation of everything our country stands for  They send the poisonous message that some Americans deserve to be assaulted or even murdered solely because of who they are     Like acts of terrorism  hate crimes have an impact far greater than the harm suffered by the individual victims  These are crimes against entire communities    and against the fundamental ideals of liberty and justice for all on which America was founded     According to FBI statistics  there were approximately 9 100 victims of reported hate crimes in the United States in 2003   almost 25 hate crimes each day  every day  It is time to make combating these crimes a genuine national priority  Clearly  the federal government needs to do more to end these senseless acts of hate and violence    Clearly  the federal government needs to do more to end these senseless acts of hate and violence  The existing federal law on hate crimes is inadequate  Our bill expands the definition of hate crimes to include crimes based on gender  sexual orientation  and disability  It strengthens state and local efforts to combat violence by enabling the Justice Department to assist them in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes  and to provide grants to help state and local governments meet the extraordinary expenses involved in hate crime cases     The Act has the support of a wide range of law enforcement  religious  and civil rights organizations  It also has strong bipartisan support in Congress  and we re optimistic it will be enacted into law this year    Statement of Edward M  Kennedy Introducing Local Law Enforcement  Enhancement Act of 2005   Mr  President  hate crimes are a violation of everything our country stands for  They send the poisonous message that some Americans deserve to be victimized solely because of who they are  They re basically acts of domestic terrorism  Hate crimes have an impact far greater than the impact on their individual victim  They re crimes against entire communities  against the whole nation  and against the fundamental ideals on which America was founded     The vast majority of Congress agrees  Last year  Senator Smith and I offered the same measure  The Senate passed it as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill by a nearly 2 1 bi partisan vote of 65 33  By a vote of 213 186  the House instructed its conferees to support it in the conference report on the bill  Unfortunately  House leaders insisted that the provision be dropped in conference  This week  Senator Smith and I are introducing the identical bill     The provision is supported by a broad coalition of law enforcement and civil rights groups  including the National Sheriff s Association  the International Association of Chiefs of Police  the Anti Defamation League  and the National Center for Victims of Crime  and I m optimistic the bill would have the same broad support it did before  Those who commit hate crimes prey on the vulnerable and terrorize them  because they can t protect themselves  If our nation stands for anything  it s to protect the vulnerable     We know that hate crimes are a serious problem that continues to plague us  According to FBI statistics  over 9 000 people were victims of hate crimes reported in the United States in 2003  That s almost 25 people victimized a day  every day  based on their race  religion  sexual orientation  ethnic background  or disability  Sadly  these F B I  statistics show only part of the problem  because many hate crimes go unreported  The Southern Poverty Law Center  a nonprofit organization that monitors hate groups and extremist activity  estimates that the actual number of hate crimes committed in the United States each year is closer to 50 000     Congress can t ignore the problem  Our bill will strengthen the ability of federal  state  and local governments to investigate and prosecute these vicious and senseless crimes  Current federal law  obviously isn t adequate to protect our citizens  It contains excessive restrictions requiring proof that victims were attacked because they were engaged in certain federally protected activities  It doesn t include violence committed because of person s sexual orientation  gender  or disability  It covers only hate crimes based on race  religion  or ethnic background    The federally protected activity requirement is outdated  unwise  and unnecessary  In June 2003  three men saw 6 Latino teenagers in a family restaurant on Long Island  The teenagers  3 boys and 3 girls  between 13 15 years old  knew each other from church and baseball teams  They were there together to celebrate the birthday of one of the girls  whose parents made her take her 13 year old sister along as chaperone  A parent dropped them all off in his mini van and promised to pick them up after dinner and a movie  But  moments after leaving  he received a panicked phone call from one of the children  telling him they d been attacked    As the group entered the restaurant  three men were leaving the bar  after drinking there for hours  For no apparent reason  they assaulted the teenagers  pummeling one boy and severing a tendon in his hand with a sharp weapon  During the attack  the men screamed racial slurs and one identified himself as a skinhead  The children  who had never experienced anything like this  have been traumatized ever since    Two of the defendants were tried under current federal law for committing a hate crime and were acquitted  The Jurors said they acquitted them because the government had not proved the attack took place because the victims were engaged in a federally protected activity    using the restaurant     The bill we introduce today eliminates the federally protected activity requirement  Under this bill  these defendants who walked out of the front door of the courthouse free that day would almost certainly have left in handcuffs through a different door     The bill also recognizes that hate crimes are committed against people because of their sexual orientation  their gender  and their disability  Current federal law didn t protect gay campers in Honolulu from attempted murder when their tents were doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire because they were gay     It didn t protect Brandon Teena  in Humboldt  Nebraska  who was raped and beaten by two male friends when they discovered that he was living as a male but was anatomically female  The local sheriff refused to arrest the offenders  and they later shot and stabbed Brandon to death     Current law did not protect a 23 year old mentally disabled man in Port Monmouth  New Jersey who was kidnapped by 9 men and women and tortured for three hours before being dumped in the woods because he was disabled     Our bill will close all these flagrant loopholes  In addition to removing the federally protected activity requirement and expanding the class of protected people   The bill protects state interests with a strict certification procedure that requires the federal government to consult with local officials before bringing a federal case   It offers federal assistance to help state and local law enforcement investigate and prosecute hate crimes in any of the categories   It offers training grants for local law enforcement   It amends the Federal Hate Crime Statistics Act to add gender to the existing categories of race  religion  ethnic background  sexual orientation  and disability    A strong federal role in prosecuting hate crimes is essential for practical and symbolic reasons  In practical terms  the bill will have a real world impact on actual criminal investigations and prosecutions by state and federal officials     The presence or absence of the federally protected activity requirement frequently determines whether state and local resources must be used to prosecute these crimes or whether the federal government can bring its full weight to bear on the case     Hate crime investigations tend to be expensive  requiring considerable law enforcement legwork and extensive use of investigative grand juries  State officials regularly seek federal assistance in bringing hate crime offenders to justice under current law  This bill expands the opportunity for the Justice Department to provide that support    Our bill fully respects the primary role of state and local law enforcement in responding to violent crime  The vast majority of hate crimes will continue to be prosecuted at the state and local level  The bill authorizes the Justice Department to assist state and local authorities in hate crimes cases  it authorizes federal prosecutions only when a state does not have jurisdiction  or when it asks the federal government to take jurisdiction  or when it fails to act against hate motivated violence     In other words  the bill establishes an appropriate back up for state and local law enforcement to deal with hate crimes in cases where states request assistance  or cases that would not otherwise be effectively investigated and prosecuted    The symbolic value of the bill is equally important  Hate crimes target whole communities  not just individuals  They are intended to send messages of fear that extend beyond the moment and beyond the individual victim of the attack  Attacking people because they are gay  or African American  or Jewish  or any other criteria in the bill is bigotry at its worst  Hate crimes are designed to de humanize and diminish  and we must say loud and clear to those inclined to commit them that they ll go to prison if they do    The vast majority of us in Congress recognized the importance of making that statement last year  This year  we can make the statement even louder  by turning this bill into law      Laura Capps
