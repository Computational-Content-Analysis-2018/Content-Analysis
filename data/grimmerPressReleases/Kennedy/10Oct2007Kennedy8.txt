         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement on the announcement of the strike by the United Auto Workers at the Chrysler Corporation   Its regrettable that this strike even had to take place  I urge Chrysler to work to reach a fair contract with the UAW  Health costs and job security are obviously difficult issues  but as we saw at GM  parties working in good faith can reach a fair deal  Chrysler should go back to the bargaining table to renegotiate a realistic agreement as soon as possible          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
