         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Today the Committee is considering a highly controversial nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the D C  Circuit      Since President Bush took office  the Senate has confirmed 205 of his nominees  95  of those he has nominated  President Bush had a better confirmation rate in his first term than either President Clinton or the first President Bush in their first terms in office  The handful of nominees who were rejected  including Janice Rogers Brown  failed to be confirmed because their records showed that they would impose their own radical views on people s everyday lives  rather than following the law  Our federal courts are too important to allow such persons to become lifetime appointees as federal judges    The President and Senate Republicans have said that they want an independent judiciary  But their actions in supporting nominees who would roll back basic rights tell a different story  Instead of judges who would approach each case with an open mind  guided by fairness and a dedication to upholding the law  they are pushing for confirmation of nominees who would do the bidding of the radical right     The nomination of Janice Rogers Brown is a prime example of a nominee who sees the federal bench as a platform to advance her own extremist views  Justice Brown has demonstrated her hostility to basic civil and individual rights    particularly in cases involving the relationship between citizens and government    which are precisely the cases the D C  Circuit hears most often    Her record casts serious doubt on her fitness to serve on the this circuit  which is the crown jewel of the federal appellate courts  and has often been a stepping stone to the Supreme Court  The D C  Circuit has a unique role among the federal courts in interpreting federal power  Although located here in the District of Columbia  its decisions have national reach  because it has exclusive jurisdiction over many laws that protect consumer s rights  employees  rights  civil rights  and the environment    The D C  Circuit is the only federal appellate court that can hear appeals on rules to protect the environment under the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act  It has exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to the North American Free Trade Act  And it decides far more appeals than any other circuit from decisions by the National Labor Relations Board  As a practical matter  because the Supreme Court can review only a small number of lower court decisions  the judges on the D C  Circuit often have the last word on these important rights     Because of the court s importance to issues that affect so many lives  the Committee should take special care in arguing judges for lifetime positions on the D C  Circuit  We must be completely confident that appointees to this prestigious court have the highest qualifications and ethical standards  and will fairly interpret the laws  particularly laws that protect our basic rights     The important work we do in Congress to improve health care  reform public schools  protect working families  and enforce civil rights is undermined if we fail in our responsibility to provide the best possible advice and consent on judicial nominations  Needed environmental laws mean little to a community that can t enforce them in the federal courts  Fair labor laws and civil rights laws mean little if we confirm judges who ignore them    In the 1960s and 1970s  the D C  Circuit expanded public access to administrative proceedings and protected the interests of the public against big business  It enabled more plaintiffs to challenge agency decisions  It held that a religious group    as members of the listening public    could oppose the license renewal of a television station accused of racial and religious discrimination  It held that an organization of welfare recipients was entitled to intervene in proceedings before a federal agency  These decisions empowered individuals and organizations to shine a brighter light on government agencies  No longer would these agencies be able to ignore the interests of those they were created to protect     But in recent years  the D C  Circuit has begun denying access to the courts  It held that a labor union could not challenge the denial of benefits to its members    a decision later overturned by the Supreme Court  It held that environmental groups are not qualified to seek review of federal standards under the Clean Air Act  These decisions are characteristic of the D  C  Circuit s flip flop  After decades of landmark decisions allowing effective implementation of important laws and principles  the court is now creating precedents on labor rights  civil rights  and the environment that will set back these basic principles for years to come  It is therefore especially important to ensure that judges appointed to this important court will not use their position to advance an extreme ideological agenda    The D C  Circuit s shift away from enforcing basic rights has been particularly pronounced in the area of labor law  When Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act  it guaranteed workers the right to join a union without discrimination or reprisal by employers  and to bargain with employers over the terms and conditions of employment  The National Labor Relations Board interprets and enforces the Act and reviews appeals of decisions by administrative law judges  The Board s decisions can be appealed to the circuit court where the unfair labor practice is alleged to have occurred  or where the employer resides or transacts business  or to the D C  Circuit  As a result  the D C  Circuit is always available as a forum to challenge decisions of the Board     In 1980  the D C  Circuit fully enforced the Board s decision 83  of the time  and at least partly enforced them in all the other cases  But the year 2000  when the court had a 5 4 Republican majority  including a solid majority of Reagan Bush appointees  the D C  Circuit fully enforced only 57  of the Board s cases and enforced at least part of the Board s decisions just 70  of the time  These statistics are significantly below the national average of an 83 4  enforcement rate for the Board in all the courts of appeals    Given these facts  it is not surprising that the D C  Circuit has become the circuit of choice for employers bent on overturning NLRB decisions  In 1980  the D C  Circuit heard only 3  of all the NLRB appeals heard by the circuit courts  Only the 10th Circuit heard fewer cases     By the year 2000  however  the D C  Circuit ranked first among all circuit courts in the percentage of Board cases it heard  Almost one in five cases    18     were filed in the D C  Circuit  and employers brought by far the largest number of these cases  Today  the D C  Circuit continues to review the largest number of NLRB cases of any circuit courtC hearing about a quarter of all such cases in the country    The Circuit s willingness to reverse Board decisions is deeply troubling because of the precedents being established  In one case  it reversed the NLRB and set aside a union election because the court felt a wage and hour lawsuit brought on behalf of several workers shortly before the election interfered with a fair election     In another case  the Board overturned a union representation election  finding that a company prevented a fair election by distributing a leaflet telling employees to vote against the union or risk losing a previously announced wage increase  The D C  Circuit reversed the Board s action    The Circuit s hostility to the Board  is also illustrated in other cases  In one case  the court overturned the Board s decision and held a company s action in permanent subcontracting employees  jobs during a lockout was not an unfair labor practice  In another case  the court reversed the Board s ruling that the Detroit News and Free Press had committed an unfair labor practice when it unilaterally implemented a merit pay proposal immediately before a 19 month strike by it s employees  In another case  the court reversed the Board s decision that it was an unfair labor practice for an employer to unilaterally revoke a contract provision on ways for the union to obtain recognition at other facilities     The list goes on and on     Given this trend in the D C  Circuit  it s particularly important that judges confirmed to this court have a record of upholding the rights of workers  Justice Brown assures us that she will follow the law  But merely making saying so is not enough when  there is so much extensive evidence to the contrary     Her record shows a deep seated and disturbing hostility to civil rights  workers  rights  consumer protection  and government regulation    the very issues that predominate in the D C  Circuit    Justice Brown has written opinions that would undermine civil rights  She held that the First Amendment prevents courts from enjoining racial slurs in the workplace  even when they create a hostile work environment in violation of job discrimination laws  Other opinions prevented victims of age and race discrimination from obtaining relief in state court  She has dissented from a holding that victims of discrimination may obtain damages from administrative agencies for their emotional distress    On workers  rights  she rejected a binding precedent limiting an employer s ability to require workers to submit to drug tests     On consumer protection  she wrote an opinion striking down a state fee requiring paint companies to pay for screening and treating children exposed to lead paint  Fortunately  she was unanimously reversed by the California Supreme Court  But because the U S  Supreme Court hears so few cases  there s no guarantee that her mistakes will be corrected if she receives a life time position on the D C  Circuit    In another case  she wrote a dissent urging the California Supreme Court to strike down a San Francisco law providing housing assistance to low income  elderly  and disabled people    Justice Brown has clearly demonstrated her willingness to ignore established precedent  In one case  she wrote a dissent urging the California Supreme Court do so  arguing that we cannot simply cloak ourselves in the doctrine of stare decisis  In fact  when she was nominated to the California Supreme Court in 1996  a Committee of the California bar Commission rated her Aunqualified  in part because of the way she injected personal  conservative political views into her legal opinions when she served on the state court of appeals    In a case this year  People v  Robert Young  Justice Brown tried to overturn a precedent protecting the rights of racial minorities and women  In a concurring opinion not joined by any of her colleagues  she wrote contradicted the precedent  stating that for the purpose of claiming that a prosecuting attorney has violated equal protection in jury selection  black women should not be considered a cognizable group  The California Supreme Court had held two decades ago that black women are a cognizable group and that prosecutors may not use preemptory challenges to exclude jurors solely on the basis that they are black women  Justice Brown argued that this precedent should be overruled because she saw no evidentiary basis that black women might be the victims of a unique type of group discrimination justifying their designation as a cognizable group    To truly fulfill our duty in reviewing this nomination  the Committee should have held a second hearing to question Justice Brown about this opinion  which was published after our first hearing     Time and again  in her public speeches  Justice Brown has leveled scathing criticism at the very idea of government regulation  She told a meeting of the Federalist Society that where government moves in  community retreats  and  civil society disintegrates    She has said that government leads to families under siege  war in the streets   She has said that when government advances  freedom is imperiled  and  civilization itself jeopardized     She has even said that today s senior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren because they have a right to get as much free stuff as the political system will permit them to extract  There are many other examples of her hostility to the role of government and programs dedicated to the public good     These views could hardly be more outside from the mainstream of the law  They are not the views of someone who should be confirmed to the second most important federal court in the land  the court with the highest frequency of cases involving government action  Congress and the White House are the places you go to change the law  not the federal courts    Justice Brown and her supporters ask us to believe that her contempt for the role of government and government regulation  and her opinions against workers  rights and consumer protection are not an indication of how she would rule as a federal judge  It is hard to believe that anyone would repeatedly use such extreme rhetoric and not mean it  It is even harder to believe that her carelessness and intemperance somehow qualify her to be a federal judge     Some have suggested that she should be confirmed to the Court of Appeals because she received 76  of the vote in an election for state court justice in which she ran unopposed  The fact that Californians voted for Justice Brown when they had no other choice is hardly a reason to confirm her to the most important court of federal appeals in the nation    In the past  some members of the press  and even some in Congress  have accused us of bias when we raise questions about a nominee  That s nonsense  Justice Brown has received the same treatment by this Committee as other nominees  We have asked about her record  looked at her statements  and reviewed her opinions  We have raised questions when her record casts doubt on her commitment to the rule of law      No one can seriously believe that objections to Justice Brown s nomination are motivated by racial or gender prejudice    No one can seriously contend that the overwhelming opposition to her nomination from the African American community is motivated by bias against blacks  She is opposed by respected civil rights leaders including Julian Bond  Chairman of the NAACP Board of Directors  by Dorothy Height  President Emeritus of the National Council of Negro Women  and a leader in the battle for equality for women and African Americans  by Reverend Joseph Lowery  President Emeritus of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  who worked with Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  in the civil rights movement and has sought tirelessly for many years  to make civil rights a reality for all Americans     Her nomination is also opposed by the Congressional Black Caucus  the National Bar Association  the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists  the California Association of Black Lawyers  and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority  the second oldest sorority founded by African American women  It is opposed by almost 100 organizations  including 24 in California  representing seniors  working families  and citizens concerned about the civil rights and the environment  They ll oppose Justice Brown s nomination because her views are too far outside of the mainstream of the law    Dorothy Height has dedicated her life to fighting for equal opportunity for all Americans  In opposing this nomination  she says that AI have always championed and applauded the progress of women  and especially of African American women  but I cannot stand by and be silent when a jurist with the record of performance of California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown is nominated to a federal court  even though she is an African American woman  In her speeches and decisions  Justice Janice Rogers Brown has articulated positions that weaken the civil rights legislation and progress that I and others have fought so long and hard to achieve    The role of our Committee and the Senate in confirming judges to the federal courts is one of our important responsibilities under the Constitution  At stake is the future of the federal courts  We count on federal judges to be open minded and fair  and to respect the rule of law  Despite what Justice Brown thinks  laws passed by Congress to give government a role in protecting the environment  immigrants  workers  consumers  and public health and safety have helped to make America a stronger  better  and fairer country  A nominee so deeply hostile to so many basic laws does not deserve to be appointed to such an important federal court  and I urge the committee to oppose her      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
