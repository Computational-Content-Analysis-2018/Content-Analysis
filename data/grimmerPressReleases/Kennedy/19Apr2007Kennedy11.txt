         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC Today  at the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing with Attorney General Gonzales  Senator Edward M  Kennedy focused his first round of questions on the process by which the U S  Attorneys were fired   Below are his remarks  as prepared for delivery Attorney General Gonzales  one of the major concerns that many of us had about confirming you as Attorney General was our doubt that you would be able to distinguish between the role of White House Counsel and the Attorney General   You responded   With the consent of the Senate  I will no longer represent only the White House  I will represent the United States of America and its people   I understand the differences between the two roles  Thats certainly not true of the U S  Attorney scandal   Its exposed a Department of Justice disastrously open to partisan influence and violating the fundamental principle of the rule of law   Its no surprise that the Department is now embroiled in a scandal over the firing of eight U S  Attorneys   In your statement  you say you have no basis to believe that anyone involved in this process sought the removal of a U S  Attorney for an improper reason   Yet you go on to describe yourself as having virtually no role in the process except to sign off on the final recommendations from your Chief of Staff  Kyle Sampson   You acknowledge that Mr  Sampson periodically updated you on the review of U S  Attorneys  but you state that his updates were brief  relatively few in number  and focused primarily on the review process itself   And you continue   During those updates  to my knowledge  I did not make decisions about who should or should not be asked to resign   Mr  Sampson says he kept in his drawer a list of U S  Attorneys to be replaced  and he revised it periodically  based on comments by Department officials   There was no systematic analysis  no written assessments  no quantitative information about caseloads or productivity  not even a memo identifying who said what about which U S  Attorney   Frankly  it strains credibility to think that such important decisions with so many ramifications for the administration of justice were made in such an irresponsible manner Did you review any paper in deciding to replace these eight U S  Attorneys  Did you speak personally with any of the replaced U S  Attorneys about their performance   Did you perform any systematic review of the effect on ongoing prosecutions of removing these U S  Attorneys   Since you apparently knew so little about the performance of any of the replaced U S  Attorneys  how can you possibly be confident that they were replaced based on performance deficiencies   Kyle Sampson testified that he placed names on the list or removed them based on the requests of others and he admitted that he did not know the reasons that names were put on the list   How could you possibly state with any confidence that none of them was removed for improper reasons   You didnt know the actual reasons when you approved their removal  did you If the process was not based on evidence  how can there be any other conclusion than that it was  as Mr  Iglesias said  a political hit job      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
