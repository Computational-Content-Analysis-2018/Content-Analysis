         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Public safety workers are on the front lines of our effort to keep communities in America safe    Theyre on call 24 hours a day  7 days a week  doing backbreaking  difficult work   They never blink or falter   They do their duty and they do it well                 Just last week in Everett  Massachusetts  a tanker truck hauling ten thousand tons of fuel suddenly exploded on the highway   40 cars caught fire  and it took more than 3 hours to put out the flames   But because the police  firefighters and emergency medical technicians responded so quickly  no one was killed in the accident   Words cant begin to express our gratitude   These heroic men and women have earned our thanks and our respect   And they have also earned the right to be treated with dignity        Thats why its such a privilege to join with Senator Harkin and Senator Gregg on this bipartisan Public Safety Cooperation Amendment to the Farm Bill  to guarantee that all firefighters  police officers  emergency medical personnel  and other first responders have a voice at the table in the life and death discussions and decisions about their work   It will ensure that they are treated fairly  and it will help them keep our communities safe   Its no wonder that this amendment has received such strong bipartisan support  It passed the House with 314 supporters      The amendment guarantees that every first responder will have the same basic right that most other workers in the public sector already enjoy  the right to collective bargaining   Many first responders already have this fundamental right        Every New York  City firefighter  emergency medical technician  and police officer who responded to the disaster at the World  Trade Center on 9 11 was a union member under a collective bargaining agreement   So were the 7 000 firefighters who responded to the crisis in California       They were able to respond more efficiently and effectively to the crisis  because they had a voice on the job   Many other first responders  however  are not so fortunate   29 states and the District of Columbia guarantee all public safety workers the right to collective bargaining   but 21 states still deny some or most or even all such workers this fundamental right   Their first responders dont have a voice in the policies that affect their safety and their livelihoods        Thats both illogical and unfair   We see all too often how dangerous these jobs can be   In 2005  80 000 firefighters were injured in the line of duty   76 000 law enforcement officers were assaulted or injured  and almost 300 of these public safety employees paid the ultimate price        First responders face chronic  long term health problems as well   The brave men and women who responded at Ground Zero now suffer from crippling health problems such as asthma  chronic bronchitis  back pain  carpal tunnel syndrome  depression  and post traumatic stress disorder       These men and women are profiles in courage   They walk into fires  wade into floods  and put their lives on the line to protect our homes and families   They know what they need to have to be safe on the job   They deserve the right to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives        The amendment grants these basic rights in a reasonable way that respects existing state laws   States that already grant collective bargaining to public safety workers are not affected by the bill   States that dont offer this protection can establish their own collective bargaining systems  or ask the Federal Labor Relations Authority for help   What the amendment does do is set a standard    each state has full authority to decide how it will provide these basic rights      These rights for first responders arent just important for the workers  theyre key to the safety of our communities and our nation   In this post 9 11 era  first responders have an indispensable role in homeland security   Its vital to our national interest that the essential services they provide are carried out as effectively as possible   As study after study shows  cooperation between public safety employers and employees improves the quality of services and reduces fatalities         Thats why strong  cooperative partnerships between first responders and the communities they serve are essential to public safety   As Dennis Compton  Fire Chief of the City of Phoenix  has said   When labor and management leaders work together to build mutual trust  mutual respect  and a strong commitment to service  it helps focus  a  fire department on what is truly most important providing excellent service to the customers        Our families and communities deserve the best public safety services we can possibly provide  and it starts with the strong foundation that collective bargaining makes possible      We cannot call these brave men and women heroes in a time of crisis  but turn our backs on them today   We need to act now to make these basic rights available to all of Americas first responders   Its a matter of fundamental fairness  and an urgent matter of public safety   The best way to give our heroes the respect they deserve is by supporting this amendment  and I urge them to do so           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
