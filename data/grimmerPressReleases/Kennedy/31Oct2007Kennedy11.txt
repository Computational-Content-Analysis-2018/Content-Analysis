         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today  we continue our debate on the Childrens Health Insurance Program  Yesterday  I spoke of the legislation that is before the Senate  and described the many concessions that the bipartisan coalition supporting this bill has made to broaden support for our proposal      It is important to discuss and understand the specifics of the legislation  and our debate will make sure that our colleagues will be able to sort the truth from the many fictions about this bipartisan proposal      But the core of our debate is not about this provision or that subclause  its a fundamental choice on priorities      We know what the Presidents priorities are  He is calling yet again for more money  on top of more money  on top of yet more money to pay for the war in Iraq      The President has made his judgment  Hes decided to pour even more of our national treasure into the sands of Iraq and to burden our economy with the immense costs of the war for years to come       Every day the war goes on  we spend whats needed to cover a quarter million children       Every week  we spend whats needed to cover 7 4 million children      And in just 41 days of war  we spend what is needed to cover the ten million children who would benefit from the bill before us today      Were told by the White House that we can afford 41 days in Iraq  and another 41  and another and another without end  but we cant afford to give our nations children a healthy start in life       We have a military surge to help the people of Iraq  I say we need a health care surge to help the children of America      This Administration is quick to highlight their achievements on health care for the children of Iraq  but won t show the same commitment to the health of our own children       In Iraq  American money has renovated 52 primary care clinics and re equipped 600 others  But in America  children are denied essential medical services in the name of fiscal discipline      In Iraq  our citizens have paid for 30 million doses of childrens vaccine  But in America  were told we cant afford basic preventive care for 10 million children       The web site of the US Agency for International Development proudly notes a remarkable accomplishment  and I commend them for it  They have successfully vaccinated 98 percent of all Iraqi children against measles  mumps and rubella  If only we could do as well for our own children      According to the CDC  only 91 percent of American children had received the same vaccine by the recommended age  The Administration should be as concerned that children growing up in Boston or Birmingham get their recommended vaccines as they are about the children of Baghdad and Basra      That same web site proudly notes that USAID has improved the health of vulnerable populations in Iraq by increasing access to high quality  community based primary healthcare  Thats just what were trying to do in America with this bill       In Iraq  its an accomplishment  In America  its a veto      A bipartisan majority in Congress has made a judgment  too  Our judgment is that we must make room for decent health care for Americas children  We must stand up to the empty rhetoric and hollow slogans of the White House  and give all children in America get the healthy start in life they deserve       We need to know who is for working families across America  and who will stand in their way to getting quality  affordable health care      We need to know who is for families like the Vega family in Greenfield  Massachusetts  CHIP helps Flor Vega  a working mother  buy an extra inhaler for her 5 year old daughter  so she could have one at school and the other at home  CHIP also helped her afford a nebulizer  the small  portable device that pumps the asthma medicine into the lungs when an inhaler isn t effective  That means her daughter doesnt face sudden dangerous attacks of asthma that require her to go to the emergency room      We need to know who is for families like the Lewis family in Springfield  Massachusetts  I met Dedra Lewis and her daughter Alexsiana when they came here to talk to me about the difference that CHIP has made in their lives  Alexsiana has a rare eye disease that requires expensive drops every hour of every day       To take care of her daughter  her mother had to cut back her hours at work  and she lost her insurance  Without CHIP  they would be choosing between paying the mortgage for their home or paying for medicine that Alexsiana needs to keep her vision      Family after family from coast to coast could tell similar stories  Thats why families across America are calling on Congress to renew the promise of CHIP       The task has not been easy  but we will not be deterred or deflected       When Medicare was first proposed in the 1960s to allow the nations senior citizens to live their retirement years in dignity  its supporters were attacked with much the same harsh rhetoric as we hear now about CHIP  its Socialized medicine  Its a Government takeover  But Congress rejected that absurd rhetoric  and hundreds of millions of senior citizens have benefited immensely ever since       American families face real challenges  higher mortgages  soaring gas prices  the ever increasing cost of health care  and many other burdens       They deserve real solutions  but the White House offers only hollow slogans       Our opponents failed to stop Medicare  and they wont stop CHIP now  Medicare didnt pass on the first attempt  but its supporters came back again and again and again with the force of the American people behind them to ask  to demand  that Congress act  And the 1964 election made it happen      And thats just what well do with CHIP  even if it takes the 2008 election to do it      Well keep at it until the children of America get the health care that they deserve and that the American people are demanding
