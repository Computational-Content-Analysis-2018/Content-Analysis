         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Im deeply concerned about the escalating and destabilizing violence in Iraq  The situation on the ground is increasingly violent and our troops have been placed in the increasingly untenable position of trying to stabilize a country at war with itself  For the safety of our men and women in uniform and our national security  we cannot accept the status quo  We must begin to address the realities of the situation on the ground honestly and straight forwardly  A dramatic change in policy is precisely what we need and what the American people are asking for  Our brave men and women in uniform have served with honor and valor  They have done everything that weve asked them to do militarily  They removed Saddam from power and he has now been found guilty in a court of law  Iraq has had free and open elections  The people have voted on a constitution and the elected leaders have formed a new Iraqi government  But all that is falling apart  Our current policy is not succeeding in preventing Iraq from sliding into full scale civil war  According to the 16 agencies of the intelligence community  Iraq has become a cause celebre for terrorists around the world  The open ended commitment of our troops makes the Iraqis overly reliant on the United States and harder for them to make essential political compromises necessary to end the violence  Our presence contributes to the violence and is a recruiting tool for extremists and terrorists not only in Iraq itself  but throughout the Middle East The violence in Iraq continues unabated  Nearly 3 000 Americans have been killed and more than 21 000 wounded  In October alone  106 American soldiers were killed in Iraq  The United Nations reports that more than 6500 Iraqis were killed in July and August  an increase of 1000 over the number killed in the previous two months  The New York Times reported on August 17 that a classified report by the Defense Intelligence Agency  details worsening security conditions inside the country and describes how Iraq risks sliding toward civil war The Pentagons September 1 report Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq clearly states that sustained sectarian violence is the greatest threat to security and stability in Iraq  Death squads are active and militias and small  illegally armed groups operate openly and often with popular support  The Washington Post reported on September 11 that the top intelligence officer for the Marine Corps in Iraq  Colonel Pete Devlin reports that there are no functioning Iraqi government institutions in Anbar  leaving a vacuum that has been filled by the insurgent group al Qaeda in Iraq  which has become the provinces most significant political force  An October 18 U S  Central Command briefing reportedly portrays Iraq as edging even closer to chaos  Just yesterday  a massive kidnapping was carried out by gunmen wearing police uniforms at the Higher Education Ministry  Although many have reportedly been released today  violence has become the norm   Clearly  our efforts to end the violence arent working  As  the American people made clear last week  they are demanding a change of course in Iraq  They deserve a full and open debate about whether there really is a military solution to the political problems of the government in Iraq  I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about a new strategy that will enable our troops to begin to come home       Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
