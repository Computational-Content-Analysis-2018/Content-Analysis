         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C  Today  U S  Senators Patty Murray  D WA   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Barack Obama  D IL   and Byron Dorgan  D ND   sent a letter to the Department of Education s Inspector General s Office asking for a complete accounting of the overpayments received by lenders as part of the 9 5 percent Special Allowance Rate program  According to information contained in an Inspector General s report in 2006 http   www ed gov about offices list oig auditreports a07f0017 pdf   and in the Washington Post on October 20th http   www washingtonpost com wp dyn content article 2007 10 19 AR2007101902607_pf html the federal government may have overpaid lenders by hundreds of millions of dollars from 2003 to 2006  Senators Barbara Mikulski  D MD  and Hillary Clinton  D NY  also signed the letter      The 9 5 percent Special Allowance Payment rate began in the 1980s as a way to increase student access to low cost loans at a time of high interest rates  However  when interest rates fell  the program survived and became beneficial to many lenders since the guaranteed subsidy rate remained at 9 5 percent  At the same time  several lenders received improper payments under this program for loans which were not actually eligible for the 9 5 percent subsidy  This resulted in the overpayment of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars from the Department of Education to these lenders      In the letter  the Senators ask the Inspector General to conduct a careful investigation of the total amount of taxpayer dollars spent on overpayments     We believe that the total amount of improper payments is a knowable number  and that taxpayers deserve to know the total amount of these payments  the Senators wrote  Taxpayers also deserve information on which lenders were involved  what methods they used to claim these subsidies unfairly  and why the Department allowed the inappropriate subsidies to be paid  We request that you conduct a careful investigation of these issues     At a time when millions of students and families are struggling to meet the high cost of college  we owe them a full  fair  and transparent accounting of any possible waste or fraud in the student loan programs     The full text of the letter follows         October 31  2007      The Honorable John P  Higgins  Jr   Inspector General  U S  Department of Education  400 Maryland   Avenue  S W   Washington   D C  20202    Dear Inspector General Higgins      We are writing to request that your office undertake an investigation to determine the full amount of improper special allowance payments made by the Department of Education to student loan lenders through the 9 5 percent loan subsidy      We greatly appreciate your previous investigations on this issue  which  among other findings  revealed that the Department made  278 million in improper 9 5 percent special allowance payments to Nelnet  As you know  however  dozens of lenders have received 9 5 percent special allowance payments during the 27 year history of the subsidy  so it is likely that the sum total of improper payments is much higher  According to an analysis of Department data by the Washington Post  between 2003 and 2006 alone  as much as  300 million may have been improperly paid to other lenders who received 9 5 percent special allowance payments      As early as 2005  Members of Congress had asked the Department to conduct an audit of all lenders that increased the volume of loans claimed as entitled to the 9 5 percent guaranteed rate of return  The Secretary of Education recently stated that her office does not plan to conduct such an audit  and expressed doubt that the total amount of overpayments is even a knowable number  We believe that the total amount of improper payments is a knowable number  and that taxpayers deserve to know the total amount of these payments  Taxpayers also deserve information on which lenders were involved  what methods they used to claim these subsidies unfairly  and why the Department allowed the inappropriate subsidies to be paid  We request that you conduct a careful investigation of these issues      Since the 9 5 percent loan scandal first emerged  Congress has acted to limit the inappropriate growth of these loans through recycling  and the Department has prohibited lenders from receiving inflated 9 5 percent special allowance payments in the future  These steps will help curtail future abuses  but the public deserves full knowledge of the funds that were misspent in the past  Your thorough investigation of this issue will help us determine the extent to which Congress needs to oversee the Departments administration of the federal student loan programs more closely  and inform future debate on the Federal Family Education Loan Program      At a time when millions of students and families are struggling to meet the high cost of college  we owe them a full  fair  and transparent accounting of any possible waste or fraud in the student loan programs  We welcome the opportunity to work with you     With respect and appreciation         Sincerely
