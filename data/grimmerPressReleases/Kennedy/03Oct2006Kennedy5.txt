         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Washington  D C     A National Labor Relations Board decision today significantly expands the number of employees classified as supervisors under the National Labor Relations Act  In practical terms  the decision means that millions of working men and women across the country will no longer have the right to join a union or qualify for other protections under the Act  and will therefore be much more vulnerable to discrimination or unfair loss of their jobs    Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement condemning the Boards decision   At a time when working families are struggling hard to make ends meet and obviously are not receiving their fair share of the nations economic growth  the NLRB is rubbing salt in the wound  Instead of protecting the rights of employees  the Board is cutting them loose and denying them of their long standing rights in the workplace  Its an unfair decision  and if its not revised on appeal  Congress should step in and restore these important protections      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
