students  parents and teachers at the Springfield High School of Science and Technology to announce a  16 5 million federal grant  Springfield and Chicopee were selected by the U S  Department of Education as the first in the nation recipients of a federal grant to address adolescent literacy  Reading skills are essential for success in the early grades  in high school  in college  and in the workplace  said Senator Kennedy  As adults  reading enables each and every one of us to participate as active citizens in our democracy  This grant will be used to improve literacy  close the achievement gap and make sure that students complete high school  The grant is awarded to the Springfield and Chicopee public schools  Striving Readers Program under the United States Department of Education  It will serve over 7 000 students in Springfield and Chicopee high schools  grades 9 11  It will also train over 500 teachers and 10 literacy coaches by the end of the grant period This

Roger L  Putnam Vocational Technical High School Remarks of Senator Edward M  Kennedy Striving Readers Grant Announcement with Secretary Spellings Springfield  Massachusetts March 3  2006  As prepared for delivery  Science and technology are key fields for the future of our Commonwealth  We know that the formula for success in your school is in reaching each individual student  one by one  Your approach to teaching in small learning communities and career academies has made all the difference to students in Springfield Both Secretary Spellings and I are honored to be here today to congratulate you  Superintendent Burke  and Superintendent Rege for your dedication to helping all students in your schools reach high standards  Together  with Mayors Ryan and Bissonnette and your School Committees  you ve targeted your policies  practices  and resources to make a difference for students who need the most help  We re very proud of all that you ve been able to achieve and we commend you for your dedication to continuing that hard work Much has been written about the challenges of teaching students to read  We ve focused national attention on the problem  because it s one of the most important keys to unlocking the world of knowledge and opportunity for each student  It s essential for success in the early grades  in high school  in college  and in the workplace  As adults  reading enables each and every one of us to participate as active citizens in our democracy Reading begins early  and we each have an important role to play  Children develop their early literacy skills at home and in child care and in preschool  even before they reach kindergarten  In the best environments  young children awaken to the letters of the alphabet much earlier  and we need to see that each and every one of them has that opportunity Reading development continues in the elementary grades  where we ve focused most of our national policy  We ve taken steps to improve professional development for teachers  and to support high quality reading instruction and interventions so that students learn to read by the end of third grade  We ve also learned a great deal about the challenges facing students in later grades  It s clear students get too little support in building the vocabulary and comprehension skills they need for success in middle school and high school  Research tells us that s the point at which reading begins to matter most  since the textbooks and other materials that students use become more complex    not just in English courses  but in subjects like science and history  too A study released this week by ACT revealed that only half the nation s students are ready for college level reading once they graduate from high school  Six million children in middle and high schools are reading below grade level  3 000 students drop out of high school each day  and one of the principal reasons is that they don t have the reading skills to keep up with their courses  They don t get enough help to acquire those skills  because reading is taught less often than in the early grades  If we don t solve this crisis soon  we ll pay a higher and higher price in the future  The shortage of basic literacy skills imposes a heavy burden on business  universities  and unprepared high school graduates  and costs as much as  16 billion a year in remedial training and reduced productivity  We need to create a safety net that enables high school students to stay in school  reach high standards  and earn their diploma  Better reading skills can help students connect with the challenging and rewarding subjects they re learning in high school  But first we have to identify the students who have fallen behind and target interventions to help them catch up and succeed Three years ago  I joined my colleagues in the Senate in introducing the Pathways for All Students to Succeed Act to improve reading and writing skills in middle school and high school  provide literacy coaches  and support students needing attention and help  The goal is to ensure that all students are proficient readers by the time they graduate from high school  I know it s a goal that Secretary Spellings shares  It s at the heart of her Striving Readers program  Springfield and Chicopee have a strong commitment to this goal  and schools across Greater Springfield are ready to meet the challenge  I m proud to join Secretary Spellings today in announcing a federal grant of  16 7 million from the Department of Education to help them carry out this important work The grant will support a 5 year plan for reading interventions to high school students that need help the most  It will train teachers in reading strategies in all subjects and it will bring reading to the forefront of the high school curriculum  The grant will make a vast difference in the lives of over 7 000 students in Western Massachusetts Because of the strong commitment by Superintendent Burke and Superintendent Rege  Springfield and Chicopee will be pioneers in developing and implementing these reading strategies  Only 7 other communities across the country are doing this  We re very proud of this special achievement and we thank you for all you ve done so well  Keep up the great work  I know we ll be proud of our Greater Springfield schools in the years ahead and the bright future you re building for the Commonwealth It s a privilege to welcome Margaret Spellings  our Secretary of Education  to Springfield  Margaret has an outstanding record as a champion of public education  and it s been a privilege to work with her over the past 6 years  As Secretary  her dedication to excellence in education and her sensible approach to policy have been a tremendous help to us all  We re delighted that she s come to Massachusetts  and honored that she could join us today  Welcome  Madame Secretary   Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  202  224 2633
