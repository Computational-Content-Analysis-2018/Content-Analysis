         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Dr  Gates  I join those in thanking you for your public service  your willingness to come back in and deal with this challenge that we re facing now on national security  defense  and primarily the issue of Iraq  And I m grateful for the time that we had talking in my office  To pick up on a sentiment that Senator McCain expressed  we have lost 60 soldiers in my state of Massachusetts  I ve talked with just about every one of their families  And they re really interested in hearing from you about whether you re going to be an independent figure that s really going to fight for the best in terms of our security as we find our security today We know  since you have been nominated now    59 Americans have been killed just in the 27 days since you ve been nominated In the 27 days just prior to that  92 Americans were killed  And in the 27 days prior to that  81 Americans were killed We don t know in the 27 days prior to the first of the year     how many more Americans will be killed And the people  the families  in my state want to know whether you re going to be that figure that Senator Warner talked about  that fearless champion of the service men and women that is going to be consistent with our national security These families know they were undermanned when they went into Iraq and they were under armored when they went into Iraq  And they know that the military has served in Iraq longer than they have in World War II    longer than World War II  They ve done everything that they ve been asked to do  and they ve done it brilliantly  with extraordinary courage and valor And the families want to make sure that we re going to have a policy that is worthy of their valor and their bravery  And they re looking at you  And that s what they want  for you to make that recommendation  and that you ll be fearless in your battle  you ll be a stand up person and demonstrate the kind of courage which is going to be so necessary to do  Could you just let them know that you re that person ready to do it for our national security and for them I also want to give you one more chance to respond to the statements about what good would your new eyes do when we have had the Commander in Chief  who  as has been mentioned  has said in the last month  We ve got a strategy for victory that will work  I truly believe the only way we won t win is if we leave before the job is done  There s one thing I m not going to do  I m not going to pull the troops off the battlefield before the mission is complete  We re going to stay in Iraq to get the job done so long as the government wants us there  And  This business about a graceful exit just simply has no realism to it all Now  in short  should we believe you or the president on the critical issue whether the administration is really willing to make a change in its policy    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
