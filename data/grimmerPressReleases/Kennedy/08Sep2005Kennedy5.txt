         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633    First  I commend our Chairman for his extraordinary work on this bill  Many said it couldn t be done  But our Chairman s motto is  Those who say it can t be done should get out of the way of those who are doing it  The bill is a worthwhile compromise between many divergent positions  and I commend him and the staff on both sides of the aisle for getting us to this point    It s difficult for any of us to focus on anything but the disaster that our fellow Americans are struggling with in the Gulf States  Our committee will do all we can to get continuing relief to these citizens as they rebuild their lives and communities  I know that Senator Sessions is dealing with this tragedy in his own state and he has seen the devastation first hand  While our hearts and prayers are with those have lost so much during this tragic time  the committee is right to proceed with this important education bill    In today s global economy  a college degree is more valuable than ever  Students and workers must have the skills they need to succeed  When I graduated from high school  good jobs were available to high school graduates  but that s not the case today  Most new jobs require some post secondary education  Now and in the future  more and more jobs    particularly jobs that can reasonably support a family    will require men and women to have a college degree or certificate  and the best jobs will often require advanced degrees    Higher education is not only important to an individual s economic livelihood  It is also important to America as a whole  To remain a leader in technology in this new global economy of the 21st century  we depend heavily on an educated and highly skilled workforce  Yet evidence suggests we are lagging behind other countries of the world  In the past decade  college access in America actually went down  while it was going up in 16 other advanced nations  according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development     In the highly skilled fields of math  science  engineering  and technology  the U S  is showing measurable declines in innovation  Countries throughout the world are out distancing us in patents  scientific articles  and scientists and engineers  By 2010  more than 90 percent of all scientists and engineers in the world will be living in Asia     America needs at least to keep pace with    and preferably stay ahead in    the global march of progress in technology  When we allow other countries to do a better job of educating their students    particularly in the areas of math and science    we risk not only our competitive edge  but also our national security  America  more than ever  needs students who will obtain college degrees     But today  too many families are struggling to get their children the education they need  They re struggling to pay for college  yet they find the doors of college often barred by the dollar sign  Public tuition is up 35 percent over the last four years     Each year  according to the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance  400 000 students ready for college will not be able to attend a 4 year college  because they can t afford it  New data from the Business Higher Education Forum shows that the poorest students face an average unmet financial need of nearly  6 000    Many who do find a way to go to college are borrowing more heavily than ever  In 1990  only 16 percent of students took out a college loan  Today  it s 52 percent  Thirty years ago  the typical student aid package was 60 percent grants and 40 percent loans  Today  it s the reverse    40 percent grants and 60 percent loans  The average undergraduate now has  17 000 in college debt     Families across the country are dedicating larger and larger portions of their income to send their children to college  In Massachusetts  after taking the average financial aid package into consideration  a family making the average salary must contribute 31  of its income to cover the costs of sending one child to college for just one year  In some states  the percentage is even higher  Congress can do more to ease the squeeze  and this bill is an important step in the right direction  It provides  5 5 billion over the next 5 years for additional grant aid to the students who need it the most  One billion dollars of those funds are dedicated to encouraging low income young people to study math  science  technology and engineering  It also expands aid through the current Pell program by allowing students to study year round     It improves the existing student loan programs by making important changes to create real competition between the various programs and keep the cost of loans affordable     It also strengthens support for graduate studies by adding a new Patsy Mink Fellowship Program to increase the participation of women and minorities on college faculties  It expands grants to areas of national shortage  including in nursing faculty  It increases the loan limits for graduate students  and makes them eligible for PLUS loans so that they can be less dependent on private loans    It expands the simplified needs test    so that more students with family incomes below  20 000 will receive their financial aid package in time to make good decisions about attending college  It also requires the Secretary to develop a simplified financial aid application and make it easier for low income students to apply for aid     It strengthens programs to prepare students to go to college and stay in college  such as GEAR UP and TRIO  Funding for the federal matching program for need based student aid will continue as well  We extend and improve minority programs  such as the Hispanic Serving Institution Program  the Tribal College Program and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Program  and a new program is added to support colleges serving large numbers of Native American students     As a nation  we have made progress in getting qualified young people to college  but we still have much to do to keep them enrolled and earn a degree  The bill addresses this retention issue by including programs to help students succeed in college     We also continue our focus on teacher preparation by strengthening partnerships with the elementary and secondary schools that hire the teachers  and by giving priority to reducing the teacher shortage in subjects such as special education and math and science    As the bill recognizes  to help the nation compete in today s global economy  we must strengthen the teaching of math and science in schools and colleges  It s shameful that America now ranks only 29th in the industrial world in math education  and that we ve fallen from 3rd to 15th in producing scientists and engineers     The bill offers strong incentives for math and science graduates to teach for at least 5 years in schools that need them most  It also contains incentives for college students to pursue careers in science  technology and engineering  and it authorizes a new scholarship program for that purpose     It s urgent for a larger proportion of our population to participate in college education  We looked at ways to expand access to working adults through modular and compressed coursework  and to enable students with disabilities to benefit by taking courses rather than taking standardized tests     Finally  there are several issues I hope we can continue to work on  I m disappointed that we have not completely eliminated the 9 5  loan subsidies  We succeeded in extending the Taxpayer Teacher Protection Act  which ends much of the abuse  But it doesn t close the loophole completely  Senator Murray and I have proposed to close the loophole completely by ending the current practice that enables lenders to recycle old loans and offer new loans that still receive the 9 5  subsidy     Our proposal would have gone further  by adopting a pre payment incentive to help rein in the existing 9 5  loans and redirect these savings to increased student aid     We also need to make the admissions process fairer for disadvantaged students  especially at elite institutions  We should increase access to test prep courses for low income students  and require the disaggregated reporting of admissions and graduation information  including legacy and early decision admissions  We took a positive step in the bill by requiring reports of admissions and graduation rates by race  gender  and low income status    We help disadvantaged students by increasing need based student aid and expanding support programs to prepare for college and succeed in college  But there is more to be done so that all students    regardless of their background    have equal educational opportunities for college     I look forward to working with the committee on ways to address all these issues as the bill moves to the floor  From our earliest days as a nation  education has been the engine of the American dream  and we can t let it stall now  Our goal is to give all students and their parents the support they need to benefit from the best education possible  and keep our country strong in the years ahead   Laura Capps
