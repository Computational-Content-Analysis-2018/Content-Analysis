         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today  the United States Department of Agriculture accepted the request on behalf of the Massachusetts delegation to provide assistance to aquaculturists in the Commonwealth  The original letter sent to USDA last week is attached Kennedy said  This is great news for Massachusetts aquaculturists and their families  This assistance from the Department of Agriculture will enable the industry to rebuild after the red tide disaster  I hope that FEMA follows suit and provides much needed assistance to the state and our shellfishermen Senator Kerry said  I am pleased the Department of Agriculture has approved our request for badly needed assistance for shellfish growers at a time when hard working men and women need as much help as possible  In the coming days  we hope to get as much economic relief as possible to our shellfishermen and shellfish growers Congressman Delahunt said  This is terrific news  With a little more help from Mother Nature  and continued pressure for a FEMA disaster declaration  let s hope to get through this crisis without too much more hardship Congressman Stephen F  Lynch said  This is good news for Massachusetts aquaculturists and their families  I am hopeful that the Department of Agriculture s recognition of the severity of the situation facing our fishing industry will encourage FEMA to overturn its ruling and deliver on the much needed relief for these hard working men and women Congressman Frank said  I m very appreciative that the Secretary of Agriculture has cut through the bureaucratic red tape and done the right thing    June 21  2005The Honorable Mike Johanns Secretary of Agriculture United States Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Avenue  SW Washington  D C  20250Dear Secretary Johanns Under the provisions of the Emergency Programs for Disaster Assistance Act  we are writing to urge you to make emergency financial assistance available to aquaculturists and fish farmers in Barnstable  Bristol  Dukes  Essex  Nantucket  Norfolk  Plymouth  and Suffolk counties in Massachusetts  As a result of the current massive outbreak of red tide  these coastal counties have been hurt by the worst red tide disaster in Massachusetts in over thirty years  The outbreak has shut down the shellfish industry  and there are few signs of improvement  If the red tide continues for eight to ten weeks during the busy season  which is by all accounts realistic  then these fishermen will lose almost half of their entire income for the year The red tide results from an unusually severe combination of environmental conditions that caused toxic algae to cover entire coastal areas  The tide has shut down over 1 700 commercial shell fisherman and 250 shellfish aquaculturists The Governor of Massachusetts has declared the crisis is of such severity that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and local governments  and has implemented the State Emergency Operations Plan  We have requested FEMA to declare a major disaster in the counties listed above Last week  the Administrator of the Small Business Administration and the Secretary of Commerce declared that the affected Massachusetts counties are disaster areas  However  aquaculturists are not eligible for Small Business Administration disaster loans  and instead must seek your assistance under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance program  We appreciate your prompt attention to this important issue of vital importance to the hard working men and women of the aquaculture industry  and we look forward to hearing from you With respect and appreciation Sincerely   Melissa Wagoner 202 224 2633
