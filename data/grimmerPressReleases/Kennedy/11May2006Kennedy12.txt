         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     This nomination is a triumph of cronyism over credentials for a seat on the second most important federal court in the nation  The D C  Circuit is located here in the nation s capital because its decisions have national reach  It handles more cases of national significance than any other Circuit Court  and has exclusive or shared jurisdiction over many issues vital to the lives of millions of Americans    from conditions in the workplace to the quality of the environment  from civil rights to consumer rights    cases that go to the heart of the relationship between citizens and government    The D C  Circuit has sometimes been a stepping stone to the Supreme Court  when Presidents recognized the court s importance and picked candidates with the highest credentials and experience     But in this case  the nominee has thin credentials and minimal relevant experience  He is here today because he was there whenever the republicans needed him    whether to defend the excesses of the Starr investigations  to man the battle stations in the Florida recounts  or to select and support ideological judicial nominees for the current President     Like all federal judges  appointees to this court serve for life    we have one chance to get it right when we confirm them  The nation s founders expected us to get it right before we give our consent  and that the President s nominees would be equal to the challenges of the job    But today  this Committee is being asked to rubber stamp a nominee who does not meet this standard  It is plain that the main reason Mr  Kavanaugh has been nominated is that he served the Republican Party and this President loyally over the past decade  Unlike the Circuit judges who introduced Mr  Kavanaugh  who had been lower court judges before they were named to Circuit Courts  he has no prior judicial experience on which we can base our assessment of his judicial qualifications  His meager litigation experience hardly qualifies him for any court  let alone this vital court     In his long delayed answers to my written questions in 2004  he could not point to any significant legal experience in the kinds of cases the D C  Circuit deals with  labor law  the Endangered Species Act  the Clean Air Act  the Safe Water Drinking Act  or any aspect of environmental law    Unlike almost all of the judges now on the D C  Circuit    at least the ones appointed before 2001    he does not come to us with the American Bar Association s highest rating of well qualified  Make no mistake  as the ABA s statement to the Committee makes very clear  there s a big difference  The ABA s highest rating goes to nominees who are at the top of the legal profession   have outstanding legal ability  breadth of experience  and the highest reputation for integrity  and  demonstrate or exhibit the capacity for judicial temperament  In contrast  Mr  Kavanaugh s qualified rating reflects the ABA s belief only that the nominee will be able to perform satisfactorily  Clearly that does not mean he is completely unqualified  just that he is not at the top     Is it important who sits on the D C  Circuit  It is if you are a working person whose rights are determined by the National Labor Relations Board  The DC Circuit hears far more petitions for review of decisions of the National Labor Relations Board than any other circuit  Many of these cases are filed by employers all over the country attempting to overturn unfair labor practice findings against them by the Board     In 2004  the last year for which statistics are available  one in four NLRB cases was heard by the D C  Circuit  16 out of 62 total cases   For the preceding five year period  the Circuit heard nearly one in three NLRB cases  143 out of 451   Its jurisdiction is especially significant for workers throughout the country because the D C  Circuit decisions in such cases can have impact everywhere  Workers everywhere deserve to know that the judges on this court are the best and the most experienced and the fairest the nation can offer    But this nominee does not have any experience with labor cases or any other experience that demonstrates his capacity to deal sensitively  knowledgably and fairly with such cases    The D C  Circuit also matters to everyone who breathes the nation s air or drinks its water  It s the only federal appellate court that can grant a remedy when the Executive Branch fails to follow Congress  mandates to protect the environment under the Clean Air Act  the Safe Drinking Water Act  and other environmental laws     Last month  the Circuit overturned a decision by the EPA  allowing more sewage to flow into the nation s rivers despite Congress s plain language to the contrary in the Clean Water Act    In a recent air pollution case  the Circuit struck down a key initiative of the secret Cheney Energy Industry Task Force implemented by the EPA    But there is nothing in the nominee s record that shows he would be willing to keep the executive branch in compliance with the law in these important cases     For decades  in cases like these  the D C  Circuit has expanded public access to administrative proceedings and protected the interests of the public against big business  It enabled more plaintiffs to challenge agency decisions  It held that a religious group    as members of the listening public    could oppose the license renewal of a television station accused of racial and religious discrimination  It held that an organization of welfare recipients was entitled to intervene in proceedings before a federal agency  These decisions empowered individuals and organizations to shine a brighter light on government agencies  No longer were these agencies able to ignore the interests of those they were created to protect     But in more recent years  there have been ominous signs  In some key cases  the D C  Circuit has begun limiting access to the courts and denying the rights of workers  It held that a labor union could not challenge the denial of benefits to its members    a decision later overturned by the Supreme Court  It held that environmental groups are not qualified to seek review of federal standards under the Clean Air Act  If this trend continues  the court  which was so essential for effective implementation of important laws and principles will instead create precedents on labor rights  civil rights  and the environment that will set back these basic principles for years to come  That s the cynical Republican strategy  and we can t let it happen     It s therefore essential to guarantee that judges appointed to this important court are of the highest quality and do not owe their loyalty to a Party or a president   and will not use the bench to advance an ideological agenda    To preserve its vital role in protecting America s citizens  and its ability to confront the Executive Branch when it fails to follow the law  the D C  Circuit needs judges who are independent of the Executive  who can stand up even to the President who appointed them  who are so well qualified that there is no doubt that they will fulfill their constitutional obligation to maintain the balance of powers among the branches of government  rather than rule in constant loyalty to the President and the party that allowed them to reach a position they did not deserve     The President can do better than this  The White House vetting operation  on which the nominee served  can certainly do better than this  And this Committee and the Senate can insist that the White House to do better than this  If we are true to our constitutional obligation  that is exactly what we must do  This nomination is an insult to the D C  Circuit  and it doesn t deserve to be approved by the Senate   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
