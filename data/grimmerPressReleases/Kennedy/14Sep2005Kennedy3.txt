         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633    Washington  DC  Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement in response to the report in the Washington Post that President Bush was considering waiving the McNamara O Hara Service Contract Act on federal contracts related to Hurricane Katrina  The Service Contract Act ensures that workers under federal contracts earn the local prevailing wage  The protection  which is similar to Davis Bacon  covers a broad range of workers under service contracts  including many lower wage workers  It does not include a provision allowing its suspension for natural disasters  Last Thursday  President Bush suspended Davis Bacon for contracts related to Katrina  ending prevailing wage protection for thousands of construction workers in the region  Below is Senator Kennedy s statement    After all that they have lost  the last thing that the survivors of Katrina need is a loss in their hard earned wages as they work to rebuild the communities of the Gulf Coast  Yet  last week the President made the harmful determination that construction workers there no longer deserve a fair day s wage under federal contracts  Now he is aiming to slash the pay of thousands of service workers who will also be participating in the clean up and rebuilding  It would be a tragic mistake to take political advantage of this national disaster by denying fair pay for the thousands of men and women in the region  How can the President be so lacking in compassion as to kick the victims of Katrina when they are down     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
