         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on President Bush s speech on Iraq    All Americans hope Thursday s elections for a permanent Iraqi government will be peaceful and that a legitimate government that is capable of unifying the country and preventing it from becoming a terrorist haven will be elected  There is no disagreement with the President on this fundamental point    The President talked a great length about milestones    the transfer of sovereignty  the interim government  and the drafting of a constitution  But the most important milestone for our troops    and the one that has remained elusive for far too long    is the ending of the insurgency  Unfortunately  for our men and women in uniform  the President s insistence that the United States stay the course in Iraq has inflamed the insurgency  rather than undermine it  and put our troops in ever greater danger    The election of a permanent Iraqi government must signal an important turning point in the relationship between America and Iraq  An open ended commitment of America s military forces does not serve America s interest and it does not serve Iraq s interest either  2006 must be a year of significant transition  Once a permanent Iraqi government has been elected  the process of redeploying American troops should begin  Our overwhelming military presence has inflamed the insurgency  and a substantial and continuing reduction of America s military presence throughout 2006 is in order  If America wants a new Iraqi government to succeed  we need to let Iraqis take responsibility for their own future     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
