         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Thank you all for being here today for this hearing on one of the most pressing and personal issues our nation will face over the next decade     the crisis of meeting the needs of seniors and persons with disabilities in ways that promote independence and choice  and help families   A fair and civilized society is judged on how it treats its most vulnerable citizens  Today in America  millions of senior citizens and persons with disabilities still struggle to obtain the support they need to live fulfilling and productive lives in their communities   Many of them are members of the Greatest Generation  and its shameful that we are failing to provide them with a solution for long term care worthy of their immense contributions to our history   Many are citizens who worked hard for themselves  their families and their communities  and became disabled as a result of an illness or injury that was not anticipated  Many are young adults who have spent over 20 years in our educational system to become participating members of their community  but they still need support to make that transition successful  The issue is about all of us  and those of you here today are the proof that disabled does not mean unable We made progress in past decades through Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  and the Americans with Disabilities Act  But countless senior citizens and persons with disabilities still live in poverty with few choices on how they live their lives  That was never the intent of the public assistance programs Ten million adults in America currently need long term services and support  Many are capable  and are eager to live full lives in their communities  but they are forced to give up their independence and self sufficiency in order to qualify for Medicaid    the only program that can support them because they are too young for Medicare and the barriers to private insurance are too high and too costly Our current system forces people into institutions prematurely  It requires them to become impoverished before becoming eligible for the help they need  It fails to provide realistic opportunities for personal life planning  and fails to give families the flexibility to help their family members in need Senator Harkin and I have two pieces of legislation that TOGETHER can both improve the current Medicaid system by allowing more individual choice AND create a new voluntary national insurance program that will promote independence  choice  personal responsibility  and quality services for those who need it   It will empower consumers to decide themselves how this assistance will be spent  for transportation so they can stay employed  for a ramp to make their home more accessible  or for a personal care attendant or a family caregiver  It will help keep families together  instead of being torn apart by obstacles that discourage them from staying at home   It will save on the mushrooming costs of Medicaid  the nations primary insurer of long term care services  by offering an alternative for those who can work while preserving Medicaid for those who really need it  We need a new approach to restore independence and choice for millions of our citizens  and enable them to take greater control of their lives  Your testimony here today will give us a deeper understanding of the challenge  and inform us about what steps we must take as a nation to meet it  Its time to respect the rights and dignity of all Americans  and I thank you all for being here today to continue that fight      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
