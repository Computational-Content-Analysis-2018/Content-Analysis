         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  REID     We re sorry that we re starting a little bit late  but the House has some votes going  and so Leader Pelosi will be here and Congresswoman Solis real soon     I m reminded of the story I learned as a little boy  When the kid was watching the sheep and he was supposed to yell  Wolf  when the wolf was coming  And he yelled  Wolf  as we know    Wolf  Wolf  and there was never any wolf  And finally when a wolf showed up  no one came     And no matter how hard we try to be bipartisan here in Washington  with President Bush it s the proverbial cry for wolf     As I said leaving the chamber last night  whatever he says  it s just the opposite     And we re here today to talk about health care  But the cry of wolf is once again ringing in my ears because he keeps talking about how he wants to improve health care and we re now five years into this and there s been no improvement     In fact  I hope the president mentions when he s in Tennessee today that there s almost a million uninsured in Tennessee    almost a million in Tennessee alone  46 million throughout the country  It s increased 5 million uninsured during his tenure in office  a million a year     So his health savings accounts are classic Bush doublespeak  It s Orwellian  They won t save Americans money  They won t make America healthier  President Bush wasn t credible when he talked about health care last night     Premiums have increased during his five years by 70 percent  Is it any wonder that G M  and Ford are laying of tens of thousands of people     And then  of course  we have people doing everything  including begging  as a result of the complicated program that he has developed in Medicare  and he didn t even mention it last night    didn t mention the word Medicare     But ignoring the problem won t make it go away  We need to fix Medicare  do it now  We have a plan to allow seniors to get their drugs  We want to reimburse states and pharmacies bearing the burden of these failures     There s no question that together we can do much better     We re going to hear now from Senator Kennedy  who has been a health care advocate for decades in Washington  We look to him for leadership yesterday and today  and in the future we will REID     Senator Kennedy  And then we ll hear from Senator Stabenow      APPLAUSE KENNEDY     First of all  I want to thank our leader  Senator Reid  for giving life and purpose to the concerns of so many families  And that is decent quality health care as a matter of right for Americans  And he s been a champion of that cause for many  many years  And we thank him for bringing us all together     I want to thank the representatives of the health community  particularly the nurses  for their joining with us today      APPLAUSE     All elements of the health care community are important  Our hospitals are important  Our professionals are important  But there s no one that s closer to the patients and no one understands the kind of challenge and the crisis that health care is facing in this nation like the nurses     And when Senator Reid called the nurses and said  We re getting together here  they asked  How can we help  How can we be a part of the team  How can we change our health care system in America  And we re proud that they re here     And we thank Debbie Stabenow  Hilda Solis and others for joining us with     For five years  this president has effectively been silent on health care  Every single day  2 000 more Americans lose their health insurance  And what is the answer  The answer is more privatization by the president of the United States     Well  Mr  President  we saw that when you tried to privatize Social Security  It didn t work in Social Security  and it isn t going to work here     We saw it when you tried to privatize the Medicare prescription drug program  Come to Massachusetts with me  Forty five different programs that are up there  Our senior citizens are confused  They re wondering why  for example  if they sign up for a program in the morning  that they in the afternoon can find higher premiums  higher deductibles and a formulary change     Why is it so  Mr  President  What was wrong with building on the existing Medicare system  which has been tried and true and works     The proposal of the president in health care is a gimmick  and the American people are tired of gimmicks KENNEDY     Their record on health care has been a fiasco  And the American people deserve better     Many of us believe in expanding the Medicare system to cover all Americans  We are serious about dealing with our health care crisis  and we re going to fight for a good program in this Congress  under our leader  Senator Reid STABENOW     Good morning  It s my pleasure to be standing here with our leadership  once again speaking out about what the people in our country care deeply about     And I  too  want to thank the nurses that who are here  My mother was a nurse for 42 years  is now retired  I grew up around hospitals and health care and have seen all my life how critical it is that people have the dignity and respect and the ability to get the care that they need for themselves and their families     There s something wrong with a picture where  in the United States of America  we spend twice as much on health care as any other country and yet have 45 million people with no health insurance     The president said nothing last night that will fundamentally address what is going on     I was deeply disappointed that the president did not address what s happening for our American manufacturers and American workers  where health care is one of the top reasons they are finding they cannot compete internationally in terms of cost     We need to hear bold action from this president to help us keep American manufacturers and American jobs here in America     And I was stunned that last night the president never mentioned the Medicare prescription drug disaster  Today  February 1st  starts the second month of the program  There are millions of people who are still trying to figure out what plan will work for them  if any  and whether or not  as low income seniors  seniors in nursing homes  people with disabilities  they re going to be able to get the medicine they re traditionally been receiving prior to a month ago     We started out the year with pharmacists being told that they should go ahead and give people a 30 day emergency supply  of their medicine while the bureaucracy was being worked out  the plans were being worked out  And now it s February 1  This is month two  What s going to happen this month to people     The president didn t say anything about what was going to happen today to the millions of Americans who are counting on us for life  saving medicine     We can do better than what the president proposed in his speech on health care  And the American people are counting on us to do better than this Medicare prescription drug plan     What I heard last night were more proposals that are great for special interests but bad for people  just like the Medicare prescription drug plan  great for the pharmaceutical industry  great for the insurance industry  but terrible for our seniors and people with disabilities STABENOW     We re on their side  We can do better  And as Democrats we re going to fight until we get it right      APPLAUSE SOLIS     I m also pleased to be here to represent members of the House  And as a part of the Hispanic Caucus Task Force on Health and also a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee  I wasn t surprised that President Bush didn t speak about the recent program that was passed by Republicans to try to expand Medicare Part D  because I know that he s been getting numerous calls  probably thousands and thousands  Because in my own district  we ve received many calls since the program went in play     And I can tell you that there are many  many individuals who are not English language proficient  particularly in districts like mine  where a majority are Latino or immigrant  Asian and others  that are struggling right now to get through to that 1 800 line  They can t even stay on the line and get someone to talk to them in their language to help them better understand and assess exactly what that prescription drug benefit is     And it s horrible to know that people are missing out on their medicines and their medication     We ve been working in the House and with the Senate to try to bridge the gap for health care disparities amongst immigrant groups and Latinos and African Americans and others  And I can tell you that we were very disappointed not to hear anything  any talk about how to decrease the climbing enrollments for those patients that have chronic illnesses like diabetes  asthma  cancer and HIV and AIDS     These are things that need immediate attention  We need more funding to help provide that safety net for our communities     And I stand tall with our health care providers here and those people out in our communities who are working day to day  many of them volunteering to help our community  They re not asking for handouts  they re just asking for a fair share and a break     They need their medication  They need health care services  In my opinion  health care should be provided to everyone  not just those that are privileged  And we need to make sure that that happens for all Americans      APPLAUSE     Leader Pelosi I believe will be joining us later  And I have had the opportunity to work with her on many  many occasions on health care issues  Health care delivery is number one in our precincts and in our districts SOLIS     Everyone is very  very concerned about the fact that their job may be jeopardized  But even more so  the high cost in premiums that they re having to pay for health care is not acceptable at all     We need to do more  We need to make sure that all Americans  especially our seniors citizens who have given so much to our country  receive that benefit     And in addition  for our veterans  our Iraqi veterans that are coming home  they also need health care and benefits     We see too many in our district  many that are coming home disabled  disfigured  won t have any jobs and won t have anybody there to greet them at the Veterans Administration to give them their medicine as well     Thank you      APPLAUSE REID     We now have a working nurse who is going to make a presentation to us  She said she just finished a tour of duty at one of the hospitals  Isis Montalvo      APPLAUSE     ISIS MONTALVO  NURSING PRACTICE AND POLICY  AMERICAN NURSES ASSOCIATION  Good morning  My name is Isis Montalvo and I have been a registered nurse for almost 19 years  I am here today representing the American Nurses Association and speaking on behalf of nurses across the country     As a nurse  I have seen  over the years  what happens when people have insufficient health insurance or no insurance at all  When they are faced with choosing between food  shelter and basic family needs  health care becomes a luxury     These people become patients who show up in overcrowded  short  staffed emergency rooms with advanced stages of their illness  with little hope for ongoing treatment beyond their brief emergency room visit     Due to lack of resources  these patients are unable to fill their prescriptions or they are unable to continue with recommended treatment or follow up  They then return to the emergency room and utilize the setting as a primary treatment center  which already is at capacity     As the nation s largest group of health care providers  nurses are on the front lines of patient care  And we are seeing our health care system pushed to the breaking point     Patients and families are suffering  I know a retired patient who was forced to sell her home after owning it for 40 years in order to pay for her escalating health care costs and her monthly medications     I met a young widow who was left to pay her deceased husband s medical bills after an extensive illness because they did not have a comprehensive health insurance plan  nor could they afford one     Today  nurses are feeling tired and frustrated with this health care crisis and are determined to address it MONTALVO     Unfortunately  the president s proposal for high cost health savings accounts are not the solution for the people we take care of on a daily basis or the millions of other people out there who are underinsured or uninsured     Let s not further the burden of the patients     It is time for real health care reform in this country  The stakes are too high for my patients and others to offer them anything but meaningful and effective solutions to this problem  Gutting the nation s Medicare and Medicaid program is not the answer     Nurses believe that health care is a basic human right that should be guaranteed to everyone in our nation  Nurses stand ready to help Congress  the administration  and the people of this great nation to ensure this right becomes a reality     Thank you      APPLAUSE REID     We know how cold it is for everyone  We don t know if Leader Pelosi s been able to get out of that meeting yet  So I think we ll go ahead and take some questions if there are some QUESTION     Senator  I wanted to ask  inaudible  aspects of the health savings accounts  today s criticism has been chiefly because they don t help the poor and the sickest of Americans  The president provided some proposals to reach out  to make it more affordable    refundable tax credits    and allow employers to contribute more for the sicker workers if they so desire     Could you speak to efforts to make these things work better for sicker Americans  whether it s adequate or inadequate REID     The problem is  if you want to go to Las Vegas  you don t drive there  you get in an airplane    you get there real quick  It takes a long time to get there in an automobile     The president s program just doesn t work  It only helps a select few     And the program is even becoming more specific  Now you pay more you get less  And  of course  it s    as many things in this administration    it helps people that need    it doesn t help the people who need the help  and it helps people that are already being helped REID     People who can t save  this program doesn t help them  It s a boon to Wall Street     Why don t we just look at the 46 million uninsured  This may help a few of those  but very  very few  It s just a program that s not modeled to help the health care crisis we have in America today     We talk about the 46 million who are uninsured  There are millions and millions of others who are underinsured  They have programs that just don t work     So I appreciate the president trying to help a little bit  but it s only a little bit KENNEDY     You know  that was such an empty    completely empty promise and guarantee when the House of Representatives today is passing a budget that s going to knock 60 000 of the lowest income people off Medicaid  If the president was all that concerned last night  why are the Republican leadership knocking 60 000 people off Medicaid today  That s the number one answer  and you say  Well  he s really concerned with the program     This is just part of    this is a gimmick  and it is going to benefit the wealthiest individuals in our society and the insurance companies  And many of those insurance companies are the ones that have made the biggest contributions to this president and to the Republicans that are supporting health savings account     It is basically a fraud for the American people  for average working people  average working families in this country  And we re going to do everything we possible can to defeat it     If you want  I ve got the chapter and verse in a half a dozen different examples of middle income people  the difference with health savings accounts and the difference with a health insurance program that we ll be glad to make available STABENOW     And I want to add something  as well     The health savings accounts really shift the risks and the costs to people  as has been talked about  And the association health plans that the president has talked about  according to the Congressional Budget Office  a nonpartisan agency  will actually increase premiums for small businesses STABENOW     Four out of five small businesses will see their premiums actually go up under one of his plans     And then finally I would say on behalf of American manufacturers    and I can speak in Michigan    on behalf of the manufacturers and the working men and women who have built the middle class in this country  there was nothing there that said this president understood what is going on right now in our fight for our way of life  which is what is going on in this country for middle class Americans right now     The kinds of proposals that will help would be his support in the short term for the federal government to cover catastrophic costs  Now  that would be a proposal that would help  I have legislation to do that  Other colleagues are supporting efforts as well     There are proposals that would make significant differences in terms of helping our businesses compete  our workers being able to care for their families and keep their health care and our small businesses being able to survive     And this president chose not to do that  He chose instead to offer a few things that help a few people at the expense of everybody else QUESTION      OFF MIKE REID     I m glad you brought the question up  but it brings out a certain sadness in my heart  because the minute you mention that  I think of Paul Wellstone and a commitment that was made after his death that they  the majority  would do something to dignify his death     No one cared about an issue more than Paul Wellstone  and there was no issue he cared about more than mental health parity  And we all know it was because of personal experiences in his life and the kind of person he was     So  of course  medical savings account  that has nothing to do with mental health parity that they promised us  And I am so disappointed     You know  everyone here with rare  rare exception  in their families have had problems with mental health    everybody  We need mental health parity  And this president hasn t addressed this     And the leadership in the Congress should be ashamed of themselves for not living up to their word that they would do something about that  They won t even let us have a vote on it KENNEDY     I thank the leader for his strong support  and I think we can give the assurance we re going to vote on mental health parity before we adjourn this year  One way or the other  we re going to get a vote on mental health parity     This president and the Republican leadership have been strongly opposed to mental health parity  Our colleague  Senator Domenici  has been a courageous voice in support of mental health parity     But the fact remains that in the health insurance programs that provide mental health parity  they find out that there are actual savings for the insurance companies when they provide it  because so much of the early focus and attention and treatment of mental health helps reduce the kinds of pressures on other illnesses and disease  That s been proven day in and day out     We ought to do it because it is the right health decision  But we also ought to satisfy those that are only interested in the bottom line that it makes economic sense  too     Finally  most of the mental health challenges that our fellow citizens are facing can be treated  And most of those can be treated in ways that provide better outcomes than even in the physical illness and sickness     So this is a failing of our health care system KENNEDY     Democrats are committed to doing something about it  and prior to the time of the elections     For those people that care about it  we hope we ll hear from them  We want to know whether they share our strong belief that we ought to get about the business of passing a good mental health parity bill REID     Last question QUESTION      OFF MIKE REID     Yes     Anyone disagree with me  Ted KENNEDY     No      CROSSTALK REID     As we stop it  because it s stopping nothing  It doesn t help anything  It doesn t help the overall problem     And if he thinks he can go around the country bragging about solving the health care crisis in America by having HSAs  the American people simply won t stand for it     Thank you all very much
