         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  Madam President  there is general agreement on both sides of the aisle that we have a foreign intelligence surveillance problem that should be addressed  The difference between us is that on this side of the aisle we have consistently been willing to work cooperatively to solve the problem  There is a model  In 1976  we faced a similar problem  The Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities  known as the Church Committee  had found disturbing abuses of electronic surveillance  Congress and the Administration set out to pass a law to prevent such abuses in the future  while still protecting our national security  In 1976  I was the principal sponsor of the original bill that became FISA  When we first introduced the bill  we had a Democratic Congress  a Republican President  Gerald Ford  and a Republican Attorney General  Ed Levi  Attorney General Levi understood the need for Congress and the Executive Branch to work together  Members of the Judiciary Committee went down to the Justice Department at least four times to meet on the bill  There were discussions with Henry Kissinger  Don Rumsfeld  Brent Scowcroft and George Bush among others  We worked responsibly and cooperatively to develop legislation to protect our civil liberties and ensure that the nation could use necessary surveillance  In the end  Attorney General Levi praised the bipartisan spirit of cooperation that characterized the negotiations and produced a good bill  That Administration recognized the importance of working with Congress  The final bill was passed by the Senate by a vote of 95 to 1 As this history demonstrates  our nation is strongest when we work together for our national security  Unfortunately  the current Administration has chosen a very different course  President Bush has refused all along to consult Congress on the development and implementation of its surveillance program  and now we find that it violated the law  This is not an argument for granting expanded discretion to the Administration  There is simply no basis for trusting this Administration to respect the privacy of the American people  Nor do we have any confidence in the Administrations competence to adopt a lawful and effective program When Attorney General Gonzales appeared before the Judiciary Committee in February 2006  I questioned him about FISA and the recently revealed warrantless eavesdropping program  I offered to work with him then  In fact  I asked him why he had not approached Congress sooner  given Attorney General Levis success and given the cost of getting it wrong  He answered  We did not think we needed to  quite frankly  Well  we now know that wasnt true  I pointed out to the Attorney General at the time the benefit of having consensus on this issue and the importance of fostering a cooperative atmosphere  His answer to me was  I do not think that we are wrong on this  But they were wrong  which is why we are debating this issue at the eleventh hour today  I told him then that the Administration was sending the wrong message to the courts  that they were jeopardizing our ability to convict terrorists by using these illegal intelligence methods  The Attorney General said  That is the last thing we want to do  We believe this program is lawful  He was wrong again  The program is not lawful and the Administration needs Congress to fix it  I did not stand alone on these issues  I had the support of many of my colleagues on the committee on both sides of the aisle  Yet  the record is clear that the Attorney General repeatedly rebuffed our efforts to work with the Administration to get this legislation right the first time Instead  the Attorney General and the President have consistently rejected Congressional input and oversight  They have repeatedly demanded that Congress rubber stamp their decisions and trust their discretion  We have seen where that leads  and we owe the nation a better approach  We should pass legislation today that closes the gap in current law  and preserves the critical role of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in protecting our civil liberties  Unfortunately  some of our colleagues  instead of using this opportunity to work together to safeguard the nation  would prefer to pass yet another partisan assault on the rule of law and American civil liberties  They insist on diminishing the role of the FISA court and increasing the unsupervised discretion of the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence  They want to trust Alberto Gonzales to ensure that the government does not listen to the phone calls and read the e mails of Americans without justification  We need to modernize FISA  not undermine it  Their proposal clearly contradicts the fundamental purpose of the initial legislation We should remember how we reached this point  For four straight years  the Bush Administration recklessly conducted warrantless surveillance in violation of FISA  The President acknowledged this surveillance only after it was reported in the press  Until January of this year  the Administration refused to bring its surveillance program under the oversight of the FISA Court  despite the clear statutory requirement to do so  The FISA Court has now reviewed the surveillance and has issued a ruling  It has declared that a significant aspect of the Presidents warantless surveillance program  in operation for four years without any oversight  violates the law and cannot continue  Without bipartisan Congressional pressure to force that review  these and other despicable violations of the rule of law would have gone on and on  Even today  the Attorney General continues to mislead Congress on basic information about the program  and he refuses to provide the legal justifications on which he relied  Now  after the FISA Courts clear ruling  the Administration is urgently demanding that we correct their mistake  We can do that  We can reach the appropriate balance between modernizing the legislation to protect our national security  and maintaining its basic protection of civil liberties  If the Administration and its allies are serious about effectively protecting the country from terrorist threats  and doing so under the rule of law  they should support such legislation      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
