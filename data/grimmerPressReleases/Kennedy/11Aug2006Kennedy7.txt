         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Senator Harry Reid and several of their colleagues sent a letter to Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman  asking him to refrain from any action to implement a proposed reorganization of the Departments employee safety and health programs  Senator Kennedy has been active in efforts to provide greater health and safety protections for Department employees  including cosponsoring legislation to establish enforceable standards at DOE facilities and to compensate employees for occupational illnesses    In releasing the letter  Senator Kennedy said  The Department of Energy is again demonstrating the Administrations lack of concern for the safety and health of the nations workers  The proposal to dismantle the Departments employee safety and health office risks a return to the Departments past failures to provide adequate protection to its employees  The Department should not go forward with any plan that poses such a risk    Below is the text of the letter  A PDF copy with signatures is available upon request     August 11  2006    The Honorable Samuel W  Bodman  Secretary of Energy  U S  Department of Energy  Washington  DC 20585   Dear Secretary Bodman     We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the July 24 predecisional draft plan to reorganize the environment  safety and health responsibilities carried out under the leadership of the Assistant Secretary for Environment  Safety and Health  EsH   We are writing to urge you to withhold action on this proposed reorganization until key questions are answered and there has been an opportunity to fully examine the implications of the proposal to dismantle the office     This office has responsibility for protecting the health and safety of 130 000 DOE and contractor employees and the public  With respect to this responsibility  DOE is a self regulating entity  not subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  Given the inherent hazards in many of DOEs operations  it is crucial that DOEs own employee safety and health systems are robust and reliable     The proposed reorganization poses a significant threat to employee safety and health  It downgrades worker safety and health issues by subsuming them into the much larger security office and eliminating the position of Assistant Secretary  A rough calculation of the post merger budget reveals that approximately 80  of the HSS budget will be dedicated to security functions and only 20  will be dedicated to worker safety and health  Because the plan failed to include a cross walk of employees  a precise analysis of the personnel make up of the new office is not possible  but it would likely yield a similarly lopsided result  in which 80  of the focus of senior management will be on security  There have been consequences for the environment and workers in the past when DOE has not paid sufficient attention to these issues  such as the recent exposure of DOE employees to lethal radiation     We are also very concerned that without leadership at the Assistant Secretary level  employee safety and health issues will lose prominence on a day to day basis  An Assistant Secretary provides political accountability  The plans assertion that a career professional is better suited to lead the office because career employees provide greater continuity is specious  Our system is based on political accountability at the top levels of the executive branch  supported by a professional career staff  We believe that adequate attention and oversight require a dedicated Assistant Secretary with an institutional mandate in this area from the President and Congress     We are also concerned that the reorganization will likely complicate and possibly delay the implementation of DOEs new worker safety rule  10 C F R  851 et seq    It took DOE more than three years to issue the current regulations  and workers cant afford to wait any longer for those rules to be implemented  The preamble to the worker safety rule specifies that the Assistant Secretary will play a central role in its implementation and enforcement  If that position is eliminated  the regulations cannot be implemented as currently drafted  causing likely delay and confusion    One of our primary concerns is that DOE has not demonstrated any deficiencies in ESH  The plan states that its purpose is to strengthen safety and health  but it does not identify specific weaknesses or deficiencies in the current organization  No drastic reorganization should be undertaken without a more specific analysis of the problems with the existing structure  if any     The plan also fails to state a case for how the reorganization will actually strengthen employee safety and health  For the most part  the operational improvements outlined in the plan could be carried out without the proposed reorganization  For example  the plan claims that a benefit of the reorganization is that it will strengthen line management accountability by improving reporting on performance to the Secretary  There is no explanation  however  of why such improvements could not be made within the current organizational structure  There is nothing inherent in the reorganization that will bring about improved management accountability     Indeed  the premise underlying this plan  that some kind of synergy will be created by merging security with safety and health  is faulty and without substance  The security and the safety and health functions are fundamentally different  Safety and health are primarily concerned with hazards posed to DOE employees from DOE activities  In contrast  security is primarily concerned with threats to DOE activities  whatever their source  In sum  the disparate nature of the two areas refutes any assertion that there are significant areas of overlap and duplication that can be enhanced by a merger     Attached please find six questions which  in addition to the concerns outlined above  need to be answered in detail and with supporting documents     Further  we request that you refrain from any action to implement your predecisional draft plan to dismantle the Office of Environment  Safety and Health and to eliminate the position of Assistant Secretary for Environment  Safety and Health  until Congress has had an opportunity to exercise appropriate oversight  In light of DOEs past failures to protect employee safety and health  Congress has a special responsibility to examine the proposed reorganization before it goes forward      Thank you for your attention to and consideration of this important issue     Sincerely      Edward M

Cantwell  Frank Lautenberg  Barack Obama  Ken Salazar  Robert Menendez     Attachment A   Questions for the Secretary of Energy on Predecisional Draft Plan of July 24  2006 Entitled Strengthening Worker Health and Safety and Security at DOE    1  What  if any  are the structural  administrative  management and or policy defects or problems with the current Office of Environment  Health and Safety    2  Is there any reason why these defects and or problems cannot be adequately addressed within the framework of the current Office of Environment  Health and Safety    3  What are the specific safety and health hazards and issues that are the Departments highest priorities  What actions or initiatives has DOE taken to date to address these hazards and issues  Specifically  how will these hazards and issues be more effectively addressed under the proposed reorganization    4  If the Office of Health  Safety and Security is established  what is the budget and staff allocation for safety and health  on the one hand  and DOE security on the other    5  What are the legal implications of placing environmental policy outside the responsibilities of an Assistant Secretary  as required by 42 U S C  7133 a   If these policy functions must remain under an Assistant Secretary  which Assistant Secretary will have responsibility    6  What  if any  adverse safety and health impacts might result from merging worker safety and health responsibilities into an organization whose combined budgets will be overwhelmingly dominated by security responsibilities         Laura
