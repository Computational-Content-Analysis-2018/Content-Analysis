         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  DC  In December of 2005  Senator Kennedy urged the Inspector General of the Department of Defense to investigate U S  dealings with the Lincoln Group in placing U S  authored stories in Iraqi press publications  Today the Pentagon released an unclassified summary of their findings  Below is a statement from Senator Kennedy on the report and a text of the letter he sent requesting the investigation   The American people know that the Bush Administration has been dangerously incompetent in the conduct of the war  giving multi billion dollar sweetheart deals that have lined contractors pockets while failing to meet the basic needs of our soldiers  As the latest example  this Department of Defense report shows that the Pentagon cannot account for millions paid to the Lincoln Group for their propaganda program and that basic contracting rules were not followed  Broader policy questions remain about whether the Administrations manipulation of the news in Iraq contradicts our goal of a free and independent press there     December 2  2005    Thomas F  Gimble Inspector General Department of Defense 400 Army Navy Drive Arlington  VA 22202  Dear Mr  Gimble     Recently  the Los Angeles Times and New York Times reported that the Department of Defense contracted with the Lincoln Group to attempt to influence Iraqi public opinion about US military activities  These reports stated that the Department of Defense paid the Lincoln Group to pose as freelance journalists and place articles favorable to the US with Iraqi press  but with the apparent intention that the role of US government would not be apparent or acknowledged publicly  In addition  the reports suggested that the government paid Iraqi journalists to write favorable stories    As a matter of policy  the reports  if true  are contrary to our efforts to encourage the Iraqis to develop a free and independent press  Any attempts to control the media would contradict this basic principle of democracy   Further  as a matter of law  these reports raise serious questions about whether the Department of Defense engaged in covert activity by concealing the role of the government  This perception is reinforced by suggestions that there are classified aspects to this activity    Since 1991  Section 503 of the National Security Act has restricted covert activity by requiring a written Presidential finding that the activity is necessary to support identifiable foreign policy objectives of the United States  and also requiring the activity to be reported to the Congressional Intelligence Committees    I request you to investigate this program  determine under what authority the program was conducted  whether it conformed with statutory requirements applicable to covert activity  and whether the contract with the Lincoln Group was proper     With respect and appreciation     Sincerely         Edward M  Kennedy      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
