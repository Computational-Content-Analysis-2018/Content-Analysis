         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  DC  Today Senators Edward Kennedy and Orrin Hatch introduced their amendment to the DoD Appropriations bill to ensure that a contractor cannot win a bid to privatize work currently performed by government workers if the only cost savings the contractor provides are attributable to the fact that the contractor provides no retirement benefits or inferior benefits to its employees  The Amendment ensures that public private competitions are focused on who provides superior service delivery  A contractor will still win the bid if it provides efficiencies beyond those solely attributable to retirement costs   Unfortunately  instead of encouraging more companies to provide good retirement benefits to their employees  current federal contracting rules actually discourage many private companies from helping their employees to save for retirement  Senator Kennedy said  This unfair policy creates a dangerous race to the bottom  in which private sector companies compete against each other to see who can provide the fewest benefits to their workers  As a result  the bidding process is actually increasing the number of Americans whose retirement security is in jeopardy  Thats both illogical and unconscionable   Below is a summary of the amendment and Senator Kennedys floor remarks  as prepared for delivery     THE KENNEDY HATCH  RETIREMENT EQUITY AMENDMENT   The Kennedy Hatch Amendment provides that a contractor cannot win a bid to privatize work currently performed by government workers if the only cost savings the contractor provides are attributable to the fact that the contractor provides no retirement benefits to its employees  or provides inferior benefits to those provided by the federal government     The Amendment does not require contractors to provide retirement benefits  or to change their existing retirement benefits  Nor does it prevent any contractor from bidding on a contract because of its retirement benefit policies  It simply requires the Department of Defense to exclude retirement costs from the cost comparison in a competitive bid  thus ensuring that a contractor cannot win a bid solely by virtue of the fact that it provides inferior retirement benefits   The Amendment ensures that public private competitions are focused on who provides superior service delivery  A contractor will still win the bid if it provides efficiencies beyond those solely attributable to retirement costs    The Amendment levels the playing field for federal employees and contractor employees in the bidding process when it comes to retirement benefits  ensuring that federal employees are not unfairly disadvantaged in public private competitions because they receive federal retirement benefits    At a time when the country is facing a crisis in retirement security  the Amendment ensures that government contracting policies don t exacerbate the problem by rewarding companies that shirk their retirement obligations  Instead  it encourages companies to provide retirement benefits for workers by guaranteeing that these benefits won t place responsible employers at a competitive disadvantage in the bidding process    Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy on the Kennedy Hatch Retirement Security Amendment  As Prepared for Delivery  September 7  2006     We know that vast numbers of Americans are increasingly concerned about their economic future  More than half of all workers describe themselves as worried or stressed about the state of the economy  and growing numbers of workers fear that they wont be able to meet  much less surpass  the standard of living of their parents     One of the primary factors contributing to these fears is the worsening crisis in the nations retirement system  The cornerstones of retirement security  private pensions  private savings  and Social Security  are increasingly at risk  Far too many working Americans will face retirement with little in their pocket  and with nothing to show for their long years of loyal service and hard work       The pension reform legislation enacted this year will help companies to keep the pension promises theyve already made to workers  but we need to do much more to encourage employers to provide adequate retirement benefits to their hardworking employees  Today  less than half of all private sector employees have any retirement plan at all at work  and the number of workers with a secure defined benefit pension plan has been cut in half since 1980      Employer provided retirement plans are essential for retirement security for working families  Workers are far more likely to save money for retirement through an employer offered pension than if they are left to save on their own      Unfortunately  instead of encouraging more companies to provide good retirement benefits to their employees  current federal contracting rules actually discourage many private companies from helping their employees to save for retirement  The competitive bidding process for contracts favors private employers who shortchange their workers on retirement benefits  Firms that provide no retirement benefits or only meager benefits often win bids to perform government work  even when the cost savings from their bid are attributable solely to the lack of retirement benefits they provide      This unfair policy creates a dangerous race to the bottom  in which private sector companies compete against each other to see who can provide the fewest benefits to their workers  As a result  the bidding process is actually increasing the number of Americans whose retirement security is in jeopardy  Thats both illogical and unconscionable     In addition  this skewed privatization policy is fundamentally unfair to federal workers  who lose contracts simply because they receive decent benefits  Valued federal employees are losing their jobs because they cant compete on an unfair playing field with employers who are shortchanging their workers         Defense workers are particularly at risk  Now this year alone  the Department of Defense is putting more than 10 000 civilian employees at risk of unfair termination  more than any other federal agency  and it has announced plans to increase this number in the future    Thirty five percent of civilian defense employees are veterans  Hundreds more are active reservists currently serving in the Iraq war  The least we can do for these dedicated and patriotic Americans is let them to compete on a level playing field to save the jobs they come home to after their service to our country    The amendment that Senator Hatch and I are offering will protect these workers by preventing contractors from winning bids for government work solely because they provide inadequate retirement benefits to their employees  or no retirement benefits at all  Our goal is obviousto protect hardworking federal employees from unfair competition  They shouldnt lose their jobs because they cant compete with private contactors on an un level  playing field    The amendment does not dictate the retirement benefits that employers must provide or require contractors to change their existing benefits  It simply levels the playing field for federal employees and contractor employees by excluding costs related to retirement from a privatization review  All the Amendment does is prevent contractors from winning bids solely because they offer inferior retirement benefits    The underlying bill already includes provisions to level the playing field for health care benefits  and we need to do the same for retirement benefits    Our bipartisan amendment is an issue of basic fairness  Its fair to private sector workers who will otherwise lose their retirement benefits in a race to the bottom  And it is fair to federal employees  who will otherwise lose their jobs to unfair competition  I strongly urge my colleagues to support our amendment
