         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Mr  President  by a vote of 246 to 182 yesterday  the House of Representatives approved a historic resolution strongly supporting our troops in Iraq and strongly opposing the escalation of the war  Seventeen courageous house Republicans joined all but two house Democrats in voting for the resolution in their clear response to the American peoples call for change in policy on the war  The Senate should approve this legislation too  The voices of the American people are growing louder and louder  and the need for us to act could not be clearer  No more delays  No more filibusters  No more excuses  Our men and women in uniform have served with great courage and honor for nearly four years    longer than it took to win World War II  We support them wholeheartedly  as Senator Reids legislation makes very clear  But support for our troops does not mean support for the Presidents misguided policy  Sending tens of thousands more American troops into the cauldron of a civil war is not a policy worthy of their sacrifice  This legislation makes that point completely clear Every Senator who opposes the escalation of the war should cast their vote in favor of this legislation Citizens across the country are watching this debate  For them  the question is clear  When the roll is called  a vote yes means you oppose the escalation of the war  You oppose sending even more of our sons and daughters into a civil war  A vote no means you agree that the President is on the right course A yes vote is the right vote for our troops  the right vote for the people of Iraq and the right vote for America Our armed forces have done everything we have asked them to do  They have served with dignity  honor  and courage  More than 3 000 Americans have been killed so far in this war that America never should have fought  More than 23 000 have been wounded  65 sons and daughters of Massachusetts have made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq President Bush does not have the consent of the American people for any new escalation  He is insisting on escalating the war  when most Americans are convinced that de escalation is the only responsible strategy  Experience demonstrates that a surge wont work  We have surged our forces in Iraq four times in the past  and each time the situation hasnt changed  Four surgesfour failures  It makes no sense to try for five  President Bush cannot continue to unilaterally impose his failing policy on an America that has already rejected it  Congress has a constituted responsibility to stop this President from sending even more of our sons and daughters to die in this civil war  This legislation is our first effort to meet that responsibility  It is our chance to go on record in opposition to the surge  Its a clear call for change  Sending even more U S  troops into Iraqs civil war is not the solution to Iraqs political problems  President Bush not only fails to see that realityhes also going out of his way to deny and defy it  This is our chance at long last to state our strong opposition to that strategy  If the President refuses to change course  we must take stronger action to change it  protect our troops  and end this reckless war The debate is about what is best for our troops and for our country  Sending even more of our forces into a civil war will not make success any more likely  We have a responsibility to vote on this issue now  before it is too late  This is the moment of truth  We either go on record opposing the escalation  or we go on record supporting it  It is time for Republicans to stand up to the President and stand up for our soldiers by clearly opposing the escalation of this war  I urge our colleagues to vote yes on this motion to proceed  The American people are watching and waiting for an answer      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
