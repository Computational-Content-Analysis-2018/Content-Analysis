         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  I strongly support the Feingold Reid amendment on Iraq  This is a defining moment in our debate on this misguided war  We in Congress have a choice  We can continue the Administrations failed policy and guarantee that even more American troops will die in Iraqs bloody civil war  Or we can finally exercise our power of the purse and begin to bring this disastrous war to an end by linking the requirement to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq by next March to a prohibition on spending  We all must face up to the fact that Congress must use the power of the purse to force an end to the war  and the sooner we do so  the better It is wrong for the Congress to continue to defer to presidential decisions that we know are fatally flawed The American people know this war is wrong  and its wrong to abdicate our responsibility by allowing this war to drag on longer while our casualties mount higher and higher For more than four long years  the Presidents assertion of unprecedented power has gone unchecked  This amendment reclaims our responsibility under the Constitution as a co equal branch of government  with specific powers of our own on issues of war and peace  Congress can exercise its authority to redirect or terminate an ongoing conflict in two ways  It can enact specific limits on the scope of the conflict  and it can use the power of the purse to deny funding for all or parts of a conflict  Congress has followed that path in prior wars  and we must follow it today  During the Vietnam War  Congress repealed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of 1964  which many of us felt had been misused to justify the escalation of Americas involvement in Vietnam  Congress also prohibited the reintroduction of troops into Cambodia after President Nixons escalation of the war  We went on to cap the number of American troops in Vietnam  and we eventually cut off funding for the war when the President left us no alternative In 1983  Congress required President Reagan to obtain statutory authorization from Congress with respect to any substantial expansion in the number or role of U S  forces in Lebanon A decade later  Congress passed legislation prohibiting President Clinton from using funds for military operations in Somalia without specific authorization by Congress Exasperated by the actions of successive Presidents Johnson and Nixon on the Vietnam War  Congress enacted the War Powers Act in 1973 over President Nixons veto  The Act requires Presidents to consult with Congress before placing troops in harms way  seek authorization to keep them there  and continue consultation as the conflict goes on  This congressional assertion of power in matters of war and peace resonates loudly today  Opponents of our efforts to bring the Iraq war to an end  have mischaracterized any use of this Congressional power as an abandonment of our soldiers on the battlefield  Nothing could be further from the truth  No responsible legislator would take any action that endangers our troops  In fact  using congressional authority to force a change of course in Iraq and begin to bring our troops out of Iraqs civil war is the best way to protect our troops Requiring a change of course by using the power of the purse or taking other action will not mean taking equipment and supplies away from our troops  We will avoid the mistake the President made in sending our troops into Iraq without adequate armor and without a plan to win the peace  There is no reason for Congress now to shy away from exercising the full range of its constitutional powers  The President was wrong to get us into this war  wrong to conduct it so poorly  wrong to ignore the views of the American people  and wrong to accuse those of us who are working to change course and end this war as harming our troops The longer the war goes on  the more it encourages the terrorists to plan new attacks against us  Iraq has become a recruiting ground for terrorists and a breeding ground for hatred of America  Our respect in the world has fallen to the lowest point our history  President Bush should not be permitted to continue his disastrous policy of sending more and more American troops to die in the quagmire of Iraqs civil war  Because the President refuses to bring this war to an end  we in Congress must put on the brakes ourselves and stop the madness  We must require the Administration to begin to bring our troops home to the heros welcome theyve earned It is time to end the continuing tragic loss of American lives and begin to bring our soldiers home  For the sake of our troops  we cannot repeat the mistakes of Vietnam and allow this war to drag on long after the American people know it is a mistake The failure of our policy is abundantly clear to anyone who honestly looks at the facts Despite the addition of tens of thousands of American troops  and the ongoing presence of more than 150 000 American soldiers in Iraq  political reconciliation remains as difficult as ever to achieve Our troops continue to be vulnerable targets for the insurgents in what has been the longest period of high casualty rates since the war began  More than 80 American soldiers were killed in each of the first three months this year  More than 100 died in April  In the first half of May  50 have already been killed  Sectarian violence in Baghdad continues  According to an April 25 report by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq  civilian casualties of the daily violence between January and March remained high concentrated in and around Baghdad  The violence is so intense that the Iraqi Government has refused to provide mortality figures to the United Nations  The London Observer reported on Sunday that in the first 11 days of this month 234 bodies of men murdered by death squads have been dumped around the capital  a dramatic rise from the 137 found in the same period in April  Attacks within the international zone in Baghdad are increasing  In March  there were ten such attacks  including one on the Secretary General of the UN and Prime Minister Maliki  In April there was a brutal attack in the Iraqi Parliament building  In May a rocket attack in the green zone killed four foreign contractors working for the U S  government  Violence is spreading out of Baghdad and increasing elsewhere in Iraq  such as in Diyala province  where 63 American soldiers have been this year  In all of 2006  20 American soldiers were killed in Diyala province  We know that insurgents are using new and deadlier bombs  including chlorine gas bombs Iraqis are demonstrating in the streets against Americas occupation  Legislation pending in the Iraqi Parliament would require a timetable for the withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq The Iraqi people want a timetable for the withdrawal of our military  The American people want a timetable  Only the President continues to stubbornly refuse to adopt one  No one in the Administration can tell the American people in good faith and good conscience that we are making progress in Iraq  Iraq is sliding deeper into civil war  and our military cannot solve their problems Its time for President Bush to listen to the Iraq Study Group  the Iraqi people  Congress  and the American people  and work with us to bring our troops home       Laura
