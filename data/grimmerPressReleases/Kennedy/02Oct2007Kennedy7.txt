         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     As Prepared for Delivery      Today our Committee considers again the pressing problem of mine safety   We are joined by family members of the fallen miners and rescue workers from Crandall Canyon   Thank you for being here with us   The nation held its breath along with you during those long weeks this summer  hoping that your husbands  brothers  fathers  and friends would be found alive  and we mourn their passing with you        Some of the family members from West Virginia are here as well   We know your losses were also very difficult to bear   Youve been true champions for mine safety  and miners families around the country are better off for it                  The tragedy at Crandall Canyon has again put mine safety on front pages across the nation   Already this year  24 men have been killed in the nations coal mines   Ineffective enforcement  outdated technology  and inadequate safety standards are the heart of the problem        After the terrible accident at the Sago mine last year  members of our Committee went to West Virginia to talk to miners and their families  and to the community   We held a hearing on that disaster   We heard particularly about the inadequacy of emergency air supplies and communications technology        We left those hearings with a commitment to work together  Republicans and Democrats to do all we could to correct the problems and prevent further tragedies   Senator Enzi  Senator Murray  Senator Isakson  Senator Rockefeller  Senator Byrd and I worked to pass the MINER Act  the most comprehensive mine safety reform in a generation   It required more emergency air supplies  more mine rescue teams  and faster adoption of cutting edge technology in the mines                    That Act has made a difference   Senator Murray  our subcommittee chair  held an oversight hearing this spring which found that the legislation was making mines safer                    But today  we find ourselves asking new questions about whether this did enough to make mining safe   For the sake of all miners  we need to understand what went wrong at Crandall Canyon   It is too early to expect these answers today  but at least we begin to ask the right questions  about the Crandall Canyon mine  about whether MSHA is effectively doing its job  about whether the Congress must do more        MSHAs basic role is to see that mine plans are safe   At Crandall Canyon  however  MSHA apparently missed the warning flags about serious safety problems   We will hear from NIOSH today about its independent analysis of the Crandall  Canyon plan  which raises very serious questions about whether the MSHA review process is strong enough and independent enough   Such questions about the review process are not just about Crandall Canyon  they have nationwide implications        Another major MSHA responsibility is to control the rescue effort when accidents take place   Mines are inherently dangerous  both for miners  and for rescue workers   Tragically  in addition to the six mine workers  three rescue workers also died at Crandall  Canyon   Clearly  something went very wrong        We had questions too after the Sago tragedy about whether rescue workers were used as effectively as possible and were adequately protected in their efforts   So we must also look at how decisions are made at the mine site after an accident takes place     In particular  were concerned about MSHAs duty to manage information at mine rescue sites   In the MINER Act  we gave MSHA additional power to control information for the public and miners families   We must examine whether MSHA is sufficiently exercising that control in such disasters      Finally  our Committee continues to press the need for better technology to locate and communicate with miners in an emergency   The deaths at Crandall Canyon clearly show that miners are paying the price for this lapse in technology   Its outrageous that the trapped miners could not be located   In the MINER Act  we sought to expedite the adoption of the latest technology   In this hearing well discuss how we can do more and do it faster                        Our work in Congress will continue after todays hearing   We will continue our investigation of the cause of the recent disaster and take up new legislation to strengthen current laws   We clearly need to do more to prevent such disasters  and will do our best to meet that responsibility             VIDEO AND TEXT EXCERPTS       http   kennedy senate gov imo media video

NIOSH today about its independent analysis of the Crandall Canyon plan  which raises very serious questions about whether the MSHA review process is strong enough and independent enough  Such questions about the review process are not just about Crandall Canyon  they have nationwide implications       http   kennedy senate gov imo media video kennedy1025help100207 ram   With more mining operations moving into reserves under deeper overburden and or below previously mined areas  there is a need to prevent  and  in the event they do occur  to mitigate the consequences of  bumps in such new circumstances  For this reason  MSHA is reviewing operators ground control plans to ensure operators minimize the dangers associated with bumps  and District 9 has rescinded all room and pillar retreat mining plans in areas with greater than 1 500 feet of cover     http   kennedy senate gov imo media video kennedy1122help100207 ram  Unfortunately  all the factors that lead to the catastrophic collapse at Crandall Canyon Mine may not yet be evident  and they may never be fully known  However  what is apparent after reviewing the available information and examining the mine map  is that the conditions that lead to this tragic event were man made  The disaster at Crandall Canyon could and should have been prevented  Contrary to what some may say  there is little doubt that this was a man made disaster      http   kennedy senate gov imo media video kennedy1136help100207 ram   Now we know we had bumps in the north barrier pillar and we moved to the south  this to me is a real red flag  OK  We had the same geologic conditions in the south barrier that we had in the north barrier  weve had bumping in the north barrier  we made minor changes on the mining plan in the south barrier and then we went in there and started mining again        http   kennedy senate gov imo media video kennedy1039help100207 ram     KENNEDY  So Agapito is an independent agency  an independent company  and they do the review in terms of the mine safety  They are basically contracted by the mine operators  is that correct     STRICKLIN  Thats correct  sir      KENNEDY  So youre relying on here  the independent company  thats paid by the miners themselves  now are doing the review and they submit that information to MSHA  is that correct     STRICKLIN  Yes sir      KENNEDY  And they    STRICKLIN  Well    KENNEDY  Go ahead    STRICKLIN  What occurs is  the mine operator would pay the services of Agapito to do that information and then the mine operator would submit that to us      KENNEDY  Okay  and you have a chance to review that     STRICKLIN  Yes  sir      KENNEDY  And you did  that review  with regards to the North Barrier     STRICKLIN  Yes  sir      KENNEDY  Okay  But  it is true that you didnt re run the models for the South Barrier  is that so     STRICKLIN  Im not exactly sure of that  my understanding was the graduate student looked at the information that was submitted to us from Agapito  I dont know  I did not hear what you may have heard  that he didnt run it through the South Barrier      http   kennedy senate gov imo media video kennedy1117help100207 ram    SENATOR KENNEDY  Some people believe that it is not coincidental that you had the earlier owners basically closed that mine down and then you have the BLM report on October 27  2004  John Lewis  mining engineer for Andalex  the owner prior to Murray Energy   called and informed me that Genwal  the mine operating company  would need to seal off the west portion of the Main West mains at the Crandall Canyon mine  those are the north and south barriers  Conditions were deteriorating     And it has the whole report here  heres the Bureau of Land Management  yet you dont get that information  I mean this is like the CIA not talking to the FBI when we were getting attacked by the terrorists  I mean heres the Bureau of Land Management making these judgments here and you dont know anything about it  theyre not supposed to let you know  The Bureau of Land Management makes these judgments  the situation in Main west is untenable for future pillar recovery  I mean did that grad student know this  Did they have this information     STRICKLIN  That information was not shared with us that Im aware of  sir     SEN  KENNEDY  Dont you think its useful if they do share  Bureau of Land Management  they make a report on safety issues that they give you a copy or include you     STRICKLIN  I think thats important that we would have that  yes  sir      http   kennedy senate gov imo media video kennedy1144help100207 ram  SENATOR KENNEDY  Let me ask you Mr  Ferriter  would you go in  Crandall  Canyon  mine and mine     FERRITER  Having looked at the roof control plan and having knowledge of the north barrier pillar  I might make a quick visit to look and see is there is developing signs of instability in the south barrier but I would not work a crew in there  my visit would be very limited and very short     http   kennedy senate gov imo media video kennedy1146help100207 ram    SENATOR KENNEDY  Let me just ask you this  finally  maybe the panel just quickly on this about outside evaluation  Weve had this Agapito  they did this evaluation  and we looked into it briefly  its a highly regarded company  but there were some important mistakes that were made in this particular evaluation  And you get the situation with theyre being paid by the companies themselves  I mean that is  thats the way that the system is done  Are you troubled by that  Should this be something that we ought to be interested in  concerned about  Does this end up being to cozy of a relationship  Whats your own experience on this  Just from left to right  Mr  ODell     ODELL  Yes  it troubles me  I mean  you always have heard  ever since I was a little kid that the customer is always right  so whatever theyre paying for  theyre going to get  So that pretty much sums it up      KENNEDY  Mr  Ferriter     FERRITER  Yes  I am very troubled about this  I think its a broken system  We have a consultant that obviously made mistakes on the analysis  that was forwarded by the operating company  the operator should have been verythey have experienced people  they should know this  they should be able to take and make corrections  tell the consultant to change it  and then it was approved by MSHA and when I was in MSHA we had a small group of about six people that did this for District 9  we had about 25 years experience there  geologists  mining engineers  we spent a lot of time in the Utah Coal Fields  we spent a lot of time reviewing these roof control plans  we used computer simulations  quite frankly  I do not know what MSHA does today  but just a simple run of the ARMPS programNIOSH ARMPS programs  I think would have put a lot of red flags out there that somebody should take a real detailed look at this  and I dont know if this was done by MSHA or not   Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
