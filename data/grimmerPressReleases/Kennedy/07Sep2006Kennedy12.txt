         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   I support the Conrad Dorgan Salazar amendment to provide funding for a unit dedicated to capturing Osama bin Laden and other top Al Qaeda leaders    Next week marks the fifth anniversary of the vicious attack on America by Al Qaeda terrorists   Despite the passage of time  Americans still vividly recall with enormous pain and sorrow that dark and somber day  We recall the nearly three thousand Americans who were killed by Al Qaeda terrorists  We recall the brave firefighters and first responders who sacrificed their lives so that others could live  We recall the twin towers crumbling before our eyes  and the Pentagon ablaze beneath a plume a smoke  And we recall the pledge by the Administration and all Americans that this type of attack will never  ever occur again   Sadly  as we approach this anniversary  the President has  once again  resorted to the politics of fear in an effort to convince the American people that the Iraq war is central to the global war on terror   Nothing is further from the truth  Scare tactics may have worked in the elections of 2002 and 2004  but this time  the American people know better   The American people know that the war in Iraq was a distraction from the real global war on terror and that Iraq had nothing to do with Al Qaeda   The American people know that America should have kept its eye on the ball and captured Osama bin Laden    rather than rushing headlong into a war that we did not need to fight  Saddam Hussein did not attack America on September 11  Osama bin Laden did    As the parents of John Hart  who was killed in Iraq by an improvised explosive device in 2003  said  In America  we seem afraid to ask the president where Osama bin Laden is  or why we were sent to Iraq on half truths when the whole truth would have sufficed  or how we will ever get out   The American people know that the financial cost of the war has been far too great  Its scandalous that America is spending more than  200 million each day on the war in Iraq  and short changing the many recommendations by the 9 11 Commission to protect our homeland against further attacks   Funding for just one day in Iraq could help meet our homeland security needs and keep Americans safer from the Al Qaeda threat in many ways  It could    provide more than 3 8 million households with an emergency readiness kit  or  improve the communications gap in more than 40 small cities or 34 mid sized cities or 6 large cities so that so that federal  state and local first responders can talk to one another during an emergency  or  pay for nearly 4 000 additional Border Patrol agents for one year to better guard our borders against potential terrorists  or   provide more than 1 285 explosive trace detection portals for airport screening of passengers  or   purchase more than 750 fire trucks for improving local emergency response capabilities  or  employ more than 4 742 fire fighters  4 071 police patrol officers  or 6 799 paramedics and emergency medical technicians for an entire year  or  provide more than 6 000 local law enforcement agencies with bomb detecting robots  or  nearly double the budget for nuclear materials and waste safety programs of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  or   provide 9 400 port container inspection units to detect hazardous materials being shipped into the country  or  provide 4 700 narcotics vapor and dangerous particle detectors   Radical Islamic terrorists have never lost their resolve to strike our homeland again  Yet  five years after the 9 11 tragedy and three years after the war in Iraq began  our ports  chemical and nuclear plants  and transportation system remain extremely vulnerable to terrorist attacks  Our firefighters and police still lack proper equipment  We are grossly unprepared to respond to a bioterrorist attack  Nuclear materials are still unsecured in the former Soviet Union and many parts of the world    Much of this could have been avoided had the President stayed focused on the real war on terrorism    the war against Al Qaeda    and put urgently needed funds into homeland security  rather than rushing headlong into a misguided war in Iraq   Its preposterous for the President to claim that America is safer today  According to a report released by the Third Way National Security Project this week     The estimated number of al Qaeda members worldwide in 2001 was 20 000  but in 2006 it is 50 000     The Number of al Qaeda terrorist attacks in the five years before 9 11 was 3  but the number in the five years since 9 11 was 30     The number of significant global terrorist attacks reported by the U S  State Department in 2003 was 175  The number exceeded 3 000 in 2004  and it exceeded 11 000 in 20065   This amendment is right on the mark and puts the focus where it belongs  on the capture of Osama bin Laden  Rather than continue to defend its failed course in Iraq  the President must make the capture of the number one terrorist in the world our number one priority      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
