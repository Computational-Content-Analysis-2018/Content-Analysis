         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C     U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R WY  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  and Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  Ranking Member of the HELP Committee  today jointly issued the following statement  It is critical that we maintain public confidence in the FDA s ability to ensure that prescription drugs are safe and effective  the Senators said  The nation is looking to us to ensure that drugs approved for use by the FDA are safe when used as intended and do not pose an unreasonable risk to the public   We are holding hearings this week as the first part of our comprehensive response to the public s concerns about the FDA and drug safety  We believe we must learn the facts and fully understand how the FDA drug approval process is working before deciding how to react   We will not pre determine our response  Overreacting could be as dangerous as doing nothing  so we must take extraordinary care to find the right approach   Once we understand what needs to be done  we will act through the Committee process in a bipartisan manner to ensure that we have the necessary reforms in place to protect the health of the American people     Senator Kennedy s Remarks at the Hearing Follow    STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY AT THE HEARING ON FDA S DRUG APPROVAL PROCESS  Thank you  Mr  Chairman  and I commend you for calling this hearing on the safety of prescription drugs   When patients go to their medicine cabinets to open a prescription bottle  they deserve an assurance that the medicines they take are safe and effective  Each one of us relies on the FDA for that assurance   I commend Senator Enzi for his leadership in making drug safety a priority for this oversight committee by calling today s hearing  There is no doubt that the FDA s ability to assure the safety and effectiveness of medicine is under stress today as never before  I look forward to working closely with our distinguished Chairman on legislation to restore the ability of the FDA to deal effectively with the challenges it faces   Last fall  FDA required antidepressants such as Prozac and Zoloft to be labeled to reflect an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior for children and adolescents  We also began to realize that Vioxx and other drugs in the COX 2 class of pain relievers increase the risk of heart attack or stroke   The failure to recognize safety problems with these COX 2 drugs may have resulted in tens of thousands of patients suffering heart attacks or stroke and an unknown number of deaths  We have a responsibility to address the failures in the current system to assure the American people that this kind of lapse will never happen again  We need to make sure FDA has the resources and authority it needs to see that major safety problems do not remain undetected in future   For most people who took them  COX 2 drugs didn t work any better than older  cheaper drugs that are much safer  We must ask why so many people were taking COX 2 drugs when there was no medical need for them to do so  Was there pressure from direct to consumer advertising or inducements to doctors to prescribe them  We need to examine these issues closely to make sure that patients do not improperly receive drugs that may be harmful due to clever advertising and high pressure sales tactics   This week s hearings will allow us to examine carefully the issues under consideration for the new legislation  These include better monitoring for drugs already on the market  greater independence for the offices that assure safety and better protections against improper conflicts of interest on essential FDA panels   Today s hearing is the first step in the process that I m optimistic will lead to a comprehensive proposal to make certain that every American can count on the FDA to protect their health   Hindsight is 20 20  but there s a real concern that the agency may have been too willing on safety issues to protect the pharmaceutical companies instead of the public interest   Why should it take nearly 2 years  after the so called VIGOR clinical trial raised serious concerns about Vioxx for the agency to act on the safety risks   Why should it take 5 years to discover that Vioxx  used by tens of millions of patients  may double the risk of heart attack or stroke   Questions certainly need to be asked about why FDA was reluctant to modify the label on these antidepressants  especially in cases where they d be used by children   When the drug user fees were enacted in 1992  Congress gave FDA the funds to review drugs much more quickly  but drug safety checks have not kept pace with the speed of drug approvals   Inevitably  when new drugs first come to market  we don t know enough about their use by large numbers of patients  since clinical trials may not detect rare but serious problems  Effective FDA oversight after approval is essential to detect problems   FDA also needs clear authority to require relabeling of a drug if necessary after approval  once a risk is found  Negotiations with a drug maker should never delay accurate information for patients and doctors   FDA needs clear authority as well to require a drug company to conduct a further clinical trial to study safety concerns after a drug goes on the market  and it needs a way to enforce these study requirements   The FDA process needs to become more open  Conflicts of interest of members of its advisory committees must be dealt with and fully disclosed in advance to the public when their expertise requires their participation in a study  Many of us were troubled by the reports last week that ten of the 32 members of the advisory committee had ties to the drug industry  and their votes were decisive in the recommendations that Vioxx and Bextra be allowed to return to or remain on the market   I welcome our witnesses today  and I look forward to their testimony
