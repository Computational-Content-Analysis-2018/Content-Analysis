         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACTS  Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy  202 224 2633 Craig Orfield  Enzi  202 224 6770   SUMMARY INCLUDED  LONGER SUMMARY AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST   Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  Committee along with Senator Mike Enzi  HELP Committee Ranking Member  re introduced the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act  First introduced August 3  2006  the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act would require drug makers and FDA to engage in better safety planning before a drug is approved for release to the public while improving the FDAs response to risks identified after a drug is on the market  The issue of drug safety will be taken up by the HELP Committee in early Spring  when the committee considers the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act  Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi hope to report out a bill addressing the drug user fee reauthorization  drug safety  and three other FDA reauthorizations shortly after Easter  for consideration on the Senate floor by late spring  and a conference with the House with final passage before the August recess  Senator Kennedy said  We need a more effective system to identify and assess the serious risks of drugs  inform health care providers and patients about such risks  and manage or mitigate these risks as soon as they are detected  and our bill will make that happen  Our bill  the  Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act   will raise the bar to ensure that drug safety is not an afterthought  but an integral part of the process throughout the life of a drug  Enzi said  It requires drug makers and FDA to engage in better safety planning from the very beginning  before a drug is approved for release to the public  in order to improve both the understanding of and response to risks that arise after a drug is on the market  The Drug Safety legislation  which reflects the comments and input of dozens of stakeholders  including the FDA  patient and consumer groups  industry trade associations  individual companies  and scientific experts  will      Integrate safety issues and the approval process by requiring earlier and more focused consideration of safety issues   Establish a flexible planning mechanism to obtain the necessary safety information about each new drug or indication     Permit adaptation of the safety plan in response to new information  and     Bring fairness  timeliness and finality to the dispute resolution process   Other key provisions of the bill     Establishing a collaboration among the FDA  academic research institutions  and the biomedical research industry to improve the process of drug development and evaluation  and advance the FDA s Critical Path Initiative      Establishing a publicly available database of clinical trials to help enhance patient enrollment in clinical trials of drugs  provide a mechanism to track subsequent progress of trials  and ensure that the results of trials are made public  and that patients  doctors  and pharmacists have the most up to date information     Making improvements to the FDAs process of screening advisory committee members for financial conflicts of interest to ensure that these committees provide independent expert advice  and to bolster the credibility of the product review process The Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act of 2007  Short SummaryTitle I  Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy  REMS Drugs and biologics will be approved with risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  REMS   The REMS will be reviewed at least annually for three years  as well as in labeling supplements and when FDA requests a review  Sponsors would propose a REMS and FDA would approve it after structured negotiations  if necessary Minimal Elements of a REMS  FDA approved professional labeling  a current requirement   15 day  quarterly  and annual reports of adverse events  a current requirement   A pharmaco vigilance statement about how to assess known serious risks and to identify unexpected serious risks  new   A timetable for periodic assessment of the REMS  new  Additional Elements  Based on the nature and magnitude of safety issues  additional elements of a REMS may include  Patient materials  such as a Medication Guide  for distribution when drug is dispensed  A communication plan to physicians about serious risks or safety protocols with the drug  Post approval epidemiological studies to assess signals of serious adverse events or to screen for serious adverse events in expanded populations  Post approval clinical trials to assess signals of serious adverse events   Pre clearance of  specific disclosures in  and or restrictions on DTC advertisements  Restrictions on product use or distribution to address a specific expected serious risk  what is currently known as a RiskMAP  Timeframes  Assessments  FDA review  and discussion of a REMS  In the context of an application or supplemental application  FDA must begin to discuss the proposed REMS with the sponsor at least 60 days before the PDUFA action deadline  If there is new safety information after approval  FDA may order sponsor to submit assessment of a REMS and must begin discussions within a set time period  A sponsor may submit an assessment of  and propose modifications to  a REMS at any time  Modifications can be adding  changing  or eliminating an element of the REMS Dispute Resolution  When there is disagreement between FDA and the sponsor about the REMS  the sponsor may initiate a structured dispute resolution process  This process begins by the sponsor proposing a REMS or assessing whether changes to an existing REMS are needed  and can be terminated by FDA and the sponsor reaching agreement at any point before issuance of an order  Once discussions of the sponsors proposed REMS begin  day 1   the sponsor may request review from day 15 until day 35  Review takes place at one of the next two monthly meetings of the Drug Safety Oversight Board  made up of FDA  NIH  VA and other HHS   Drug Safety Oversight Board reviews both proposals and issues a recommendation to the Secretary within 5 days  The Secretary must respond within 7 days after that  by issuing an order that resolves the dispute  can also be done w in the PDUFA action letter  if that is the context   Once FDA sponsor discussions begin  the dispute resolution process takes from 36 days to 89 days  depending on circumstances  Agreement terminates dispute resolution process Compliance  Non compliance with an element of a REMS would be a prohibited act   Civil money penalties for violation of a component of an approved REMS Application to generic drugs  A generic drug would be required to meet each element of a REMS except communication plans  carried out by FDA   and post approval study and clinical trial requirements  generally not applicable by the time a drug goes generic   There are provisions to ensure that the patenting of components of a system for restrictions on distribution and use are not used as tools to thwart generic competition  Resources  Increased drug user fees would be used to review REMS and for FDAs general drug safety surveillance Title II  Reagan  Udall Institute for Applied Biomedical Research  Establishes a non profit institute to lead collaborations amongst the FDA  academic research institutions  and industry directed to improving the process of drug  device  and biologic development and evaluation  Collaborative research projects will be selected that are designed to bolster R  D productivity  provide new tools for improving safety in drug  device  and biologic evaluation  and in the long term make product development more predictable and manageable  Like the NIH Foundation  this institute will be financially supported by both industry and the government Title III  Clinical Trials DatabasesRegistry Database  To enhance patient enrollment and provide a mechanism to track subsequent progress of trials  clinical trials of late Phase II  Phase III and Phase IV would be required to register in a publicly available database  The required data elements would be based on the World Health Organization international consensus data set Results Database  To ensure that results of trials are made public  and that patients and providers have the most current information  all Phase III and Phase IV trials would be required to deposit their results in a publicly available database  There would be a process to determine whether and when to add those Phase II trials that had to register  Several pieces of information would be placed in fields in the database entry  while the bulk of the information describing the results would be in two summary documents  lay and technical   Results could be submitted to the database but not made publicly available pending regulatory action and or publication Title IV  Conflicts of Interest The bill requires public disclosure of waivers of conflicts of interest of advisory committee members before advisory committee meetings  and greater efforts by FDA to identify qualified advisory committee members with minimal conflicts
