         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I applaud the Senator from West Virginia for his amendment  We have to put a stop to all of the taxpayer financed propaganda put out by our government to influence the American people  Over the last year  we ve found out that the Bush Administration has used taxpayer funds to finance fake news reports by actors posing as reporters  not actual journalists  who read the Administration s script on prescription drugs and the No Child Left Behind education program  Even more recently  we have found out that a number of actual real life journalists have been secretly paid by the Bush Administration to promote its political agenda  This is dangerous to our democracy  It s an unethical misuse of taxpayer funds  Senator Lautenberg and I have generated a series of investigations by the Government Accountability Office critical of the Bush Administration s propaganda efforts  We have introduced legislation  The Stop Government Propaganda Act  that the Byrd amendment compliments  Our legislation  like the Byrd amendment  specifically prevents the Administration    any Administration  Democratic or Republican    from paying actors to pose as legitimate journalists in order to push for a political agenda  I urge my colleagues to support the Byrd amendment  Congress cannot sit still while the Administration corrupts the First Amendment and freedom of the press    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
