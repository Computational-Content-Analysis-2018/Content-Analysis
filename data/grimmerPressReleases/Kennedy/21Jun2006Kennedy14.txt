         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Mr  President  I intend to support the Levin Reed amendment  and I also intend to support the Kerry amendment    Both amendments make clear that Democrats are united in our belief that its time to shift to the Iraqis the responsibility for their own future and begin to withdraw our troops from Iraq  Its wrong for the Republican controlled Congress to be a rubber stamp for the Presidents failed policy  We cant ignore our responsibility to our men and women in uniform   America was wrong to go to war in Iraq in the way we did  when we did  and for the false reasons we were given      There was no imminent threat  There was no persuasive link to Al Qaeda  Saddam Hussein was not close to acquiring a nuclear weapon    But  as my brother Robert Kennedy said in 1968  past error is no excuse for its own perpetuation  Mindless determination and foolish consistency don t make a better outcome likely    With each passing day  the American people are growing more and more impatient with the war in Iraq    They want a policy worthy of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform  not sloganeering and accusations of cut and run  When President Bush withdrew a majority of our military presence from Saudi Arabia in 2003  no one accused him of cutting and running or handing a victory to Osama bin Laden   The American people dont want our troops deployed in Iraq indefinitely  defending the same flawed strategy  Staying the course is not an acceptable strategy when the course is a failed course   Our military forces have now been deployed in Iraq for 39 months    more than three years  Thats longer than the 37 months of  combat in the Korean War    By the end of this year  it will be longer than it took to fight and win World War II  The American people want a realistic strategy for our troops to be redeployed out of Iraq  and this amendment provides it  It sends a clear message  now that a democratic government has been elected by the Iraqi people  its time for American troops to begin to come home  We need to view disengagement as part of the solution in Iraq  Our overwhelming military presence and our open ended military commitment have only fueled the insurgency  made America a crutch for the Iraqi government  made our country more hated in the world  and made the war on terrorism harder to win   The best hope for the success of the new Iraqi government to succeed is for us to begin disengaging from Iraq  and they from us  The Iraqi government must begin to make its own decisions  make necessary compromises to avoid full scale civil war  and take responsibility for its own future   As Iraqs National Security Adviser wrote in the Washington Post yesterday  Iraq has to grow out of the shadow of the United States and the coalition  take responsibility for its own decisions  learn from its own mistakes  and find Iraqi solutions to Iraqi problems  Iraq has had elections  a permanent government has been established  more than 200 000 members of Iraqi security forces have been trained  and its time begin bringing Americans home  The Levin amendment and the Kerry amendment can help us achieve that goal and prevent our troops from being caught in an endless quagmire   Mr  President  the cost of this war in blood and treasure has been far too great  More than  320 billion has already been spent  with no end in sight  A recent estimate by Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz suggests the total cost will exceed  1 trillion   Our military is stretched to the breaking point    Many soldiers have been deployed more than three times to Iraq   More than 2500 American lives have been lost  including more than 50 sons of Massachusetts  More than 18 000 of our troops have been wounded  Clearly  despite the death of Zarqawi  Al Qaeda terrorists and insurgents remain determined to kill American soldiers  Despite what Vice President Cheney says about the insurgency being in its last throes  the insurgency rages on  Last month  68 American soldiers were killed in Iraq  Insurgents attacked American soldiers 90 times a day   We always knew that deposing Saddam Hussein would be easy   But the Administration should have foreseen that winning the peace would be difficult  Unfortunately  for our men and women in uniform  the arrogance of the administration blinded it to the cold  hard realities that our troops would face every day in Iraq  Alarm bells had been ringing  but the Bush Administration ignored them   As General Hoar  former head of the Central Command  warned before the war  in September 2002  winning the peace would be bloody  He said  In urban warfareIt looks like the last 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan  General John M  Shalikashvili  former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  warned  before the war  in September of 2002  I think if it gets to urban warfare  and the likelihood is certainly great that it could   it could get very messy  The collateral damage could be very great  and our own casualties could increase significantly  In fact  in their 1997 book  A World Transformed the first President Bush and his National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft explained why they didnt go on to Baghdad in the First Gulf War  They wrote that it   would have incurred incalculable human and political costsWe would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and  in effect  rule Iraq  The coalition would instantly have collapsed  the Arabs deserting it in anger and other allies pulling out as well  Under those circumstances  there was no viable exit strategy we could see  Had we gone the invasion route  the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land  Those words eerily describe what happened when the current President Bush ignored that wise advice and invaded Iraq   Mr  President  we must not forget that ultimately this is a debate about real people who are risking their lives every day  With this amendment and the Kerry amendment  we provide a realistic way out of the quagmire in Iraq  and I urge my colleagues to support both         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
