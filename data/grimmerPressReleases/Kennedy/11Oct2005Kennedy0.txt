         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Senators Kennedy and Gregg put forth a bipartisan plan to create a new agency to ensure that the Gulf Coast region is equipped to rebuild  They believe that to get the job done right a new agency is needed  led by a non partisan person who has proven organizational skills to coordinate redevelopment efforts and cut through the red tape to ensure that federal funds are deployed swiftly  efficiently and effectively  The Gregg Kennedy plan puts a strong emphasis on local control  recognizing that while the federal government possesses the necessary resources to rebuild the devastated areas  the state and local officials know the area best and should share the decision making authority     We need a response that is as good and generous as the American people    but our existing disaster relief structures are not equipped for this monumental task  Senator Kennedy said  The residents of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans take pride in their cities and towns and they want to lead the way in reviving their own communities  But they desperately need our help  It is up to us in Congress to ensure that the region is equipped to rebuild  The plan I m proposing with Senator Gregg brings everyone around a common table to develop a blueprint for the new Gulf Coast     Senator Gregg stated  Our nation s history is not only one of growing prosperity  opportunity  and the steady progress of a free and industrious society  but it is also uniquely identified by the challenges we have faced and overcome  The people of the Gulf Coast region have suffered significant loss and devastation from the combination of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  and in response the federal government has  and will continue to  commit significant federal resources  While we continue to provide much needed assistance in federal resources  we must provide an accountable structure for ensuring that these taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and in a systematic way    In the aftermath of Katrina  Kennedy was determined to look beyond the immediate response and put in place an agenda that reflects the rich history of the region and lifts communities and neighborhoods into places of opportunity and prosperity  Over the past several weeks Senator Kennedy has visited the Gulf Coast  participated in congressional hearings  spent time with evacuees at Camp Edwards in Massachusetts and met with recovery experts and officials from the area to determine the best course of action  He has held discussion meetings with African American ministers  the president of the NAACP  and business leaders from the area to formulate this proposal for a rebuilding effort     Under their plan  the Director of the Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster Preparedness Agency will work with an Authority  composed primarily of residents from the affected area  that will develop a comprehensive plan for rebuilding the region  Governors  mayors  community leaders  business and non profit leaders  citizens and the federal government will be able to sit around the same table to develop a common blueprint for reconstructing their communities and their

Edward M  Kennedy Introduction of Gregg Kennedy Gulf Coast Recovery and Preparedness Act of 2005  As prepared for Delivery    When I last spoke on the Senate floor about Hurricane Katrina  I spoke of my visit to the region   to Louisiana and Mississippi   where I witnessed first hand the devastation to these communities  Entire blocks were left bare to their foundations where families once lived  Schools and hospitals were destroyed  Power lines were draped over fallen trees and there was water everywhere  Roads were washed out and bridges were destroyed  Much of the great city of New Orleans was under water  It was beyond what any of us could have imagined     Seeing the Gulf Coast in such a state has deeply touched me and my family in deeply personal ways  My wife Vicki and her strong and wonderful family are from Louisiana  She went to school in Louisiana  attending Tulane University  and considers New Orleans her second home     It has now been more than a month since Hurricane Katrina first hit the Gulf Coast  Hurricane Rita wreaked further havoc on the region  And although the emergency phase of the response may be over  we now fact the extraordinary challenge of rebuilding this region and restoring people s lives    Relief workers and agencies have been working tirelessly to clear debris  and connect evacuees to services and temporary housing  Just this week  New Orleans has finally been drained of all water left standing in the city  Health workers are working to address the public health challenges and the ongoing health needs of the evacuees  And states across the country continue to work with evacuees in their area to help them with housing  jobs and services    Relief and recovery efforts have revealed that we have our work cut out for us  Thousands of homes were destroyed and thousands more have water marks to the ceilings  mold and severe structural damage are everywhere  Entire schools and hospitals must be rebuilt  Roads and bridges that were washed out must be replaced  Museums with artifacts of the rich cultural tradition of the region have been damaged  Much of what has made these cities and towns vibrant has been destroyed and kept residents away from their beloved communities     We need to make these communities whole again  We need to make them stronger and healthier  We need to build the roads and bridges that will bring the many evacuees home to quality  permanent homes  and get their children back to their schools     We must rebuild the region thoughtfully and swiftly  We owe it to the residents of the region who want to come home  And we owe it to the thousands of relief workers  charities  and businesses that have come together to make the region and its residents safe and secure     It is up to us in Congress to ensure that the region is equipped to rebuild  The residents of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans take pride in their cities and towns and they want to lead the way in reviving their own communities  But they desperately need our help  That is why today  Senator Gregg and I are introducing the Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster Preparedness Act     We need a response that is as good and generous as the American people but our existing disaster relief structures are not equipped for this monumental task     The primary focus of our Department of Homeland Security is to protect the nation from terrorism  and it is imperative for that work to go on unimpeded  And FEMA is primarily a rapid response agency whose first responsibility it is to provide relief in the immediate aftermath of a disaster  Given the enormity of the number of people displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  the rebuilding will be an all consuming task  And if it is to take place as rapidly as possible  it requires the creation of a new federal entity to be an effective partner in that effort  Our bill creates a Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster Preparedness Agency to aid in the work of rebuilding the region  The enormous federal investment that will be needed to revitalize the region would be channeled through this agency  Estimates of the cost of rebuilding the region are as high as  200 billion  We need someone who will be responsible for the coordinated deployment of these dollars    The agency will be headed by a Director  an eminent  nonpartisan person with demonstrated leadership in large organizations  It will take strong leadership that has the attention of the President to coordinate redevelopment efforts and cut through the red tape to ensure that federal funds are deployed swiftly  efficiently and effectively     Under our bill  the President appoints the Director with the advice and consent of the Senate  The Director will have overall control of federal funding  personnel  and assets used for rebuilding the region     The Director of the Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster Preparedness Agency will work with an Authority  composed primarily of residents from the affected area  that will develop a comprehensive plan for rebuilding the region     Governors  mayors  community leaders  business and non profit leaders  citizens and the federal government will be able to sit around the same table to develop a common blueprint for reconstructing their communities and their lives     While only the federal government possesses the necessary resources to rebuild the devastated areas  it is essential that state and local officials who know the area best be full partners  Local residents must share the decision making authority  Creating this Authority to develop a comprehensive plan for redevelopment will guarantee that local concerns are taken seriously     How to rebuild should not be determined by the biggest  most powerful contractors  We need to work from a shared vision for the future in which we all do our part in rebuilding the new Gulf Coast     The rebuilding process does not merely involve reproducing in place the structures that existed prior to the hurricane and the flooding  although that alone would be an enormous task  It involves planning for the future of the affected communities     To develop this plan  the Authority will involve the best flood control engineers  the best community and urban development specialists  planners  and experts to address rebuilding or restoring water management facilities  environmental restoration  transportation  ports  housing  schools  hospitals  utility infrastructure  other public facilities  and employment and training  And  while we need to build water control systems and structures that will be able to withstand giant hurricanes and floods in the future  it is not just about the bricks and mortar  It is about promoting economic development and improving the quality of life for the residents of the region  it is about preserving the unique historical  cultural and architectural character of communities  and restoring the ecological resources of the region  It is about promoting access to housing  transportation  jobs and schools to residents of all incomes  We have a chance to build the Gulf economy of the future    and in doing so improve the entire nation s economic destiny  We have a chance to build a new economy that works for everyone    with diverse housing and more job opportunities     We cannot wait any longer  The people of Louisiana  the people of Mississippi  Alabama and now Texas  and the many states who have taken in evacuees  cannot wait any longer  We need to act and appoint an executive who will lead recovery and redevelopment efforts and really listen to what the residents of the Gulf Coast  its community leaders  business leaders and elected officials really need  All of those who visited the region and those who have seen images of the devastation on TV recognize that rebuilding the Gulf Coast requires an unprecedented national effort  It must be a principal focus of our national government in the months ahead and it must be done in a genuine collaboration with the people of the affected region  I want to commend my colleague Senator Gregg who has worked very hard to ensure that we come up with a sensible way of addressing the enormous challenge of rebuilding that lies ahead  We believe that a Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster Preparedness Director and a Gulf Coast Revitalization Authority is the best way to combine the federal resources and coordination with real local involvement in the decision making process    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
