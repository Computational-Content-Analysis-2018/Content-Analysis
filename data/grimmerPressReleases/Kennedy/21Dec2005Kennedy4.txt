         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC    While Senator Bill Frist attempts to insert into the Department of Defense Appropriations Conference Report a last minute provision to provide virtually unlimited liability protection to the drug industry and no money for compensation to victims  Senators Kennedy  Harkin and Dodd joined together to protest this special interest giveaway  Standing with Nancy Hughes  a registered nurse  the leaders discussed how this liability protection will do nothing to protect those who will receive these vaccines and thus fails to protect Americans from the avian flu     It s astonishing that the response of our Republican colleagues to the danger of pandemic flu is to reduce the funds to prepare for it  and use this danger as an excuse for yet another giveaway to their friends in the drug industry  But that s just what they ve done  said Senator Kennedy  America can do better than this special interest vaccine plan that will fail to protect us from the flu  One drug company that is pushing vehemently for this provision is Sanofi Pasteur which is under FDA investigation for being connected to at least five cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome caused by its meningococcal vaccine  Under Frist s plan  Sanofi Pasteur could be let off the hook without paying a dime  if Secretary Leavitt declares a meningitis epidemic  And Leavitt has stated recently  as reported by Newsweek that we re seeing an epidemic of chronic diseases    Proponents of Frist s plan claim that the debate is about endless lawsuits against the companies that make the vaccines  but that couldn t be farther from the truth  Kennedy and Dodd have proposed some important legal protections for drug companies that make pandemic flu and countermeasures for responding to terrorist attacks and a compensation program modeled after the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for routine childhood vaccines  Without a real compensation program  the liability protection in the defense bill provides a Christmas present to the drug industry and bag of coal to everyday Americans  Below is a summary of Senator Frist s proposal     DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE BIODEFENSE LIABILITY PROVISION Scope of Immunity  Drug companies receive effectively complete immunity from suit for injuries caused by countermeasures identified in a declaration by the Secretary of Health and Human Services  Others  such as doctors  receive effectively complete immunity from suit for injuries caused by countermeasures administered pursuant to such a declaration  A countermeasure can include any medical product to prevent  treat  mitigate  or diagnose an epidemic    State statutes and regulations  not just liability law  are completely preempted during a declaration    Example  Senator Frist and other Republicans have variously called diabetes  obesity  methamphetamine addiction  and arthritis epidemics  Manufacturers of products for these common diseases and symptoms  including Vioxx  could be given complete immunity protections under the bill     Limit on immunity  bad actors   An injured person can break the immunity only if he or she can prove using clear and convincing evidence that the bad actor  for example  the drug company or the person who administered the medical product  acted with willful misconduct  This standard will be essentially impossible to meet    Willful misconduct includes only acts or omissions taken  intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose   knowingly without legal or factual justification  and  in disregard of known or obvious risks that are so great as to make it highly probable that the harm will outweigh the benefit    Gross negligence and recklessness are excluded  The Secretary of Health and Human Services must amend the definition of willful misconduct by regulation  but only to make it even narrower    An administrator  such as a doctor  can act with such willful misconduct and may still be immune if it reports the injury within 7 days    A drug manufacturer can act with such willful misconduct and is still immune unless FDA initiates and wins an enforcement action against it  FDA inaction blocks injured patients from pursuing redress     Injured persons must meet extraordinary hurdles to bring a lawsuit  including bringing the suit in Washington  DC  heightened pleading requirements  and very limited discovery    The Secretary s declarations are not subject to judicial review    Example  The Bush Administration could identify Vioxx as a needed countermeasure to treat the arthritis epidemic or to treat pain associated with flu  and completely immunize Merck even from lawsuits currently pending against it  as FDA has taken no enforcement action against Merck     Example  Had contaminated Chiron flu vaccine been distributed in 2004 and harmed people  the Bush Administration could have issued a declaration to immunize the company completely from liability     Example  A health care provider who gives a countermeasure to a person to kill him or her could be immune from any liability if the provider reports the death within 7 days    Compensation  A compensation fund is established when the Secretary of Health and Human Services issues an immunity declaration  The fund covers serious injury or death that is directly caused by a countermeasure to persons who the Secretary determines are eligible because they are specified in the declaration  The drug company s immunity is broader  it s for all people given the drug during the effective period of the declaration  even if outside the geographic region specified in the declaration  or for a use not specified in the declaration   and there is no money in the fund unless Congress appropriates the money after the declaration  No money is appropriated in this bill    Example  The Secretary of Health and Human Services immunizes Sanofi  a vaccine company  from liability for any injuries caused by its pandemic flu vaccine  promising a compensation fund  but House Republicans block funding because of deficit concerns  Lack of compensation funds deters first responders from getting vaccinated and the nation s response to the pandemic is critically undermined when many of them are stricken by pandemic flu   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
