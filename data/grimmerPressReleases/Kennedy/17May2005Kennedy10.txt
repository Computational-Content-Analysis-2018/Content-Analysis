human smuggling     To further improve border enforcement  the bill improves the security of Mexico s southern border and assesses the needs of Central American governments in securing their borders

is description of all the provisions of the bill     STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM AND STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SECUITY     Mr  Chairman  thank you for calling this important hearing on the need for comprehensive immigration reform    Current enforcement policies are not effective  but harsh immigration restrictions won t work either  We can t seal our borders to the millions of tourists  students  and business men and women who come to the United States each year  and we can t deport the millions of illegal workers here in the United States without crippling our economy     In the last 10 years  the government has spent more than  20 billion to enforce our immigration laws  Yet  none of our efforts have been adequate  We ve tripled the number of border patrol agents  improved surveillance technology  and installed other controls to strengthen border enforcement  Yet  illegal immigration continues  The proof is in the numbers  The number in the nation is now estimated at nearly 11 million  and it increases by almost 500 000 a year  Those already here are not leaving  and new immigrants keep coming in    The solution is an immigration reform that is comprehensive  Enhancing enforcement or border security alone won t solve the problem  Without comprehensive reform  the status quo will continue and our immigration and border security system will remain dangerously flawed    Last week  Senators McCain  Brownback  Lieberman  Graham  Salazar  and I introduced bipartisan legislation to modernize our broken immigration system to meet the challenges of the 21st century  Our bill will make our immigration policies more realistic and enforceable  restore legality as the prevailing norm  and make it easier for immigrants to cooperate with local authorities     It will protect the labor rights of all workers  and create a level playing field for employers  It will strengthen our economy  restore control of our borders  and improve national security  The bill reflects the basic values of family unity  fundamental fairness  and opportunity that are at the heart of our heritage as a nation of immigrants  I look forward to working with Senator Cornyn and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact it into law     I firmly believe that we need to legalize the flow of people at our borders in order to strengthen our security and reduce threats from terrorists  Temporary worker proposals that would require the worker to go home after a period of time won t do the job  We know what will happen  Undocumented workers will not come out of the shadows and sign up for a temporary worker program  They ve spent years in this country  working hard  paying taxes  and raising their children  They contribute significantly to the strength of our economy  Registering for employment now to be deported tomorrow is unfair  It won t work  it won t reduce the size of the illegal population  and it won t free up resources to target suspected terrorists and criminals     We need an earned legalization program that will encourage undocumented workers to come forward and report to the authorities  enabling our government to properly screen and document them  Reducing the size of the undocumented population reduces the ability of terrorists to hide    A genuine earned legalization program for undocumented workers  plus a revised temporary worker program with protections for both U S  and foreign workers  a realistic path to citizenship for all deserving immigrants  a way to unite immigrant families  and strong border security provisions all make up critical components of comprehensive and effective immigration reform     We know that these reforms are long overdue  The illegal workers here today are not leaving  and new ones continue to come in  A significant part of the workforce in many sectors of the economy is undocumented  Massive deportations are unrealistic as policy  impractical to carryout  and unacceptable to businesses that rely heavily on their labor  Americans want and deserve realistic solutions  They don t want open borders  and they don t want closed borders  They want smart borders    We must replace the illegal flow with regulated  legal immigration  Detractors of this concept distort it as an amnesty proposal  but it is not an amnesty  Our goal is to bring the underground economy  above ground  and recognizing the reality of immigrants in our workplace     I thank our witnesses at today s hearing  and I look forward to their insights on these important challenges    SECURE AMERICA AND ORDERLY IMMIGRATION ACT  at a Glance 5 12 2005   Title I  Border Security  Requires the development of various plans and reports evaluating information
