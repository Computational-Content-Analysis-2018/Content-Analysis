         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The President s admission that he authorized spying on our fellow citizens without judicial approval is a crystal clear signal that we must take a step back and not rush reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act    further risking our civil protections  We can do so    without any gap in our current counter terrorism efforts    with a brief extension that maintains existing law     This morning and over the past few days  we have heard a lot about whether America will be safer if the Senate approves the PATRIOT Act conference report before the end of the year  For President Bush and the Republican leadership to make this assertion is a fear tactic  plain and simple  and it s wrong  Legitimate fears about terrorism should not be an excuse to short cut basic civil liberties  nor mislead the American people about the impact on current counter terrorism efforts  Indeed  ongoing intelligence investigations shall continue unaffected    and uninterrupted    even if the sixteen expiring provisions are not re authorized by December 31st     But let s set the record straight  opponents of the conference report do not want these tools to expire and our national security will not be jeopardized    at all    if existing laws are extended for three more months     Whether this week or in the next ninety days  Congress should work to achieve a bipartisan consensus that protects both our security and our liberty    while restoring the public trust  In current form  this conference report fails to do all that we can to improve intelligence capabilities in a manner that improves the safeguards that are indispensable to our democracy     Specifically  with regard to National Security Letters  one of the most glaring omissions in the conference report is the failure to include a sunset provision for National Security Letters  which would be consistent and logical given the new reporting and auditing provisions contained in the conference report  Without a doubt  it is more meaningful to have a sunset on a provision used 30 000 times than one that is used only 35     Given the latest revelations  more Congressional oversight is needed as well as an independent investigation into the activities of the National Security Agency  There are serious questions about whether this Administration evades laws in ways that violate our liberties  There is no accountability    and there must be more oversight  Without further delay  Congress must also ensure that the Administration is following through on the creation of an independent and serious Privacy and Civil Liberties Board to review these disturbing allegations     We all agree on the need for law enforcement and intelligence officers to have strong powers to investigate terrorism  to prevent future attacks  and improve information sharing between federal  state and local law enforcement  In the wake of the tragic events on September 11th  Congress  the Administration and the country faced the urgent need to do everything possible to strengthen our national security and counterterrorism efforts  and the original PATRIOT Act was our response to that need     Even at that time though  many of us had concerns about whether the law went too far  In November 2001  Nancy Talanian and a small group of neighbors in Western Massachusetts came together to launch the Bill of Rights Defense Committee    what has now become a nationwide movement to protect the Bill of Rights     This small Massachusetts group encouraged similar community discussions across the country  Seven states and hundreds of local governments engaged in vigorous public debate on the scope of the PATRIOT Act  As of this week  400 resolutions have been passed    These concerns    much less those raised in the last 24 hours    can t be casually dismissed because the Administration claims there have not been any unconstitutional searches or verified abuses of the PATRIOT Act  Civil liberty protections are a continuing source of our country s strength    not just fringe benefits to be abandoned in time of crisis  We can t protect our borders if we don t protect our ideals     The Administration wants to get this bill done    but the American people want it done right  Our Senate bill included the necessary assistance for law enforcement  while maintaining fundamental protections in accord with the Bill of Rights  As a result  it received unanimous approval of the entire Senate     It is short sighted and irresponsible for the President to draw a line in the sand against our bipartisan efforts to extend the deadline for the expiring provisions for another 90 days  With a March 31 deadline  we can deal responsibly with the major issues still on the table  Serious concerns about the standards and oversight of the most contentious surveillance methods can and must be addressed     The entire world is watching to see how we strike the balance between intelligence gathering and the Constitution  Let s take the necessary time to reach a bicameral  bipartisan consensus that restores the public trust           Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202
