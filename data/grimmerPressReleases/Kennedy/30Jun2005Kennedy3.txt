         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C     Today  Senators Kennedy and Alexander convened a hearing to examine history standards in schools and the need to promote American history in school curriculum  David McCullough  historian and author of National Book Award winning 1776 and New York Times bestseller John Adams  testified before the committee and shared his thoughts on how our schools can improve the teaching and learning of America s past Instilling appreciation of America s past    teaching the values of liberty  justice  equality  and civic responsibility    should be an important mission of every school  Senator Kennedy said  Thanks to the efforts of large numbers of teachers of history and civics in classrooms throughout America  we re making progress  But much more remains to be done to advance their understanding of the subject  We need high standards for civic education  more opportunities for internships and service learning  and stronger partnerships between schools and community organizations to involve young people more fully in the life of their communities Kennedy and Alexander have offered legislation to address the underachievement of American students in history  acknowledging that students still consistently score lower on American history than on any other course  The American History Achievement Act would encourage states to make progress on their U S  history standards  elevate the standing of American history in curriculum  and promote better teaching of the subject in classrooms Specifically  the bill would create a new 10 state pilot assessment of U S  History and Civics  administered in grades 8 and 12  through the National Assessment of Educational Progress  NAEP   It would also provide for a more frequent national analysis of learning in American history  by assigning priority to the U S  history NAEP at the national level Below are Senator Kennedy s remarks at today s hearing Thank you  Mr  Chairman for convening this important hearing  We re fortunate to have such a distinguished panel with us today to discuss how our schools can improve the teaching and learning of America s past  We re honored that one of the nation s great historians    David McCullough    could join us this afternoon As you know  Mr  Chairman  I share your appreciation of the importance of history as the foundation for the nation s continuing ideals and our schools can contribute immeasurably to each generation s commitment to those ideals  America s economy and security today require strong skills in math and science  and the No Child Left Behind Act supports the development of these skills  But our democracy and our future in the world depend on much more It s no surprise that readers in droves are turning to David McCullough s 1776  Anyone concerned about the quagmire in Iraq today can t help but be reassured that in the dark days of the Revolutionary War in 1776  we summoned the leadership to find our way out of that quagmire  and hopefully we can do it again  As George Santayana wrote in 1905  Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it  Or  as H  G  Wells put it in 1921  Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe Instilling appreciation of America s past    teaching the values of liberty  justice  equality  and civic responsibility    should be an important mission of every school  Thanks to the efforts of large numbers of teachers of history and civics in classrooms throughout America  we re making progress According to the results of the most recent assessment by the National Assessment of Educational Progress  fourth and eighth grade students are improving their knowledge of American history  Children are using primary sources and documents more often to explore history  and are being assigned historical and biographical readings by their teachers more frequently But much more remains to be done to advance their understanding of the subject  Students still consistently score lower on American history than on any other course  A recent study by Sheldon Stern    the Chief Historian Emeritus at my brother s Presidential Library in Boston    suggests that state standards for teaching American history need improvement  His research reveals that 22 states have American history standards that are either weak or lack clear chronology and appropriate political and historical context  or sufficient information about real events and people  As many as nine states still have no standards at all for American history Good standards matter  They re the foundation for teaching and learning in every school  Every state should have creative and effective history standards  Massachusetts began to do so in 2000  through a joint review of history standards by teachers  administrators  curriculum coordinators  and university professors  After monthly meetings and three years of development and revision  the state released a new framework for teaching history in 2003  Today  our standards in both American history and world history receive the highest marks Higher academic achievement in reading and math obviously do not have to come at the expense of subjects such as history  Students can build literacy and number skills in a history or geography course too  Interdisciplinary approaches are consistent with the No Child Left Behind Act s promise of high quality education for each student Achieving this goal requires better teacher preparation  better certification  and better support for new teachers  Greater investments are needed to improve the quality    not just the quantity    of student assessments  We must continue to support efforts under the No Child Left Behind Act such as the Teaching of Traditional American History program  to help teachers improve instruction It s a privilege to join our Chairman  Senator Alexander  again in this Congress in introducing the American History Achievement Act  to establish a strong national commitment to teaching history and civics in the nation s public schools  It will lay the foundation for higher standards and more effective ways of teaching about the nation s past  and provides a more frequent and effective analysis of how well America s students are learning these important subjects We ve included civic education in the bill as well  The strength of our democracy and the health of our communities depend on informed  caring  and active citizens  We cannot protect our freedom without emphasizing the character of our citizens Every young person should have an education that provides them with the skills they need to be good citizens  such as knowledge of government  law  and democracy  and the ability to understand and analyze important issues of the day  We need high standards for civic education  more opportunities for internships and service learning  and stronger partnerships between schools and community organizations to involve young people more fully in the life of their communities Today s students will be better citizens in the future if they learn about our history and learn the skills needed to participate in our democracy   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
