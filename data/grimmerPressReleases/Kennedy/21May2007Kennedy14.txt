         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today  we take up the solemn task of immigration reform  not just because we may  but because we must Our security is threatened in the post 9 11 world by borders out of control Our values are tarnished when we allow 12 million human beings to live in the dark shadows of abuse as undocumented immigrants  Our economy is harmed when our immigration system fails to protect the American dream of a good job and decent wages Our competitiveness in the global economy is at risk when our employers cannot find the able workers they need Our immigration system is adrift and urgently needs an overhaul from top to bottom   The answers are not simple or easy   We cannot meet this challenge by simply building fences   We need comprehensive and common sense solutions that meet the immigration needs of this century   We begin this debate mindful that immigration issues are always controversial   There are strong views on every side of this question because the issue goes to the heart of who we are as a nation and as an American people But we should remember in this debate that we are writing the next chapter of American history   Immigrants made the America of today and will help make the America of the future   I am reminded of this awesome responsibility each time I gaze from the windows of my office in Boston   I can see the Golden Stairs from Boston Harbor where all eight of my great grandparents set foot on this great land for the first time   They walked up to Bostons Immigration Hall on their way to a better life for themselves and their families So many Americans can tell similar stories of ancestors who came from somewhere else   Some built our cities   Some toiled on our railroads   Some came in slavery  others to raise their families and live and worship in freedom That immigrant spirit of limitless possibility animates America even today Today  immigrants harvest our crops  care for our children  and own small businesses They serve with pride in our armed forces  70 000 in all   At this very moment  many are risking their lives for America in Iraq and Afghanistan Immigrants contribute to scientific discovery  to culture and the arts   They help make our economy the most vibrant one on the planet Our strength  our diversity  our innovation  our music  our hard work  our love of country  our dedication to family  faith and community  these are the fruits of our immigrant heritage and the source of our national strength   They have made America the envy of the world As President John F  Kennedy so eloquently wrote  the secret of America is that we are a nation of people with the fresh memory of old traditions who dared to explore new frontiers  people eager to build lives for themselves in a spacious society that did not restrict their freedom of choice and action   Last week  we reached an historic agreement on a far reaching bipartisan immigration plan that lives up to this heritage   It involved hard negotiations between Democrats and Republicans and it has the support of President Bush   Our plan is strong  realistic and fair   It is a common sense immigration policy for our times It is tough at the border   It doubles our Border Patrol from 14 000 agents to 28 000   It hires 800 new investigators and 800 anti smuggling officers   It builds more fences and more detention centers  and provides more state of the art  high tech border enforcement equipment It is tough on employers who hire illegal immigrants in defiance of the law   Today  its too easy for an employer to hire an undocumented worker and pay them substandard wages in sweatshop conditions   That hurts American workers   It depresses wages   It allows employers to avoid paying payroll taxes   Our bill says no more worker abuse   Under our plan  employers must verify that they hire only legal workers   If they dont  they can be fined up to  5 000 for a first offense and up to  75 000 for subsequent offenses   They can even go to jail Our bill says that these tough enforcement measures must be in place first before we move forward with changes in future immigration   Future workers cannot come in until weve doubled the Border Patrol  built more fences  enhanced our equipment and technology along the border  and the employer verification system has begun   Its enforcement first and future workers later Our plan also addresses the 12 million undocumented immigrants who are in America today   They have something to contribute   They are men and women of dignity   They work hard every day   They care for their families   They revitalize decaying neighborhoods   They sit in our pews on Sundays   We witnessed this recently in my own state of Massachusetts   An immigration raid in New Bedford disrupted the lives scores of families who had laid down roots in the New Bedford community   Their children were in our schools  many of them born in America   They worked every day in a factory making equipment for our troops in Iraq Were not going to round up these 12 million men  women and children and send them home   Thats not the American way   So our plan allows these families to earn the privilege of remaining here and working legally   They have to pay a  5000 fine over an eight year period They have to work and pay taxes They have to learn English They cannot be criminals or national security risks and they must obey our laws The heads of family must make a trip home for a day or two sometime in the next eight years to submit their applications for a green card at an American consulate just like other immigrants applying to come here   Then they are guaranteed the right to come right back to America right away to rejoin their families while they wait for their green card applications to be considered  Finally  they have to get in line for their green cards behind everyone else who has been waiting to come here legally If they meet these tests  they will be welcomed into the sunshine of America   They will have no fear in coming forward and joining the American family   They will not be deported   Instead  we welcome them as our neighbors and friends and as future citizens of this great land Our plan also continues to stress family reunification  a longstanding tradition under our immigration laws Today  if youre trying to bring your relatives here legally  you might have to wait 22 years to get visas for them   As a result of this backlog  four million family members of American citizens and legal immigrants are on the waiting list to come here   Our plan expedites the reunion of these families and eliminates the waiting list in eight years   In the future  our plan continues to make family reunion the highest priority   It says if you are an American citizen or a legal immigrant  you can bring your immediate family here to join you  your wife or husband  your minor children  and your parents Of the one million green cards we issue each year  two thirds will be dedicated to reuniting these families But under our plan  more distant relatives will no longer have an automatic right to immigrate   They must first prove that they have the skills  education and English abilities to contribute fully to our economic strength Finally  our plan recognizes that our economy will continue to need hardworking people who are willing to come here for a few years   We need nurses and home health care aides   We need farm workers and janitors and hotel workers   We need computer programmers and scientists and engineers   So our program will allow them to come as guest workers under a program with strong labor laws that protect American jobs and wages Our plan is a compromise   It involved give and take in the best traditions of the United States Senate   For each of us who crafted it  there are elements that we strongly support and elements we believe could be improved   No one believes this is a perfect bill  But after weeks of negotiations and years of debate  this bill accomplishes our core goals   It provides tough new enforcement at the border and the worksite   It allows a realistic path to family security and eventual citizenship for millions of men  women and children already here   And it provides a new system for allocating visas in the future that stresses family reunion and national economic needs I dont usually quote Republican presidents  but President Reagan understood the integral role that immigration plays in our countrys future   As he said so eloquently in one of his last speeches before leaving the White House  We lead the world because  unique among nations  we draw our people  our strength  from every country and every corner of the world   And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation   While other countries cling to the stale past  here in America we breathe new life into dreams   We create the future  and the world follows us into tomorrow   Thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity  were a nation forever young  forever bursting with energy and new ideas  and always on the cutting edge  always leading the world to the next frontier   This quality is vital to our future as a nation   If we ever closed the door to new Americans  our leadership in the world would soon be lost  The world is watching to see how we respond to the current crisis   Lets not disappoint them I urge my colleagues to vote to proceed to this debate and to support our new plan     BORDER ENFORCEMENT AND TRIGGERSSecure Borders  Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 Comprehensive immigration reform must include measurable border enforcement benchmarks or triggers   The bill provides that implementation of the temporary worker program takes place only after the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that    1     Staff Enhancements for Border Patrol    Customs and Border Protection has increased to 18 000 agents from 14 500    3 500 of 14 000 new agents mandated by the bill must be in place to set off the trigger  2     Strong Border barriers   The installation of at least 200 miles of vehicle barriers  370 miles of fencing  and 70 ground based radar and camera towers  along with 4 unmanned aerial vehicles along the southern border 3     Catch and Return   The detention of all removable aliens

The Department of Homeland Security is using secure and effective identification tools to prevent unauthorized workers from obtaining jobs in the U S  These tools include the use of tamper proof identification documents and an effective electronic employment eligibility verification system 5     Processing applications of Aliens   DHS is processing applications for earned legalization status in a timely manner  including the background and security checks The bill states that it is the sense of Congress that the border security and other measures can be completed within 18 months of enactment  The President must submit a report to Congress 90 days after enactment and every 90 days thereafter detailing progress made in funding  appropriating  contractual agreements reached and specific progress with regard to meeting these triggers   If not enough progress is being made  the President must include specific spending recommendations or other actions  TITLE I  BORDER

communities   Sets up a Commission with membership from states and local communities to recommend border enforcement strategies  programs  and policies to the President and Congress FAMILY REUNIFICATION REMAINS THE CORNERSTONE OF LEGAL IMMIGRATIONSecure Borders  Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 The plan maintains that more than a majority of future immigration will be based on family ties   That couldnt be more important   Family reunification has been the cornerstone of our immigration policy for decades and under this proposal it still will be  For the next 8 years  family based immigration will total 1 1 million legal immigrants  which is approximately 80  of all legal immigration Over these 8 years  an additional 567 000 visas will be added to the system annually to eliminate the current backlog of four million family members waiting legally in line as of May 2005   Adult children and siblings will particularly benefit from this increase as current waiting times in those categories can be as much as 22 years No change to the law regarding spouses and minor children of U S  citizens  who will continue to enter the U S  without limitation  Parents of U S  citizens will continue to be eligible for immigrant visas   40 000 parent green cards will be available annually   Parents will also be eligible for special visitor visas permitting them to stay in the U S  for a limited period of time annually   Families of future temporary workers will also be eligible for special visitor visas 5 000 new hardship green cards will be available to the extended families of U S  citizens  ie  adult children and siblings    This will allow immediate family reunification for these more distant relatives if there are medical our other hardships facing the family that require the relatives presence  When current backlogs are eliminated  after 8 years   the 140 000 visas allocated today to adult children and siblings will be shifted to the new point system   In the future  adult children and siblings will no longer be eligible for green cards based solely on family relationships  but can receive green cards under the new point system if they also have skills that are needed in the U S  economy  CURRENT LAW    BACKLOG REDUCTION  first 8 years after enactment  POST  BACKLOGFAMILY 980 000    1 100 000    627 000 EMPLOYMENT 140 000

temporary workers that will have strong labor protections   This will help people who risk their lives crossing the border for a job will have the chance to apply for good jobs in the United States   And it helps strengthen the backbone of our economy Creates a new temporary worker program  Y Visa Program  to meet U S  labor needs   Provides 400 000 visas per year for temporary workers coming to the U S  to meet labor needs   This cap can be adjusted based on market needs to a maximum of 600 000 visas annually Ensures that Y visa holders are working while they are in the U S   Workers are allowed short periods to look for new work  60 consecutive days   and can only be unemployed for 120 days  total  over the duration of the visa   Encourages Circular Movement  Workers  not accompanied by dependents  can work in the U S  for 2 years and can be extended for 2 additional two year periods  6 years total  provided the worker resides 1 year outside the U S  between each 2 year extension   Workers who bring their spouse and kids to the U S  are limited to 2 two year periods  but the family may only remain during 1 of the two two year periods   The family must also demonstrate household income that is 150  of the U S  poverty guidelines and that the cost of medical care is covered by medical insurance Reforms the H 2A Program   The bill replaces the bureaucratic  unworkable and uncertain H 2A agricultural program with a streamlined attestation process like the one now used for H 1B high tech workers  speeding up the ability of growers to hire temporary workers when U S  workers are not available   Strong worker protections  like adverse effect wage rate and the 50  rule  are maintained to protect both U S  and foreign workers   Increases H 2B Visas   H 2B visas are now known as Y 2B visas   These seasonal visas have a limit of 100 000 visas annually but can be increased to 200 000 visas annually based on labor market needs  Increases H 1B Visas   Raises the FY 2008 cap to 115 000 visas annually but can be raised to 180 000 visas annually based on labor market needs Protections Against H 1B Fraud and Abuse   Enhances protections for American workers and give the federal government more authority to enforce program requirements Medical Services in Underserved Areas   Conrad 30 program is authorized permanently   Previously  the program had to be reauthorized every 2 years   The purpose of the program is to increase the supply of physicians to rural areas that need qualified primary care physicians and specialists in critical areas of medicine such as diabetes  cardiology and orthopedic medicine   WORKER PROTECTIONS IN THE Y VISA PROGRAMSecure Borders  Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 Provides a legal way for needed workers to enter the U S   Many low wage jobs in the U S  today are filled by undocumented workers who have few rights and are afraid to speak up about workplace abuses  Replacing this broken system with Y visa workers who have the same protections as U S  workers is vital to ending worker exploitation  The program also protects American workers by ensuring they will always receive the first opportunity to hold these jobs and will not be unfairly undercut by vulnerable immigrant workers  The Y visa program  Requires Employers to Look for American Workers First  Employers who want to bring in Y visa workers must      Recruit U S  workers beginning at least 90 days before applying to the Y program  and extensively advertise the job so U S  workers can apply    Offer the job to any eligible U S  worker      Ensure that they have not displaced a similarly employed U S  worker   Restricts Employers in High Unemployment Areas from Bringing in Workers  Employers in counties where the unemployment rate is more than 7 percent cannot bring in Y visa workers unless they receive a waiver from the Department of Labor   Bars Bad Actors from Participating in the Y Visa Program  Employers who violate the terms of the Y visa program  as well as employers who have repeatedly or willfully violated our wage and hour laws or committed egregious health and safety violations  are barred from seeking Y visa workers for up to three years  Violators of human trafficking laws are permanently barred  Ensures a Level Playing Field   Y visa workers must receive the same wages  benefits  and working conditions as similarly employed U S  workers  This includes paying at least a local prevailing wage  calculated based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data   so that American workers are not forced to compete against artificially low wages  Y visa workers can move to other jobs so long as those employers have complied with the requirements of the program  Y visa workers have whistleblower protections from intimidation or threats  and maybe permitted to stay in the country to provide needed evidence in cases involving labor and immigration law violations  Requires Employers To Cover Workplace Injury Costs  If the position is not covered by workers compensation insurance  the employer must provide equivalent insurance  Prevents End run around Tax and Employment Laws  Y visa workers cannot be treated as independent contractors  This helps to ensure that state and federal taxes and workers compensation are paid and reported for all Y visa workers  and legal wages are paid to Y visa workers  Establishes Strict Monitoring of Labor Recruiters   Each foreign labor recruiter must provide accurate information about the jobs advertised  Recruiters cannot charge workers for their recruitment  Workers have the right to enforce the terms that labor recruiters promise  Recruiters must register with DOL and post a bond to ensure that workers are adequately protected Provides Tough Penalties for Those Who Break the Law and Gives the Government Strong Enforcement Authority  Workers who are harmed by employers who break the law can seek unpaid backpay and benefits  The Department of Labor can impose stiff penalties up to  5 000 per violation per affected worker in the case of willful violations  Additional fines apply when willful violations harm American workers  Department of Labor is authorized to hire 1 000 additional staff to investigate violations and enforce labor laws    THE MERIT SYSTEM RESPONDS TO U S  ECONOMIC NEEDS Secure Borders  Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 A merit based system will be added to the family based immigration system  accounting for about a third of all future immigration   It will factor in preferences for both high skilled and low skilled workers  as well as extended family ties  Encourages the immigration of workers of all skill levels  America needs workers of all skill levels to keep our economy thriving   The merit system provides this balance  rewarding those who     Work in professional  specialty occupations requiring particularized skills     Work in one of the 30 high demand occupations predicted to have the largest growth in the next decade  such as home health aides  maintenance and repair workers  carpenters  truck drivers  and teaching assistants       Work in critically needed science  technology  engineering  math  or health fields Rewards those who have worked hard to benefit the American economy  as well as those who show great promise as workers   Points are granted for      Temporary Workers whose employers attest that they provide an integral skill for their businesses      Workers years of employment with a U S  company      Prospective immigrants who have a job offer from a U S  employer Develops a highly educated  well trained workforce that is key to our competitiveness in the global economy   The merit system strongly rewards highly educated workers at the forefront of their fields  It also encourages lower skilled workers to pursue educational opportunities  from a GED to a skilled trade   Workers receive points for a variety of educational accomplishments     An advanced degree  like an M D  or Ph D     A Bachelors or Associates degree     A high school diploma or GED     Completion of an apprenticeship program     Completion of a vocational education program Workers with high sought post secondary degrees in science  technology  engineering  math  or health occupations receive additional points Encourages Knowledge of English and Civics   English and basic civics knowledge helps immigrant workers to succeed in the American workforce and become integrated into our communities  The merit system rewards those who pursue these skills  providing points for both mastery of the language  demonstrated by a high score on the TOEFL test  or basic proficiency  demonstrated by passing the USCIC Citizenship Test in English and Civics  Recognizes Family Connections   People who have families in this country are more likely to become active  contributing members of our society   The merit system recognizes the value of these connections  providing extra points for workers who have close family legally residing in the U S   once those workers have shown that they have job skills we need   THE MERIT SYSTEM   HOW DO THEY FARE Secure Borders  Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 Under the bill  380 000 visas will be allocated each year to immigration under a new merit based point system   100 points are possible   The 380 000 applicants with the highest point totals will be awarded visas   Below are examples of individuals who would earn substantial points under

and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 The 12 million undocumented workers who are here should be offered the chance to earn their legalization  immediately    If this agreement becomes law it will provide a historic opportunity for millions of hard working people right away Millions Out of the Shadows   The bill creates a new category of Z workers and their families who will be eligible to live and work legally in the U S  and who may  after demonstrating a history of employment or study in the U S   learning English  paying taxes  and abiding by all laws  have the opportunity to become legal permanent residents after eight years   In order to encourage full participation  strict confidentiality provisions protect information submitted in a Z application   Current estimates suggest that more than twelve million undocumented immigrants may come out of the shadows and begin a new life with this program Basic Eligibility Requirements   Z visas will be available to undocumented immigrants  their spouses  children  and parents over the age of 65  who entered the U S  prior to January 1  2007  who are not criminals  security risks  or persecutors and who can establish that  but for their unlawful entry or presence  they are otherwise admissible to the U S   Registration for the program will begin 6 months after enactment and will be open for one year  the Secretary of DHS may extend registration for an additional year if necessary  Probationary Status   Within 24 hours of submission of fingerprints and an application package  an applicant will be entitled to a probationary Z status that makes the holder work eligible and protects him or her from removal or deportation   During this time  the probationary Z holder will also be permitted to travel if he or she receives permission from DHS   During this probationary period  DHS will continue to review applications and do more in depth background checks as necessary Permanent Z Status   Approximately 18 months after initial registration  after the bills trigger requirements are met  DHS will issue permanent Z status cards to all probationary Z holders who continue to qualify for the benefit   The

without immigrant farm workers  Yet  the overwhelming majority of these workers today are not legal immigrants   The AgJobs provisions in this bill reflect a far reaching agreement between the United Farm Workers and the agricultural industry to remedy one of the most difficult immigration challenges our nation faces   It provides a fair and reasonable means for illegal agricultural workers to earn legal status  Highlights of the Earned Legalization Program for Ag Workers Requires that undocumented agricultural workers apply for a Z A visa if they can demonstrate that they have worked in American agriculture for at least 150 work days within the previous 2 years before 12 31 06   Requires that Z A visa holders demonstrate that they have worked in American agriculture for an additional 150 work days per year for 3 years  or 100 work days per year for 5 years to get a green card   They can receive the card eight years after enactment when the backlog of current green card applicants is cleared  No more than 1 5 million blue cards may be issued over the 5 year period and the program will sunset after 5 years   Individuals may participate in employment other than agriculture so long as the worker satisfies the 100 or 150 workdays each year  and if they dont they will lose their status  Workers participating in the program will be required to pay a fine  and show that they are current on their taxes  and learn English  To avoid backlogs  agricultural workers who receive a green card under this program will be exempt from the overall numerical limitations on visas  TITLE VI  DREAM Act Secure Borders  Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 The Development  Relief  and Education for Alien Minors  DREAM  Act would help a select group of intelligent

but do not qualify for federal assistance to pay for college   Because they are undocumented  they could be deported at any time   The DREAM Act would give them an opportunity to achieve the American dream Some of the people who would benefit from the DREAM Act include A female student at Boston Latin Academy who has lived in the United States since she was 4 years old   She is fluent in English  French  and Portuguese and was among 3 seniors in her class selected to mentor new students   She is determined to be the first member of her family to attend college and become a lawyer   A teenager
