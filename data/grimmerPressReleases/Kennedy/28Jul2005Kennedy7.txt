         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     This bill is deceptively named the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act  But it will make it virtually impossible to bring lawsuits against the gun industry  even in circumstances in which the industry s conduct contributes to unlawful gun violence  The bill purports to exempt suits in which the manufacturers and sellers engage in illegal or negligent conduct  but these exemptions are poorly defined and clearly would not cover many types of bad conduct     The Senate Majority Leader says this bill is of urgent importance  taking precedence over the defense bill  because the Department of Defense faces the real prospect of having to outsource sidearms for our soldiers to foreign manufacturers     The Republican leadership and the Bush Administration will do whatever it takes to give the gun industry all it wants  The NRA wants gun dealers and manufacturers to be protected from lawsuits  The NRA expects    the NRA demands    that this body remove the last resort for victims of gun violence against negligent    and often complicit    gun dealers and manufacturers by barring all types of cases    Let s be clear about what this bill does not do     It does not help our law enforcement officials fight crime or terrorism     It does not meet the urgent need to strengthen any of our gun control laws     It does not affect    it does not address at all    the rights or ability of law abiding citizens to purchase or own a gun    It does not have anything to do with the Second Amendment    no matter how you interpret the language of that Amendment  This bill has one motivation  payback by the Bush Administration and the Republican leadership of the Congress to the powerful special interest of the National Rifle Association  As the New York Times reported less than two weeks ago  Wayne LaPierre  the Executive Vice President of the NRA  made it clear that the NRA expected total support from its allies    or else  Mr  LaPierre said  It s simply bad politics to be on the wrong side of the Second Amendment at election time  asserting that Vice President Al Gore lost the 2000 presidential election because he supported gun control  including a federal ban on assault weapons  That s the same assault weapons ban that President Bush told the American people he supported  but then allowed to expire     We know what happened when the NRA pushed this special interest bill last year  When the Senate voted to reauthorize the assault weapons ban as part of the bill  the NRA called supporters and instructed them to vote against the bill that it had just been lobbying for  What a disgraceful spectacle   members of this great body reversing themselves on the floor of the Senate minutes before a vote because of a single call from the NRA  That same kind of raw  special interest power is now being used again    to take the Senate away from the important business of protecting our men and women who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan    so that a few unsavory gun dealers and gun manufacturers can channel powerful killing machines into the hands of criminals and terrorists in this country without any regulation or judicial oversight whatever  The manufacturers of guns    unlike the manufacturers of nearly every other consumer product in the country    are not subject to consumer product safety standards  As it stands  manufacturers and sellers in the industry are free to design  make and market these products with no independent review of their potential risks  The gun industry is the only industry whose products are not subject to basic consumer health and safety regulation     Why stop with the gun industry  Why not make tire manufacturers immune from lawsuit  Or car manufacturers  Or bicycle manufacturers  Or toy manufacturers  Obviously  it would be absurd to shield any negligent manufacturers from liability for their actions  But when it comes to shielding the gun industry  the NRA is calling the tune  And too many members of this body are tragically dancing to it  The other side also tells us that it is too burdensome on the gun industry to fight these lawsuits  After all  we are told  there are thousands of gun laws on the books  and the government can enforce them  Let s look at some of those gun laws and how the gun lobby has systematically made it more difficult  and in some cases  even impossible  for the government to police negligent gun dealers and manufacturers  while making it easier for criminals to get their hands on guns  Federal gun dealers are regulated under federal law and required to perform background checks of gun buyers  But at the urging of the gun lobby several years ago  Congress drastically narrowed the definition of gun dealer  Now  there are many unregulated individuals who don t meet the new definition  These reckless and unlicensed dealers are now selling millions of guns to people  including criminals and terrorists  without background checks  All of that is legal  because the United States Congress kowtowed to the National Rifle Association  In the caves of Afghanistan  our troops found an Al Qaeda manual that instructed terrorists on how to buy guns legally in the United States  without having to undergo a background check  Al Qaeda understands that we have created a mess that allows    even encourages    criminals and terrorists to traffic in guns  But we won t do anything about that    the so called gun show loophole    because the NRA has snapped its fingers and said NO  We are told by the other side that victims of gun violence don t need recourse to the courts because the government is already inspecting and overseeing the businesses of gun dealers  But is that the whole story  Absolutely not  At the direction of the NRA  Congress limited federal inspections of gun dealers to once a year and passed laws making it virtually impossible for agents to conduct inspections more than once a year  If an agent happens to inspect a negligent or even grossly negligent gun dealer in January  the dealer doesn t have to worry about the feds showing up for at least another year  Federally regulated financial institutions can be inspected without notice  whenever and as often the as regulators deem appropriate  Meat packing plants  shipyards  iron foundries and gas refineries can all be inspected without notice  whenever and as often the regulators deem appropriate  But not gun dealers  Congress and the NRA have said that they can be inspected only once a year  What difference does that make in the life of the average citizen  It makes a lot of difference  Just ask the innocent victims of the DC sniper attacks  When the regulators can t keep tabs on gun dealers  it means that companies like the Bull s Eye Shooter Supply Store    the dealer that supplied the Bushmaster rifle to the DC snipers    can get away with supposedly losing the rifle that ended up in the hands of the DC snipers    and losing more than 200 other guns that ended up who knows where  The DC sniper victims had only the courts to turn to for recourse  because Congress made it impossible for federal agents to police unsavory gun dealers like Bull s Eye  Now the NRA is telling Congress    take away the courts too  Why  An obvious answer is that gun dealers and manufacturers want to sell more guns  Our laws are designed by the NRA to increase the sales of guns by dealers and manufacturers  even if they are sold by or to criminals  The NRA is lavishly rewarded for lobbying successes  and so are the members of Congress who do their bidding  It s hard to reach any other conclusion  The unholy alliance and control of the legislative process against the safety of our citizens is immoral  and it s a disgrace  But let s look at the other outrageous actions that this body has taken because the NRA has demanded it  Congress has cut federal funding for the agency that oversees gun dealers and manufacturers  In fact  the GAO has recently reported that the ATF is so under funded that it would take it 22 years to inspect the records of all of the gun dealers in this country just once  The GAO report also found that terrorists and people on terrorist watch lists are not automatically barred from purchasing guns and are routinely buying guns in this country     This must stop  The gun industry must have some accountability  That is why I am offering my amendment that would ensure that cases could be brought against gun manufacturers and dealers aiding or abetting a representative of a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization  You can find the list Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations on the Internet and it includes Al Qaeda and HAMAS  among others  How can Congress deny victims the right to challenge a manufacturer or dealer who provided guns to a foreign terrorist organization which caused them harm  This Administration continually says that we are engaged in a war on terror  but it takes the position that the war on terror doesn t allow us to prevent terrorists from buying guns in this country  Because of the actions of this Administration and this Congress in caving to the NRA  terrorists can now add assault weapons to their arsenal  All to appease the NRA so they ll give campaign contributions and get out the vote  This is not only a disgrace    it s criminal  and it has to stop  The hypocrisy is mind boggling  After 9 11  the worst terrorist attack in the history of the nation  the Justice Department    over the objection of the FBI and at the urging of the NRA    decided that the government had to destroy within 24 hours the background check records of all gun purchasers  What is the rationale for the destruction of background check records in 24 hours  Former Attorney General Ashcroft and the NRA decided that it was a violation of the privacy rights of law abiding citizens to have their records held on file for 90 days  as they had been for years  since the passage of the Brady Law  This is the same John Ashcroft who  in the immediate aftermath of 9 11 prohibited    that s right  he prohibited    the FBI from examining the gun purchasing records of any of the 19 hijackers or any of the 1200 other terrorists suspects who were detained for questioning  What kind of society are we turning into  We re supposed to be protecting this nation from terrorism  not aiding and abetting terrorists  Within days of the 9 11 attacks  we knew who the hijackers were  We knew where they sat on the planes  We saw some of their faces on surveillance videos  We knew what they had charged on their credit cards  We knew where they had gone to school  We knew where they lived and where they traveled  We knew that they had tried to get pilot s licenses  We knew that they had looked for ways to transport hazardous chemicals  But we didn t know whether they or their terrorist friends had purchased firearms  because we were worried about their privacy rights and their right to bear arms  Give me a break  Every day  law abiding Americans have their every move video taped by surveillance cameras  They are required to take off their shoes and jackets and be searched at airports and have their luggage inspected and opened  Yet  our government worries about the privacy rights of terrorist gun owners and refuses to let the FBI look at gun purchase records of suspected terrorists  The Justice Department refuses to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns  And then it destroys those records in 24 hours  Something is rotten here  and it has to stop    I ask you again  Whose side are we on  Instead of addressing real issues that can make our country and our communities safer  we are considering a bill that that will close the courthouse door to victims of gun crimes  and give a free pass to the handful of gun dealers and gun manufacturers who sell firearms to terrorists and criminals  And we are doing it to appease the special interest of the NRA  That is why I plan to offer an amendment that would allow victims to sue if a gun manufacturer or dealer aids  abets or conspires to sell guns to anyone on the FBI s Most Wanted Terrorist List or Top Most Wanted Fugitives List  This list is available over the Internet and posted across America  Victims of terrorist crimes deserve their day in court  How can Congress justify an immunity shield for companies that knowingly provide guns to terrorists and fugitives identified by the FBI  Law abiding citizens who sell or purchase firearms do not want to give criminals a free pass  But that s exactly what this bill will do  If we vote for it  we will be aiding and abetting these wrongdoers  just as Congress has done for years at the command of the NRA  This bill gives greater protection to the gun industry than Congress gave to the health care industry  teachers and volunteers under the headline of tort reform  The legislation is so extreme that it requires the immediate dismissal of any cases pending in either state or federal court     By doing so  the bill denies victims their day in court  amounts to an unprecedented interference with the judicial branch of government  and is an outrageous violation of the rule of law     The bill s supporters misrepresent the real goal of the lawsuits filed against this industry  These lawsuits are not filed in an effort to bankrupt the industry  Like all tort suits  the victims turn to the courts to obtain compensation for their injuries and demand responsible conduct     Let s be clear and debunk a few myths that the other side is spinning  The gun industry is not uniquely burdened with lawsuits    they just don t like what the public discovers about the industry and its practices when documents are produced in litigation  And this immunity bill is not aimed only at frivolous lawsuits  The truth is that it bars almost all actions for negligence  If this bill had become law last year  the families of the victims of the DC snipers would have been barred from suing and receiving their  2 million settlement from the gun dealer in Washington State who lost and couldn t account for more than 200 guns in its inventory  many of which lost weapons    like the assault rifle used by the DC snipers    that were used in the commission of crimes  If passed  the bill forces the dismissal of a lawsuit filed by the family of Massachusetts victim Danny Guzman  an innocent bystander shot on Christmas Eve 1999  Danny was killed by a gun stolen by the employee working in a gun manufacturing plant     Danny  here in a picture with his cousin  was a true victim of negligent conduct  This gun factory lacked adequate security  record keeping and other reasonable safeguards to prevent employees from taking guns out of the plant in their pockets  The lack of security was so bad that the owners of the plant didn t even know guns were missing     Danny s mother and his two surviving daughters sued the manufacturer  claiming it had negligently hired criminals to work in its plant  and had such irresponsible security that it allowed them to walk out of the plant with guns without serial numbers  One of these guns was used to shoot Danny  This case should not be dismissed    This bill would also result in the automatic dismissal of a case just filed in Pennsylvania  Anthony Oliver  a fourteen year old boy  was killed by a handgun that discharged accidentally while he was playing with friends  Anthony s life was cut short due to this gun seller s reckless conduct     His family filed a case against the gun companies that negligently allowed one of Anthony s friends to obtain a handgun  The dealer who sold the gun had a history of supplying guns to criminals and had not even taken the minimum steps to screen purchasers     Over a four year period  Lou s sold over four hundred guns traced to criminals  Under this bill  Anthony s family will not get their day in court and the irresponsible activities of this gun dealer and its supplier will be not be stopped  This case should not be dismissed    This bill would also bar municipal lawsuits  If this bill passes  four pending cases involving New York City  the District of Columbia  Gary  Indiana and Cleveland  Ohio will all be dismissed     The amendment that I plan to offer will make sure that these families and communities get their day in court and that the rules of the game are not changed mid course  Victims of such violence should have the same right to equal protection of the laws as other Americans     This bill is not about protecting the gun industry from bankruptcy  This bill is a blatant  special interest bill to protect gun manufacturers and sellers who provide guns to criminals or even terrorists  With this bill  Congress is aiding and abetting in the perpetuation of these crimes    Enough  I urge my colleagues to join me in saying no to this shameful bill and get back to the serious issues that face our country    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
