         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       Washington  DC  Tonight Senator Kennedy issued the following statement in response to the New York Times report of the National Intelligence Estimate which determined that the war in Iraq has increased terrorism around the world  Last month the United States Senate unanimously passed Senator Kennedys amendment requiring the Director of National Intelligence to task the intelligence community to prepare a new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq  The last time the NIE was updated was in July 2004  yet much has changed in the security  economy and political stability of Iraq in the last two years According to reports  this intelligence document should put the final nail in the coffin for President Bushs phony argument about the Iraq war  Despite what President Bush says  the intelligence community has reported the plain truth    the misguided war in Iraq has  metastasized and spread  terrorism like cancer around the world  The fact that we need a new direction in Iraq to really win the war on terror and make Americans safer could not be clearer or more urgent   yet this Administration stubbornly clings to a failed  stay  the course  strategy  How many more independent reports  how many more deaths  how much deeper into civil war will Iraq need to fall for the White House to wake up and change its strategy in Iraq   Laura Capps Melissa  Wagoner 202 224 2633
