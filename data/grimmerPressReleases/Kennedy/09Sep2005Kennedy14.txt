         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633    Statement by Senator Kennedy on Secretary Collin Powell s comments on the Iraq War     The first step toward changing our failed course in Iraq is to admit mistakes  To his credit  Secretary Powell has done so  and so should President Bush     As we approach the fourth anniversary of 9 11  President Bush should admit that he wrongly invoked the tragedy of 9 11 to justify war with Iraq  The war has made terrorists even more determined to attack our country  and has made America less safe     Instead of rushing into an unnecessary war  President Bush should have kept focused on the real threat to our nation    the threat from Al Qaeda and other extremists who are determined to strike America again  The war in Iraq has made future terrorist attacks more likely  not less likely     Four years after 9 11  as the Administration s bungled response to Hurricane Katrina makes clear  we re obviously not adequately prepared to deal with another devastating attack   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
