         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I welcome this decision by Sinn Fein to support the Police Service of Northern Ireland  and I commend Gerry Adams and the other leaders of Sinn Fein for taking this important step to move forward on policing I hope this historic action will be fully embraced by the DUP and that they will agree to share power on a permanent and inclusive basis to create a stable government in Northern Ireland   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
