         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     After reviewing the record on this nomination  I cannot support the nomination of John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States     Our Founders proclaimed the bedrock principle that we are all created equal  But everyone knows that in the early days of our Republic  the reality was far different  For more than two centuries  we have struggled  sometimes spilling precious blood  to fulfill that unique American promise  The beliefs and sacrifices of millions of Americans throughout the history of our young nation have breathed fuller life and given real world relevance to our constitutional ideals    With genius and foresight  our founders gave us the tools    the Constitution and the Bill of Rights    that have aided and encouraged our march of progress  The guarantees in our founding documents  as enhanced in the wake of a divisive Civil War  have guided our nation to live up to the promise of liberty  equality and justice for all    We have made much progress  But our work is not finished  and we still look to our elected representatives and our independent courts in each new generation to uphold those guiding principles  to continue the great march of progress  and never to turn back or give up our hard won gains    The commitment to this march of progress was the central issue in John Roberts s hearing  We asked whether he  as Chief Justice  would bring the values  ideals and vision to lead us on the path of continued equality  fairness and opportunity for all  Or would he stand in the way of progress by viewing the issues that come before the Court in a narrow and legalistic way  thereby slowly turning back the clock and eroding the civil rights and equal rights gains of the past    We examined the only written record before us and saw John Roberts  aggressive activist in the Reagan Administration  eager to narrow hard won rights and liberties  especially voting rights  women s rights  civil rights  and disability rights  As Congressman John Lewis eloquently stated in our hearings  25 years ago John Roberts was on the wrong side of the nation s struggle to achieve genuine equality of opportunity for all Americans  And  despite many invitations to do so  Roberts never distanced himself from the aggressively narrow views of that young lawyer in the Reagan Administration    Who is John Roberts today   And who will he be as the 17th Chief justice of the United States    John Roberts is a highly intelligent nominee  He has argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court  and won more than half of them  He is adept at turning questions on their head while giving seemingly appropriate answers  These skills served him well as a Supreme Court advocate  These same skills  however  did not contribute to a productive confirmation process  At the end of the four days of hearings  we still know very little more than we knew when we started    John Roberts said that  The responsibility of the judicial branch is to decide particular cases that are presented to them in this area according to the rule of law    Of course  everyone agrees with that  Each of us took an oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution  and we take that oath seriously  But the rule of law does not exist in a vacuum  Constitutional values and ideals inform all legal decisions  But John Roberts never shared with us his own constitutional values and ideals    He said that a judge should be like an umpire  calling the balls and strikes  but not making the rules    But we all know that with any umpire  the call may depend on your point of view  An instant replay from another angle can show a very different result  Umpires follow the rules of the game  But in critical cases  it may well depend on where they are standing when they make the call    The same is true of judges      As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously stated  The life of the law has not been logic  it has been experience  He also said that legal decisions are not like mathematics  If they were  we wouldn t need men and women of reason and intellect to sit on the bench    we would simply input the facts and the law into some computer program and wait for a mechanical result     And as Justice Stephen Breyer offered in his confirmation hearing  I always think law requires both a heart and a head  If you do not have a heart  it becomes a sterile set of rules  removed from human problems  and it will not help  If you do not have a head  there is the risk that in trying to decide a particular person s problem in a case that may look fine for that person  you cause trouble for a lot of other people  making their lives yet worse     We all believe in the rule of law  But that is just the beginning of the conversation when it comes to the meaning of the Constitution  Everyone follows the same text  But the meaning of the text is often imprecise  You must examine the intent of the Framers  the history  and the current reality  And this examination will lead to very different outcomes depending on each Justice s constitutional world view  Is it a full and generous view of our rights and liberties and of government power to protect the people  Or a narrow and cramped view of those rights and liberties and the government s power to protect ordinary Americans    Based on the record available  there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Judge Roberts s view of the rule of law would include as paramount the protection of basic rights  The values and perspectives displayed over and over again in his record cast doubt on his view of voting rights  women s rights  civil rights  and disability rights     In fact  for all the hoopla and razzle dazzle in four days of hearings  there is precious little in the record to suggest that a Chief Justice John Roberts would espouse anything less that the narrow and cramped view that staff attorney John Roberts so strongly advocated in the 1980s     On the first day of the hearing  Senator Kohl asked  Which of those positions were you supportive of  or are you still supportive of  and which would you disavow  Judge Roberts never gave a clear response     Voting Rights Act Other than his grudging concession during the hearing that he knows of no present challenge that would make section 2 of the Voting Rights Act constitutionally suspect    a concession that took almost 20 minutes of my questioning to elicit    John Roberts has a demonstrated record of strong opposition to Section 2  which is almost universally considered to be the most powerful and effective civil rights laws ever enacted  Section 2 outlaws voting practices that deny or dilute the right to vote based on race  national origin  or language minority status    and is largely uncontroversial today     But in 1981 and 1982  Judge Roberts urged the Administration to oppose a bi partisan amendment to strengthen Section 2  and to have  instead  a provision that made it more difficult    some say impossible    to prove discriminatory voting practices and procedures  Although Judge Roberts sought to characterize his opposition to the so called effects test as simply following the policy of the Reagan Administration  the dozens of memos he wrote on this subject show that he personally believed the Administration was right to oppose the effects test    When Roberts worried that the Senate might reject his position  he urged the Attorney General to send a letter to the Senate opposing the amendment  stating my own view is that something must be done to educate the Senators           He also urged the Attorney General to assert his leadership against the amendment strengthening Section 2  He wrote that the Attorney General should head off any retrenchment efforts by White House staff who were inclined to support the amendment  He consistently urged the Administration to require voters to bear the heavy burden of proving discriminatory intent    even on laws passed a century earlier    in order to overturn practices that locked them out of the electoral process    Judge Roberts wrote at the time that  violations of section 2 should not be made too easy to prove         Remember  when he wrote those words there had been no African Americans elected to Congress since Reconstruction from seven of the states with the largest black populations     The year after Section 2 was signed into law  Judge Roberts wrote in a memo to the White House Counsel that we were burned by the Voting Rights Act legislation    Given his clear record of hostility to this key voting rights protection  the public has a right to know if he still holds these views  But Judge Roberts gave us hardly a clue    Even when Senator Feingold asked whether Judge Roberts would acknowledge today that he had been wrong to oppose the effects test  he refused to give a yes or no answer    Judge Roberts responded  I m certainly not an expert in the area and haven t followed and have no way of evaluating the relative effectiveness of the law as amended or the law as it was prior to 1982    So we still don t know whether he supports the basic law against voting practices that result in denying voting rights because of race  national origin  or language minority status    You don t need to be a voting rights expert to say we re better off today in an America where persons of color can be elected to Congress from any state in the country  You don t need to be a voting rights expert to know there was a problem in 1982  when no African American had been elected to Congress since Reconstruction from Mississippi  Florida  Alabama  North Carolina  South Carolina  Virginia  or Louisiana    where African Americans were almost a third of the population    because restrictive election systems effectively denied African Americans and other minorities the equal chance to elect representatives of their choice  And you don t need to be a voting rights expert to say it s better that the Voting Rights Act paved the way for over 9 000 African American elected officials and over 6 000 Latino public officials who have been elected and appointed nationwide     You don t need to be an expert to recognize that Section 2 has benefited Native Americans  Asians and others who historically encountered harsh barriers to full political participation     Yet Judge Roberts refused in the hearings to say that his past opposition to Section 2 doesn t represent his current views     Civil Rights Restoration Act and Title IX   Judge Roberts also refused to disavow his past record of opposition to requiring non discrimination by recipients of federal funds  These laws were adopted because  as President Kennedy said in 1963   s imple justice requires that public funds  to which all taxpayers       contribute  not be spent in any fashion which       subsidizes  or results in       discrimination     He supported a cramped and narrow view that would exempt many formerly covered institutions from following civil rights laws that protect women  minorities and the disabled  Under that view  the enormous subsidies the federal government gives colleges and universities in the form of federal financial aid would not have been enough to require them to obey the laws against discrimination  That position was so extreme that it was rejected by the Reagan Administration and later by the Supreme Court  Although Judge Roberts later acknowledged that the Reagan Administration rejected this view  he would not tell the Committee whether he still holds that view today    He also never stated whether he personally agrees with the decision in Franklin v  Gwinnett  where the Supreme Court unanimously rejected his argument that Title IX  the landmark law against gender discrimination  provided no monetary relief to a schoolgirl who was sexually abused by her teacher    A careful reading of the transcript of his testimony makes clear that he never embraced the Supreme Court s decision to uphold affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law School  Nor did he expressly agree with the Supreme Court decision that all children    including those who are undocumented    have a legal right to public education  He emphasized his agreement with certain rationales used by the court in those cases  but he left himself a lot of wiggle room for future reconsideration of those 5 4 decisions    Women s Rights   Finally  a number of my colleagues on the Committee asked Judge Roberts about issues related to women s rights and a woman s right to privacy  On these important matters  too  he never gave answers that shed light on his current views    No one is entitled to become Chief Justice of the United States  The confirmation of nominees to our courts    by and with the advice and consent of the Senate    should not require a leap of faith  Nominees must earn their confirmation by providing us with full knowledge of the values and convictions they will bring to decisions that may profoundly affect our progress as a nation toward the ideal of equality    Judge Roberts has not done so  His repeated reference to the rule of law reveals little about the values he would bring to the job of Chief Justice of the United States  The record we have puts at serious risk the progress we have made toward our common American vision of equal opportunity for all of our citizens    Supporting or opposing nominees to the Supreme Court should not be a partisan question  In my 43 years in the United States Senate  I have supported more nominees for the Supreme Court by Republican presidents than by Democratic presidents    But  there is clear and convincing evidence that John Roberts is the wrong choice for Chief Justice  I oppose the nomination  and I urge my colleagues to do the same   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
