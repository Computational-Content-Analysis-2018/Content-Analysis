         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today  Senator Specter has done exactly what the American people expect us to do  take our constitutional duty seriously to ensure that any nominee to the Supreme Court is committed to the rights and freedoms of all Americans  including those with disabilities     As we consider Judge Roberts  nomination  we must never forget that Supreme Court justices wield enormous power over the daily lives of all Americans  It is too often the last place our citizens can go for protection of their rights     Just last year  in Tennessee vs  Lane  the Court decided that Beverly Jones and George Lane  two disabled Americans working at county courthouse with no disabled access  had the same right to equal opportunity in our society as every other American  As Senator Specter notes  Justice O Connor cast the deciding vote in Ms  Jones  case     Over the course of the next several weeks  we must determine whether John Roberts also respects the power of Congress to protect the rights of the disabled  From what we know right now  John Roberts has too often sought to narrow the rights on which the American people depend  We can t afford to confirm someone to the Court who would turn back the clock on progress on fairness and equality  There are few debates more important than this one    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
