         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE             Mr  Chairman  Im concerned that the Committee is proceeding with undue haste on the nomination of Mr  Keisler   There are important unresolved matters that we should consider before we reach a decision     First  is the issue we raised in the letter we sent you last week  urging the Committee to examine the need to fill the 11th or 12th judgeships on the D C  Circuit   Republican members of this Committee strongly opposed attempts by the Clinton Administration to fill the 11th seat and they were successful in blocking well qualified nominees   They argued that the court did not have enough cases to justify that number of judges   Since then  the number of written opinions issued by the court has declined by 17    The number of cases resolved on the merits per judge is down 21   and the number of cases filed per judge is down 10    We should consider these caseload declines carefully before we fill the current vacancy   American taxpayers deserve no less   In addition  we have had very little time to consider the record of Mr  Keisler   He was nominated only a month ago  and the ABA did not complete its evaluation of him until yesterday   As we all know  the D C  Circuit is second in importance only to the Supreme Court   We should proceed with particular care in confirming judges to that Court   In fact  among the last seven D C  Circuit nominees  the shortest period from nomination to hearing was 71 days   We have barely had 30 days for Mr  Keisler   This rush has left very little time to study and  in some instances  even to assemble his record   We know that he has served in high government positions and has had a successful private practice  and has received a well qualified rating by the ABA  But we have had little real opportunity to examine his record    We know that he worked in the Reagan White House  but we know virtually nothing about what he worked on there   We have not had the opportunity to obtain records from that period of his career   We know that he was a founder and longtime high ranking officer in the Federalist Society and that he was upset that Judge Bork was not confirmed to the Supreme Court   Indeed  he dismissed criticism of Judge Borks record  stating   Its just a bunch of hot air   I think Bork is in the mainstream   And he is reported to have said   It was extremely frustrating to see ideas that had previously been considered part of a reasonable debate excommunicated and defined as extreme by the Senate   As one who sat on this Committee when Judge Bork was considered  I disagree strongly with those views   I  therefore  hope that we will have an opportunity to look carefully into all of these issues before we proceed to vote the merits of this nomination         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
