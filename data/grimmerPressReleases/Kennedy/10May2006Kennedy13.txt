         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      This new age of the life sciences holds immense potential for better health for all Americans  Senate Health Week ought to be a time of re dedication to bringing the promise of quality health care to every American  Our goal is to make health care a right and not a privilege    where no American must choose between a visit to the doctor and paying the rent or putting food on the table    That is the vision we are trying to achieve    but obviously  we have not succeeded yet  Time and again  narrow self interest has defeated proposals to extend the benefits of health care to all Americans  Because of these wrong choices  the vast promise of the life sciences is being denied to millions of Americans  Even things as basic as regular visits to the family doctor are a distant dream for millions of our fellow citizens    46 million Americans have no health insurance    that s six million more than in the year President Bush was elected  Even for those who have coverage  health care is becoming more and more unaffordable  Insurance premiums have leaped by a shocking 73 percent since the year 2000  when the rise in wages and prices in that period was only 13 6 percent     These soaring increases in health costs come at a time when working families are under siege on other fronts  Gas prices have more than doubled since President Bush took office  College tuition is up 45 percent  Housing by 44 percent  The list goes on and on and up and up    In the face of this growing health care crisis of access and costs  Health Week ought to be a call for action  a summons to put forward serious proposals to solve the major health care challenges we face  But no  that s not what this so called Senate Health Week is all about     Instead of debating a proposal that advances the nation toward making the promise of the century of the life sciences a reality for all Americans  the current proposal is a retreat from that goal    The supporters of Senator Enzi s proposal refer to it as a bill to level the playing field so that small businesses have the same kinds of advantages in negotiating for good insurance coverage as large employers enjoy  When the bill is described in that way  it s hard to see how anyone could be against it    But the true impact of this legislation goes far beyond the mild descriptions its supporters employ  The legislation before the Senate wipes away good state laws guaranteeing mental health parity  services for diabetes care  cancer screening  access to specialists  and many other needed services    The bill would encourage discriminatory pricing of insurance based on factors outside a person s control  like age or gender or a person s health history     During yesterday s debate  many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle said that they favor letting small businesses be part of one big insurance risk pool  If that s what they want  they should support the Durbin Lincoln bill  not the bill that s now before the Senate    The Enzi bill will actually fragment the market compared to current law in many states  The Enzi bill allows an insurer to have 9 separate classes of business  and each association plan is also a separate pool  In my state of Massachusetts  an insurer must include all small businesses in one pool      Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said that this bill will lower premiums by 12 percent    This figure is based on a study paid for by the business lobby  But the most recent estimate  by the CBO  is that premiums would be lowered by 2 to 3 percent  These savings  which amount to  80 to  120 for the average individual policy and  215 to  325 for the average family plan  are one time savings  The bill does nothing to address long term health care costs  And fully one quarter of small business workers will see their health care costs rise  while 100 000 older and less healthy workers will lose coverage altogether  Their health care needs won t go away  but their health coverage will     The current proposal is so harmful to millions of Americans that the letters from organizations and experts opposing it would fill a book  Literally     I have a compilation right here of just some of the endless stream of letters we have received asking the Senate to oppose the bill    There is opposition from every corner of the nation and every walk of life  Organizations representing patients  and workers  and health professionals  and small businesses and families  and many others oppose this legislation  Governors  attorneys general  insurance commissioners  and state legislators oppose it too    We have a better way  My colleague from Illinois  Senator Durbin  and my colleague from Arkansas  Senator Lincoln  have a proposal that accomplishes all the goals that the supporters of S  1955 claim for that legislation    but without undermining the good coverage that millions of Americans now count on    Supporters of the Enzi bill say that it is important to level the playing field so that small businesses have the same bargaining leverage as larger employers  I agree    That s why the Durbin Lincoln bill allows small businesses to pool their risk across state lines under the auspices of the same agency that oversees the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program that Members of this Senate can count on when their own health is threatened     Supporters of the Enzi bill say that it is important to help small businesses with the high cost of health care   I agree      That s why the Durbin Lincoln bill provides tax credits to small businesses to help them afford the high cost of health care  and reinsurance program to help defray the cost of the most expensive claims    Our Senate debate this week should address these major issues in the proposal before us    but it should deal with other health priorities too  It would be a travesty to have a Health Week that fails to address the real health priorities of working families    but we are at the mid point of the week  and there is no sign of it yet     Let me just outline briefly a few of the areas in which we should take action     One of the major challenges of recent years has been to give seniors real help with the soaring cost of prescriptions  A good Medicare drug bill in the Senate  supported by a broad bipartisan majority  was hijacked when the White House entered the negotiations  Instead of building on the Medicare that seniors know and trust  the drug program was turned over to HMOs and other private insurance plans that were enticed to participate by massive subsidies  when those funds should have gone to strengthen benefits     The flaws of the legislation itself were worsened by incompetent implementation  The rollout of the plan failed so badly that seniors  the disabled  and those with mental illness were denied the drugs they counted on to maintain their health  or were forced to pay massive fees for the drugs they needed     Now the Administration is poised to compound these blunders by imposing steep fines on seniors who have not been able to navigate the tangle of options to select a drug program  GAO recently reported that the information given to seniors by the Administration on the available Medicare plans was often confusing  and that a third of callers to the Medicare help line were given inaccurate or incomplete information  With help like that  it s no wonder seniors are having so much difficulty understanding the program    but they still have to pay a high price if they don t sign up by next Monday     The amendment that Senator Nelson plans to offer will help seniors with the penalties they will otherwise have to pay for not signing up for a drug plan in time  I don t know how many times we have heard the Administration say that enrolling in the drug benefit is entirely voluntary    but it s hardly voluntary  if you have to pay a fine when you don t join by an arbitrary deadline     We face unmet challenges in other areas too      The hope and help that stem cell research can bring is being delayed and denied because the Senate refuses to act on the bipartisan legislation approved by the House to abolish the unwarranted restrictions imposed by the Bush Administration on this lifesaving research     All year  Americans have watched with growing alarm as the avian flu virus has spread from Asia to the Middle East to Europe  Yet preparations in America lag far behind those in other nations  We should debate proposals to improve our readiness    One measure that would help in preparing for this danger is to see that all workers have paid leave if they are sick  Flu and other contagious diseases can be spread through close contact at work and at school  CDC has emphasized that employees with flu should stay home to prevent the spread of the disease  Yet half of all American workers are not guaranteed the right to take time off when they are ill without risking the loss of pay  or even their job  The Senate should take action on the Healthy Families Act  which would guarantee seven paid sick days per year for full time workers     The saddest irony of this so called Health Week is that it follows Cover the Uninsured Week  In a nation of extraordinary wealth and limitless creativity  there should have been no need for a Cover the Uninsured Week  It s shameful that we continue to allow 46 million of our fellow citizens to go without regular access to decent health insurance    The Bush Administration should really have called last week Discover the Uninsured Week  For seven days every year  they give speeches and say nice words about the uninsured  Then they spend the next 51 weeks blocking serious proposals to extend coverage to families who face bankruptcy and ill health because they have no source of health care    Health Week may be our last opportunity this Congress to have a serious debate on extending coverage to the uninsured  but the Senate leadership will undoubtedly squander this chance too  In frustration across the nation  states are beginning to lead the way because the federal government has refused to act for so long  In Massachusetts  Republicans and Democrats  business leaders  health professionals  community leaders  and citizens from all walks of life came together to enact a proposal that will extend the benefits of health coverage throughout the Commonwealth  At the very least  the Senate should be debating ways to assist the efforts of states in bringing affordable health care to their citizens     The Senate has had time to give tax favors to millionaires  It s had time to protect the profits of the oil companies  It s had time to pass bankruptcy legislation written by the credit card companies  In the weeks to come  we ll have no end of time for election year posturing on proposals cooked up in the back rooms of political consultants  offices that have no chance of becoming law  We have had time for those measures  but no time is allowed to vote on proposals that seriously address the health care crisis  Unless we do  it would be a mockery to call this week Health Week   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
