         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I have consistently said throughout this Committee s long debate on asbestos legislation that I would support a properly designed and adequately funded Trust Fund bill  That legislation would have to fairly compensate all the victims of asbestos induced disease in a timely way  It would put more money in the pockets of these injured workers than the current system by reducing transaction costs  This is not such a bill    S  852  in its current form  does not meet that standard  It is unfair and unworkable  While it contains some improvements over prior Committee drafts  it remains seriously flawed  Compared to the legislation reported by this Committee in the last Congress    1  The Trust Fund is not adequately funded  In fact  it even provides  13 billion less in total funding to compensate victims than last term s bill    2  It does not allow seriously injured victims to pursue their cases in court until the Trust Fund is ready to process and pay claims    3  It unfairly denies thousands of lung cancer victims who have had very substantial amounts of exposure to asbestos the right to receive any compensation from the Trust Fund     4   It makes it harder for asbestos victims to recover compensation from the Trust Fund by raising the standard of proof    5  It does not have a clear  automatic sunset allowing victims to quickly seek compensation in the courts if the Trust Fund becomes insolvent and unable to pay their claims    6  It gratuitously takes rights away from victims of silica disease even though they are not eligible to receive any benefits from the Trust Fund    7  It caps attorneys  fees at an unreasonably low level that will make it harder for victims with complex cases to get a qualified attorney to pursue their claims    These are major shortcomings which must be corrected before we approve legislation creating an Asbestos Trust Fund  The argument that there are serious inadequacies in the way asbestos cases are adjudicated today does not mean that any legislation is better than the current system  Our first obligation is to do no harm  We should not be supporting legislation that excludes many seriously ill victims from receiving compensation and that fails to provide a guarantee of adequate funding to make sure injured workers will actually receive what the bill promises them    As I have said before  the real crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation crisis  it is an asbestos induced disease crisis  Asbestos is the most lethal substance ever widely used in the workplace  Between 1940 and 1980  there were 27 5 million workers in this country who were exposed to asbestos on the job  and nearly 19 million of them had high levels of exposure over long periods of time  That exposure changed many of their lives  Each year  10 000 of them die from lung cancer and other diseases caused by asbestos  Each year  hundreds of thousands of them suffer from lung conditions which make breathing so difficult that they cannot function at all     Even more have become unemployable due to their medical condition  And  because of the long latency period of these diseases  all of them live with fear of a premature death due to asbestos induced disease  These are the real victims  They deserve to be the first and foremost focus of our concern     All too often  the tragedy these workers and their families are enduring becomes lost in a complex debate about the economic impact of asbestos litigation  We cannot allow that to happen  The litigation did not create these costs  Exposure to asbestos created them  They are the costs of medical care  the lost wages of incapacitated workers  and the cost of providing for the families of workers who died years before their time  Those costs are real  No legislative proposal can make them disappear  All legislation can do is shift those costs from one party to another    Any proposal which would shift more of the financial burden onto the backs of injured workers should be unacceptable to all of us     Let me highlight several of the most serious flaws in the legislation before us    It would close the courthouse doors to asbestos victims on the day it passes  long before the Trust Fund will be able to pay their claims  Their cases will be stayed immediately  Seriously ill workers will be forced into a legal limbo for up to two years  Their need for compensation to cover medical expenses and basic family necessities will remain  but they will have nowhere to turn for relief  Even those victims who have less than a year to live will be forced to stop their cases for nine months  Nine months is an eternity for those with only a year to live  Many of them will die without receiving either their day in court or compensation from the Trust Fund    Experts tell us that the Asbestos Trust created by this legislation is seriously underfunded  The funding plan in this bill relies on very substantial borrowing in the early years as the only way to pay the flood of claims  The result will be huge debt service costs over the life of the Trust that could reduce the  140 billion intended to pay claims by as much as 40  or more  The amount remaining would be far too little to pay claims of all of those who are entitled to compensation under the terms of the bill    In addition  there is a strong constitutional argument that the existing bankruptcy trusts cannot be forced to turn over all their assets  which will place  7 6 billion in jeopardy  Many companies are also likely to challenge their obligation to finance the Asbestos Trust  It is not at all clear how much will actually be available to pay eligible victims what the legislation promises they will receive    There is likely to be a serious shortfall in the early years  when nearly 300 000 pending cases will be transferred to the Trust for payment  The Trust may not have the resources to pay those claims in a timely manner  Payments to critically ill people may be delayed for years    One way to reduce the enormous financial burden on the fund in the early years would be to leave many of those cases in the tort system  especially cases which were close to resolution  That would be fair to the parties in those cases and it would greatly improve the financial viability of the fund  Unfortunately  that proposal has also been rejected    If the Trust Fund does become insolvent  a very real possibility  workers will not have an automatic right to immediately return to the court system  The process outlined in the current bill could take years  Workers could end up trapped in the Trust with reduced benefits and long delays in receiving their payments  There needs to be a clear  objective trigger based on the Trust s track record of paying claims in the prior year that will automatically allow victims to pursue their claims in court if the Trust runs out of money  The Committee s 2003 legislation contained such a provision  but this bill does not  We cannot allow seriously injured workers with valid claims who are not paid in a timely manner by the Trust to be denied their day in court  That would be a shameful injustice    I am particularly upset by the change in the way lung cancer victims are treated  Under the medical criteria adopted by this Committee overwhelmingly two years ago  all lung cancer victims who had at least 15 years of weighted exposure to asbestos were entitled to receive compensation from the Fund  That provision remained in every draft of the bill written since  until the Specter Leahy legislation introduced last week  Under this bill  lung cancer victims who have had very substantial exposure to asbestos over long periods of time are denied any compensation unless they can show asbestos scarring on their lungs  The Committee heard expert medical testimony that prolonged asbestos exposure dramatically increases the probability that a person will get lung cancer even if they do not have scarring on their lungs  Deleting the Level VII category will deny compensation to approximately forty thousand victims suffering with asbestos related lung cancers  Under the legislation as now drafted  these victims are losing their right to go to court  but receiving nothing from the Fund  How can any of us support such an unconscionable provision    This bill also tampers with the agreed upon medical criteria by raising the standard of proof for each disease category  The new language requires the workers to prove that asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to their disease  instead of just a contributing factor  This is a major increase in the burden workers must overcome to receive compensation  It is significantly higher than most states currently require in a court of law  Rather than having to show that asbestos exposure contributed to their illness  they will now have to address the relative impact of asbestos and other potential factors  This change is a serious step in the wrong direction  raising the bar even higher on injured workers    While this legislation does contain some improvements    increasing some compensation values  protecting workers from subrogation  and providing medical screening for high risk workers    they are clearly outweighed by the bill s weaknesses    This is a bill that shifts more of the financial burden of asbestos induced disease to the injured workers by unfairly and arbitrarily limiting the liability of defendants  It does not establish a fair and reliable system that will compensate all those who are seriously ill due to asbestos  It lacks a dependable funding stream which can ensure that all who are entitled to compensation actually receive full and timely payment  These are very basic shortcomings    We cannot allow what justice requires to be limited by what the wrongdoers are willing to pay  Unless substantial improvements are made to the legislation  I intend to vote no and I urge my colleagues to do the same   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
