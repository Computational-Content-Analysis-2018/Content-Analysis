         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement on his decision to vote against cloture on the nomination of John Bolton The debate about John Bolton s nomination should continue  and I will vote against the motion to end it It s obvious that the information the Senate has requested is highly relevant to this controversial nomination  and if it helped Bolton  the White House would release it in a heartbeat  Instead  the Administration is stonewalling Congress and demanding a vote  It s a flagrant abuse of power  It s time to end the cover up  Then we can vote Frankly  President Bush should withdraw the nomination  As today s press reports make clear  the State Department is glad get him out of Washington  but the United Nations is the wrong place to send him   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
