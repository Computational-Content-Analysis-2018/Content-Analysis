         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Although Judge Alito has tried to distance himself from the many extreme views he expressed in his 1985 job application to the Meese Justice Department  the documents released today prevent him from doing that and appear to be a clear sign that he passes the right s litmus test with flying colors     In that job application  Alito stated that he personally believes that the Constitution does not protect a women s right to privacy in her own medical decisions  Just a year before  Alito not only urged the Justice Department to take advantage of the opportunity to advance the goal of eventual overruling of Roe v  Wade  he also laid out a strategy to do so by slowly cutting back on Roe s protections     The significant concerns raised by these documents only magnify the need for Judge Alito to explain whether he still holds the extreme views in his 1985 job application  He needs to make clear that he no longer questions constitutionally established remedies for discrimination and protections for the right to vote  and that he will not come to the court with an agenda to roll back women s rights  Not only will the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing provide Judge Alito an opportunity to disavow these extreme views  but a full release of his records from the Department of Justice would help shed light on just what kind of Supreme Court Justice he would be   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
