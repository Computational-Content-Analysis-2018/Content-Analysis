         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C   As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Kennedy has been a leading voice of opposition against the war in Iraq and has consistently called for a political solution to the escalating violence  In January of 2005  Kennedy called for the beginning of the withdrawal of troops  making a direct comparison with the war in Iraq to the Vietnam War and drawing intense criticism from the Bush administration  Now  he is strongly opposed to the escalation of the war and believes that it is not enough to speak out against it but that Congress must act immediately to prevent it    The legislation he is introducing today would require Congress to vote before the President escalates troop levels to fight a civil war  giving the American people a voice in the process Address of Senator Edward M  Kennedy Escalation is Not the Answer  Time for Congress to Act to Ensure Real Change in Iraq AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY     Thank you  President Jonathan Salant  for that generous introduction   Its an honor for me to be here at the National Press Club      I had hoped to speak today about health care and my agenda as Chairman of the Senates Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee   I will speak to those concerns on another day soon  but an issue of grave importance requires our immediate action      President Bush will address the nation tomorrow about his decision to send tens of thousands of additional American troops to the war in Iraq   That war is the overarching issue of our time  and American lives  American values and Americas role in the world are all at stake      If ordered into battle  we know our brave men and women will serve us with pride and valor  just as they have throughout this troubling war   All Americans will support them fully  as will those of us in Congress   We will always support our troops in harms way Its a special honor to have here with us today a person who symbolizes that commitment  Brian Hart of Bedford  Massachusetts   His presence reminds us who is being called to sacrifice and service  husbands and wives  fathers and mothers  sons and daughters  brothers and sisters  friends and neighbors Brian Harts son John  at the age of 20  gave his life in Iraq in 2003  defending his patrol from ambush   Brian and his wife Alma turned that enormous personal tragedy into a remarkable force for change Hes worked skillfully and tirelessly ever since to ensure that our soldiers have better equipment to protect them   Today and every day  I salute his patriotism and his own dedicated service to our country  Brian Hart As the election in November made clear  the vast majority of Americans oppose the war in Iraq  and an even greater number oppose sending even more troops to Iraq today Families like the Harts and all Americans deserve a voice in that profound decision   Our Constitution gives them that right   The President is Commander in Chief  but in our democracy he is still accountable to the people   Our system of checks and balances gives Congress  as the elected representatives of the people  a central role in decisions on war and peace Today  therefore  I am introducing legislation to reclaim the rightful role of Congress and the peoples right to a full voice in the Presidents plan to send more troops to Iraq   Congressman Ed Markey of Massachusetts will introduce similar legislation in the House of Representatives   Our bill will say that no additional troops can be sent and no additional dollars can be spent on such an escalation  unless and until Congress approves the Presidents plan Our proposal is a straightforward exercise of the power granted to Congress by Article I  section 8 of the Constitution   There can be no doubt that the Constitution gives Congress the authority to decide whether to fund military action   And Congress can demand a justification from the President for such action before it appropriates the funds to carry it out This bill will give all Americans  from Maine to Florida to California to Alaska and Hawaii  an opportunity to hold the President accountable for his actions   The Presidents speech must be the beginning  not the end  of a new national discussion of our policy in Iraq   Congress must have a genuine debate over the wisdom of the Presidents plan   Let us hear the arguments for it and against it   Then let us vote on it in the light of day   Let the American people hear  yes or no  where their elected representatives stand on one of the greatest challenges of our time Until now  a rubber stamp Republican Congress has refused to hold the White House accountable on Iraq   But the November election has dramatically changed all that Over the past two years  Democrats reached for their roots as true members of our Party   We listened to the hopes and dreams of everyday Americans   We rejected the politics of fear and division   We embraced a vision of hope and shared purpose   And the American people voted for change We campaigned as Democrats in 2006   And we must govern as Democrats in 2007   We have the solemn obligation now to show the American people that we heard their voices   We will stand with them in meeting the extraordinary challenges of our day  not with pale actions  timid gestures  and empty rhetoric  but with bold vision  clear action  and high ideals that match the hopes and dreams of the American people   That is our duty as Democrats and as Americans on the war in Iraq The American people sent a clear message in November that we must change course in Iraq and begin to withdraw our troops  not escalate their presence   The way to start is by acting on the Presidents new plan   An escalation  whether it is called a surge or any other name  is still an escalation  and I believe it would be an immense new mistake   It would compound the original misguided decision to invade Iraq   We cannot simply speak out against an escalation of troops in Iraq   We must act to prevent it Our history makes clear that a new escalation in our forces will not advance our national security   It will not move Iraq toward self government  and it will needlessly endanger our troops by injecting more of them into the middle of a civil war Some will disagree   Listen to this comment from a high ranking American official   It became clear that if we were prepared to stay the course  we could help to lay the cornerstone for a diverse and independent AsiaIf we faltered  the forces of chaos would scent victory and decades of strife and aggression would stretch endlessly before us   The choice was clear   We would stay the course   And we shall stay the course That is not President Bush speaking   It is President Lyndon Johnson  forty years ago  ordering a hundred thousand more American soldiers to Vietnam      Here is another quotation   The big problem is to get territory and to keep it   You can get it today and it will be gone next week   That is the problem   You have to have enough people to clear itand enough people to preserve what you have done      That is not President Bush on the need for more forces in Iraq   It is President Johnson in 1966 as he doubled our military presence in Vietnam      Those comparisons from history resonate painfully in todays debate on Iraq   In Vietnam  the White House grew increasingly obsessed with victory  and increasingly divorced from the will of the people and any rational policy   The Department of Defense kept assuring us that each new escalation in Vietnam would be the last   Instead  each one led only to the next      Finally  in 1968  in large part because of the war  Democrats lost the White House   Richard Nixon was elected President after telling the American people that he had a secret plan to end the war   We all know what happened  though   As President  he escalated the war into Cambodia and Laos  and it went on for six more years      There was no military solution to that war   But we kept trying to find one anyway   In the end  58 000 Americans died in the search for it Echoes of that disaster are all around us today   Iraq is George Bushs Vietnam      As with Vietnam  the only rational solution to the crisis is political  not military   Injecting more troops into a civil war is not the answer   Our men and women in uniform cannot force the Iraqi people to reconcile their differences      The open ended commitment of our military forces continues to enable the Iraqis to avoid taking responsibility for their own future   Tens of thousands of additional American troops will only make the Iraqis more resentful of Americas occupation   It will also make the Iraqi government even more dependent on America  not less      General Abizaid made this point plainly when he told the Senate Armed Services Committee last November  I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more and from taking more responsibility for their own future      General Abizaid was unequivocal that increasing our troop commitment is not the answer      He said  Ive met with every divisional commander  General Casey  the corps commander  General Dempsey  we all talked together   And I said  in your professional opinion  if we were to bring in more American troops now  does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq   And they all said no   That was General Abizaid      General Casey reiterated this view just two weeks ago   He said  The longer that U S  forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraqs security  it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to make the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militias They can continue to blame us for all of Iraqs problems  which are  at base  their problems      One of our great military commanders  former Secretary of State Colin Powell  put it this way last month   I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purpose of suppressing this communitarian violence  this civil war  will work      Such an escalation would be a policy of desperation built on denial and fantasy   It is stay the course under another name   It will not resolve the Iraq war  but it will exact a fearsome new toll in American lives and further weaken our nation   It will make America more hated in the world  and make the war on terrorism even harder to win      For the sake of our men and women in uniform in Iraq  the President should have heeded these generals  not discarded them and gone shopping for advice that matches his own wishful  flawed thinking   Cooking the intelligence is how we got into this war   Ignoring the sound counsel of our military is no way to end it      The American people are also well aware that the military action authorized by Congress in 2002 was for a very different war than we face today   Our troops are now caught in the crossfire of a civil war  a role that Congress has not approved and that the American people rejected in November      Many of us felt the authorization to go to war was a grave mistake at the time      Ive said that my vote against the war in Iraq is the best vote Ive cast in my 44 years in the United States Senate   But no matter what any of us thought then  the Iraq War resolution is obviously obsolete today      It authorized a war to destroy weapons of mass destruction   But there were no WMDs to destroy   It authorized a war with Saddam Hussein   But today  Saddam is no more   It authorized a war because Saddam was allied with al Qaeda   But there was no alliance      The mission of our armed forces today in Iraq bears no resemblance whatever to the mission authorized by Congress   President Bush should not be permitted to escalate the war further  and send an even larger number of our troops into harms way  without a clear and specific new authorization from Congress      In everybodys reality except the Administrations  Iraq is now in the middle of a civil war      Sectarian violence is on the rise   Militias continue to commit unspeakable acts of violence and torture   Ethnic cleansing is a fact of daily life   Millions of Iraqis are fleeing the violence and leaving their country      No one can seriously deny that this civil war is radically different from the mission Congress voted for in 2002   Why should even more of our troops be sent to Iraq in the middle of this civil war      The President may deny the plain truth   But the truth speaks loudly and tragically   Congress must no longer follow him deeper into the quagmire in Iraq      I recognize the Presidents almost certain determination to persist in his failed course   It appears that he will not listen to the views of Congress or of the American people      It is disappointing that he seems ready  even eager  to reject the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group   Instead of heeding the growing call for genuine change  he has used the time since that report to root out dissent in his own Administration and in our armed forces      This Congress cannot escape history or its own duty   If we do not learn from the mistakes of the past  we are condemned to repeat them   We must act  and act now  before the President sends more troops to Iraq  or else it will be too late      The legislation that we will introduce today is brief but essential   It requires the President to obtain approval from Congress before he sends even more American soldiers to Iraq   And it prohibits the President from spending taxpayer dollars on such an escalation unless Congress approves it      Our proposal will not diminish our support for the forces we already have in Iraq   We will continue to do everything we can to make sure they have all the support they truly need   Even more important  we will continue to do all we can to bring them safely home   The best immediate way to support our troops is by refusing to inject more and more of them into the cauldron of a civil war that can be resolved only by the people and government of Iraq      I will seek a Senate vote on this proposal at the earliest realistic date   I hope that instead of escalation without end and without authorization  the President will follow through on his words last week  when he said  We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus on Iraq   If he truly means those words  he will ask Congress for our approval      The heavy price of our flawed decisions a generation ago is memorialized on sacred ground not far from here   On a somber walk through the Vietnam Memorial  we are moved by the painful  powerful eloquence of its enduring tribute to the tens of thousands who were lost in that tragic war that America never should have fought   Our fingers can gently trace the names etched into the stark black granite face of the memorial      We wonder what might have been  if America had faced up honestly to its failed decisions before it was too late      I often pause as well at Section 60 in Arlington National Cemetery   Those from Massachusetts who have fallen in Iraq lie there now in quiet dignity   Each time  I am struck by the heavy price of the war in their young lives cut so sadly short      The casualties are high   The war is long   The time is late   But as Tennyson said  Come  my friends   Tis not too late to seek a newer world      Those words speak clearly to all of us today   And we are inspired anew to wage this battle by the concluding line of that great poem   To strive  to seek  to find  and not to yield      Thank you very much SUMMARY OF KENNEDY LEGISLATIONThe legislation requires the Congress to vote before the President escalates troop levels in Iraq  It does not cut off funding for our troops already in Iraq The legislation claims the peoples right to a full voice in the Presidents plan to send more troops into the Iraq civil war   It says that no funds can be spent to send additional troops to Iraq unless Congress approves the Presidents proposed escalation of American forces The Iraq War Resolution of 2002 authorized a war against the regime of Saddam Hussein because he was believed to have weapons of mass destruction and an operational relationship with Al Qaeda  and was in defiance of U N  Security Council Resolutions   The mission of our armed forces today in Iraq no longer bears any resemblance to the mission authorized by Congress Iraq has descended into civil war and sectarian violence continues to escalate On March 5  2006  General Nash said  We re in a civil war now  it s just that not everybody s joined in   On December 3  2006  U N  Secretary General Kofi Annan said  When we had the strife in Lebanon and other places  we called that a civil war    this is much worse    On December 17  2006  Secretary Colin Powell said   I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence  this civil war  will work  Iraq needs a political solution  not a military solution  The open ended commitment of our military forces continues to enable the Iraqis to avoid taking responsibility for their own future   Tens of thousands of additional U S  troops will only make the Iraqis more dependent on America  not less  On November 15  2006  General Abizaid was

General Casey said  The longer we in the U S  forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraqs security  it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militiasThey can continue to blame us for all of Iraqs problems  which are at base their problems More than 3 000 American soldiers have died in Iraq and more than 22 000 have been wounded  America cannot wait for the next president to resolve the problems in Iraq   A military escalation in Iraq would not strengthen our national security President Bush should not be permitted to increase the number of United States troops in harms way in the civil war without a specific new authorization from Congress  The legislation requires a vote before funds are spent to deploy more troops and escalate our military presence   It does not cut off funding for our troops already in Iraq   ESCALATION IS NOT THE ANSWER The centerpiece of Bushs new Way Forward in Iraq is to send tens of thousands more troops to Baghdad  This is not the new magic bullet for Iraq Troop Escalation has been tried Before with No Long Term Success    Troops were increased by 15 000 to 137 000 to quell Maqtada al Sadrs uprising   December 2003 April 2004    April 2004 was the second bloodiest month of the war for our troops  Today  Maqtada al Sadr is more powerful then ever and is currently commanding a militia of 60 000 followers     Troops were increased by 12 000 to 150 000 to route out insurgents from Fallujah and provide security for the January 2005 elections  November 2004 March 2005   Today  the situation in Fallujah  part of Anbar Province is dire  In fact  it was the subject of recent Marine Corps report stating that  prospects for securing that country s western Anbar province are dim and that there is almost nothing the U S  military can do to improve the political and social situation there     Troops were increased by 22 000 to 160 000 to provide security for the constitutional referendum and parliamentary elections  September December 2005   The increased troops levels provided calm on election days but did not have a long term effect on stability for the country      Troops were increased by 12 000 to 140 000 to stabilize Baghdad  June October 2006   This fall was the bloodiest ever for our troops since the war began We dont need more troops to Police a Civil War    During September and October  7 054 civilians were violently killed  including almost 5 000 in Baghdad alone   This is an increase of approximately 450 from July and August when the death toll reached 6 599   In May and June 5818 Iraqi civilians were violently killed  The death toll of Iraqi civilians continues to mount  United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq Human Rights Reports May to October 2006     Violence reached alarming levels in many parts of the countrySectarian attacks seem to be the main source of violence in the country  fueled by action of the insurgents and militias  as well as various criminal groups  United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq  Human Rights Report 1 September 31 October 2006    Hundreds of civilians continued to be kidnapped and their bodies subsequently scattered in different areas of Baghdad  handcuffed  blindfolded and bearing signs of torture and execution style killing  Many witnesses reported that perpetrators wore militia attire and even police or army uniforms  The perpetrators were reported to operate in groups  arrive in what appeared as police vehicles and were not deterred by the presence of police forces in the vicinity  United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq  Human Rights Report 1 September 31 October 2006    Conditions that could lead to civil war exist in Iraq  specifically in and around Baghdad  and concern about civil war within the Iraqi civilian population has increased in recent months  Department of Defense  Report on Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq  September 1  2006    We re starting to see this conflict here transition from an insurgency against us to a struggle for the division of political and economic power among the Iraqis  General Casey  September 21  2006     The violence has caused an estimated 1 6 million Iraqis to be displaced internally and up to1 8 million refugees are to flee neighboring countries  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  UNHCR Briefing Notes  November 3  2006 The Solution to Iraqs Problem is Political not MilitaryThe generals know Iraq needs a political solution  Adding more troops wont force the Iraqis to come together and work out their differences     If you look back historically as how insurgencies have been defeated  they have been defeated when the insurgents saw their options as better protected in the political process and their prospects for economic advancement can be better protected by the political process than fighting for them  And that s the essential element here  General Casey  Testimony to Senate Armed Services Committee  June 23  2005     Insurgencies  we ve talked about  aren t defeated just militarily   educational opportunities  and informational components both internally and externally  And what we ve tried to do is harness all instruments of our national power and all the instruments of national power of our international friends and partners in this to bring those instruments of national power  of which the military is just one  to bear on the problem   General Myers  Testimony to Senate Armed Services Committee  September 29  2005    Our troops are the best equipped  the best trained  the best led in the world  And I am enormously proud of them  and I have the utmost confidence in their ability to handle any mission  Yet  sectarian violence is worse than ever in Baghdad in particular  And I wonder about the validity of a strategy that says that less capable troops that are not as well equipped  trained and led as the best troops in the world can handle the security of this country if the upswing in violence has occurred despite the presence of the best troops in the world  It doesn t give me a lot of confidence in our underlying strategy  And it suggests to me that what we need is a political rather than a military solution  General Abizaid  Testimony to Senate Armed Services Committee August 3  2006 More Forces Make Americans a crutch for the Iraqis    I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more  from taking more responsibility for their own future  General John Abizaid  Testimony to Senate Armed Services Committee  November 15  2006    The longer we in the U S  forces continue to bear the burden of Iraqs security  it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militiasthey can continue to blame us for all of Iraqs problems  which are at base their problems  General George Casey  Telephone

said  In your professional opinion  if we were to bring in more American troops now  does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq  And they all said no   And the reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more  General John Abizaid  Testimony to Senate Armed Services Committee  November 15  2006I am adamantly opposed to reinforcing the current troop strength in Iraq  I think it s a big mistake  If you put an inconsequential increase  20 000 to 30 000 troops  three  four  five brigades  it won t make any major change in the tactical situation  General Barry Mccaffrey  Ret    Hardball with Chris Matthews  November 20  2006 Over the last five years  the sustained strategic demand     is placing a strain on the Army s all volunteer force  At this pace  without recurrent access to the reserve components through remobilization  we will break the active component  General Peter Schoomaker  Testimony to Army Panel to recommend changes for the National Guard and Reserves  December 14  2006 We do not believe that just adding numbers for the sake of adding numbersjust thickening the mixis necessarily the way to go  Commandant of the Marine Corps General James Conway  Press Interview  December 16  2006I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence  this civil war  will work   Former Secretary of State Colin Powell  CBS Face the Nation  December 17  2006 Putting another 20 000 or 30 000 troops  particularly into urban combat in a city of seven million Arabs of Baghdad  is a fools errand   It is sticking your finger in the water   When you pull your finger out  their presence will not have made a difference  General Barry Mccaffrey  Hardball with Chris Matthews  December 19  2006 The longer we in the U S  forces continue to bear the burden of Iraqs security  it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing

EscalationIf there is a road map to victory  then I would be prepared to listen to what the president has to say about more troops  But on this date of the record  I do not see it  Senator Arlen Specter  The Washington Post  January 1  2007 I don t think the addition of new American troops in a situation plagued by sectarian strife is the answer  I think more American troops will present more American targets  Senator Susan Collins  The Washington Post  January 1  2007 The prime minister made it pretty clear that he did not welcome the idea of more American troops  I would speculate that he recognizes that he needs to take control of the situation  that if he s seen as completely dependent on American troops it s difficult for him to establish his legitimacy Senator Susan Collins  The Washington Post  January 1  2007Baghdad needs reconciliation between Shiites and Sunnis  It doesn t need more Americans in the cross hairs  Senator Norm Coleman  The Los Angeles Times  January 5  2007 My conclusion was that it would be a mistake to send more troops to Baghdad  I think the sectarian violence there requires a political  not a military  solution  Senator Susan Collins  AP Worldstream  January 6  2007We are bogged down and will continue to be bogged down in Iraq  andespecially if he puts in more troops  If there s anything clear to me that we should have learned about Vietnam  You can t continue to put more troops in  more troops in  because it makes it more difficult to get out  Senator Chuck Hagel  Omaha World Herald  January 6  2007  IRAQ IS IN A CIVIL WAR    We re in a civil war now  it s just that not everybody s joined in  General Nash  March 5  2006    Everything is in place if they want to have a civil war  General Pace  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  March 13  2006    I think we have had a low grade civil war going on in Iraq  certainly the last six months  maybe the last year  Senator Hagel  March 19  2006    We are unfortunately engaged in a civil war   We are losing between 50 and 60 persons daily all over the country  and probably more   If this is not civil war  then God knows what civil war is  Former Prime Minister Allawi  March 19  2006    Civil war is taking place in Iraq  the situation is very bad  and the country needs quick measures for saving the situation   Former Prime Minister Allawi  March 20  2006    It s not a full  blown civil war   It s really terrible and severe sectarian violence which    which can turn into a full blown civil war   And sectarian violence is a stage of civil war  one of the stages of    probably an early stage of civil war  Former Prime Minister Allawi  March 22  2006    I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I ve seen it  in Baghdad in particular  and that if not stopped  it is possible that Iraq could move towards civil war  General Abizaid  U S  Central Command  August 3  2006    The prospect of a low intensity civil war and a de facto division of Iraq is probably more likely at this stage than a successful and substantial transition to a stable democracy  British Ambassador to Iraq Patey  August 3  2006    We  in fact  are in probably a low grade  maybe a very defined  civil war  Senator Hagel  August 20  2006    So what I think we have is something which is  at the very best  civil war in miniature  at the very best  British Royal Marine Lt  Gen  Fry  August 22  2006    We re starting to see this conflict here transition from an insurgency against us to a struggle for the division of political and economic power among the Iraqis   General Casey  September 21  2006    Given the developments on the ground  unless something is done drastically and urgently to arrest the deteriorating situation  we could be there  In fact  we are almost there    Secretary General Annan  November 28  2006     The situation in Iraq could be considered a civil war    Secretary Powell  November 29  2006     When we had the strife in Lebanon and other places  we called that a civil war    this is much worse   Secretary General Annan  December 3  2006    I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence  this civil war  will work   Secretary Powell  December 17  2006 Use of Force in Iraq    On October 22  2002  President Bush signed into law the Authorization for the Use of Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002  which gave him congressional authorization to use the military as necessary and appropriate in order to  1  defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq  and  2  enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq     The resolution was premised explicitly on statements that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction  had defied U N  resolutions and harbored and enabled terrorists  including al Qaeda   In reality  Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction and did not have any operational relations with al Qaeda      Any purpose that the resolution was intended to serve was satisfied when Saddam Hussein and his regime were toppled and replaced by an elected government     Pursuant to the War Powers Resolution  which Congress passed in 1973 over the veto of President Nixon  Congress must authorize the use of troops in combat through a declaration of war or other congressional authorization   The President may commit troops without such authorization  but unless he obtains it  he must withdraw the troops within 60 days   He may obtain an additional 30 days to ensure safe withdrawal of the troops   The original resolution governing the use of force in Iraq was consistent with the War Powers Resolution     Pursuant to the Constitution  Congress retains substantial authority over decisions to commit troops to combat   It has authority  which it has exercised  to decide whether or not to fund the commitment of troops     By all accounts  the President intends to announce a substantial increase in the number of troops committed to the Iraq war to carry out a substantial increase in the mission in Iraq     Under the structure of the War Powers Resolution and exercising its constitutional authority  Congress has the power to enact legislation requiring the President to seek an authorization for this new military mission before it will appropriate funds to carry it out  Background on War Powers Resolution    The War Powers Resolution was enacted on Nov  7  1973 when Congress voted to override President Nixons veto by votes of 284 135 in the House and 75 18 in the Senate   Majorities of both Democrats and Republicans supported the override     The Resolution was a response to frustration that President had conducted the Vietnam War without meaningful input from Congress   It was designed to establish a framework to force dialogue between the President and Congress before troops were committed to combat and to ensure a role for Congress once troops were in the field     The Resolution       states that there are three situations in which the President can send forces into imminent hostilities  pursuant to  1  a declaration of war   2  specific statutory authorization  or  3  a national emergency created by attack upon the United States       requires the President in every possible instance to consult with Congress before committing troops      requires the President to report to Congress within 48 hours after committing troops in a situation involving hostilities or imminent hostilities      directs the withdrawal of troops within 60 days after such a report unless the President obtains a declaration of war  congressional authorization or a congressional extension of the deadline   He may keep the troops deployed for an additional 30 days if necessary to ensure their safe removal from hostilities      instructs the President to remove troops whenever Congress passes a concurrent resolution directing him to do so     Presidents have submitted 119 reports consistent with the War Powers Resolution   Generally  Presidents have complied with the terms of the Resolution without acknowledging that they were legally required to do so     The Authorization for the Use of Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002  which gave the President power to send troops to Iraq  satisfied the War Powers Resolution   That resolution  however  was based on faulty premises  namely that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and harbored al Qaeda   It also rested on his defiance of UN resolutions   That authorization no longer has relevance to todays Iraq  from which Saddam Hussein has been removed     Requiring the President to seek a new authorization to support an expansion of the war in Iraq is consistent with the structure and purposes of the War Powers Resolution   It will force the President to come forward with a plan and  after debate    obtain congressional approval or disapproval     Congress unquestionably has the power pursuant to the Constitution to require the President to seek authorization for his war plan before it appropriates the funds to carry it out   Congress Historical Role in Policing Military EscalationOn numerous occasions over the past several decades  Congress has exercised its constitutional authority to limit the Presidents ability to escalate existing military engagements by capping the number of American military personnel available for deployment and by refusing to release appropriated funds   It is incumbent upon Congress to exercise that authority to ensure that our men and women are not put in harms way unnecessarily or without a plan worthy of their great sacrifice       In the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974  P L  93 559  enacted during the Vietnam War  Congress limited the number of American military personnel in South Vietnam to 4 000 within six months and 3 000 within a year of the Acts enactment          The Lebanon Emergency Assistance Act of 1983  P L  98 43  required the President to obtain statutory authorization from the Congress with respect to any substantial expansion in the number or role in Lebanon of the United States Armed Forces  including any introduction of United States Armed Forces into Lebanon in conjunction with agreements providing for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon and for the creation of a new multinational peace keeping force in Lebanon      Through the Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1985  P L  98 525  Congress prohibited the use of funds appropriated in the Act or in subsequent Acts from being used to increase the number of U S  military personnel deployed in European nations of NATO   The Act provided that Congress might authorize increased troop levels above the prescribed ceiling upon the Secretary of Defenses certification to Congress that the European nations had taken significant measures to improve their defense capacity       In the Military Construction Appropriations Act of 2001  P L  106 246  Congress limited the involvement of U S  military personnel and civilian contractors in counter narcotics activities in Colombia by prohibiting the use of appropriated funds to expand their presence above specified levels       The Second Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1973  P L  93 50  specified that none of the funds appropriated by the Act were to be used to support directly or indirectly combat activities in or over Cambodia  Laos  North Vietnam  and South Vietnam or off the shores of Cambodia  Laos  North Vietnam and South Vietnam by United States Forces and after August 15  1973  no other funds heretofore appropriated under any other Act may be expended for such purpose      Congress authorized the use of U S  Armed Forces in Somalia in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 1994  P L  103 139  but set a deadline after which appropriated funds could no longer be used to pay for their involvement   The Act specified that the deadline could only be extended if requested by the President and authorized by the Congress       In the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 1995  P L  103 335  Congress required congressional approval of any change in the United States mission in Rwanda from one of strict refugee relief to security  peace enforcing  or nation building or any other substantive role and blocked funding for continued participation of the U S  military in Operation Support Hope beyond a specified date      The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998  P L  105 85  provided that no funds appropriated for fiscal year 1998 or any subsequent year could be used for the deployment of any U S  ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina after a specified cutoff date unless the President first consulted with Congress and then certified to Congress that certain conditions existed in the field  SPEECH BIBLIOGRAPHY    It became clear that if we were prepared to stay the course in Vietnam  we could help to lay the cornerstone for a diverse and independent Asia  If we faltered  the forces of chaos would scent victory and decades of strife and aggression would stretch endlessly before us   The choice was clear   We would stay the course   And we shall stay the course   President Johnson  Address to the Tennessee Legislature  March 15  1967    The big problem is to get it and to keep it   You can get it today and it will be gone next week   That is the problem   You have to have enough people to clear it and enough people to preserve what you have done  President Johnson  Press Conference October 14  1966    I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more  from taking more responsibility for their own future  United States Central Commander General John Abizaid  Testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee  November 15  2006    I ve met with every divisional commander  General Casey  the corps commander  General Dempsey  we all talked together   And I said  in your professional opinion  if we were to bring in more American troops now  does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq   And they all said no   United States Central Commander General John Abizaid  Testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee  November 15  2006    The longer we in the U S  forces continue to bear the burden of Iraqs security  it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militiasthey can continue to blame us for all of Iraqs problems  which are at base their problems   Multinational Force Commander General George Casey  Telephone interview  December 29  2006    I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence  this civil war  will work   Former Secretary of State Colin Powell  CBS Face the Nation  December 17  2006    We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus on Iraq   President George W  Bush  What Congress Can Do for America  Wall
