         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today we are considering the nomination of Charles Millard to be Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  Let me start by thanking Senator Mikulski for agreeing to help Chair this important hearing  She had a vital role in the passage of the Pension Protection Act last year  and has shown impressive leadership as Chair of our Retirement and Aging Subcommittee  Id also like to thank Senator Enzi for his continuing leadership and partnership on these issues  and to recognize Senator Burr as the new Ranking Member of the Subcommittee The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has a main role in our retirement safety net  44 million American workers and their families rely on it to insure their hard earned pensions  This agency was established so that never again would employees who gave a lifetime of service to a company be left with nothing when their company pension plan failed  The agencys director is not only the chief steward of Americans retirement  but also the leading advocate for defined benefit pensions  This is a time of great change in our retirement system  Only 50 percent of American workers have any type of retirement plan through their job  In the last twenty five years  the percent of workers with a secure  defined benefit pension has been cut in half  so that today only one in five workers is earning a traditional pension  As we know from the many pension failures in recent years  even these workers arent secure  In this climate of uncertainty  the PBGC is more important than ever  When pensions fail  workers and retirees are left unsure about their future  The agency is responsible for ensuring that retirees and workers know what has happened to their pensions and receive their payments in a timely manner  I look forward to hearing from Mr  Millard about how he intends to work to increase the agencys advocacy on workers behalf The Pension Protection Act enacted last year created new rules to improve pension funding  thus lowering the risk to workers and the agency  It will be some years before the full effect of this legislation is known  in the meantime  the agency continues to face serious financial challenges  It has a projected deficit of  18 9 billiona decrease from recent years  yet a stark difference from 2001 when it had a surplus  Retirees benefits are in no immediate danger  but there is obviously cause for concern Its vital that the agency make its investments  in ways that are consistent with providing the maximum benefit to retirees  In recent years  the agency has changed its policies  shifting more toward investments in bonds  I understand that Mr  Millard is in the process of reviewing these decisions  I believe he should conduct his review with an eye toward best protecting the retirees under the agencys care  Finally  the best strategy to protect workers pensions is to act early to prevent pension failures  Thats why I have long supported enabling the agency to negotiate with struggling companies before their pensions fail  to keep pensions afloat  A provision establishing such an alternative funding arrangement program was included in the Pension Protection Act passed by the Senate  but unfortunately it was dropped in conference  I strongly believe that it is in the best interests of workers  retirees  and the PBGC to explore this and every other available means to protect and preserve workers pensions and prevent future losses  As Interim Director  Mr  Millard has no doubt already become aware of the challenges faced by the agency  As director he has the demanding job of safeguarding Americans security in their retirement  It takes someone with knowledge  experience  and determination to lead the agency at this critical time  and I look forward to hearing Mr  Millards views on all of these issues      Laura Burton Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
