         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC Late last night  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement on the passage by the United States Senate of the America COMPETES Act  which invests in education  especially in math  science  engineering  and technology  creates a Presidents Council to encourage innovation  and doubles the support for research at the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation for the next seven years  Senator Kennedy said  The America COMPETES bill takes needed steps to create a stronger America in the global economy  Greater investments in education  research and innovation are essential for meeting the challenges of this new century  The nation has done it before  and we can do it again  As Prepared for Delivery Our increasingly global economy is creating numerous challenges for Americas families nationwide  Across the country  hardworking citizens are being left behind  The value of their wages is declining  their cost of living is going up  and many of their jobs are being shipped overseas  As a result  the nation is falling behind in the world economy  Study after study tells us the answer is to invest more in education  research and innovation  if we hope to keep up with other countries whose economies are soaring We know that a sound education is more important than ever for todays youth to succeed  Yet studies show  for example  that 15 year old U S  students score below average in math and science compared to the youth of other industrial nations  In one study  our 15 year olds ranked only 24th in math  High school and college graduation rates are also falling behind  Our college graduation rate today has now dropped below the average graduation rate for OECD countries  We know that federal investments in research lead to medical  scientific  and technology breakthroughs  But these investments have been shrinking as a share of the economy  In real terms  government spending for research has been flat  Since 1975  weve dropped from 3rd to 15th in the production of scientists and engineers Its a serious problem and we cant just tinker at the margins  We have a responsibility to our people  our economy  our security  and our nation to make the investments to achieve the progress we need in the years ahead  The America COMPETES Act is a step in the right direction  It will help put America back on track It invests in research  by doubling the support for research at the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation over the next 7 years  and will increase funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology as well It invests in innovation  by creating a Presidents Council on Innovation and Competitiveness to determine the most effective ways to create jobs and move our economy forward Above all  it will invest in education  especially in math and science  engineering  and technology from the elementary school through high school and beyond  in order to attract more young people to pursue careers in these fields in the years ahead  The problem today is especially serious for our low income and minority students  Teachers are the single most important factor in improving student achievement and narrowing the achievement gap  One study found that having a high quality teacher for five years in a row can close the average 7th grade achievement gap in math between lower income and higher income children  Yet too often  low income and minority students are taught by the least prepared  least experienced  and least qualified teachers  Math and science classes in high poverty schools are much more likely to be taught by teachers who do not have a degree in their field We know what we need to do  and this bill will help us do it  We must make sure all students are getting the teachers they need and deserve in the subjects that matter most in the new economy  This bill addresses the teacher challenge head on by taking strong steps to ensure that all children have access to a high quality teacher with strong content knowledge in math  science  engineering and technology  particularly in high need schools  where such teachers are needed most  The bill expands the Robert Noyce Teacher Program of the National Science Foundation  NSF  by creating a new NSF Teaching Fellows program to prepare accomplished math  science  technology and engineering professionals to teach in high need schools  It also creates a Master Teaching Fellows program to leverage the talents of the best teachers to improve instruction in high need schools  Teaching Fellows in the program will receive annual salary supplements of  10 000 a year in exchange for a commitment to teach for at least four years in a high need school The bill also expands the Teacher Institutes for the 21st Century Program at NSF  which provides cutting edge professional development programs throughout the school year and during the summer for teachers in high need schools  In addition  the bill supports impressive new programs in colleges and universities to prepare math  science  technology  engineering and foreign language teachers  These programs will combine bachelors degrees with concurrent teacher certification in their subjects  and will create masters degree programs for teachers to improve their knowledge in these subjects and to encourage math and science professionals to go into teaching  Too often today  elementary and secondary school standards are not aligned with the expectations of colleges and employers  In many cases  high school graduates are struggling to keep up in college and the workplace  Remedial education and lost earning potential cost the nation 3 7 billion a year  because so many students are not adequately prepared for college when they leave high school  Our bill will help states align their standards with the demands of the 21st century workplace  Grants to states to create P 16 Councils will bring the elementary and secondary schools  college  businesses  and the Armed Forces together to ensure that education standards are better aligned with the expectations of colleges  the workforce  and the military  This alignment is essential if we hope to remain internationally competitive  Support will also be available for new data systems in states to track students achievement and help them graduate prepared to succeed The bill will help give students in low income districts the same opportunities as those in wealthier districts to enroll and succeed in college preparatory classes  by expanding access to Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate classes This bill invests as well in foreign language education  to ensure that students are exposed to foreign languages and cultures  More than 80 Federal agencies now use tens of thousands of employees with skills in 100 foreign languages  and our businesses need the same  For students to become proficient in foreign languages  they need sustained study  beginning in the early grades  But only a third of students in grades 7 through 12 today and only 5 percent of elementary school students study a foreign language  The bill provides grants to colleges and local educational agencies to create partnerships for students from elementary school through college to study such languages Finally  the bill will encourage new interest in nuclear science  Massachusetts has long been a leader in this research  Of three dozen licensed research reactors in the United States  three are located in Massachusetts universities  The University of Massachusetts in Lowell  Worcester Polytechnic Institute  and MIT  These colleges will have an increasingly important role as nuclear science expands  and our bill will expand existing programs and establish new ones to meet the growing demand All of these programs and investments are designed to help prepare us to compete in the 21st century  but there is more we must do if we intend to keep our nation and our workforce truly competitive  Significant new investments are needed to expand opportunities for higher education  College is more important than ever today  but it is also more expensive than ever  In the Senate two weeks ago  we passed the largest increase in student aid since the G I  Bill  and I look forward to delivering that aid for low income students as quickly as possible We must also address the increasingly demanding impact of the global economy on American workers and their families  Our hard working men and women deserve greater job security today and greater job opportunities in the future  This bill puts first things first  Increased investments in education  research  and innovation are indispensable to our success as a nation  Weve done it before and we must do it again  Lets begin with this bill      Laura
