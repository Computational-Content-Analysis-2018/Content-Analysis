         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to the 2006 hate crimes statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Investigations      The upward trend in the number of hate crimes may be the tip of the iceberg since many state and local jurisdictions dont participate in the data collection  We obviously need to strengthen the existing federal hate crimes law  A provision to do just that was included in the Senate version of the Defense Authorization  and hopefully the FBI report will persuade the House to accept it  Its essential to send a strong message here at home and around the world that our country will not tolerate crimes fueled by hate      A summary of Senator Kennedys hate crimes legislation is also included below          Overview  The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act  LLEEA  is a bill to strengthen the ability of federal  state  and local governments to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race  ethnic background  religion  gender  sexual orientation  disability  and gender identity  It will strengthen state and local efforts by enabling the Justice Department to assist them in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes  The bill will also provide grants to help state and local governments meet the extraordinary expenses involved in hate crime cases  At the federal level  the LLEEA will eliminate the outdated intent requirement in current law that prevents the Justice Department from working with state and local officials in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes  It will allow the federal government to step in when needed  but only after the Department has certified that a federal prosecution is necessary     Intergovernmental assistance program  The LLEEA will provide technical  forensic  prosecutorial and other assistance to state and local law enforcement officials for hate crime investigations and prosecutions     Federal assistance and training grants  The LLEEA will authorize Justice Department grants of up to  100 000 to state  local  and Indian law enforcement officials who have incurred extraordinary expenses associated with investigating and prosecuting hate crimes  It will also authorize the Office of Justice Programs to award grants to state and local programs designed to combat hate crimes committed by juveniles  including programs to train local law enforcement officers in identifying  investigating  prosecuting  and preventing hate crimes     Prohibition of certain hate crime acts  The LLEEA will give the Justice Department jurisdiction over crimes of violence committed because of a persons actual or perceived race  color  religion  national origin  gender  sexual orientation  disability  or gender identity  Existing law only covers race  color  religion  or national origin based hate crimes  where the victim was engaging in one of six federally protected activities     Interstate commerce requirement  For crimes based on gender  sexual orientation  disability  or gender identity  the Justice Department must show a connection to interstate commerce  i e   that the defendant or victim crossed state lines or the defendant used a firearm that traveled through interstate commerce      Certification requirement  Prior to indicting someone under this Act  the Justice Department must certify that the state in which the hate crime occurred does not have jurisdiction  has asked the federal government to assume jurisdiction  or has failed to vindicate the federal interest against hate motivated violence  The LLEEA will provide a federal backstop for state and local law enforcement to deal with hate crimes that might otherwise not be aggressively investigated and prosecuted  or for which states request assistance           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
