         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      LIST OF BILL SUPPORTERS ATTACHED  Many of the best ideas in public policy are the simplest  The Childrens Health Insurance Program is based on one simple and powerful idea  that all children deserve a healthy start in life  and that no parents should have to worry about whether they can afford to take their child to the doctor when the child is sick  CHIP can make the difference between a child starting life burdened with disease  or a child who is healthy and ready to learn and grow  This need not be a partisan issue  My good friend Senator Hatch and I worked together in 1997 to create this program that was our shared vision for healthier future for American children  This year  we have once again worked together to find common ground on covering the children deserve decent  quality health care   In Massachusetts  in the 1990s we agreed that health care coverage for children is a necessity and that action needed to be taken  In 1993  the Massachusetts Legislature of the states Childrens Medical Security Plan  which guaranteed quality health care to children in families ineligible for Medicaid and unable to afford health insurance  A year later  Massachusetts expanded eligibility for Medicaid  and financed the expansion through a tobacco tax  the same approach we used successfully a few years later for CHIP and the same approach that is proposed in the bill before us now Rhode Island followed and other states took similar action  and helped create a nationwide demand for action by Congress to address the unmet needs of vast numbers of children for good health care In 1997  Congress acted on that call  and the result was CHIP  Senator Hatch and I worked together thenas we have this yearto focus on guaranteeing health care to children who need it  Now  in every state in America and in Puerto Rico  CHIP covers the services that give children a healthier start in life  well child care  vaccinations  doctor visits  emergency services  and many others  We know that CHIP works  Children across America depend on it for their health care  but there are still too many children that are left uninsured  In its first year 1997  CHIP enrolled nearly a million children  and enrollment has grown ever since  An average of 4 million are now covered each month  and 6 million are enrolled each year  Every state in America and in Puerto Rico  CHIP covers the services that give children a healthier start in life  well child care  vaccinations  doctor visits  emergency services  and many others  As a result  in the past decade  the percentage of uninsured children has dropped from almost 23 percent in 1997 to 14 percent today  That reduction is significant  but its obviously far from enough Children on CHIP are more likely to have a regular source of care than uninsured children  97 percent of CHIP can see a doctor regularly compared to only 62 percent of uninsured children What does this mean for these children  It means that their overall quality of life is improved because they can get the care they need when they need it  Their parents are more confident that they can get the health care they need  they are more likely to have a real doctor and a real place to obtain care  and  their parents dont delay seeking care when their child needs it  Children on CHIP also have significantly more access to preventive care Studies also show that CHIP helps to improve childrens school performance  After just one year on CHIP  children pay better attention in class and are more likely to keep up with all school activities  When children are receiving the health care they need  they do better academically  emotionally  physically and socially  CHIP helps create children who will be better prepared to contribute to America CHIP has perhaps had he greatest impact on minority communities  Sadly  we still have persistent racial and ethnic health disparities in America  African Americans have a lower life expectancy than whites  Many Americans want to believe such disparities dont exist  but ignoring them only contributes more to the widening gap between the haves and have nots  Minority children are much more likely to suffer from asthma  diabetes  HIV AIDS and other diseases than their white counterparts Minorities are more likely to be uninsured than whites  More than half of all children who receive public health insurance belong to a racial and ethnic minority group  The good news is that since the beginning of CHIP  the number of uninsured Latino children has decreased by nearly one third and the number of uninsured African American children has decreased by almost on half  And having CHIP works for minority children  CHIP all but eliminates the distressing racial and ethnic health disparities for the minority children who disproportionately depend on it for their coverage  Minority children are more likely to have their health care needs met  In other words they can see the doctor when they need  go to the hospital and get the medicines they need just like other children  when they are on CHIP They are also more likely to have a real doctor not just sporadic visits to the emergency roomwhen they are covered by CHIP For specific diseases  like asthma  children on CHIP have much better outcomes than when they were uninsured CHIPs success is even more impressive and important when we realize that more and more adults are losing their own insurance coverage  because employers reduce it or drop it entirely  Thats why organizations representing children  or the health care professionals who serve them  agree that preserving and strengthening CHIP is essential to childrens health  The American Academy of Pediatrics  First Focus  the American Medical Association  the National Association of Childrens Hospitals and countless other organizations dedicated to children all strongly support CHIP A statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics puts it this way  Enrollment in SCHIP is associated with improved access  continuity  and quality of care  and a reduction in racial ethnic disparities  As pediatricians  we see what happens when children dont receive necessary health care services such as immunizations and well child visits  Their overall health suffers and expensive emergency room visits increase Today  we are here to dedicate ourselves to carrying on the job begun by Congress ten years ago  and to make sure that the lifeline of CHIP is strengthened and extended to many more children  Millions of children now eligible for CHIP or Medicaid are not enrolled in these programs  Of the nine million uninsured children  over two thirdsmore than 6 million  are already eligible for Medicaid or CHIP  These programs are there to help them  but these children are not receiving that help either because their parents dont know about the programs  or because of needless barriers to enrollment Think about that number9 million children in the wealthiest and most powerful nation on earth  9 million children whose only family doctor is the hospital emergency room  9 million children at risk of blighted lives and early death because of illnesses that could easily be treated if they have a regular source of medical care  9 million uninsured children in America isn t just wrongit s outrageous  and we need to change it as soon as possible We know where the Bush Administration stands  The Presidents proposal for CHIP doesnt provide whats needed to cover children who are eligible but unenrolled  In fact  the Presidents proposal is  8 billion less than whats needed simply to keep children now enrolled in CHIP from losing their current coverage 8 billion short  To make matters worse  the President has threatened to veto the Senate bill which does the job that needs to be done if were serious about guaranteeing decent health care to children of working families across America  We can t rely on the Administration to do what is needed  We in Congress have to step up to the plate and renew our commitment to CHIP  The Senate bill is a genuine bipartisan compromise  It provides coverage to 4 million children who would otherwise be uninsured  It adjusts the financing structure of CHIP so that states that are covering their children arent forced to scramble for additional funds from year to year  and  so that Congress doesnt have to pass a new band aid every year to stop the persistent bleeding under the current program  Importantly  this bill will not allow states to keep their CHIP funds if they arent doing something to actually cover children Equally important  this bill allows each state to cover children at income levels that make sense for their state The bill also supports quality improvement and better outreach and enrollment efforts for the program  Its a scandal that 6 million children today who are eligible for the program are not enrolled in it In sum  this bill moves us forward together  Republicans and Democrats alike  to guarantee the children of America the health care they need and deserve Our priority should be not merely to hold on to the gains of the past  but to see that all children have an access to decent coverage  Families with greater means should pay a fair share of the coverage  But every parent in America should have the opportunity to meet the health care needs of their children In Massachusetts  I met a woman named Dedre Lewis  Her daughter Alexsiana developed an eye disease that if left untreated would make her go blind  Because of our state CHIP program Masshealth  Dedre is able to get the medicine and doctors visits need to prevent Alexsianas blindness  Dedre said this If I miss a single appointment  I know she could lose her eyesight  If I can t buy her medication  I know she could lose her eyesight  If I didn t have Masshealth  my daughter would be blind This is the impact CHIP has on families across America Let me close by saying that quality health for children isn t just an interesting option or a nice idea  It s not just something we wish we could do  It s an obligation  It s something we have to do  And its something we can do today  I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure this very important legislation is enacted List of Organizations Supporting CHIP Reauthorization Act
