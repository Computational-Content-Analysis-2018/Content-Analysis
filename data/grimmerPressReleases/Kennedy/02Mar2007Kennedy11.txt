         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C Recognizing the need to prevent the perpetuation of future  terrorist hoaxes  Senator Edward Kennedy  D MA   Senators Norm Coleman  R MN    and Jon Kyl  R Ariz   introduced legislation that would impose stricter  penalties on those who commit fraudulent acts of terrorism as well as expand the  definition of prosecutable offenses  Its unconscionable in this  post 9 11 world  for anyone to be perpetrating hoaxes that cause panic and drain  already limited public safety resources  said Kennedy  Hopefully  this bill  will fulfill its purpose of preventing the false alarms that can be so  disruptive of our families and our communities in these difficult and dangerous  times Terrorizing the public through false  threats is not a joke  We need to send a clear message to those thinking about  hoaxes that they will pay dearly  said Coleman  The threats may be fake but  the consequences are very real in terms of costs to first responders  lost  revenues and sometimes even injury or the loss of human life  By diverting  resources and attention  such acts make it that much harder to protect our  nation from real acts of terror  We need to make certain that the punishment  fits this crime and deters any future attempts to falsely terrorize the citizens  of Minnesota and across the country U S   law enforcement and authorities already have the monumental responsibility of  protecting the United States from the real threat of terrorism  said Kyl  It  is completely unacceptable to have people  groups  and companies perpetrating  fraudulent threats for personal gain and entertainment  I am pleased to join  with Senator Coleman to help ensure that our law enforcement officials are able  to focus on the very real terrorist threats we face today Current federal statute broadly defines the list of  punishable terrorist hoaxes and does not include fraudulent terrorist acts such  as hoaxes to blow up energy facilities  attacks on military bases or attacks on  railways and mass transportation facilities  This legislation seeks to fill  these gaps by expanding the hoax statute to punish hoaxes involving any offense  included on the U S  Codes official list of federal terrorist offenses   Specifically  the bill  Expands on the current terrorism hoax statute  so this punishes hoaxes about any terrorist offense on the U S  Codes official  list of terrorist offenses  Increases the maximum penalties for hoaxes about  the death or injury of a U S  soldier during wartime  Expands current laws  civil liability provisions to allow first responders and others to seek  reimbursement from a party who perpetrates a hoax and becomes aware that first  responders believe that a terrorist offense is taking place but fails to inform  authorities that no such event has occurred  and Clarifies that threatening  communications are punishable under federal law even if they are directed at an  organization rather than a natural person  The bill increases the  penalties for perpetrating a hoax about the death  injury  or capture of a U S   soldier during wartime  Under the bill  the maximum penalty for such hoax would  be 10 years imprisonment  and a hoax resulting in serious bodily injury could  be punished by up to 25 years imprisonment        Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202 224 2633
