         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Muchissimas gracias  Luis  Thank you very much Luis Es un gran honor para mi recibir este premio  Estoy inmensamente agradecido  Its a great honor to receive this award  Im immensely grateful I commend Esperanza USA for your outstanding leadership for Latino communities throughout the United States  and for your invaluable partnership in the current battle for comprehensive immigration reform  Reverend Luis Cortess leadership on these issues has been truly visionary  Luis  so many of us who care about reform are grateful for your wise counsel  your insight and your ability to motivate your congregations to support this historic effort for human dignity and respect  I very much look forward to our continuing work together As Ecclesiastes teaches us  For everything there is a season  and a time for every matter under heaven  There can be no doubt that the time for immigration reform is now  Despite last weeks vote  we are pressing forward  Im encouraged by the determination of our leaders and so many of our colleagues from both parties to keep working together to enact humane legislation that is true to our faith  serves our countrys national interests  and upholds our great tradition as a nation of immigrants The immigration raids that have been occurring in many communities across the country in recent weeks    in Massachusetts and Illinois  in Missouri and Connecticut  in Oregon and other states    are a vivid demonstration of the crisis in our current immigration law  One of these raids took place in March in New Bedford  Massachusetts  Hundreds of armed police and immigration officers raided a factory  creating panic among the workers  They handcuffed unarmed men and women who were already suffering gross indignities at the hands of their employer  We saw the appalling photographs of children left bewildered and crying by a government operation reeking of callousness  In the hours that followed  children were left without their parents  pregnant women were detained  and family members sought desperately to locate their loved ones  Soon after the raid  I visited some of the families whose lives had been turned upside down  We met in a small church basement  and I was deeply moved by the stories I heard  These are individuals who came to this country because they believe in the American Dream for themselves and their children  As heartbreaking as these raids were for the individuals involved  their families and communities  they are a symbol of a much larger problem  our broken immigration system  We must enforce our nations immigration laws  But the raids in New Bedford and elsewhere are only a stopgap solution that unfairly penalizes vulnerable workers in an already flawed system  Surely we can find a better solution to the current immigration crisis than raids that tear families apart  We are people of faith  and immigration reform is a moral imperative  We pride ourselves on being a nation of immigrants  but we have repeatedly failed to welcome the stranger in our midst  We defy our history and our heritage when millions of immigrants are condemned to second class status to live in the shadows  exploited in the workplace  forced to live in constant fear of deportation  How we respond to this challenge is a test of our own humanity  Jesus emphasized the importance of loving and caring for strangers when he proclaimed   F or I was hungry and you gave me food  I was thirsty and you gave me drink  I was a stranger and you welcomed me   Matthew 25 35  As people of faith  we must heed these calls  Esperenza means hope and now we have new hope that the bill is alive  Were more determined than ever to pass a bill that strengthens our security and upholds our humanity  Ive been encouraged by the expressions of commitment from the leadership of both parties to complete action on the immigration bill  and Im grateful to President Bush for his unfaltering support  We all realize that doing nothing is not an option  It will only lead to more deaths in the desert  more families torn apart by local raids  and more infiltration of our borders The people at the heart of this debate come from many different lands and many different walks of life  They harvest our crops  staff our hotels and restaurants  and care for our aging relatives  They are also responsible for a third of the Silicon Valley start ups during the high tech revolution  At least 70 000 of them serve in the U S  Armed Forces  and we are honored that some of them are here with us this morning  Their courage is unequivocal proof that immigrants are as committed as anyone else to defending our country and advancing our ideals  Please join me in applauding their heroic accomplishments Im sure that such immigrants are the lifeblood of your congregations as well  They are all children of God  For their sake and our own  we in Congress will press on to reach the fair solution they eminently deserve  Esperenza means hope and now we have new hope that the bill is alive  Were more determined than ever to pass a bill that strengthens our security and upholds our humanity  Thank you so much for your support  and thank you for this wonderful award      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
