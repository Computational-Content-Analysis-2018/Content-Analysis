the Advancement of Colored People  and Jon Melegrito  the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance representative  Below are Senator Kennedys prepared remarks and a fact sheet on his plan to raise the minimum wage  MINIMUM WAGE AND CIVIL RIGHTSCivil rights and workers rights have always gone hand in hand  When Martin Luther King Jr  joined the picket line with striking sanitation workers in Memphis just days before his death  he recognized that workers rights are a fundamental part of the march to progress for people of color  The fight for fair wages and safe working conditions for migrant farmworkers is a fight for civil rights  The fight to stop exploitation of Asian garment workers is a fight for civil rights  And today  we are waging another great civil rights battle  the fight to raise the minimum wage  I dont have to tell anyone in this room that people of color are far more likely to live in poverty in the Bush economy  The poverty rate for African Americans is 25 percent  twice that for all Americans  For Hispanic Americans it is 22 percent  And many Asian American populations  such as Cambodians and Laotians  have poverty rates far above the national level as well  Low wages are a key part of the problem of poverty in these communities  The occupations that tend to pay the minimum wage  serving food at fast food restaurants  caring for children in preschools or elderly Americans in nursing homes  cleaning hotel rooms or office buildings  are dominated by workers of color A fair increase in the minimum wage is an essential first step to attacking the problem of poverty in communities of color  Almost 36 percent of workers who would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage are people of color  More than 2 1 million African Americans workers  more than 2 3 million Hispanic workers  and almost 300 000 Asian American workers would benefit from the increase provided in my minimum wage bill  These arent just statistics  Theyre real people struggling every day just to get by  Americans understand fairness  and they know this isnt fair  Thats why Americans across the country have joined together in a grassroots minimum wage movement that has spread like wildfire across this great nation  Leaders of the civil rights community have played a key part in this battle  And leaders of the minority business community are joining the fight as well  I am pleased to be joined here today by David Lizarraga  Chair of the U S  Hispanic Chamber of Commerce  John Trasvina  President of Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund  Hilary Shelton  Director of the Washington Bureau of the NAACP  and Jon Melegrito of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance  These civil rights and business leaders have come together here today because they recognize a fundamental truth  that no one who works hard for a living should have to live in poverty  I thank them for joining me in this battle RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESSSenator Kennedys Fair Minimum Wage Act would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps   5 85 60 days after enactment   6 55 one year later   7 25 one year after thatThe number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office  37 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year earn  10 700 per year  almost  6 000 below the federal poverty guidelines of  16 600 for a family of three  Since then the minimum wage was last raised in 1997  its real value has eroded by 21 3 percent  Every day the minimum wage is not increased  it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind  Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  4 00 below what it was in 1968  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  9 37 an hour today  not  5 15  Nearly fifteen million Americans will benefit from a minimum wage increase to  7 25 an hour  6 6 million directly  and another 8 3 million indirectly  Fifty nine percent of these workers are women  and forty percent are people of color Eighty percent of those who would benefit are adult workers  not teenagers seeking pocket change  Fifty four percent of workers who will benefit are full time employees  and more than a third of these adults are sole breadwinners for their families  Increasing the minimum wage will help more than 7 3 million children whose parents would receive a raise  Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 400 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families  It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy  o 15 months of grocerieso 19 months of utilitieso 8 months of rento Over two years of health careo 20 months of child careo 30 months of college tuition at a public  2 year collegeThis year  the Senate raised its pay by  3 100 and is set to receive an additional  3 300 raise in 2007  It is shameful that Members of Congress received our eighth pay increase in nine years  yet we have not provided a single pay increase to the lowest paid workers  The salaries of lawmakers have gone up by  31 600 since 1997  while minimum wage workers continue to earn just  10 700 a year History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation  In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades  Nearly 12 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 248 000 per month  In contrast  in the last four years  the minimum wage has held steady  but only 4 9 million jobs have been created States across this country have raised their own minimum wages without adverse economic consequences  Study after study has shown that raising the minimum wage has not cost jobs in the states  An Economic Policy Institute study of Washington  Oregon  and Alaska showed that increases in the state minimum wage had no impact on the state unemployment rate  Similarly  the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center has found that after the last two minimum wage increases in Massachusetts in 2000 and 2001  employment grew more quickly in sectors with the most minimum wage workers  including leisure  hospitality  and the service sector A recent Gallup poll found that 86  of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business  and three out of four small businesses said that a 10  increase in the minimum wage would have no effect on their company  Additionally  nearly half of small business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased  and only 16  of owners think the minimum wage should be reduced or eliminated entirely Britain has the second largest economy in Europe  after Germany   They implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty  They raised their minimum wage to about  9 51 per hour last year  and they are planning to raise this rate to about  9 89 in October of this year Ireland has an extremely robust economy  with impressive growth over the last decade  and the fourth largest GDP per capita in the world  The minimum wage rate in Ireland is 7 65  hour  about  9 65  and yet their unemployment rate is lower than the U S    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
