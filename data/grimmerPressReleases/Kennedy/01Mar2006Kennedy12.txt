         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   WASHINGTON U S  Senators Edward Kennedy  D MA  and Debbie Stabenow  D MI  today announced legislation to offer a streamlined  user friendly prescription drug benefit administered directly through Medicare  The new benefit will offer seniors and people with disabilities a real choice that alleviates many of the problems with the new Medicare Prescription Drug program  Instead of the Medicare program that seniors know and trust  the Administration and its allies in Congress turned the drug benefit over to the drug and insurance industries  Kennedy said  Instead of allowing Medicare to bargain for discounts on prescriptions as the VA does  they made negotiations prohibited  The program was unsatisfactory to start with  and its implementation was so incompetent that President Bush didn t even mention it in his State of the Union Address  said Kennedy  Seniors across the country have been denied the medicines they need  or forced to pay excessive costs to fill their prescriptions  It s time to fix these failures  Our proposal gives seniors a real choice  by adding drug coverage to Medicare s coverage of hospital and doctor s bills  It ends the outrageous ban on bargaining for discounts on drug prices  It s a realistic solution to the Administration s failed approach  I have received thousands of calls and letters from people across Michigan about the trouble they are having with the new program  said Stabenow  And while the Administration must take action to fix these problems  the one choice that seniors want is the one choice they don t have    a comprehensive  affordable prescription drug benefit administered by Medicare  Our bill will give seniors the prescription drug benefit they deserve    one that works for them  not against them  The Stabenow Kennedy bill will establish a standard prescription drug benefit administered directly by Medicare  Seniors who choose this option will have a modest deductible and co payments for prescriptions  without any gaps in coverage  The benefit would also provide protection for seniors against drug costs above  5 100 per year  Everyone who chooses the Medicare guaranteed option would pay a low  uniform monthly premium  regardless of where they live By instructing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices directly with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of those enrolled in the Medicare guaranteed option  the Stabenow Kennedy bill will help lower prescription drug costs  Negotiating group prices will result in lower expenses for seniors and savings for taxpayers Additional sponsors of the Stabenow Kennedy legislation are Senators Hillary Clinton  D NY   Carl Levin  D MI   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ   Daniel Akaka  D HI   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ   Barbara Boxer  D CA  and Mark Dayton  D MN   30 STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY INTRODUCTION OF MEDICARE BILL It s a privilege to join Senator Stabenow in introducing a bill to cure the serious defects in the Medicare prescription drug law  Passage of Medicare was one of the great triumphs of public policy of the past half century  In 1965  Congress and the President made a solemn promise to every senior citizen that if they worked hard and played by the rules  they would be assured of quality health care in their golden years  In 1965  medical care primarily involved doctor visits  hospital stays  and nursing care  and these were the costs that Medicare covered  Few illnesses were treated with costly drugs  Four decades later  medicine has changed dramatically  Thanks to extraordinary breakthroughs in the life sciences  we now have a range of miracle drugs to treat a wide range of dangerous health conditions and illnesses that were once untreatable or required costly and invasive surgery  As a result  the great unfinished business of Medicare in recent years has been to provide coverage for the drugs that millions of seniors need to protect their health and save their lives  After years of growing controversy and increasingly burdensome costs for seniors  the Senate finally acted last year to provide that coverage  but the bill was hijacked by the most doctrinaire elements of the Administration and its allies in Congress and the pharmaceutical and insurance industries  Instead of the Medicare that seniors know and trust  the drug benefit was turned over to these special interests  Instead of allowing Medicare to bargain for discounts on prescription drugs  as the Veterans Administration does for drug for veterans  such bargaining for lower costs for seniors was made illegal  The result has been a disaster  The bill that passed was a nightmare of complexity and confusion  Seniors across the country were denied the drugs they need  or were forced to pay exorbitant fees to fill their prescriptions  The program was such a debacle that President Bush did not even mention it in the State of the Union  But the budget the Administration sent to Congress a few days ago contains this incredible statement  The Medicare prescription drug benefit is off to a good start  Off to a good start  What world is OMB living in  Only an insurance or pharmaceutical company executive could say something like that  Try telling that to seniors across the nation who have struggled to make sense of the baffling array of the plans and the uncertain coverage for the drugs they need  As Linda Milligan of Lebanon  Oregon  a 66 year old breast cancer survivor  said of her efforts to get the drugs she needs  I spent three hours a day for two weeks phoning different agencies  and everyplace I called they just passed me on to someone else  I m just about to have a nervous breakdown  Arlene Arterio of Medford  Massachusetts  said  I ve been on Medicare since 1994  and I m going crazy trying to figure out what s what with this new drug program  Each time I call  the information is different  To Janet Chrismore  a pharmacist from Charlottesville  Virginia  the drug program is hardly off to a good start  She knows low income seniors who were told they ll have to pay hundreds of dollars for their prescription drugs  These are her words  I had one patient whose monthly co pay went from  51 to  943  Most elderly people can t absorb that kind of increase into their budget  Chris Venier  a pharmacist in Lexington  said of the program  It s a disaster  Last Friday  one company help line said they couldn t process the call and instructed me to hang up  Then  the help line was closed for the weekend  Medicare is not getting the job done right  Try telling Edmund Burke of Quincy  Massachusetts  that the program is going well  He s 79 years old and he has to figure out which of the 41 plans in his area cover the six medications he takes every day  It is no surprise that the Administration is ignoring the facts when it comes to Medicare  They have a long and sorry history of ignoring facts that don t fit their ideology  It s the kind of fundamental incompetence that has led to disaster after disaster in both our foreign policy and our domestic policy  The White House was warned about the dangers of their inadequate plans for Iraq    and yet did nothing to avert danger  The White House was told of the imminent peril of Hurricane Katrina    but took no action  We re now in the second month of the new drug program and it s clear that    despite the warnings    the Bush Administration was totally unprepared  They even paid for phony news stories to try to convince the country that their plan was a winner  Leading figures in the Republican party have claimed that the problems with the drug plan were inevitable and unpredictable  as Secretary of HHS Leavitt said  That s just not the case  The problems weren t unpredictable at all    they were clearly predicted and just as clearly ignored  Democrats  seniors  and public health leaders warned the Administration time and again that a Medicare drug plan stuffed with giveaways for the drug companies and the HMOs was a prescription for disaster    but the Administration did nothing   It s time for the Bush Administration to stop making excuses  It took less than a year from the time President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid to get those programs up and running and that was before the days of computers  The President says he wants a bipartisan solution on health care  Let s start right here  Let s start by addressing the crisis caused by the botched Medicare prescription drug program  We know what the problems in the drug benefit are  and we can fix them  The legislation that Senator Stabenow and I are introducingthe Medicare Guaranteed Prescription Drug Act    will give every senior citizen in every community in the nation a choice  They can continue with their current plan if they feel it s satisfactory  or they can stay in traditional Medicare and obtain drug coverage as well  No longer will they have to rely on a bewildering array of private plans to meet their need for drugs  In large cities and small rural areas  from Maine to California  to Alaska and Hawaii  Medicare will be there for every senior who wants it  The Bush Administration and its allies in Congress say they believe in competition  but they refuse to put it into practice  If those who wrote this bill are so sure that private plans can do a better job of delivering prescription drug coverage than Medicare  why not put it to the test  Real competition would let senior make a free choice between private plans and the Medicare they know and trust  There will be some who argue that this proposal reduces choices  Nothing could be further from the truth  It doesn t restrict choices    it expands them by allowing every senior to choose to stay with Medicare if they wish to do so  It gives the guarantee of Medicare to the countless seniors who deserve a better deal  Our bill also reverses one of the most flagrant abuses of the Administration s planits outright ban on allowing Medicare to bargain for a senior discount on drugs  That provision is so contrary to common sense and the public interest that most people hardly believe you when you tell them the Administration insisted on it  The Bush plan actually makes it illegal to try to negotiate discounts on drug prices for senior citizens  Companies across America negotiate on the prices they pay for the goods they buy  It s the way free markets work  But can Medicare negotiate for the price of the drugs it buys for seniors  Nothe Republican Medicare law makes it illegal  Why did the drug companies insist on prohibiting Medicare from negotiating discounts for seniors  For the obvious reasonthey were afraid it would work  They were afraid Medicare would get a better deal for seniors than the private companies that will administer the drug benefit under the new law  Obviously  private companies serving a small part of the national market have less ability than Medicare to get a good deal for seniors  Medicare serves the national market  Just as national chain stores get better deals than local stores on products  Medicare could get a better deal on the price of drugs for seniors  We know that when federal agencies negotiate for drug price discounts  they get them  The Veterans Administration does it  It serves millions of veterans  and the quality of care it provides is among the best in the nation  VA care is more cost effective than most private health systems can provide  How does the VA do it  Part of its success is good use of information technology  Another large part is the good deal it gets on the prescription drugs it provide for our veterans  Like any business  the VA tries to get the best deal it can on the drugs it buysand it succeeds  If consumers walk into a pharmacy to buy Mevacor for high cholesterol  they have pay  4 a pill  The VA negotiated a price of only 26 cents a pill  For Plendil  for high blood pressure  the VA price is 46 cents a pill  but the retail price is  2 37 cents  For Zantac  the retail price is  1 83 a pill  but VA gets it for only two cents a pill  Two cents  Some of those who argue against our bill say it s wrong to compare the VA price to the full retail price  and we should really compare the VA price to the price negotiated by private companies  Every Member of Congress is eligible for the Federal Employees Benefit Plan  That s run by private companies  If the opponents of this bill are right  then the federal plan should do as well as the VA in getting discounts on drug prices  But they don t  Private plans in the Federal Employees Program get an average discount of 18  on the drugs they obtain  As Members of Congress we obviously benefit from these lower prices  VA does over 3 times betterit obtains average discount of 55  on the drugs it buys for veterans  Some opponents of our proposal claim that private plans will do even better than Medicare in negotiating discounts for seniors  That s ideology talkingthe facts say otherwise  Blocking Medicare from negotiating prices for drugs will cost seniors billions of dollars in needless extra spending on excessive prices for prescription drugsdollars that needlessly exacerbate the glaring inadequacies in the drug benefit  It s time for all of us in Congress to work together to fix the failures of the Medicare drug law  Let s give seniors a real choice by allowing them to stay in traditional Medicare  Let s end the outrageous ban on bargaining for price discounts  Let s give real help to millions of seniors who face soaring costs for the prescription drugs they clearly need to protect their health  I urge the Senate to act quickly on the legislation that Senator Stabenow and I are offering THE MEDICARE GUARANTEED PRESCRIPTION DRUG ACT Passage of Medicare was one of the great triumphs of public policy of the past half century  In 1965  Congress and the President made a solemn promise to every senior citizen that if they worked hard and played by the rules  they would be assured of quality health care in their golden years  In 1965  medical care primarily involved doctor visits  hospital stays  and nursing care  and these were the costs that Medicare covered  Four decades later  medicine has changed dramatically  We now have a range of miracle drugs to treat a wide range of dangerous health conditions and illnesses that were once untreatable or required costly and invasive surgery  As a result  the great unfinished business of Medicare in recent years has been to provide coverage for the drugs that millions of seniors need to protect their health and save their lives  Sadly  the Republican Medicare bill failed to live up to the promise of Medicare Instead of the Medicare that seniors know and trust  the drug benefit was turned over to HMOs and other insurance companies  Instead of allowing Medicare to bargain for discounts on prescription drugs  as the Veterans Administration does for drug for veterans  such bargaining for lower costs for seniors was made illegal  The result has been a disaster  The bill that passed was a nightmare of complexity and confusion  Seniors across the country were denied the drugs they need  or were forced to pay exorbitant fees to fill their prescriptions  The time has come to address these serious flaws and give seniors the Medicare drugs benefit they deserve  To address these serious problems  the legislation   Gives every Medicare beneficiary the choice of receiving their drug benefit through traditional Medicare  with a formulary that is not allowed to change from day to day or state to state   Allows Medicare to negotiate the same good discounts on drug prices that the VA gets for veterans   Establishes a consistent nationwide premium for Medicare drug coverage   Reduces the annual deductible for drug coverage   Increases the share of seniors  drug costs that Medicare will pay   Eliminates the so called doughnut hole that will force seniors to bear the full costs of their drugs one a minimum is reached  Provides true security against runaway costs by assuming the full costs of drug purchases once a maximum out of pocket spending limit is reached Stabenow Kennedy Medicare Guaranteed Prescription Drug Option The one choice seniors don t have under the current program is the one they want  Medicare beneficiaries should always have the choice to stay in traditional Medicare and have a comprehensive  affordable prescription drug benefit administered by Medicare  A Real Choice The Stabenow Kennedy legislation would establish a Medicare operated prescription drug plan in each region of the country  Seniors could continue to choose one of the many new private insurance plans currently being offered  or  they could choose to receive their prescription drug benefit through the traditional Medicare program The legislation simply gives seniors and people with disabilities the choice to get their prescriptions filled through traditional Medicare  A Meaningful  Standardized Benefit The Stabenow Kennedy legislation would establish a standard benefit based on the current Part B benefit  a modest deductible  20  coinsurance  without any gaps in coverage  The benefit would also provide protection against catastrophic drug costs and would not require any cost sharing above the out of pocket threshold  Seniors enrolling in the Medicare guaranteed option would get the standard benefit  and would have the peace of mind of knowing they are receiving coverage similar to the coverage they have today for their physician and other Part B benefits  Private plans could provide the new standard benefit  or any actuarially equivalent package  as they do today  Plans could continue to offer multiple variations of deductibles and coinsurance levels  Affordable Coverage  Affordable Prices All seniors choosing the Medicare guaranteed option would pay a uniform  low monthly premium  regardless of where they live  The Stabenow Kennedy bill will also reduce drug prices by instructing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of beneficiaries choosing to receive their drugs through the Medicare guaranteed option Seniors choosing to enroll with a private insurer would continue to pay the prices determined by the insurance company   Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy  202 224 2633
