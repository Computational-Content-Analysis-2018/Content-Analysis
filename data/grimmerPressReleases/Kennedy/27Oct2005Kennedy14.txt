         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  This has been a remarkable and troubling process   The only voices heard in this process were the voices of the extreme factions of the President s own political party   They had a litmus test  and before giving her a fair chance to have her own voice heard  they decided Harriet Miers didn t meet it   That s not what the Supreme Court is about   The United States Senate was ready to give Harriet Miers a fair chance and a fair hearing and she should have been given that chance   The President has an opportunity now to unite the country  In appointing the next nominee  he must listen to all Americans  not just the far right   We need a justice for all Americans to fill Justice O Connor s seat and protect the rights and freedoms Americans hold so dear   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
