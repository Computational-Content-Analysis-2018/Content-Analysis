         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Thank you Chancellor Motley for that generous introduction    I m honored to be here at UMass Boston  Many of the most talented people in our state have benefited from the outstanding opportunities you offer  and I commend you for your impressive leadership in higher education    I welcome the opportunity to meet with you on the issue of Iraq  Forty years ago  America was in another war in a distant land  In Vietnam in 1965  we had the same number of troops and the same number of casualties as in Iraq today    We thought in those early years we were winning that war  We thought the skill and courage of our troops were enough  We thought victory on the battlefield would lead to overall victory in the war  and to peace and democracy for the people of Vietnam    We lost our national bearings in Vietnam   We ignored the truth   We failed our ideals     In the name of a misguided cause  we continued the war too long  We failed to comprehend the events around us  We did not understand that our very presence was creating more enemies and defeating the very goals we hoped to achieve  We cannot allow that history to repeat itself in Iraq     In his Inaugural Address and his State of the Union Address  President Bush talked about the noble goals of spreading freedom and democracy and ending tyranny around the globe  There s no disagreement about these goals and the importance of these ideals  America has been a beacon of democracy  freedom  and human rights for more than two centuries  and we cannot let the beacon dim     When America is at its best  our deeds match our words  But many of us feel we haven t done that in Iraq  We care about our country  Stephen Decatur famously said  My country  right our wrong  But others through the years have said it better   Our country  right or wrong  When right  to be kept right  When wrong  to be set right    We ve paid a high price for the invasion of Iraq  Saddam is gone  but there were no weapons of mass destruction  The cakewalk the Administration predicted became a quagmire instead  We recklessly shifted our focus away from the real threat to our national security   the threat from Osama bin Laden and the terrorists he was inspiring to attack America     In his State of the Union  President Bush talked about the war on terror  He spoke 27 times about terror  but he did not mention Osama bin Laden once  What world is he living in      He started a war we never should have fought  He stopped fighting a war we hadn t won  and left our greatest enemy in the world still at large  planning his next 9 11      We paid a high price in other ways for the war in Iraq  We insulted our allies  shattered our alliances  and lost worldwide support we had won after 9 11  More than 1400 American soldiers have given their lives in Iraq  Our military is stretched to the breaking point  leaving us dangerously ill prepared if other urgent needs arise  The families of our military  and our guard and reserves are suffering    We must learn from our mistakes  The insurgency is being fueled by the American occupation  We have reached the point where a prolonged American military presence in Iraq is no longer productive for either Iraq or the United States  The overwhelming and seemingly endless nature of the U S  military presence has become part of the problem  not part of the solution     We were all moved by the bravery of the Iraqi people who voted in Sunday s election  and we honor the courageous men and women of our armed forces who continue to risk their lives for a better future for the Iraqi people     But  we ve been here before  As a headline in the New York Times in 1967 stated about an election in Vietnam  U S  Encouraged By Vietnam Vote  Officials Cite 83  Turnout Despite Vietcong Terror    Let s not be lulled again  Let s use the elections in Iraq as an opportunity for a fresh and honest approach  Let s start by having an exit strategy    The election is a step forward  but it is not a mandate for the Administration s current policy  It is not a cure for the violence and resentment caused by the perception of the American occupation     But the election does provide an opening  if we are wise enough to seize it  to demonstrate to the Iraqi people that we have no long term designs on their country     President Bush shies away from such a strategy  But in fact  it s exactly what he called for in 1999  when he was Governor of Texas and speaking about the war in Kosovo  He said  Victory means exit strategy  and it s important for the President to explain to us what the exit strategy is     President Bush should follow his own advice  A coherent exit strategy is the best way to spread freedom in Iraq and lay the groundwork for the honorable homecoming of our forces    The first step is to confront and admit our own mistakes  Americans are rightly concerned about why our soldiers are there  when they will come home  and how our policy could have gone so wrong     No matter how many times the Administration denies it  there is no question they misled the nation and led us into a quagmire in Iraq  President Bush rushed to war on the basis of trumped up intelligence and a reckless argument that Iraq was a critical arena in the war on terror  that somehow it was more important to start a war with Iraq than to finish the war in Afghanistan or capture Osama bin Laden  and that somehow the danger was so urgent that U N  weapons inspectors could not be allowed to complete their search for weapons of mass destruction    The weapons of mass destruction weren t there  but today 150 000 Americans are    Thirty two Massachusetts soldiers have been killed in Iraq  and another 133 soldiers from Massachusetts have been wounded  One of the casualties  Chief Warrant Officer Kyran Kennedy  who was killed in Tikrit in November  was a graduate of this proud University in 1983    Another son of Massachusetts  John Hart  was killed in Iraq because his Humvee had insufficient armor  His parents  Brian and Alma Hart  are here with us today  We honor their sacrifice  and we especially honor their dedication to speaking the truth to the Pentagon and insisting that better armor protection be available for all our troops  We are also joined by other families who have loved ones serving in Iraq  We honor their service  and we pledge to do our very best to support them     Sadly  despite the valor and dedication of our men and women in uniform  our nation s respect and credibility around the world have reached an all time low because of Iraq  The convenient label of a coalition of the willing cannot conceal the fact that American soldiers make up 80  of the troops on the ground  and have suffered more than 90  of the casualties     Ending the rule of Saddam Hussein was supposed to lessen violence and bring an irresistible wave of democracy to the Middle East  It hasn t  Saddam Hussein s capture was supposed to quell the violence  It didn t  The transfer of sovereignty was supposed to be the breakthrough  It wasn t  The military operation in Fallujah was supposed to break the back of the insurgency  It didn t     The number of Americans killed and wounded is the equivalent of a full division of the Army   and we only have ten active divisions     We all hope for the best after Sunday s election  But Sunday s election is not a cure for the violence and instability  Unless the Sunni and all the other communities in Iraq believe they have a stake in the outcome and a genuine role in drafting the new Iraqi constitution  the election could lead to greater alienation  greater escalation  and greater death   for us and for the Iraqis     The Central Intelligence Agency s top official in Baghdad warned recently that the security situation is deteriorating and is likely to worsen  with escalating violence and greater sectarian clashes     The American people are concerned  They recognize that the war with Iraq has not been worth the cost in American lives  prestige  and credibility  They understand it has made America more hated in the world  created new breeding grounds and support for terrorists  and made it harder to win the real war against terrorism   the war against Al Qaeda and radical jihadist terrorists     Conservative voices are alarmed as well  As Paul Weyrich  founder of the Heritage Foundation  said last November  we are stuck in a guerrilla war with no end in sight     As former Coalition Provisional Authority adviser Larry Diamond recently said  There is a fine line between Churchillian resolve and self defeating obstinacy  We must recognize that line and act on it     A new Iraq policy must begin with acceptance of hard truths  Most of the violence in Iraq is not being perpetrated   as President Bush has claimed   by a handful of folks that fear freedom and people who want to try to impose their will on people just like Osama bin Laden     The insurgency is largely home grown  By our own government s count  its ranks are large and growing larger  Its strength has quadrupled since the transfer of sovereignty six months ago   from 5 000 in mid 2004  to 16 000 last October  to more than 20 000 now  The Iraqi Intelligence Service estimates that the insurgency may have 30 000 fighters and up to 200 000 supporters     It is also becoming more intense and adaptable  The bombs are bigger and more powerful  The attacks have greater sophistication    An Army Reservist wrote the stark truth  The guerillas are filling their losses faster than we can create them  for every guerilla we kill with a smart bomb  we kill many more innocent civilians and create rage and anger in the Iraqi community  This rage and anger translates into more recruits for the terrorists and less support for us  Our troops understand that  The American people understand it  And it s time the Administration understood it     Beyond the insurgency s fighters  it has active or tacit support from ordinary Iraqis who aid and abet the attacks  It is fueled by the anger of even more Iraqis   not just Saddam loyalists   who can t believe the United States is unable to provide security and other basic services  and who therefore think we re unwilling to provide them    The International Crisis Group  a widely respected conflict prevention organization  recently reported  These post war failings gradually were perceived by many Iraqis as purposeful  designed to serve Washington s interests to remain for a prolonged period in a debilitated Iraq    Too many Iraqi people do not believe that America intends no long term military presence in their country  Our reluctance to make that clear has fueled suspicions among Iraqis that our motives are not pure  that we want their oil  and that we will never leave  As long as our presence seems ongoing  America s commitment to their democracy sounds unconvincing     Other indications of anti American sentiment are clear  CDs with photographs of the insurgents are spread across the country  Songs glorify combatants  Poems written decades ago during the British occupation after World War I are popular again    We have the finest military in the world  But we can t defeat the insurgents militarily if we don t effectively address the political context in which the insurgency flourishes  Our military and the insurgents are fighting for the same thing   the hearts and minds of the people   and it is a battle we are not winning     The goal of our military presence should be to allow the creation of a legitimate  functioning Iraqi government  not to dictate it and not to micromanage it     Creating a full fledged democracy won t happen overnight  It may take years for the Iraqis to finish the job  But  the process cannot begin in earnest until Iraqis have full ownership of the process  Our continued  overwhelming presence only delays it    If we want Iraq to develop a stable  democratic government  America must assist   not control   the newly established government    Unless Iraqis have a genuine sense that their leaders are not our puppets  the election cannot be the turning point the Administration hopes     To enhance its legitimacy in the eyes of the Iraqi people  the new Iraqi Government should begin to disengage politically from America  and we from them     The reality is that the Bush Administration has pulled the strings in Iraq  and the Iraqi people know it  We picked the date for the transfer of sovereignty  We supported former CIA operative Iyad Allawi to lead the Interim Government  We wrote the laws that now govern Iraq    It is time to recognize that there is only one choice   America must give Iraq back to the Iraqi people       We need to let the Iraqi people make their own decisions  reach their own consensus  and govern their own country    We need to rethink the Pottery Barn rule  America cannot forever be the potter that sculpts Iraq s future  President Bush broke Iraq  but if we want Iraq to be fixed  the Iraqis must feel that they  not we  own it     The Iraqi people are obviously facing historic issues in establishing a government  deciding the role of Islam  and protecting minority rights    The entire international community has a clear interest in a strong  tolerant and pluralistic Iraq  free from chaos and civil war     The United Nations  with our support  should take the lead in providing assistance and advice on establishing a system of government and drafting a constitution     For freedom and democracy to take root  the Iraqis need a clear signal that America has a genuine exit strategy     At least 12 000 American troops and probably more can and should leave at once  to send a strong immediate signal about our intentions and to ease the pervasive sense of occupation  Our military presence in Iraq has increased by 19 000 since November  The large majority of those troops were added to guarantee security for the election  and there is no reason they should not come home as soon as possible  Even Secretary Wolfowitz  the architect of the war  told the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday that our military presence can come down by about 15 000  Commanders have said they hope to withdraw about 15 000 troops sometime this spring or summer     For the longer term  President Bush should also announce his intention to negotiate with the new Iraqi government for a drawdown of American combat forces    As Major General William Nash  who commanded the multi national force in Bosnia  said in November  a substantial reduction in our forces following the Iraqi election would be a wise and judicious move to demonstrate that we are leaving and the absence of targets will go a long way in decreasing the violence    America s goal   not a hard and fast time table but a realistic goal   should be to complete our military drawdown as early as possible in 2006  That goal is consistent with the timeline for the election of the permanent Iraqi government that will take place at the end of this year  It is also consistent with the view of Iraq s interim Interior Minister  who recently said  I think we will not need the multi national foreign forces in this country within 18 months  I think we will be able to depend on ourselves    President Bush cannot avoid this issue  The Security Council Resolution authorizing our military presence in Iraq can be reviewed at any time at the request of the Iraqi Government  and it calls for a review in June  The U N  authorization for our military presence ends with the election of a permanent Iraqi government at the end of this year  The world will be our judge     Obviously  while American troops are drawing down  we must clearly be prepared to oppose any external intervention in Iraq or the large scale revenge killing of any group  We should begin now to conduct serious regional diplomacy with the Arab League and Iraq s neighbors to underscore this point  Clearly  we will need to maintain troops on bases outside Iraq but in the region     We do need to train and equip an effective Iraqi security force  and we have a year to do so before the election of the permanent Iraqi government    We have the best military in the world  We won the first Gulf war  contained Saddam Hussein during the nineties  and overthrew the Iraqi government in just three weeks     My wife s nephew from Shreveport  Louisiana  received 12 weeks of basic training  He was supposed to receive additional training in Kuwait  but instead he was sent right to Mosul to serve as a gunner in a Stryker Brigade  At 23  he s the oldest one  They call him Pops  He s home now  but he is getting ready to go back to Iraq     Our Army has great expertise in training programs  Every year  we send recruits through 21 weeks of training to become military police  Our enlisted infantry receive 13 weeks of training     If America can train the best military in the world in 13 weeks  why can t we train the Iraqis in 8 or 12 or 15 months to fight and die for their country    Secretary Rumsfeld has said about our departure from Iraq that  It is condition based  It s based on when the Iraqi government and their security forces can develop the capability  the capacity to provide for the security of their people    Secretary Rumsfeld has mismanaged every other aspect of this war   He must get this one right    With the international community s help we can do even more and do it faster  The President will travel to Europe in a few weeks  and he should not return home empty handed     The insurgents have been skilled at recruiting Iraqis to participate in suicide attacks  But too often  the trained Iraqi forces do not have a comparable commitment to the Iraqi government  The way to strengthen their allegiance is to give them a worthy cause to defend as soon as possible   a truly free  independent and sovereign Iraq     President Bush has left us with few good choices  There are costs to staying  and costs to leaving  There may well be violence as we disengage militarily from Iraq  and as Iraq disengages politically from us  But there will be much more serious violence if we are forced to go it alone  Setting a strategy for withdrawal may not guarantee success  but not doing so will almost certainly guarantee failure  It will not be easy to extricate ourselves from Iraq  but we must begin     Error is no excuse for its own perpetuation     Mindless determination doesn t make a better outcome likely      The Book of Proverbs in the Bible teaches us that  Pride goes before destruction  and a haughty spirit before a fall  It s time to improve our country s standing in Iraq and in the eyes of the world  and the election has given us an extraordinary opportunity to do it  The danger is very real that if we do not  our leadership in the world will be permanently lost  We cannot let that happen  There is a wiser course we can take in keeping with the best in our heritage and history   a course that will help America  at long last  to regain our rightful place of respect in the world and bring our troops home with honor  Let s take that course  and take it now    Thank you very much        Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
