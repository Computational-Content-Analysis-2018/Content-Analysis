         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  the Department of Justice is in a state of crisis  Under Attorney General Gonzales  it too often served as a rubber stamp for the White House and as a pawn for political gain  rather than as the nations guardian of the rule of law  It ignored the law and authorized torture and warrantless surveillance  It let politics drive decisions about who should be prosecuted  It fired U S  Attorneys who would not go along  It hired and punished career attorneys on the basis of their personal politics  and it abandoned enforcement of our civil rights laws      After such an unacceptable period of tarnished leadership of the Department  we need a clear  decisive and straightforward Attorney General who is not afraid to stand up for the Constitution and the rule of law  especially when that means disagreeing with the President of the United   States      I had hoped that Judge Mukasey could be that person  but as I have stated  I will vote against his confirmation as Attorney General  He is clearly an able lawyer  and his commitment to public service as an Assistant United States Attorney and federal judge are admirable  As a federal judge for almost 19 years  he was by all accounts fair and conscientious in the courtroom  But after listening to Judge Mukaseys testimony and considering his responses to written questions from members of the Judiciary Committee  I have concluded he is not the right person to lead the Justice Department at this crucial time in our history      The next Attorney General must restore confidence in the rule of law  He must show the American people and the world that America has returned to its fundamental belief in the rule of law as the bedrock protector of our national values  Only an Attorney General who is not afraid to speak truth to power can be such a leader  Regrettably  Michael Mukasey has shown that he is not that leader     Like many of my colleagues and many American citizens  I am deeply troubled by Judge Mukaseys evasive answers about torture  He has repeatedly refused to acknowledge that waterboarding   the controlled drowning of a prisoner  is torture  Instead  he has said only that torture is unconstitutional  without being willing to say whether waterboarding is torture      As the record makes clear  courts and military tribunals have consistently found waterboarding to be an unacceptable act of torture  As Malcolm Nance  a former Master Instructor and Chief of Training at the US Navy Survival  Evasion  Resistance and Escape School  said of waterboarding  For the uninitiated  it is horrifying to watch and if it goes wrong  it can lead straight to terminal hypoxia  When done right it is controlled death     Waterboarding is an ancient and barbaric technique  In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  interrogators of the Spanish Inquisition used it  It was used against slaves in this country  In World War II  it was used against our soldiers by Japan  In the 1970s  it was used against political opponents of the Khmer Rouge and the military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina  As I speak  it is being used against pro democracy activists by the military dictators of Burma  This is the company that the Bush Administration embraces when it refuses to renounce waterboarding     But Judge Mukasey is unwilling to say that waterboarding violates the law  He calls it repugnant  and it obviously is  But he refuses to condemn it as unlawful  Why  The answer seems painfully obvious  Former intelligence officers and supervisors have admitted  and the Vice President has confirmed  that the CIA has waterboarded detainees  Had Judge Mukasey renounced waterboarding as unlawful  he would have had to assert his independence and speak the truth about this Administrations lawlessness  He was unwilling to do it      We were told that Judge Mukasey had agreed to enforce a new law prohibiting waterboarding if Congress passed it  There are two problems with this statement  First  enforcing laws passed by Congress that are constitutional is the job of the Attorney General  It is a prerequisite to occupying the office  not a concession to be offered to win confirmation     But  second  waterboarding is already illegal  It is illegal under the Geneva Conventions  which prohibit outrages upon personal dignity  including cruel  humiliating  and degrading treatment  It is illegal under the Torture Act  which prohibits acts specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering  It is illegal under the Detainee Treatment Act  which prohibits cruel  inhuman  or degrading treatment  And it violates the Constitution  The nations top military lawyers and legal experts across the political spectrum have condemned waterboarding as illegal  After World War II  the United States prosecuted Japanese officers for using in waterboarding  What more does this nominee need to enforce existing laws     The Attorney General must have the legal and moral judgment to know when an activity rises to the level of a violation of our Constitution  treaties or statutes  But this nominee wants to pass the buck to Congress  He has failed to demonstrate that he will be the clear  decisive and straightforward leader that the Department of Justice so desperately needs      This Administration has recklessly brushed aside the rule of law for the past seven years  We need an Attorney General who will stand up to this destructive conduct and say no more  We cannot afford to take our chances on the judgment of an Attorney General who either does not know torture when he sees it  or is willing to look the other way to suit the President             Melissa Wagoner  202
