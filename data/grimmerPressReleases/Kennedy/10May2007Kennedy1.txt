         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CLast night  the Department of Labor Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  issued a report on the explosion at the Sago Mine in West Virginia  The January 2  2006 tragedy killed 12 miners and led to the passage by Congress of the MINER Act  which was signed into law on June 15  2006  MSHAs report found that the explosion at Sago Mine would have been far less severe if tougher standards for sealing off underground areas had been in place  Senator Kennedy said  As this report clearly shows  the tragic deaths at the Sago Mine could have been prevented by stronger safety standards  We have long pressed MSHA to strengthen critical standards and this reports findings underscore the urgency of this need  I commend MSHAs announcement that it plans to take immediate action on mine seals  but more needs to be done to prevent future tragedies  We need other new standards  based on the latest science  and diligent enforcement of these standards to protect miners safety      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
