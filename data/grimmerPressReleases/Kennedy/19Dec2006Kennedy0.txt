         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  OR MORE INFORMATION  CONTACT Karen Lightfoot  Waxman    202  225 5051Nadeam Elshami  Durbin    202  228 5643Laura Capps  Kennedy    202  224 2633  WASHINGTON  DC  Rep  Henry A  Waxman  Sen  Richard J  Durbin  and Sen  Edward M  Kennedy today released a GAO analysis of the decline in new drug development by the pharmaceutical industry  The report shows that much drug industry research doesnt translate into real breakthroughs for patients  said Sen  Kennedy  The goal of Congress  FDA  the industry  and academia must be to deliver truly innovative new medicines to patients  At a time when more and more working families are struggling to afford health care  we must see that every penny of our national investment in health care is well spent  and does not go toward improperly subsidizing the marketing and promotional activities of drug companies  One major step is to help promote truly innovative new therapies  That s why the legislation that Senator Enzi and I have introduced supports FDAs critical path initiative  whose objectives the report identifies as important for reaching this goal This new GAO study refutes many of the pharmaceutical industrys myths about the drug development process  said Rep  Waxman  Most prominently  it indicates that the link between high research expenditures  which the industry claims must be driven by high prices  and new drug development is unclear at best  The report indicates that many aspects of the drug development system need to be examined to determine how to encourage research that focuses on breakthrough treatments rather than drug industry profits The findings in this new GAO report raise serious questions about the pharmaceutical industry claims that there is a connection between new drug development and the soaring price of drugs already on the market  said Sen  Durbin  Most troubling is the notion that pharmaceutical industry profits are coming at the expense of consumers in the form of higher prices and fewer new drugs Among the findings of the GAO report were the following  No direct link between research expenditures and breakthrough drug development  In the last decade  pharmaceutical industry research expenditures have increased by 150   while the number of applications for potential breakthrough drugs has recently fallen  This decline has occurred despite the fact that FDAs drug approval times have improved  The majority of approvals obtained by the pharmaceutical industry are not for critical breakthrough drugs  According to GAO  an estimated 60  of drug approvals are for me too drugs  only 12  of drug industry approval applications are for priority new molecular entities  Patent law loopholes reduce innovation  The ability of drug manufacturers to easily obtain patents for minor changes to products  or to receive patent exclusivity for new uses of existing products  have reduced incentives to develop new drugs  Industry business practices reduce innovation  Pharmaceutical industry business practices  including industry research that focuses on profitable but non innovative drugs  and the large number of mergers and acquisitions in the industry  resulting in the discontinuation of many drug development efforts  have resulted in a decline in research that results in true breakthrough drugs
