         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Last night  Senator Edward M  Kennedy continued his fight on the war on poverty by offering an amendment H R  3058  the Transportation  Treasury  Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill  Kennedy s proposal takes into account that the current minimum wage is grossly inadequate to live on in this economy with nearly 37 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Hurricane Katrina demonstrated in stark terms that so many Americans live every day on the brink of economic disaster and for them any setback becomes a major obstacle to survival  An increase in the minimum wage would have directly benefited 491 000 workers in Alabama  Mississippi  and Louisiana     The images of Katrina were a shocking reminder that the American dream remains out of reach for millions of working Americans  It s little wonder that so many in the Gulf Region were living in poverty when Katrina hit  These Americans work as hard as anyone else    often harder  But the minimum wage that many receive cannot cover their bills or support their families  Senator Kennedy said  These Americans can t afford the rising cost of higher education  so they don t send their children to college  They can t afford the rising cost of prescription drugs  so they don t take the medicine they need  and often they don t go to the doctor either  We know that America can do better  and as the Senate raises its own salary it should take the single most important step to combating poverty by raising the minimum wage    The minimum wage hasn t been increased since 1997  yet during that time Americans increasingly feel the squeeze of the Bush economy  Americans are spending 74 percent more on gas than they did at the beginning of 2001  Heating oil prices are expected to rise by 56 percent this winter  Such rapid price increases will force consumers  especially the poor  to cut spending on clothing  health care and food just so they can get to work and keep warm this winter     Kennedy s proposal would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps  currently the minimum wage is  5 15  During the bankruptcy bill debate in March  50 United State Senators expressed their support for Kennedy s plan to provide long overdue help for the millions of Americans who are working in poverty  Five Republicans supported Kennedy s measure  while only 38 senators voted for the competing proposal  offered by Senator Santorum     The bill that Kennedy wants to amend includes an automatic Congressional pay raise  Congress has received seven pay increases in the last nine years  yet in those same nine years  the Republican leadership has not provided a single pay increase to the lowest paid workers     Below is Kennedy s floor statement on the amendment as well as a fact sheet on the minimum wage      Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy on  Raising the Minimum Wage  As Prepared for Delivery   October 17  2005   If the images that we saw on our television screens after the recent hurricanes have taught us anything  it is that a substantial part of America today is invisible and forgotten  It s a part of our country that we don t often see and don t often think about  and it s populated by families who live lives of hardship and quiet desperation because of poverty  The images are a shocking reminder that the American dream remains out of reach for millions of working families  These Americans work as hard as anyone else    often harder  But the minimum wage that many receive cannot cover their bills or support their families  They can t afford the rising cost of higher education  so they don t send their children to college  They can t afford the rising cost of prescription drugs  so they don t take the drugs they need  and often they don t go to the doctor either  Each paltry paycheck brings impossible decisions  Do I pay my rent  or pay for heat  or pay for food  or pay for my new child s clothes  In the current economy  these choices will only get more difficult  Struggling families are being squeezed in every direction by the Bush economy  Families are just barely balancing on a cliff of piling bills  just hoping they won t topple over  And no wonder costs are increasing  while wages are stagnant  Americans are spending 74 percent more on gas than they did at the beginning of 2001  Heating oil prices are expected to rise by 56 percent this winter  Such rapid price increases will force consumers  especially the poor  to cut spending on clothing  health care and food just so they can get to work and keep warm this winter  America can do better  Year after year  these invisible Americans struggle to get by  Yet Congress refuses to help by increasing the minimum wage  which has been at  5 15 an hour since 1997  A minimum wage worker who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  makes about  10 700 each year  For a single parent with two children  that s  4 500 below the poverty line  It s little wonder that so many in the Gulf Region were living in poverty when Katrina hit  An increase in the minimum wage would have directly benefited 491 000 workers in Alabama  Mississippi  and Louisiana  But we haven t enacted any increase for them in eight years  Instead  we ve decided to give ourselves another annual pay raise  In the past eight years  we have raised our own salaries by  28 500  If this bill passes  Members of Congress will automatically receive another  3 100 raise next year  If so  the salaries of Senators and Representatives will have gone up by  31 600 since 1997  while minimum wage workers continue to earn only  10 700 a year  How can any of us look in the mirror each day and justify that  Apparently  when it comes to our own pocketbooks  we agree with the Speaker of the House  who said that lawmakers ought to be able to keep up with the cost of living so that they can take care of their families and provide for their families like everybody else does  But everybody else doesn t do it  If that s the decent thing to do for ourselves  it s also an even more decent thing to do for the most vulnerable Americans  the invisible working men and women who struggle to live on an irresponsibly low minimum wage  It s long past time for Congress to give these hard working Americans a raise  My amendment will raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps over the next two years  The increase will directly raise the pay of seven and a half million workers  and indirectly benefit eight million more  Contrary to popular myth  the vast majority of these workers are not teenagers  Almost two thirds of those who will benefit will be adult workers  A third of the beneficiaries are mothers  and more than a third are the sole breadwinners in their families  An increase in the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour for full time minimum wage workers will add almost  4 400 to their annual income    enough to make a real difference in their lives    enough for a low income family of three to pay for   More than a year of groceries  or  Over 9 months of rent  or  A year and a half of heat and electricity  or  Almost two years of child care  or  Full tuition to earn a degree at a community college  Some claim the timing is wrong  and that an increase in the minimum wage will make the economy even more vulnerable  That is already a tragedy  But the record clearly shows that raising the minimum wage does not have a negative effect on jobs  on employment  or on inflation  In the first four years after the last minimum wage increase in 1997  the economy had its strongest growth in thirty years  Nearly 11 million new jobs were added  an average of more than 200 000 new jobs a month  In today s economy  millions of Americans are suffering  7 7 million are unemployed  37 million are living in poverty  including 13 million children  Almost 46 million are without health insurance  As the pictures of Katrina so powerfully demonstrated  real faces are behind these numbers  and real lives are being jeopardized day after day  year after year by our delay in Congress  A fair increase in the minimum wage is long overdue  How can Congress keep saying yes to itself and no to these millions of deserving working families  when Katrina has shown us their faces so clearly as they struggle to make ends meet  How can we ignore the neediest of these Americans  They re not invisible at all    they re there for all of us to see  All we have to do is open our eyes and see  I urge the Senate to support this amendment  and improve the lives of millions of American families     RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS    The Kennedy Amendment would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps       5 85 60 days after enactment    6 55 one year later    7 25 one year after that    The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 3 million since President Bush took office  37 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Among full time  year round workers poverty has doubled since the late 1970s  An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem      Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  earn  10 700 a year   4 500 below the poverty line for a family of three  Since Congress last acted to raise the minimum wage in 1996  the value has eroded by 17 percent     Every day the minimum wage is not increased it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind  Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase      Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  3 00 below what it was in 1968  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  8 50 an hour today  not  5 15      Seven and a half million workers will directly benefit from the minimum wage increase       Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 370 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families  It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy     More than one year of groceries   Over 9 months of rent    A year and a half of heat and electricity  or  full tuition for a community college degree     This year  the Senate raised its pay by  4 000 and we are now proposing to give ourselves a  3 100 raise for next year  It is shameful that Members of Congress receive our seventh pay increase in nine years  yet in those same nine years  we have not provided a single pay increase to the lowest paid workers      If this raise passes  the salaries of lawmakers will have gone up by  31 600 since 1997 while minimum wage workers continue to earn just  10 700 a year     History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation  In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades  Nearly 11 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 232 000 per month  In contrast  in the last four years the minimum wage has held steady  but only 2 5 million jobs have been created     A fair increase is long overdue  Congress should act as quickly as possible to pass a minimum wage increase that reflects the losses suffered as the result of our shameful inaction in the past  No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
