         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Welcome to Pay Raise Day 2007  We did it  After ten long years  today America gets a raise  Its a special day for working families  and Im honored to be here with you We have so many leaders here today who have dedicated their lives to the nations workers  John Sweeney  Anna Burger  Paul Sherry  Maude Hurd  Kim Gandy  William McNary  Michael Goodwin  many other champions for working families  My thanks to them  and to each and every one of you who have joined us here today  You were the true soldiers in this great battle for fairness and justice  You pounded the pavements  you knocked on doors  you made the phone calls to send out the message that no one in America who works for a living should have to live in poverty In the ten years that we worked to get this bill passed  I met countless minimum wage workers  I heard their stories of struggle and survival  How they worked more than one job  How they saved every penny they could  How they had to make impossible choices every day about what food they could afford to buy and what bills they could afford pay  Today Im thinking of each of them   the 13 million Americans who will see more money in their paychecks for the first time in a decade under this bill  They will have a few more dollars to spend on the essentials of life  or a few more hours to spend time with their families  6 million children will have better food  better health  and better opportunities for the future  Dont let anyone tell you that what we do here in Washington doesnt make a difference to real people  6 million children with a brighter future  thats the difference having a Democratic Congress makes Weve overcome many obstacles  Weve faced every tactic in the Republican anti worker playbook  to get this minimum wage increase across the finish line  And let me assure you here today  we have only just begun to fight    We need your help just as much in the battles ahead  Will you join us in the fight for affordable health care  Will you join us in the fight for better  safer schools  Will you join us in the fight to create more good American jobs  Will you join us in the fight to make sure minimum wage workers are never left behind again You and I know how important these battles are  You and I know were right  And we know that if we keep working hard together  the future of working Americans will only get brighter  Thank you very much THE IMPACT OF THE FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACTIncreasing the minimum wage will make an immediate and significant difference in the lives of millions of hard working Americans   An estimated 13 million Americans will benefit from an increase to  7 25 an hour  5 6 million directly  and another 7 4 million indirectly  More than sixty percent of these workers are women  and almost forty percent are people of color   Almost eighty percent of those who benefit are adult workers  not teenagers seeking pocket change   This raise means that minimum wage earners will almost immediately earn an additional  1 500 to help support their families  When the full increase takes effect in 2009  these workers will see a total increase of  4 400 per year  enough for a low income family of three to buy  o 15 months of grocerieso 19 months of utilitieso 8 months of rento Over two years of health careo 20 months of child careo 30 months of college tuition at a public  2 year collegeIncreasing the minimum wage will help combat poverty in our nation   The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office  37 million Americans currently live in poverty  including 13 million children   Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s  This increase to the minimum wage  combined with the federal Earned Income Tax Credit  EITC  and the food stamps program  will bring a family of four above the poverty line  It will benefit an estimated 6 4 million children of low income workers  Britain has the second largest economy in Europe  after Germany   They implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty  They raised their minimum wage to about  9 58 per hour last year  and they are planning to raise this rate to about  9 96 in October of this year  Increasing the minimum wage restores lost value  Every day minimum wage workers waited for a raise  the minimum wage lost value  and workers have fallen farther and farther behind  This raise restores the purchasing power of minimum wage workers   Since the minimum wage was last raised in 1997  its real value has eroded by 22 percent  Before this raise  minimum wage workers had lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase   Even with this increase  the real value of the minimum wage will still be  2 25 below what it was at its peak in 1968  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be  9 50 an hour today  not  5 15      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
