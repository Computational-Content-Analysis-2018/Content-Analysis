         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  its a privilege to join Senator BURR and other colleagues in supporting the Puerto Rico self determination act  Puerto Rico and its four million residents have enjoyed a positive relationship with the United States since the islands commonwealth status was established over 50 years ago  But its important for all of us to protect the right of the Puerto Rican people to self determination  and this legislation will do so  Our bill calls for a constitutional assembly in Puerto Rico composed of delegates elected by the Puerto Rican people  The delegates will determine the appropriate options for inclusion in a referendum to enable the Puerto Rican people to decide the future status of the island  Congress will have the final say on the referendum  but the process should start with the people of Puerto Rico and not in Washington  A constitutional assembly will best serve their interest by letting us know their wishes  The people of Puerto Rico are U S  citizens  and many of them have served our Nation with great courage and sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan  At the very least we owe them a fair and democratic process in determining their future  The recommendations in the report released in December by the White House task force on the status of Puerto Rico do not adequately address this basic issue  since the options suggested in the report do not give Puerto Ricans the fair choice they deserve  The possibility of change in the current status has stirred intense debate in recent years  and this bill is intended to allow a fair solution that respects the views of all sides in the debate  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation as the most effective way to resolve this issue and give the people of Puerto Rico the respect they deserve
