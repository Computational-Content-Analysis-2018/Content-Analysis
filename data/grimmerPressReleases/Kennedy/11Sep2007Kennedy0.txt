         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Everyone agrees that military action and reconciliation need to go hand in hand  General Jones said it  President Bush said it  Youve said it  In the counterinsurgency manual you wrote last December you specifically state that military actions by themselves cannot achieve success in counterinsurgency Tactical actions must be linked to the host nations essential political goals  Without those connections  lives and resources may be wasted for no real gain  Let me repeat that  Without the connection between military and political goals  lives and resources may be wasted for no real gain  Thats a chilling prospect  General Using your own test for the success of a counterinsurgency  its hard to see how the surge has advanced Iraqs essential political goals  When he announced the surge in January  President Bush said  America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced  But we really havent  The Iraqis havent resolved their political differences  and there have been no consequences  The most important benchmarks that are essential to achieve national reconciliation and end the violence have not been met and are not likely to be met anytime soon  The National Intelligence Estimate said political reconciliation remains elusive The Government Accountability Office says the Iraqi Government has failed to enact the most critical changes that are essential to reach a political accommodation and end the violence  How much longer  General Petraeus  can you ask our troops be held hostage to the Iraqi governments abysmal failure to make the political compromises that are essential to end the violence  especially when there is no indication  NO INDICATION  that they will do so anytime soon   How many more brave Americans must die  How many more billions of taxpayer dollars must we spend  How much more of a burden must we place on our military  General  your testimony to date sounds like more of the same open ended commitment of our troops the President has been advocating for more than four years  Its a timetable for our troops that is dictated more by Iraqi politicians than our national security interests  Its clear that youre not prepared to tell the American people when the nightmare in Iraq will end Its time for the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future  fight for their own country  resolve their political differences  and enable our troops to come home  We should tell the Iraqis that we are going to leave  and add the urgency that is so clearly necessary  rather than drag this process out month after month  year after year  so that President Bush can hand his Iraq policy off to the next President  so that the failure can be blamed on someone else       Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
