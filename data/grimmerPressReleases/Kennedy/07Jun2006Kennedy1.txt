         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                    Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy delivered the keynote address at the first ever National Health IT Week  a summit bringing together health care providers and information technology corporations  Senator Kennedy recently put forth the Wired for Health Care Quality Act  which sets goal posts for improving health care through technology  reducing administrative costs  and diminishing fatal errors caused by lack of information  This legislation to modernize health care for the 21st century successfully passed the Senate and is expected to go to the House floor later this month   The vision for the future is a health care system where accurate and complete information is instantly accessible to patients and doctors  when it is needed and where it is needed  The reality today is far from that vision  Senator Kennedy said  Were close to achieving our goals of saving lives and providing affordable  high quality health care for all our people  The widespread adoption of health IT is the best path to these goals   Currently  patient care declines in quality when physicians do not have access to timely information about the patients they serve  Additionally  health care costs skyrocket when tests or procedures are duplicated because critical records are missing or inaccessible  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act remedies this by creating a federal state partnership to modernize health care by enabling states to make low interest loans to help health professionals afford new computer systems for electronic records and other technology  The legislation also authorizes direct federal grants to needy providers  plus assistance to create regional health information networks    Below are Senator Kennedys remarks as prepared for delivery                   KEYNOTE ADDRESS BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY                                           AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY   Thank you  Dr  Middleton  for that generous introduction  Im honored to be a part of this landmark event  the first ever National Health IT Week  I congratulate the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society for hosting this important summit  as well as the Massachusetts Medical Society for helping to bring together such a broad coalition    Were gathered here today from many sectors of society physicians  information technology companies  community health centers  hospitals  and many others  What unites us is our commitment to advancing the health information technology revolution  and Im proud to be part of this impressive effort   Saving livesreducing the cost of health careimproving the quality of medical care for millions of Americansthese are the priorities that the Senate should be addressing  We have little time remaining in the current Congress  and we should use every minute to make progress on health care and other issues that truly matter to working families    American families face major challenges such as rising costs for education  gasoline  housing  and many other necessities of life  but perhaps none is more serious or more personal than the soaring cost of health care  Containing these costs can mean the difference between a family being able to afford the health care they need  or having to go without needed care or essential treatment    Containing health costs also means the difference between American businesses being able to compete in the global marketplace  or losing out to competitors from nations that have made the investments needed to rein in the high cost of health care    There is a right way and a wrong way to deal with the high cost of health care  The wrong way is to deny patients the care they need  or to allow insurance companies to drop coverage for those with disabilities or a history of illness    The right way is to invest in the innovative new treatments to prevent illness and avoid disability  and to invest in the information technology systems that save lives  and help doctors and nurses bring the best possible care to their patients    Thousands of lives are lost every year to preventable medical errors  This unacceptably high toll can be dramatically reduced through wider use of electronic records and error prevention software that warns a doctor or nurse when a medication is likely to injure a patient or when an urgently needed test has not been performed    Health information technology can increase health coverage for the 46 million Americans who lack health insurance  by freeing up funds now used for overhead  It places control over health care in the individuals own hands  through personalized electronic health records and online medical consultations between physicians and their patients    Health IT also encourages patient self care  making it easier for patients to obtain preventive health services  counseling for chronic disease management  and other life saving interventions  It brings substantial reductions in wasteful spending by promoting more efficient use of resources  IT systems improve our ability to monitor emergency room diagnoses across the country and ensure rapid detection of bioterrorist attacks and infectious disease outbreaks  If pandemic flu reaches our shores tomorrow  its the information systems used by state and local public health departments that will detect the outbreak and help us respond effectively   Industries as diverse as telecommunications  tourism  and financial services have already been transformed by IT  Yet the health care sectorthe industry that saves lives and promotes well beinghas been left behind  The IT gap is growing between large hospitals that can afford to purchase new technology  and smaller hospitals  clinics  and doctors offices that cant afford the investment    Public hospitals  community health centers  and doctors practicing in underserved areas are being left behind  Its more and more difficult for them to keep up with the costs of advanced technology  It costs a physicians office about  40 000 to implement a new IT system  and many cant afford the upfront investment  adopt new computer systems  or re train their staff    The United States is lagging behind  We have less coordination of care and a higher rate of medical mistakes than Australia  Canada  Germany  New Zealand or the U K  In other nations  investing in health IT is seen  rightly  as a national priority  Less than a week ago  the respected Financial Times of London ran a lead editorial calling for a sustained national effort to improve the use of health IT  As that editorial correctly observed  It is hard to believe that at the start of the 21st century  so much still relies on paper records and film  Nor is it conscionable that patients are obliged endlessly to repeat basic details about themselves    The obstacles to transmitting information from family doctor to hospital to test laboratory and back again are routine  with all the risk of information being lost  or  if not lost  subject to transcription error  A high quality  easily accessible record is thus fast becoming not a pleasant luxury but an essential piece of glue to hold patient care together   The vision for the future is a health care system where accurate and complete information is instantly accessible to patients and doctors  when it is needed and where it is needed  The reality today is far from that vision  One out of every 7 primary care visits is affected by missing medical information  More than 40 percent of Americans have been affected by a medical error  either personally or through a friend or relative  A third of those affected say the error did significant permanent harm to the patients health  In this era of medical miracles and advanced health technology  theres no excuse for lagging so far behind   To help solve some of these problems  and to expedite the implementation of health IT  weve passed bipartisan legislation in the Senate  The Chairman of our Senate Health Committee  Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming  deserves credit for his leadership on this important legislation    The passage of the Senate bill  called the Wired for Health Care Quality Act  is an excellent example of what can be accomplished when both sides of the aisle work together for change  We worked closely with Senator Enzi  as well as with Senator Frist  Senator Clinton and Senator Dodd  to gain support for this important effort    Our bill authorizes direct federal grants to needy providers  plus assistance to create regional health information networks  It creates a federal state partnership to modernize health care by enabling states to make low interest loans to help health professionals afford new computer systems for electronic records and other technology                But getting the right hardware and software into the hands of doctors is only half the battle     Its also essential for doctors to be trained to make effective use of the new technology  Our legislation establishes a Best Practices Center  where doctors can learn to implement new technology in the clinic or hospital  It sets up a Help Line at the Department of Health and Human Services to answer technical questions  To help doctors sort through the confusing array of options on the market  the bill establishes a certification program  so that providers can quickly determine whether particular systems meet the applicable technical standards   The bill passed the Senate six months ago  and Im hopeful the House will act soon  Much of modern health IT was invented here in America  But unlike people in Britain  Sweden and Canada  most Americans are still waiting for health IT to move from the computer lab to the doctors office   In 2004  our health care spending reached  1 9 trillion  a record 16 percent of economy  Over  600 billion was spent on administrative costs alone  representing a third of the total spent on health  Widespread adoption of electronic health records could save more than  160 billion each year  according to a study by the RAND Corporation  It makes no sense not to adopt this cost saving technology   The Veterans Administration is doing it right  Since 1996  when it began investing significantly in IT  its costs per patient have decreased by 7 percent  even though private sector costs have increased 62 percent    The VAs health IT system is now one of the gold standards for electronic health records  and the Department of Defense is close behind  The challenge is to make these technologies available not just to our soldiers and veterans  but to the rest of America as well    Thats why Im here today  We need your help to advance the health IT revolution  Congress and the executive branch need to work with insurance carriers  hospitals  and other major institutions to make this transformation happen  Ill do my best in coming months to push for targeted funding  strong safety and privacy standards  and better cooperation between the public and private sectors    Were close to achieving our goals of saving lives and providing affordable  high quality health care for all our people  The widespread adoption of health IT is the best path to these goals  It brings me new hope to see so many committed health care providers  advocates  and entrepreneurs here today  contributing their voices to a call for action  Im proud to be a part of this coalition  and I thank you for your dedication to improving the health of all Americans           Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633
