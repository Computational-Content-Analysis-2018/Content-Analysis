         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy voiced his strong opposition to the spending reconciliation bill currently pending in the United States Senate  The bill slashes health care for the poor  child support  the student loan program and other key programs for American families  The cuts made in this bill will not be used to reduce deficit  but used to pay for more tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans     The Reconciliation bill  as well as the Labor Health and Human Services appropriations bill that also contains drastic cuts to health care  education and job training programs  will be debated this week on the Senate floor  Additionally  the Department of Defense appropriations bill will also contain a 1  cut across the board for the very programs that have already seen their funding decreased     Kennedy  who has been an outspoken opponent of the cuts said  Republicans are good at the rhetoric and making it look like they want to help our neediest citizens  but when it comes to putting their money where there mouth is they fall shortvery shortand it s our nation s poor that have to pay    The student loan programs are cut in the Reconciliation bill by 13 billion dollars  Instead of putting that funding back into increased aid for all needy students  the cuts will help line the pockets of the wealthy in the form of tax giveaways  The new student aid program in the bill fails to prioritize the neediest students and imposes so many hurdles to getting the aid that it is sure to leave behind those who most need help to stay in school    America s low income families will see their health care costs rise  while at the same time seeing their coverage scaled back  Families struggling to move from welfare to work will face numerous barriers with harsh new work requirements and inadequate child care funding255 000 children in low income working families will lose their child care subsidies over the next five years  More children will suffer from cuts to the Child Support Enforcement Program  Almost  3 billion will be lost in child support payments over the next five years  Low income families and the elderly who rely upon assistance in paying their home heating bills through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  will barely be given enough fuel to get through half of the cold winter months    Senator Kennedy said  The Republican majority spoke today  and Americans lost  The priorities of the hardest working men and women    the men and women whose dedication keeps this country moving    have been overlooked in favor of big business and tax giveaways for the wealthiest  America can do better than an Administration and a Republican Congress that leave America s families behind in order to line the pockets of the already wealthy    Below are Senator Kennedy remarks in opposition to the Reconciliation bill as well as a fact sheet detailing he cuts to programs in both the Reconciliation bill and the Labor Health and Human Services Appropriations bill that is due to be debated later this week    House Reconciliation Bill Cuts Important Low Income Programs   Welfare Reauthorization  TANF   The legislation includes new work requirements in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  TANF  program   States would have to meet much higher work participation rates in 2007  starting just ten months from now  or else face fiscal penalties   The conference agreement would remove from states the flexibility they now have to apply different types of work related requirements to people receiving assistance funded entirely with state maintenance of effort dollars   29 states  not including Massachusetts  use state dollars in a separate program that counts towards maintenance of effort dollars  This is a critical option in the original TANF law that gives states the flexibility to serve populations that would not be able to participate for the hours and activities required to be countable under federal law  Both houses of the MA legislature have approved a bill that would direct Massachusetts to use separate state funds countable towards maintenance of effort dollars to serve families where the parent is disabled  caring for a disabled family member or has other major barriers to employment  If the option to use separate state dollars in this way is eliminated  there will be enormous pressure on Massachusetts and many other states to cut off assistance to vulnerable families who would otherwise count against the state s work rate   The conference report also imposes unrealistic work requirements on two parent families  In effect  this requirement means that any state that provides assistance to two parent families will almost certainly fail to meet the work participation requirements and will face fiscal penalties   CBO estimates that if states attempt to meet the work requirements in the conference report by placing more parents in welfare to work programs  rather than by reducing the number of poor families receiving assistance at all   the costs to states would be  8 4 billion over the next five years    Child Care  Despite this increase in required work  the bill fails to allow child care funding to keep pace with even inflation   The House bill provides only  1 billion for child care assistance  This is far less than the  6 billion in the Senate welfare reauthorization bill   Child care funding in the bill falls  11 billion short of the amount that CBO has estimated states need to meet the new work requirements and ensure that current child care funding keeps pace with inflation   An estimated 255 000 children in low income working families would lose child care assistance in 2010  States will shift resources away from child care subsidies for these families to help meet the costs of new work requirements   The bill will harm children in Massachusetts  There are already 13 500 children on waiting lists for child care in Massachusetts    Child Support  The conference agreement includes a provision in the House bill that would prohibit States from receiving federal matching dollars when they reinvest incentive funds into their child support systems  these funds are earned by States only when they achieve certain performance benchmarks in collecting child support    This change will cut federal child support funding by  1 5 billion over the next five years   4 9 billion over the next ten years   The cuts will result in a  2 9 billion reduction in the amount of child support collected over the next five years  and an  8 4 billion loss over the next ten years   In Massachusetts  over  58 million in child support payments will be lost over the next five yearsalmost  170 million will be lost over the next ten years    LIHEAP  The Reconciliation bill contains an additional  1 billion in FY 2007 dollars for LIHEAP   This one time obligation is split  250 million for formula funds and  750 million for contingency or emergency funds  Unfortunately this money is for next year and will do nothing to help keep low income families warm this winter  In addition  emergency funding is given out at the discretion of the President  It s possible that he could release little to no emergency funds in FY07   For FY06  LIHEAP is funded at  2 5 billion in regular funding and  1 683 billion in contingency funding  DOD and Labor HHS combined   However  with a 1 percent across the board cut to discretionary programs LIHEAP will receive  2 475 in regular funds and  1 666 billion in contingency  We are still far short of the programs authorized level of  5 1 billion   In Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves 134 000 needy families  Right now  these families receive a maximum benefit of  765 for the current heating season  This is enough for only one tank of oil  It takes at least two to four tanks to make it through the winter  Massachusetts may not see an increase over last years funding level in FY06  it all depends on when  if  and how the President releases the contingency or emergency funds    Medicaid  The House bill cuts Medicaid by  6 9 billion over the next five years and  28 4 billion over 10 years  Massachusetts could be cut by about  195 million over 5 years and  804 million over 10 years      17 million people would face higher Medicaid cost sharing  although the number could be as high as 30 million  including 13 million children  The conference report lets states require co payments and deductibles on many Medicaid beneficiaries who do not pay cost sharing under current law  and increase cost sharing for beneficiaries who currently pay some cost sharing      Most of the savings from higher cost sharing would result because enrollees wouldn t access needed health care  CBO previously estimated that 80  of the projected savings results from decreased use of services  Health providers would be allowed to deny services if the enrollee doesn t pay the required cost sharing    resulting in higher spending in other areas like emergency room visits      States will be able to provide any child  regardless of how low their family income  with a lesser benefits package than current law requires  This could impact all 25 million children who receive health coverage through Medicaid    Education     The Conference report makes the biggest cuts to student loan programs in history   12 7 billion   and instead of putting those funds back into increased aid for all needy students  the bill will help fund tax giveaways for the rich     While this report includes some new aid for students studying math and science  the new program fails to prioritize the neediest students  and it imposes so many hurdles to getting the aid that it is sure to leave behind those who most need help to stay in school     Nearly 80 000 students at Massachusetts colleges and universities received over  180 million in Pell grants last year       While the Senate proposal would have delivered an estimated  120 million in additional aid for all Pell eligible students in Massachusetts over the next five years  the Conference report provides only a fraction of this amount and limits eligibility to only a small subset of Massachusetts Pell grant recipients     LABOR HHS APPROPRIATIONS BILL  AMERICANS DESERVE BETTER   Education    Base bill includes smallest increase in Head Start funding since 1986     o Head Start will increase only  11 million  leaving over 750 000 eligible preschool children without services  o In Massachusetts  15 000 eligible children would not be served    If a 1  cut is enacted  Head Start funding in the bill will be cut by  68 5 million  and 9 400 children would be dropped from the program     Even Start funding is slashed by more than half  from  225 million to  99 million  o Over 30 250 children will be dropped from the program    If a 1  cut is enacted  Even Start funding will be cut by another million dollars  and 235 more kids will lose services     As requirements under the No Child Left Behind Act are more demanding than ever  the Republican proposed bill cuts  780 million in funds for these programs     If a 1  cut is enacted  the bill will cut funding for No Child Left Behind by an additional  237 million  leaving the funding level  1 billion lower than last year s level     Title I funding for disadvantaged students  the law s key program  is  9 9 billion lower than the amount promised in the law  o Nationally  3 1 million children would be left behind  o Over 52 000 Massachusetts children would be left behind  o If enacted  Massachusetts schools would see cuts of over  4 million in Title I funding     If a 1  cut is enacted  Title I funding will be cut by  128 million  meaning 160 000 fewer kids will be served than last year    2 680 fewer in Massachusetts     Includes no new funding for after school programs   o Funding in the bill   991 million  is less than half the amount promised under NCLB   o At this funding level  1 65 million children would be left out of after school programs    31 500 in Massachusetts alone    If a 1  cut is enacted  after school funding would be cut by 10 million dollars  taking after school programs away from over 13 000 children  In Massachusetts  230 children will be dropped from programs     Smallest increase for IDEA in a decade   o It increases IDEA Part B grants by  100 million from the FY05 level to  10 7 billion   o The federal contribution toward special education will decrease from 18 6  in FY05 to 18  in FY06     If a 1  cut is enacted  the federal share will decrease to 17 8       Pell Grants are frozen for the fourth year in a row   o The maximum Pell grant remains at  4 050 despite tuition rising 45  at four year public colleges since 2001     Labor    Job training programs cut     o The bill cuts funding for adult and youth training programs by more than  60 million  This would mean a cut of  3 million in Massachusetts    If a 1  cut is enacted  funding will be further reduced by over  600 000 nationally  and by  30 000 in Massachusetts      Funding cuts for Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services  even in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and with 8 million Americans unemployed  including more than 160 000 in Massachusetts     This bill prohibits OSHA from enforcing respiratory safety standards to protect health care workers from deadly infectious diseases     Workplace safety programs failed to receive adequate funding as workplace deaths rise    Health NIH  If the Republicans succeed in a government wide spending cut  NIH will lose money relative to last year  This has only happened four times in the entire history of NIH   This is the lowest NIH funding level in 35 years   NIH is the engine of discovery that fuels modern medicine and our biomedical economy  The tank has been low for the past two years and now the Administration and Republican Congress has us running on fumes   You can t buy a car and refuse to pay for the gas     CDC  Critical health promotion and prevention programs will be cut in the bill  CDC will be cut by  307 million and programs focused on health promotion activities are cut by over  50 million   Preventive health block grants that support a wide range of public health functions will be cut by 25  and grants to states for bioterriorism and emergency preparedness is cut 12      HRSA  There are 45 million Americans who lack health insurance  but this bill funds community health centers that serve as a safety net of care for the most vulnerable  at less that half of the levels passed by the Senate   This means that there will be no new community health centers in 2006   Overall  funding for critical health professions training programs that encourage diversity in the health professions and train health care providers to that will deliver care in underserved areas are cut 52    Several vital programs strive to encourage better health care for America s most vulnerable are eliminated in this bill including geriatric training grants and funding for rural emergency medical services   With a 1  across the board cut  several programs including family planning  HIV AIDS prevention programs will now receive a decrease in funding  despite the growing need for these services     TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST     Ironically    and sadly    these cuts to the budget come as Republicans will try this week to secure over  90 billion in new tax breaks for the wealthiest      Bush and House Republicans want a  90 billion package that will extend the president s dividend and capital gains tax cuts for investors   The Senate Republicans approved a  58 billion alternative  without Bush s priority of extending capital gains and dividend cuts past their 2008 expiration date       According to the Tax Policy Center  the capital gains and dividend tax cuts in the House Republican bill alone will save the average millionaire over  32 000 per year  above and beyond the enormous cuts they ve gotten already from this Administration      Most of the benefits of this extension would flow to taxpayers who make more than  1 million per year  which the New York Times calls morally reprehensible at a time when so much is being cut from domestic programs      Estimates based on data from the Urban Institute    Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center show that if all of the Bush tax cuts are made permanent  the richest 1  of taxpayers will receive an average tax benefit of  58 200 each year  This represents a 7 3  change in their after tax income  By contrast  middle income taxpayers will receive an average annual tax cut of just  655  This would represent only a 2 5  change in their after tax income     The Bush tax cuts already enacted cost nearly two trillion dollars  plus additional interest on the higher national debt       On top of those tax cuts already in place  the President is proposing another  1 5 trillion dollars of extended tax cuts between FY 2006 and 2015  with another  300 billion in additional interest   Even this understates the real cost of making the tax cuts permanent  because nearly all the cost occurs in the five years after 2010  Thus  the real ten year cost  FY 2011    2020  would be nearly  3 0 trillion dollars      In January 2002  Senator Kennedy was the first major Democratic official to call for a rollback of those Bush tax cuts that benefited only wealthy taxpayers  specifically    1  restoring the rates of the top three brackets    39 6   36   and 31  to their 2001 levels    2  maintaining the partial phase out of exemptions and deductions for high income taxpayers contained in the 2001 tax code    3  maintaining the estate tax on estates over  3 5 million    Statement of Senator Edward Kennedy Conference Report on Budget Spending Reconciliation  As Prepared for Delivery    During this holiday season  we should be focused on the true meaning of Christmas and the special thoughts that Americans of many faiths have at this time of year for their families  their friends and neighbors  and peoples everywhere  We re reminded that each of us has an obligation to care for one another and to help those in need    to lend a hand to the least of those in our midst  As the Bible teaches us  we should Love thy neighbor as thyself    But this budget reconciliation bill does the opposite  It robs from the poor to make room for tax giveaways to the rich  Wealthy Americans  banks and drug companies are big winners under this deal  Those who need hope and help are the big losers  It s a bill Scrooge would love    Sadly  as we complete this measure at Christmastime  it will indeed be the neediest members of our society who have to tighten their belts  Republicans have decided to leave tax giveaways for the wealthy under the Christmas tree  while leaving middle class families out in the cold  Those with incomes over  1 million will receive an average of  32 000 in tax cuts  But those with incomes under  100 000 will receive an average of only  29  Bah humbug    Children and families struggling to pay for health care will be among those who are hurt the most  46 million Americans lack health insurance  but this bill will increase costs and cut health benefits for millions of low income families  It slashes Medicaid funding by  6 9 billion over the next five years  and  28 4 billion over 10 years    Under this Administration  the number of uninsured has already risen to historic levels  But this Republican bill will send the level even higher  by raising costs and cutting benefits for low income families who rely on Medicaid for needed health care    The conference report is actually worse than the Republican House bill in many respects  It would take away the guaranteed benefits for the 25 million children who receive health care through Medicaid by creating an ambiguous new state option called flexible benefits  It hurts seniors by increasing the prescription drug co payments beyond those in the House bill  allowing states to charge up to 20  of the cost of each drug  beyond the means of many low income Medicaid families  It indexes cost sharing to medical inflation  a much higher rate of increase than family wages  It allows states to increase cost sharing up to four times the amount allowed under current law     The majority of the savings from these provisions don t come from the actual co payments and premiums paid by Medicaid enrollees  They result from families using fewer medical services  because the increased costs will put the health services they need beyond their reach    Unlike the Senate bill  which made the majority of its cuts by reducing overpayments to drug companies and HMOs  the conference report cuts Medicaid by limiting the access of low income families to needed health care  Instead of getting rid of the outrageous slush fund for Medicare HMOs  it cuts health care for poor children     The Republican Congress is telling hard working Americans everywhere that they don t care about the hardships they face  Their policies encourage failure  not hope for a better life    This bill means that mothers trying to hold down a job and put food on their table will go without the child care assistance and child support they need and deserve    Behind closed doors  Republicans also have added a welfare reauthorization in this bill despite their repeated efforts to block debate on the reauthorization in the Senate  Democrats supported moving forward  but Republican reluctance to spend money on our most vulnerable citizens kept the leadership from bringing the bill to the floor     So House Republican leaders decided to avoid the standard legislative process by unfairly slipping their welfare bill into this massive budget reconciliation bill     The bill includes new work requirements without adequate child care funding  By eliminating the current caseload reduction credit  the bill requires over half the States to increase the number of welfare recipients in federal work activities by two thirds in 2007  unless they have a substantial drop in their welfare caseload over the next year  Despite this increase in required work  the bill fails to allow child care funds to keep pace with inflation  The bill under funds child care by  11 billion in terms of what is needed to maintain current purchasing power and to meet the increased work requirements   In Massachusetts alone  13 500 children are already on waiting lists to receive these essential services  Under this bill  the situation can only get worse    The bill will make life harder for poor children who rely on child support to survive  It greatly weakens enforcement efforts to make dead beat dads live up to their responsibilities and provide for their children  Under the Republican plan  nearly  2 9 billion will be lost in child support payments over the next five years and  8 4 billion in over the next ten years     In Massachusetts   58 million in child support payments will be lost over the next five years  and  170 million over the next ten years    These are the nation s poorest children  They are vulnerable and in need  But the Republican plan would abandon them  Merry Christmas     Families having to choose between putting food on the table and keeping warm this winter are also big losers under this bill    In Massachusetts  the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  serves 134 000 needy families  These families will receive a maximum benefit of  765 for the current heating season  This is enough for only one tank of oil  It takes at least two to four tanks to make it through the winter    Unfortunately  under this bill  low income families struggling to make it through the winter won t see any additional funds until fiscal year 2007  The bill cruelly ignores the obvious fact that the heating crisis is here now    They claim that they have provided for LIHEAP in other bills  But when you add the up the numbers  they ve only provided  2 4 billion in regular funds and  1 6 billion in emergency funds  The emergency funds are given out at the discretion of the President  so it s possible that states will see little to none of the  1 6 billion this year  Obviously  the Republican majority had no intention of fully funding LIHEAP at it s authorized level of  5 1 billion    Republicans mouth the same old rhetoric about wanting to help our neediest citizens  But when it comes to putting their money where there mouth is they fall shortvery shortand it s the nation s poor who suffer    Students struggling to get a college degree are the big losers as well  We know that education is the key to keeping America strong  secure  and competitive  Now  more than ever  we must embrace and invest in education to advance America in the years ahead    To do so requires a commitment to educational opportunity for all    especially for talented youth who have so much potential  but need help affording a college degree    The cost of tuition and fees at public colleges has skyrocketed in recent years and Pell grants have fallen far behind  Under current law  this will be the fourth year in a row that the maximum Pell grant has not been increased     For countless families  the gap is so great that college is out of reach  Over 400 000 talented  qualified students each year can t go to a 4 year college because they can t afford it  170 000 don t attend college at all  That s unacceptable    But in the face of this crisis  the Republican budget deal abandons the Senate provisions that increased the maximum Pell grant by  450    It includes the biggest cuts in student loan programs ever  in order to pay for  13 billion in tax giveaways for the richest Americans     The Senate bill included  8 billion to increase grant aid for all Pell grant recipients  In contrast  the small amount of funding for student aid included in this Conference report     13 billion for tax cuts and only  3 75 billion for students    will only be available for a very small number of students eligible for Pell Grants    This bill abandons the government s long time commitment to ensuring that the neediest students get the most help  It imposes so many hurdles to new aid that it is sure to leave behind those who need our help the most to stay in school    Under this proposal  a single mother who can attend college only part time because she has to work 40 hours a week to put food on the table will not be eligible for a penny in new grant aid     Under this proposal  a student who did not have the opportunity to take rigorous courses in high school because this Administration under funded the No Child Left Behind Act would not be eligible for a penny in new grant aid    Under this proposal  a student who decides that the best road to a good job is to pursue a credential  such as a dental hygiene certificate  would not be eligible for a penny in new grant aid     In today s global economy  we need stronger incentives for students to study math and science  and the Senate bill did that      We also need to address the broader crisis of hundreds of thousands of qualified students who never go to college  because the costs are too high and student aid is too low  All qualified students should get the help they need to achieve the American dream     Take the case of Carli  from Hampton  New Hampshire  She s a junior at a public college in the state  and she already has  25 000 of debt  She relies on her Pell grant  but even with that  she has to work 20 hours a week during the school year and 40 hours a week in the summer    She writes  This is not a question of not working hard enough  It has been an uphill battle to put myself through school  I am happy to do it  but I just want to know that when I m through  there is a place for me in the American Dream too    Becky  from Holyoke  Massachusetts is a junior in college and is already in  24 000 of debt  She s alarmed at how high her debt will be when she graduates    She writes  We students are the future of the USA  By putting us at risk and in a financial crisis  Bush and his cronies are putting the future of the USA at risk    In addition to abandoning so many students who so desperately need our help  this bill also rejects our Senate passed proposals to increase competition in the federal loan programs  As a result  private lenders will still have their unfair advantage over the more cost efficient federal loan program  The end result will be increased costs to taxpayers    The actions taken today hand the keys of the student loan program over to profit hungry banks and lenders  Congress missed the opportunity to say students  not banks  should be given a break     American students deserve better   America deserves better      It would be wrong to say that everyone loses under the Republican proposals  There s certainly one big winner    the big drug companies  who got everything on their Christmas wish list from a back room deal to sneak a major giveaway to one of the most profitable industries in America into the massive appropriations bill that will be before the Senate this week    This giveaway to the drug industry is not just for pandemic flu  It extends far beyond  It covers a range of drugs  vaccines  even medical devices that the Administration decides are covered by the broad definitions of the bill  This is an Administration that has never met a company it doesn t want to help evade responsibility for its actions    from gun makers  to predatory lenders to the pharmaceutical industry  Giving this Administration the power to write a blank check to the drug companies is an invitation to abuse    That provision is such a shameless handout to the industry that they had to sneak it into the bill in a backroom in the Capitol  away from the eyes of the public  away from Senate debate  Making an end run around the normal process of Congressional debate just compounds one bad idea with another     Attempts to add controversial provisions to major spending bills in the waning hours of Congress have a long and sorry history  These so called midnight riders are often withdrawn or rescinded if they re exposed before they become law  Last year  the Republican leadership inserted a surprise provision in a massive spending bill to give Congressional staff the right to pry into any American s tax returns  Three years ago  anonymous Republicans slipped a special favor to Eli Lilly  one of America s largest drug companies  into a massive bill at the end of the year  Both of these scandalous provisions were rescinded once the bright light of public scrutiny fell upon them    The proposal to deny compensation to victims of defective vaccines should be debated in the open  not slipped secretly into a pending bill    If we had a public debate  Congress would reject any proposal to protect irresponsible or reckless companies  and deny compensation to patients  health providers  and any others harmed by these vaccines  But under this bill  those hurt by defective bird flu vaccines are the big losers    There s broad agreement that Congress needs to do something to deal with liability concerns  and there s a proven way to do it  We need responsible liability protections for the companies so they ll make the vaccines  and an effective compensation program for those who are injured by faulty vaccines  so people will be willing to take the vaccines    The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program did just that  It gave incentives to manufacturers of childhood vaccines  encouraged families to have their children vaccinated  and compensated those who are injured    When thousands of Americans developed neurological problems after being vaccinated against swine flu in the 1970 s  Congress protected the manufacturers of the vaccine from lawsuits  but established procedures for injured patients to receive compensation from the federal government     The current provision now includes a fig leaf of a compensation program    but it s a compensation fund with no funding  There s no guarantee that any victim of a faulty or negligently made drug or vaccine will receive any compensation whatsoever  We re supposed to believe that the Republican leadership in Congress will act quickly to create a compensation fund when it s needed  They say they ll keep their promises  Tell that to those exposed to deadly doses of radiation because they lived    downwind from the atomic test sites in Nevada  The compensation fund set up by the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act is short of funds  As a result  victims of radiation exposure in Utah  Nevada and other western states get IOU s instead of compensation for their injuries  In an article from the Desert News last year  our colleague Senator Orrin Hatch describes this tragedy as one of the most important issues facing Utah  I commend our colleague from Utah for leading the fight to see that the downwinders get what is due to them    not just an IOU     Let s not repeat the mistakes of the past   We know how to get it right this time  and that s what we should have done   Laura Capps Melissa
