         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Im honored to be here with all of you  and Im grateful for the opportunity to discuss some of the significant legislation weve been working on in the Senate  For over 35 years  the Congressional Black Caucus has fought hard and well  for the interests of millions of African Americans  and for the greater good of all Americans  Youve truly lived up to your reputation as the conscience of the Congress  The CBCs agenda for the current Congress includes many major issues  but few  if any  are more critical than education      In many ways  its the defining civil rights issue of our time  On Tuesday  the nation celebrated the 50th anniversary of the court order requiring desegregation of Little Rock Central High School  We all know theres been great progress since then  But its a national scandal that half a century later  we still dont have equal education     The struggle for equal educational opportunity is at the heart of our march of progress  because education creates so much opportunity in all areas of American society today  It is a powerful force for increasing economic opportunity  combating residential segregation  increasing civic engagement  and fully including all our people into the fabric of American life      When Robert Kennedy served as Attorney General  school desegregation was one of his highest priorities  because he understood so well that justice delayed is justice denied  and its still being denied     You and I know that civil rights is still the unfinished business of America  Formal integration alone is not enough to create equal educational opportunity  The troubling reports of racial violence and discriminatory discipline in Jena  Louisiana  are an appalling current example  But integration has been incomplete in less dramatic ways as well  Too often  for example  the tracking of students in advanced courses has reflected racial stereotypes and led to racial divisions  There is still a troubling gap in test scores of African Americans and other minorities     Today  were faced with many challenges  and we need stronger action on education to meet them      After years of missed opportunities by a Republican Administration and Congress  our new Democratic Congress has made strengthening education a genuine priority        Both the Senate and the House have passed bills to reauthorize Head Start  and were working on getting it out of Conference soon  Its a national tragedy that after all these years  only half of all eligible children actually receive Head Start services today  We need to do more to increase enrollment and improve the quality of the programs  Its the best way to ensure that needy students arrive at school ready to learn     In another positive action  we passed and the President signed the America COMPETES Act  which strengthens education in critical fields such as math  science  engineering  and foreign languages  The bill makes a new commitment to fund scientific research and will help ensure that our nation continues to be competitive in this new century     Earlier today  President Bush signed a bill that strongly renews our commitment to higher education  It provides  20 billion in student aid  the biggest increase in such aid since the GI Bill  It raises the maximum Pell Grant from  4 300 to  5 400  which means that needy students can receive  1 100 more than they currently do      We all know how important Pell Grants are in helping African American students attend college  In 2004  nearly 47 percent of all African American college students received a Pell Grant  more than any other group    and the new law means that these students financial lifeline to college is even stronger     The heart of the law is opportunity  It makes it easier to attend college by offering more aid  simplifying the financial aid process  and supporting states in their outreach to inform students about the importance of higher education      It also increases opportunities after college  It reduces the interest rate on federal student loans  It caps loan payments at 15 percent of monthly income  And it forgives loans entirely for those who enter careers in public service      Its outrageous that so many college graduates are so oppressed by heavy loan debt on their college loans that they have to give up the careers they wanted  As the Nellie Mae Foundation reported in 2003  African American students are the most likely to be overwhelmed by their student loans  Sixty percent of African American students reported that they felt overburdened by their education loans  Forty percent reported more hardship than they anticipated in making their loan payments  And 22 percent reported making different career choices because of their heavy debt burden     The new law promises college graduates that if they dedicate ten years to a public service field  their student loans will be forgiven  Its an incentive for students to choose careers such as public school teachers    law enforcement and emergency management professionals    social workers and librarians    prosecutors and public defenders    public health doctors and nurses    child care workers    employees in non profit groups  and many more     The law provides an additional  510 million for minority serving institutions  It strengthens our commitment to students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities by providing an additional  170 million for laboratory equipment  teaching materials  and teacher education programs  It encourages these schools to invest more in career preparation programs  such as language instruction and information technology      Today  we have 105 Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the nation five percent of our colleges and universities  Yet these institutions award almost 30 percent of all college degrees obtained by African Americans and in some areas of science  math  and engineering  they account for more than half of all such degrees for African Americans  H B C Us are also responsible for a large number of graduate and professional degrees earned by African Americans      The law also provides  30 million in grant aid to an important new category of colleges  Predominantly Black Institutions  Many institutions of higher education have been ineligible for federal funds because they are not Historically Black Colleges and Universities established before the cut off date of 1965  At least 75 more institutions  serving 265 000 students  will be eligible under this broader definition  and about 50 percent of their students are low income or first generation college students    The law also provides more than  200 million to expand Upward Bound  which helps thousands of talented minority students prepare for college and succeed in college  It restores funding to almost 120 high quality  existing Upward Bound programs that werent initially funded this year by the Department of Education  It will also fund dozens of new Upward Bound programs in communities across America     As you know  Upward Bound is one of the last remaining Great Society programs  and its results have been impressive             Upward Bound means that  students can dream larger dreams  and open doors that had been locked before  Im so proud we were able to increase funding for this vital program  and I particularly commend Bobby Scott and all the members of the C B C who worked so hard to make that happen     Finally  the law provides new opportunities for students and families to develop greater financial literacy skills  which is so important for first generation college students  Weve provided  130 million to establish a College Access Partnership Grant program  State agencies will partner with non profit organizations to support new outreach activities for at risk students  help students and families file the federal financial aid form  and provide professional development for high school guidance counselors and college financial aid administrators      The new law renews our commitment that every student who works hard and wants to earn a college degree will be able to do so  400 000 students today dont attend a 4 year college because they cant afford to  The law is a large down payment to close that unacceptable gap      Through these changes  well create a true continuum of education that will not only help more students enter and succeed in college  but also succeed in the workforce and achieve the American Dream     But there is much more that remains to be done  To truly create this continuum  we also need a renewed commitment to strengthening K 12 education     When the No Child Left Behind Act became law in 2002  many states were struggling to implement standards based reforms  Few states had high quality and fair accountability systems in place to ensure an excellent education for every child  Only four states accounted for and reported the achievement of every group of students in their schools      No Child Left Behind made a historic commitment that every child counts  black or white  native born or immigrant  disabled or non disabled      Today  thanks to the Act  all 50 states have standards that enable us to track the achievement of every group of students      Every school now measures its progress in closing achievement gaps and getting all students to meet high standards  Schools across the country are identifying weaknesses in their instruction and documenting areas of need for their students      Because of the No Child Left Behind Act  over 1 3 million children now have the opportunity to participate in after school programs  430 000 children in struggling schools receive extra tutoring and academic support      Since its enactment  as we know  schools have faced many challenges in implementing it  By far  however  the most serious challenge is the lack of funding  There is now a cumulative shortfall of 56 billion dollars since the law was enacted  Think how much better our schools would be today if we had sent that 56 billion dollars to them and not to Iraq     We know that other critical challenges remain  One of the most disturbing trends is the inequitable distribution of teachers  In high poverty and high minority schools  students are far more likely to have inexperienced teachers  or teachers without a major in the subject theyre teaching     I know you heard from my colleague on the House Education Committee  George Miller  earlier  Reauthorizing the No Child Left Behind Act is a high priority for both of us  and weve had several hearings and meetings to learn more about the specific challenges that schools  teachers and students are facing in the classroom each day      We know that struggling schools need greater support  We need to do more to attract and retain high quality teachers  especially in hard to staff schools      We need to improve the way we measure student progress  and provide flexibility to local communities to determine the most effective interventions in schools that are not making sufficient progress      We need to strengthen parent and community involvement in schools  to meet students social and developmental needs      We need to strengthen state standards  and make sure theyre aligned with the demands of our 21st century workforce      The original Elementary and Secondary School Education Act became law in 1965  but we were slow to assess its results  A year after its enactment  I remember when my brother  Robert Kennedy  as a Senator from New York  was questioning the administration about the implementation of the act  He asked  What happened to the children  Do you mean you spent a billion dollars    and you don t know whether they can read or not     Half a century after Brown v  Board of Education  were still fighting for the basic right of a good education for every child  Were still fighting against the factors that relegate many of our poorest minority students to underperforming and still largely segregated schools  There is no place for separate but equal education in America  We cant afford to let housing patterns and other factors lead to high concentrations of low income and minority students in certain school districts  As we act on education  we cant ignore the obvious fact that our battle is more difficult because of the many ways in which race and poverty still matter in America      Education will be as important to the next phase of the civil rights struggle as it was in the last  We cannot rest until we get it right  We need to put meaning into the Acts promise that no child will be left behind     For this Democratic Congress  its a commitment we intend to keep      I commend the Congressional Black Caucus for its leadership on this and so many other issues  Your efforts in making this nation stronger  fairer  and more inclusive are invaluable not only for African Americans  but for all Americans  Youve made a huge difference  and I know youll keep up the great work  Thank you for all you do so well to make America America           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
