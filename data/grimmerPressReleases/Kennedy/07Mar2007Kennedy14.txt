         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in New Bedford further  highlight the immediate need for reform of our broken immigration system   We  need to hold businesses accountable for the status and treatment of workers they  hire   And the best way to end the exploitation of undocumented workers is to  put them on a path to earn legal status   I am deeply disturbed that dozens of  young children may have been left stranded after the arrest of their parents  If  we work together  we can end this worsening immigration crisis for our economy  and our security   Now is the time   With President Bush as a genuine partner   we can pass a tough  but fair immigration plan that protects our borders   upholds our values  strengthens our economy  respects our laws and enhances our  prosperity   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
