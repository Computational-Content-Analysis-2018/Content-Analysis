         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   In a few weeks  many of us will travel home to join our loved ones for a Thanksgiving meal that celebrates family  community  and our gratitude for the bounty that God has bestowed on our nation  We too often take it for granted that the food we eat is safe and free from dangerous contamination  Recent outbreaks of E  coli and Salmonella have shown all too clearly that network of protections we count on to protect us from deadly foodborne illness is a frayed and inadequate patchwork   These outbreaks are examples of a wider problem with food safety  According to the CDC  there are 76 million cases of foodborne illness every year  Most of them result only in mild symptoms  but diseases caused by contaminated food cause over 325 000 hospitalizations and 5 000 deaths every year  which means that an average of 13 Americans die from a foodborne illness every day  A few weeks ago  spinach contaminated with a deadly strain of E  coli made its way from farms in California into the food supply  and quickly spread to 26 states  When the outbreak was finally over  204 individuals were infected  102 were hospitalized  and 3 died  The deaths of a two year old boy in Idaho and two elderly women in Wisconsin and Nebraska highlight the special vulnerability of children and seniors to these illnesses   Many dedicated professionals in local  state and federal health agencies worked hard to respond to these outbreaks  but responding to an outbreak means that the battle is already lost  We need to learn what must be done to prevent these outbreaks from occurring in the first place  In November 2005  months before the recent outbreak    FDA had sent a letter to California vegetable firms outlining serious concerns with the continuing outbreaks of foodborne illnesses associated with the consumption of fresh and fresh cut lettuce and other leafy greens  That November letter wasnt even the first warning by FDA  It reiterated concerns in a letter nine months earlier  Despite these repeated warnings  corrective actions were not taken to prevent the subsequent outbreak  Obviously  we need to strengthen our approach to food safety  The questions are many  Does FDA need additional authority to take action when problems are identified  Does it have the authority but lack the resources to take action  Is coordination adequate among federal agencies  and between federal and state agencies  so that prompt action can be taken when problems are detected  Not every outbreak is foreseeable or preventable  But when there are persistent problems that have not been corrected  it is the responsibility of Congress to set things right  and thats he purpose of this hearing  Well also hear today from representatives of firms with new technologies to improve food safety  through better detection of contamination and better ways to trace the flow of food products from farm to table  I look forward to their testimony  and to the testimony of representatives from our federal and state health agencies  Were all partners in the effort to see that the food that American families eat is safe from contamination and danger     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
