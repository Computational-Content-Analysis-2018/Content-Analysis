         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  We all know that when a loved one faces a grave illness or serious injury  we would do everything we can to get them the care they need  There nothing more precious to us than our loved ones  And we would do whatever we can to save their lives  Take out a second mortgage  Cash in our savings  Max out our credit cards  Anything to make them whole and bring them back again   Under this bill  if your medical bills force you into bankruptcy  the banks and credit card companies can take away everything you own    even your home  You may recover from your illness or injury  but you may never recover what you ve worked so hard to attain over a lifetime  The credit card companies don t care if you get sick  as long as they get their money back  with interest  And this bill lets them take it all   The money you saved to put your children through college    gone  The years of faithfully paying the mortgage on your home    gone  The little nest egg you put aside for your daughter s wedding    gone  The investments for your retirement    gone  Your dignity and standing in the community    also gone   This bill does everything wrong to good middle class families who ve done everything right  They have worked hard  played by the rules  earned a good salary  saved their money  even purchased health insurance    only to find that s not enough   As health costs continue to skyrocket  it s no surprise that more and more of our fellow citizens are facing bankruptcy  In fact  in more than half of all bankruptcy filings today  medical expenses were the major factor  affecting more than two million Americans  Among those who cited illness as a cause of bankruptcy  their average un reimbursed medical costs were nearly  12 000  even though more than three quarters had health insurance  The average for a cancer patient is  35 000  That s  35 000 out of your pocket in expenses that are not covered by health insurance   A recent study found that these families did everything they could to pay these medical bills and avoid bankruptcy  One in five went without food  One third had their electricity shut off  Half lost their phone service  One in five were forced to move  And many more went without needed health care or couldn t fill a needed prescription  And 7 percent actually had to move an elderly relative to a less expensive nursing home   More than three quarters of medical bankruptcy filers had health insurance coverage at the onset of their illness  Many could not afford to keep it due to the financial hardships they faced after the onset of their illness  Others lost their jobs after they were no longer able to work  and with it the health insurance they got through their job   These are not irresponsible spendthrifts  They are middle class Americans with a serious illness or injury  They have had the misfortune to face large doctor and hospital bills that insurance didn t cover  They have had the misfortune to be unable to return to work after suffering medical problems  They went to bankruptcy court because of cancer  stroke  diabetes  and heart attacks  Yet the bill treats them exactly the same as their neighbor who filed for bankruptcy because he went on a spending spree at the mall   The number of families forced into bankruptcy because of medical hardships has soared over the years  Over the past 20 years  medical bankruptcies increased by 2200 percent  Over the past decade  the number of older Americans filing for bankruptcy has tripled  with many of the seniors forced into bankruptcy because of the high cost of health care and prescription drugs   The current health system is badly broken and those who have become its victims are often forced into bankruptcy  This bill would tilt that bankruptcy process in favor of the credit card industry and against those it should help    medically distressed families   It is no surprise that the number of families forced into medical bankruptcies is soaring  One only needs to look at our health system  Forty five million Americans have no insurance at all  Even more    as many as one in three     lack health insurance at some point in the year  as health insurance costs have increased 59  over the past four years   The average employer based family health policy now costs almost  10 000  putting health coverage beyond the reach of many middle class working families  And that s the average cost  Those families forced to buy health insurance on their own    because their employers don t provide it    usually have to pay much more  Those with health problems may pay double or triple the average cost  If a family member has already had medical problems  chances are that they may not be able to find health insurance at any cost   Under this bill  they would be penalized twice    once by the failure of the health care system and a second time by the harshness of the proposed new bankruptcy laws   The sponsors of this bill have said it is intended to stop abuses of the bankruptcy system by spendthrifts who run up debt that they know they will never be able to pay  Yet this bill makes no distinction between those forced into bankruptcy following the financial devastation of a serious illness or injury  and those who actually really are abusing the system  The provisions of this bill apply equally to a single mother who is no longer able to work because she is undergoing intensive treatment for breast cancer and a young adult who went on a spending spree at the mall  The bill applies equally to a father who suffered a massive heart attack that kept him out of work for months  and to Enron s Kenneth Lay   The victims of this bill are people like April Wetherell  a 50 year old woman from Toms River  New Jersey  who went back to school after having children and received her Masters in Social Work at Fordham University  She was working as a social worker at a visiting nurse agency in 2003 when she suffered a stroke while recovering from knee surgery  The stroke left her unable to speak  work  or care for her own needs  At the time of her stroke  April still owed about  25 000 in student loans  She had been making payments on her student loans until her illness left her unable to return to her job  Although April had health insurance  it didn t cover all her medical costs  and she was left with more than  20 000 in unpaid medical bills  At the time of her stroke  April had about  7 000 in credit card debt  which she had been paying off on a timely basis  Even though she had done all the right things    going back to school for her Masters degree  working hard in her chosen field  paying for health insurance  and paying her student loans and credit card bills timely  April was forced into bankruptcy after having the misfortune to be struck unexpectedly by a serious  incapacitating illness   People like Walton Pinkney of Frederick  Maryland  an electrician who had worked in his field for more than 10 years  Walton switched jobs in 2000  and his new employer did not provide health benefits for the first 90 days of employment  Walton had the misfortune to collapse with heart failure during his first month at his new job  Because his new health benefits had not yet taken effect  he was responsible for the more than  45 000 in medical expenses related to his heart condition  Although he attempted to return to work  his employer decided that his health was too poor for him to continue to work as an electrician  Faced with large medical bills he could not pay after he lost his job  Walton finally had to file for bankruptcy in 2003   People like Zoraya Marrero  a single mother with three children from Woodbridge  Virginia  Her oldest child suffers from spina bifida  While living in Massachusetts  Zoraya received disability benefits and medical coverage for her child due to the illness  After moving to Virginia in 2000  she learned that not only did she no longer qualify for benefits  she had to pay back  60 000 for benefits she d already received  Zoraya has been fighting the  60 000 claim and paying her own medical expenses while working in a doctors office  She can t afford private insurance  and can t afford to pay for her son s costly medical care  Zoraya recently filed for bankruptcy   People like April Wetherall  Walton Pinkney  and Zoraya Marrero do not seek relief in the bankruptcy courts willingly  They and millions of other Americans in similar situations have filed for bankruptcy only after exhausting all other options   And you can expect the number of medically distressed debtors to grow  Administration policies have only added to the number of uninsured and underinsured Americans  Since the President took office  the number of uninsured has been growing by about 1 million Americans a year  And the Administration s current health proposals will only add to the soaring number of Americans with unsustainable medical debt  Their promotion of high deductible health plans will leave more and more families underinsured   The high deductible health plans that this President and many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle promote so vehemently will lead to more and more medical debt  Although families may be forced into bankruptcy with medical debt as low as  1 000  high deductible plans used in conjunction with a health savings account may have deductibles as high as  5 000 for an individual or  10 000 for a family  These families may incur significant  often life changing medical debt that can force them into bankruptcy before they have even one dollar of reimbursable health costs   The fastest growing group of bankruptcy filers is individuals 55 and older  and they overwhelmingly cite medical or job problems as the reason  More than 50 percent of those 65 and older are driven to bankruptcy by medical debts they cannot pay  Those who are aged 55 to 65 may be forced to retire early because they are no longer physically capable of working  and often can t find health insurance at any cost  If they can find a company that will sell them a plan  they often face premiums of twenty thousand dollars or more  high cost sharing  and coverage exclusions for the very health conditions they need help with the most  They are the ones with the greatest need of medical treatment and prescription drugs   Even those over 65 on Medicare have large coverage gaps that leave them at risk  Although Congress passed a Medicare prescription drug in 2003 that is set to take effect next January  too much of the money will go to enlarge the profits of HMOs and drug companies at the expense of those who most need prescription drugs  Senior citizens will still be left with large coverage gaps    large enough to force over the edge into bankruptcy  And the bill failed to give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the ability to negotiate for fair and affordable drug prices  I will be supporting an amendment to correct that failure later this week   Medicare is also becoming less and less affordable  The rising Part B premiums which seniors must pay are rising much faster than the cost of living  Last year saw the largest Part B premium ever  eating away at the social security that is the only income for many senior citizens  And you can expect the Medicare Part D premiums to rise even faster   All these Americans are losing bankruptcy protections in this bill   I will be offering two amendments that will protect families with high medical costs from this bill s draconian provisions  These families have more than met the test of taking personal responsibility and doing the right thing  Now we have a moral obligation to provide solutions that are fair and compassionate  They deserve to be given the opportunity for a fresh start  They have already suffered greatly from their medical situation and from the deprivations they experienced trying to avoid bankruptcy   My first amendment will exempt those families facing bankruptcy due to serious medical hardship from also facing the burdensome means test  If the goal of this bill is truly to stop consumer abuses of bankruptcy  we ought to provide a safe harbor for those families that have been forced into bankruptcy through no fault of their own   If the goal of the bill is truly to force those individuals who run up bills irresponsibly to take greater personal responsibility  then we should exempt medically distressed families  These families didn t lack personal responsibility    they did everything they could to avoid bankruptcy  They were forced to take on debt because of their misfortune to become sick and because of the broken health care system   Since those who are in bankruptcy in the aftermath of medical hardship are clearly not the type of debtor the sponsors of this bill say they are trying to address  my amendment provides a safe harbor from the means test for these families  It would exempt medically distressed debtors whose substantial medical expenses have caused financial hardship and forced them to file bankruptcy   The amendment sets a high bar to qualify for relief as a medically distressed debtor  It defines their financial hardship as one of the following  being out of work for a month or more due to illness or injury  unreimbursed medical costs totaling 25 percent of income  or unreimbursed medical costs totaling  10 000 within a 12 month period  Those families falling within this definition have experienced significant hardship resulting from their medical problems  and we need to give them a chance to get back on their feet  They deserve to be given the chance to make a fresh start  A specific exemption from the application of the means test will give them a fighting chance   My second health amendment says if you get seriously ill or injured  you should not lose your home  It will provide a minimum homestead exemption of  150 000 for medically distressed bankruptcy filers  Families who face insurmountable debt following serious medical problems often must give up their homes in order to obtain relief from their debts  That is wrong  A family should not have to lose its home to obtain relief from debts caused by serious medical problems  These families should not be forced to choose between relief from debt and losing their modest home   But in nearly half of all States  the homestead exemption is less than  25 000  Several States have no homestead exemption at all  In contrast  a few States provide unlimited homestead exemptions  allowing debtors who have not necessarily played by the rules to shelter millions of dollars  At least for those debtors who are in bankruptcy court due to serious illness or injury  we need a more rational system  There needs to be a minimum level of homestead protection for these medically distressed debtors to give them a chance to keep their modest family home   The amount of equity a homeowner can protect in bankruptcy in most States has not kept up with rising home prices  While the value of even modest homes climbs in many areas of the country  the homestead protection afforded families does not  leaving even people of very modest means with the choice between their home or discharging medical debt  That is a choice we should not force these families that are down on their luck to make   The lack of a minimum homestead exemption falls particularly hard on elderly and disabled homeowners who often live on nothing but their monthly social security benefits  With incomes of  800 to  1 000 a month  they may be able to maintain their home because the mortgage was paid off years ago  They should not be forced to sell that home because of unpaid medical bills  We owe them better treatment   It is particularly unjust to allow those who truly are abusing the bankruptcy system to shelter millions of dollars in Texas or Florida  while forcing a family that is bankrupt because of medical hardship to sell their modest home because they happen to live in a State without a homestead exemption   This amendment will give these homeowners a fighting chance to maintain their modest family home and hopefully get back on their feet   Slamming shut the door to bankruptcy relief for those facing high medical expenses or the inability to work because of their medical condition would be shameful  These amendments will provide families struggling to overcome large medical debts the chance they deserve for a fresh start   Laura Capps
