         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC Today  Senators Edward M  Kennedy and Richard Durbin sent the following letter to Attorney General Gonzales following up on allegations that the Judiciary Committee has received that the process for selecting candidates to interview for career attorney and summer intern positions at the Department of Justice has been infected by partisan and ideological concerns  As the letter indicates  the allegations suggest that the Deputy Attorney Generals office has been rejecting interview candidates based on internet searches demonstrating that the candidates had worked for Democrats  the wrong judges  or groups advocating liberal policies  The letter asks the Attorney General to respond in detail to the allegations  If true  these allegations  coming in the midst of the U S  Attorney scandal  further erode confidence in the fair and impartial administration of justice by this Administration  Below is the text of the letter  A PDF version is available upon request   April 27  2007Attorney General Alberto GonzalesUnited States Department of JusticeWashington  D C Dear Attorney General Gonzales  Last week  a letter sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee by a group of Department of Justice employees contained serious allegations that partisan politics has tainted the process for selecting candidates for interviews for the Departments Honors Program and the Summer Law Intern Program  If the allegations are accurate  they further erode the confidence of Congress and the American people in the fair and impartial administration of justice by the Department  We  therefore  ask that you respond promptly to the information in the letter  The letter states that there has been a change in the longstanding procedure by which candidates are selected for interviews by the Department for the Honors Program and The Intern Program  Traditionally  each division of the Department has been given substantial autonomy to decide which candidates to interview for these programs  According to the letter   t his year the divisions once again pored over applications and resumes  choosing students to interview who demonstrated not only excellent grades but a real interest in the areas of law the Department enforced  The letter states  however  that all interviews must now be approved by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General  In the most recent round of hiring  that office rejected many interview requests  and some sections were left without enough interviewees to fill all of their vacancies  Honors graduates from top law schools were among those removed from the list  Supervisors from the affected units obtained a meeting with Michael Elston  Chief of Staff to the Deputy Attorney General  at which they were told that candidates had been stricken from the interview list because of inappropriate information about them on the internet  He explained that he had a screening panel perform internet searches  but refused to identify who served on the panel or the nature of the inappropriate material  According to the letter  most of those struck from the list had interned for a Hill Democrat  clerked for a Democratic judge  worked for a liberal cause or otherwise appeared to have liberal leanings  Unfortunately  these allegations come on the heels of the ongoing scandal over the firing of eight U S  Attorneys and prior reports that the Departments hiring of career attorneys in recent years has changed dramatically to reflect reliance on ideology and partisan affiliation  An analysis of hires in the Civil Rights Division showed a substantial decline in hires who had prior civil rights experience but an increase in hires whose resumes showed affiliation with the Republican Party  membership in groups promoting conservative causes  and the Federalist Society  Because the American people must be assured that their Department of Justice enforces the law fairly and impartially  we ask that you respond to the following questions and requests for information 1  Is it true that requests to interview candidates for the Honors Program and The Intern Progarm must be approved by the Deputy Attorney Generals office and  if so  when was that requirement instituted  Please provide all written communication discussing this change in procedure  2  Has the Department in fact used a screening panel to review applications for the Honors Program and Intern Program after the divisions make their recommendations about whom to interview  If so  please describe the panels

recent round of hiring for these programs  fall 2006   how many requests for interviews were submitted to the Deputy Attorney Generals office for approval  How many were rejected  Please provide a list of the submitted requests and a list of the requests that the Deputy Attorney Generals office rejected  Please also provide the resume of each candidate for an interview whose name was submitted to the Deputy Attorney Generals office  Please identify the resumes of candidates who were not approved for interviews by the Deputy Attorney Generals office  4  Did a meeting take place on or about December 5  2006 between Michael Elston and Department employees to discuss the refusal to grant interviews to candidates forwarded by offices of the Department  5  Who attended the meeting  Please provide the name and position of each participant  6  Please provide all e mail or other written communication regarding the meeting  7  Were internet searches conducted regarding the applicants for interviews  If so  who conducted the searches  Please describe the manner in which these searches were undertaken and the scope of the searches  8  Please provide any written summaries or reports about the searches  including any statements on the results of the searches  9  Were applicants rejected  in whole or in part  because information about them on the internet was considered inappropriate  If so  please set forth in detail the Departments criteria for deciding what information should be used to disqualify a candidate  and specify whether such criteria included membership or affiliation with Democratic or liberal organizations  Please state as well who established the criteria used for selecting candidates for hire through the Honors Program and The Intern Program  Please provide any documents reflecting those criteria  10  Were members of any screening panel that reviewed applications for either Mr  Elston or the Deputy Attorney General provided clear  uniform criteria for reviewing applications for the Honors Program and The Intern Program  If not  why not  If so  please list those criteria  and provide any documents reflecting those criteria  11  If the Department had no uniform criteria for determining what information would be used to disqualify candidates for the Honors Program and The Intern Program  please list each person involved in the process of determining which candidates to interview  and the criteria that each used to determine whether a particular candidate should be hired  Please state whether any of these persons considered membership in Democratic or liberal organizations when selecting candidates to be interviewed   12  Does the Deputy Attorney Generals office review requests to interview candidates for Assistant United States Attorney positions  13  What role does the Executive Office of U S  Attorneys have in hiring Assistant U S  Attorneys  In particular  does the office review interview requests from interim or acting U S  Attorneys  Does it review requests from interim or acting U S  Attorneys to hire Assistant U S  Attorneys  14  Did Mr  Elston or any other political appointee consider partisan political affiliations or membership in either conservative or liberal organizations as part of the process for reviewing applications  Thank you for your response   Sincerely Edward M  Kennedy
