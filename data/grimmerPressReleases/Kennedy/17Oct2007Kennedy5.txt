         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today  the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin hearings on the nomination of Michael Mukasey to be the Attorney General of the United States      The nomination comes at a critical time  The next Attorney General will make decisions on issues of vital importance to all Americans  The nation faces challenges on national security  civil rights and civil liberties  criminal justice  immigration  and many other pressing topics  Unfortunately  the Department has failed to meet these challenges under this Administration  Instead  as the scandal over the firing of U S  Attorneys has shown  the Department has spent the past few years playing politics with the rule of law  and the nations interests have suffered as a result      The next Attorney General will face enormous challenges in restoring the rule of law in both the Department of Justice and the Administration  Every member of the Senate  and especially members of the Judiciary Committee  has a duty to ask thorough questions about how these challenges will be addressed     The next Attorney General must have the independence necessary to put law above politics and to work openly and effectively with Congress  The nation is best served by cooperation between Congress and the Department on the pressing issues of the day  especially in areas such as criminal justice  civil rights enforcement  and the fight against terrorism      History provides a model  In 1976  we had a Democratic Congress and a Republican President  and Attorney General Ed Levi worked with Congress to develop a surveillance law that protects both our national security and our civil liberties  He understood the need for Congress and the Executive Branch to work together to serve the American people  Members of the Judiciary Committee were invited to the Department of Justice at least four times to meet on the legislation  As a result of that cooperation  I introduced the first FISA bill in 1976  and two years later the final bill passed the Senate by an overwhelming margin of 95 to 1  Both Congress and the American people greatly valued this constructive approach  and I hope that the next Attorney General will take Mr  Levis bipartisan cooperation as a model for working with Congress      It is equally important for the next Attorney General to take urgent steps to end the influence of partisanship in the Departments law enforcement decisions  Our Committees investigation of the U S  Attorney firings found a Department deeply infected by partisan decision making  and its taken a severe toll on the Departments standing in the eyes of the courts  the Congress  the American people  and the world  To restore its reputation  there must be a full accounting of the problems  and a genuine effort to right the wrongs  including remedies for those who suffered because of personnel decisions improperly based on politics      It also appears that changes in the Attorney Generals Honors Program have allowed partisanship and ideology to trump quality in the Departments hiring decisions  The next Attorney General will need to change that as well     The politics first attitude of the Department has done immense damage  but perhaps nowhere as much as in civil rights enforcement  Civil rights is still the nations unfinished business  Although the civil rights challenges of this century are different from those of the last  we still need a strong  active Civil Rights Division  The next Attorney General must move quickly to ensure that the Civil Rights Division once again fulfills its role as the guardian of civil rights  This Administration has allowed partisan considerations to trump the rule of law  both in litigation and in personnel matters  The recommendations of career attorneys who had served the Division well for many years have recently been overruled in circumstances that strongly suggest political motivation  Free communication between the Divisions career professionals and its political appointees has been chilled by fear of retaliation  A former official in the Division admitted to our Committee that he bragged about hiring Republicans for career civil service positions  even though federal law clearly prohibits a partisan litmus test for career Department positions  These events have tarnished the high reputation of a Division that has opened the doors of opportunity for Americans and helped bring Jim Crow to his knees  The next Attorney General must have a serious and specific plan for getting the Civil Rights Division back on track     Whoever is confirmed to lead the Department of Justice also must undertake fundamental reforms in the Office of Legal Counsel  Too often in this Administration  important decisions apparently were issued without the necessary review at the highest levels of the Department or by other affected agencies      A number of us in the Senate have long been concerned that many of these opinions were not legally sound and have led us in the wrong direction  They formed the basis for abuse of detainees  They allowed the President to conclude that America doesnt always have to comply with the Geneva Conventions  and that we can try detainees in poorly conceived military commissions      As a result  weve been shamed in the eyes of the world and have failed in our efforts to bring terrorists to justice  Six years after 9 11  we have not tried and convicted a single detainee through a military commission  These defective legal opinions have harmed our national security  Under Attorney General Janet Reno  the Office of Legal Counsel had a presumption favoring public disclosure of its opinions  so that citizens and lawmakers could stay informed and faulty opinions could be exposed  The Department should return to that policy     I also believe the Attorney General needs to take an active role to ensure that the federal government is doing its part to assist state and local law enforcement in combating violent crime  Violent crime rates had been falling since 1992  but theyve now risen again for the second year in a row  The trend is disturbing  and the Attorney General needs to work with Congress to reach the proper balance between prevention and punishment     For some time  Ive also been concerned about the rise in gun crimes across the country  Each year  30 000 Americans are killed by gun violence  destroying families and harming whole communities  A recent report by the International Association of Chiefs of Police made 39 recommendations to the Administration and Congress for reducing crime and protecting the safety of police officers and all Americans  Its a call to action  and I hope the next Attorney General will work with us in Congress  across party lines  to do everything we can to make our communities safer      In addition  we need to be more certain that the death penalty is being applied fairly and without discrimination  We know that mistakes happen in the system  the number of exonerations in the past decade is clear evidence of that      The Department recently issued a controversial set of regulations for federal courts on death penalty appeals  They give the Attorney General the power to certify states for special  fast track procedures  If these regulations are implemented  it would lead to protracted litigation and public outrage  and further undermine our commitment to the rule of law  The views of the next Attorney General on this matter are critical given the high stakes in these cases     The next Attorney General can also do much to set the tone for the treatment of immigrants  The Department of Justice ultimately determines the legal status of individuals who appear before the Immigration Judges  who submit appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals  which may then be certified for the Attorney Generals review  Those decisions can have a life or death impact on immigrants  and the Attorney Generals enforcement priorities can have a dramatic effect on the immigration debate  Aggressive enforcement of laws prohibiting discrimination against individuals based on their nationality or ethnic background and equally aggressive action against unconstitutional state and local laws on immigration should be a high priority      Unfortunately  the heavily politicized appointment of immigration judges under Attorney General Gonzales has shaken the confidence of the American people in the fairness of our immigration laws  Immediate attention to this problem is essential to restore the integrity of our immigration courts     I look forward to learning more about Judge Mukaseys views on these issues  which are of such pressing importance to our country          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
