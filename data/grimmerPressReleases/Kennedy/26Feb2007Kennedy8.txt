         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      As  prepared for delivery     This  hearing focuses on the need for FDA regulation of tobacco products  the most  lethal of all consumer products  Used as intended by the companies that  manufacture and market them  cigarettes will kill one out of every three  smokers  Yet  the federal agency most responsible for protecting the public  health is currently powerless to deal with the enormous risks of tobacco use   Public health experts overwhelmingly believe the passage of S  625  bipartisan  legislation that will at long last give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco  products  is the most important action Congress can take to protect children  from this deadly addiction  If Congress fails to act and smoking continues at  its current rate  more than six million of todays children will ultimately die  from tobacco induced disease  Smoking is the number one  preventable cause of death in America  Nationally  cigarettes kill well over  four hundred thousand people each year  That is more lives lost than from  automobile accidents  alcohol abuse  illegal drugs  AIDS  murder  and suicide  combined  Congress cannot continue to ignore a public health problem of this  magnitude  Giving FDA authority over  tobacco products will not make the tragic toll of tobacco use disappear  overnight  More than forty million people are hooked on this highly addictive  product and many of them have been unable to quit despite repeated attempts   However  FDA action can play a major role in breaking the gruesome cycle that  seduces millions of teenagers into a lifetime of addiction and premature death   What can FDA  regulation accomplish   It can reduce youth smoking  by preventing tobacco advertising which targets children   It can help prevent the  sale of tobacco products to minors    It can stop the tobacco industry from  continuing to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking   It can help smokers  overcome their addiction   It can make tobacco products less toxic and less  addictive for those who continue to use them    And it can prohibit unsubstantiated  health claims about supposedly reduced risk products   Regulating the  conduct of the tobacco companies is as necessary today as it has been in years  past  The facts presented in the federal governments landmark lawsuit against  the tobacco industry conclusively demonstrate that the misconduct is substantial  and ongoing  The decision of the Court states  The evidence in this case  clearly establishes that Defendants have not ceased engaging in unlawful  activityDefendants continue to engage in conduct that is materially  indistinguishable from their previous actions  activity that continues to this  day  Only strong FDA regulation can force the necessary change in their  corporate behavior  We must deal firmly with tobacco company  marketing practices that target children and mislead the public  The tobacco  industry currently spends over fifteen billion dollars each year to promote its  products  Much of that money is spent in ways designed to tempt children to  start smoking  before they are mature enough to appreciate the enormity of the  health risk  The industry knows that nearly 90  of smokers begin as children and  are addicted by the time they reach adulthood  If we are  serious about reducing youth smoking  FDA must have the power to prevent  industry advertising designed to appeal to children wherever it will be seen by  children  This legislation will give FDA the authority to stop tobacco  advertising that glamorizes smoking to kids  FDA authority  must extend to the sale of tobacco products as well to ensure that children  under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes  The tobacco industry has a long   dishonorable history of providing misleading information about the health  consequences of smoking  FDA must have clear and unambiguous authority to  prevent such misrepresentations in the future  The largest disinformation  campaign in the history of the corporate world must  end  The nicotine in  cigarettes is highly addictive  Medical experts say that it is as addictive as  heroin or cocaine  Yet for decades  while tobacco companies were publicly  denying the addictiveness of their products  they were actually chemically  manipulating the nicotine in them to make it even more addictive  A newly  released analysis by the Harvard School of Public Health demonstrates that  cigarette manufacturers are still manipulating nicotine levels  Between 1998 and  2005  they significantly increased the nicotine yield from major brand  cigarettes  FDA must have the power to  take the necessary steps to help addicted smokers overcome their addiction  and  to make the product less toxic for smokers who are unable or unwilling to stop   This legislation will also require manufacturers to  submit reduced risk products to the FDA for analysis before they can be  marketed  No health related claims will be permitted until they have been  verified to the FDAs satisfaction  These safeguards are essential to prevent  deceptive industry marketing campaigns  which could lull the public into a false  sense of health safety  Enacting this  bill this year is the right thing to do for Americas children  They are  depending on us  By passing this legislation  we can help them live longer   healthier
