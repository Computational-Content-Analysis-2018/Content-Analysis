         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  SAKSON  Call the Subcommittee on Workforce Protection hearing    convene the hearing and we ll get started  We have members    Ranking Member Murray is on the way  Senator Kennedy is going to be here  but he is on the floor in the middle of a debate right now  Senator Burr is also coming  So they ll be coming in and join us  but I want to be prompt in beginning  And I ll start with my opening statement  And hopefully with me starting that  then others will come in  We ll recognize them before we hear from our distinguished panelists  I d like to start by saying this  I was a member of the Georgia National Guard for six years  I ran a company for 22 years and employed guardsmen and reservists  And now I ve served the United States Senate and the United States House and voted to commit our young men and women in the reserve to defend freedom around the world  There is nothing more important to us as a nation than a ready reserve that is ready  that is trained and is staffed to do the jobs we would never anticipate doing  There is not a one of us that would ve guessed that 9 11 2001 would have ever happened or that within months after that we d have guardsmen and reservists deployed in Afghanistan  Iraq  and around the world  The companies that are here today  and those that are here in support of our men and women are real heroes to me  We re going to hear from four companies that go above and beyond the call of duty in the support of their employees who are members of the Reserve and the Guard  The purpose for the hearing is to really focus the light of day and shine the light    the spotlight    on these great companies and what they ve done  It s critical that we continue in this difficult world of ours to have the best trained  best equipped  best staffed Reserve and Guard anywhere in the world  Because of the employers that we have  we have that  and today I m proud to commend them to all of you  Given their vital role employees play  the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve  or ESGR  was established in 1972 to promote cooperation between reservists and their civilian employers and to help resolve any conflicts that may arise due to employee s military commitment  Today we are very pleased to have Bob Hollingsworth here today  who is the executive director of that distinguished committee  The USERRA act  which was passed by the federal government in 1994  requires minimum requirements of American business  not to discriminate in the hiring of guardsmen and reservists  and to ensure that they have a job waiting when their deployment is complete  But I am pleased to report that thousands upon thousands of employers like the four represented here today go well above and beyond that call of duty  Many employers voluntarily offer differential pay to their activated employees  These are payments that represent the difference in the wages they earn and what they would have earned  In addition  many continue to extend health benefits to the deployed family employees and their family members  Beyond even this  we ll hear how some employers take the extra step to show how much they appreciate the devotion of their employees  We re happy to have with us today two such corporate role models  including one from my home state of Georgia  and we welcome Dennis Donovan of the Home Depot  and Christine Bierman from Colt Safety Fire  Rescue  based in St  Louis  Missouri  I also understand the importance of re employing veterans once back from their tour of duty  and I welcome Lisa Nisenfeld from the Southwest Washington Workforce Development Council to speak to us today on the efforts that are done in that area  We  in Congress  must always be looking for more ways to foster the important relationship between reservists and employers  Numerous bills introduced in this Congress take different approaches to this end  I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses today on the importance of the contribution they make to our Reserve and Guard  On a closing comment in my opening statement  I d just like to add that this morning  ironically  I spent three hours at Walter Reed Hospital with members of the 48th Brigade who are back from Iraq going through physical therapy and rehabilitation from the limbs they lost in defense of our country and in defense of freedom  Ironically  three of those I visited were guardsmen from Georgia  all of whom talked of how proud they were to serve the country and how much they were looking forward to going back to their employers  Having no idea that I would be conducting this hearing this afternoon  two of them talked specifically about their employer and about how much their support had meant to their families while they were deployed in Iraq  This is the story we want to hear in the Congress  These are the companies we want to brag about today  And I thank all of our guests who are testifying for their testimony  And I introduce the distinguished ranking member  Mrs  Murray MURRAY  Well  thank you very much  Mr  Chairman  And I want to thank you for hosting today s hearing on this really critically important issue to the men and women who are serving us in the Guard and Reserve  I want to start by saying that our Guard and Reserve members are playing an extremely important role for our country every day  Iraq  Afghanistan  now Louisiana  Mississippi  Alabama  communities across the United States  And I want to take a moment here to thank all of them for their tremendous service  Guard and Reserve employment is an important issue that our committee must focus on  Although we have had some successes  it s clear that we re not providing our Guard and Reserve members all of the resources they need to access and maintain employment once they are separated from active duty  I want to extend a special thanks as well to our panelists who are here today  Lisa Nisenfeld  who is the executive director of the Southwest Washington Workforce Development  comes from my home state in Vancouver  Washington  I was with her last week talking about these issues  I know from firsthand experience that Lisa is one of the workforce stars in our state  and under her leadership workforce programs in the region have more than doubled their positive outcomes and  in fact  have become a key economic development resource for growing companies  Mr  Chairman  I have been working with Guard and Reserve members throughout my 13 years here in the United States Senate  and I know the issues facing them have never been as severe as they are today  The system simply doesn t work well enough and is not adjusted for the up tempo military model where our Guard and Reserve members make up 40 percent of our troops in Iraq  Guard and Reserve members are doing the jobs of active duty but they are getting few of the benefits  One of the Guard members I recently talked to told me that the mindset of Guard members was that the VA was for their fathers  not for them  We have to cut through those kinds of misunderstandings and show our Guard and Reserve members what benefits they have earned and deserve  The return of so many OIF and OEF veterans has made veterans employment assistance even more important  Since 2001  we have had over 1 million troops serving us in Iraq and Afghanistan  Now  although the Department of Defense provides services for the active duty components  the Guard and Reserve face some major reintegration hurdles  Over the past six months  I have met with many of these veterans  especially our Guard and Reserve members in Washington state  and many of them have talked to me about the difficulty accessing employment assistance once they have been demobilized  Time and time again  I have sat down with veterans who tell me stories about struggling to get caught up at work after their deployment  about having difficulty getting education benefits  or they re struggling to find a job to support their families when they return  I have to tell you  Mr  Chairman  those stories really frustrate me  Last week  in fact  I was with Lisa and we had three Guard members with us who returned last March  and they still    not one of them have been employed yet  and it s six months after they ve returned  and they are now days away from losing their unemployment insurance  Other Guard members have spoken with me and tell me about getting behind at their jobs or not knowing how and where to get the training they need  Others have told me that they have no idea that employment services were even available and that USERRA protected their rights to get back to their old jobs  Others have told me about employers who were nervous about hiring Guard members since they might have medical injuries or issues caused by injuries or they may be deployed again in just a few months  One Guard member in a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing testified to us that he lost his business because FDA programs intended to help small business owners and the self employed didn t work with the realities of mobilization  I ve also heard about the Transition Assistance Program  the TAP program  that it doesn t work well for the two week time frame Guard members are given to separate and it s too focused on the needs of traditional forces  And a finding that we recently got from our May GAO report confirmed what I ve heard on the ground out there  Now  often when people think of veterans services  they often just think of the V A  health care system  However  we need to let people know that there are a large amount of services that are available to our veterans for benefits and they include employment assistance  That means there are considerable resources available to help our veterans meet the employment challenges they face  and I hope that at today s hearing we will hear from our panelists about what s working  what s not  and where we need to make the changes necessary to improve these services  Last August  Mr  Chairman  at a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing  General Lowenberg  who is the adjutant general of the Washington National Guard  said that he felt many Department of Defense programs don t work for our Guard and Reserve members  He said that services provided by the Defense Department and the V A  should be revised to fit the nature of a military now heavily dependent on Guard and Reserve members  The Department of Defense estimates  in fact  that 68 percent of separating service members attended the full TAP seminars  but only 35 percent of our Guard and Reserve members attend  I hope we hear from our panelists today on what we can do to provide resources to help veterans and employers  I think it s clear that Congress needs to look at many programs and services  including interpersonal and life skills training  readjustment counseling  V A  briefings and workshops that are presented before the members  active duty tour ends  and training sessions and workshops that continue for up to a year after a Guard and Reserve member s release from active duty  We have got to find some innovative ways of educating our veterans about the many federal and state benefits to which they are entitled along with the growing number of services that are provided by private  nonprofit  public service organizations  and I want to hear the panel address the how those and other services may or may not be working for traditional active duty members as well as for our Guard and Reserve members  We need to update our resources  The Cold War is over  yet we are holding onto programs that were built for veterans of that era  The Department of Defense  the V A   the Department of Labor  and others need to look at how we can get the right services to veterans today  We should provide improved services to our Guard and Reserve members after they have separated  whether it s three months or six months or a year later  We have to update the TAP program to work within the realities of what Guard and Reserve members are going through today  We should improve the Labor VETS Program by expanding its outreach efforts with creative initiatives designed to improve employment and training services for our Guard and Reserve members  We should place a priority on identifying military occupations that require licenses or certification or credentials at the local  state and national levels  And we should provide programs and funding that truly help our Guard and Reserve members who run small businesses or are self  employed as they manage that transition  Mr  Chairman  I have said many times I believe how we treat our veterans when they come home is an important indication of the character of our nation  That s why I think it s important for this subcommittee to look for ways to make the transition to work and home life smoother and easier for our service members and for their families  So I hope that with today s hearing we can hear about some of these current needs and improvements  but I want to end with just two final thoughts  I want everyone in this room to bear in mind the story of a young guardsman that I met in August  He s a father of three  and he recently returned from Iraq  He lost his job  he can t get unemployment  he can t get the V A  or the DOD doctors to figure out what is wrong with him  and he s currently getting food stamps to feed his family  Today we re going to hear some success stories  and I applaud the employers who are doing the right thing  We so appreciate that and want you to continue on and do what we can to make that happen  but we also have to focus on a lot of these Guard and Reserve members who are falling through the cracks just like this father I talked to  Secondly  I have heard for over a year that we did a better job of taking care of our Guard and Reserve members during and after the Gulf War  I ve heard that everywhere I go  And I know this is a war where our Guard and Reserve made up a smaller percentage of our troops in the Middle East and obviously was a much shorter conflict  Helping our Guard and Reserve transition into civilian life is a fundamental cost of war and the Service Members Occupational Conversion and Training Act was developed as a transitional tool designed to provide job training employment to veterans discharged after August 1st  1990  the first Gulf War  Back then  I think we need to recognize  there was a lot stronger network that helped our Guard members with reintegration than there is today  So I hope to hear from our panelists today how we can best change that to provide our veterans today the services they need and that they ve deserved and that they ve earned  Thank you very much  Mr  Chairman ISAKSON  Senator Roberts ROBERTS  Thank you  Mr  Chairman  and I d like associate myself with your remarks and that of the distinguished ranking member  I want to thank you for holding the hearing  And I would ask permission that my entire statement be made part of the record  and I will very briefly summarize ISAKSON  Without objection ROBERTS  We have two of Kansas  largest employers  Sprint and Weststar Energy  have made the decision to further support their citizen soldiers by providing the differential pay  I want to certainly bring that attention to the committee  We re very proud of them  and we hope that they serve as an example and a catalyst  I would point out that I think that congressional action is needed to clarify the tax treatment of this important voluntary benefit  Here s the problem  Under a 36 year old tax ruling  our military fighting from forward operating bases are required to file quarterly tax returns and submit quarterly tax payments because IRS rules actually treat a guardsman or a reservist called up to active duty as a  quote  terminated employee  This ruling is outdated  it s unacceptable  outrageous  if not an insult to our men and women  If you d stop and think a minute about anybody in the Reserve and Guard trying to stop the influx of the insurgency at the border in Anbar province or if they re trying to stabilize  say  Fallujah  or if you re in the very difficult task of detection and interrogation by highly trained people  they simply do not have time to sit down and fill out these tax forms or a quarterly tax payment  I think that we need to take prompt action  Last year we almost had the problem fixed  Unfortunately  during consideration of the 2005 defense authorization bill the prospective legislation was removed during conference due to objections with regard to an unrelated tax provision  so we got into yet another turf fight  We cannot allow this IRS ruling to stand  so earlier this year three members of this committee  Senator Gregg  Senator Alexander  and myself  joined together to introduce legislation to clarify the tax treatment for the pay that is differential  We need to make sure that this voluntary benefit provided by employers who want to do the right thing does not inadvertently really create an additional tax reporting burden on our citizen soldiers  So I think adopting this bill will relieve that burden  send a message to both the Guard and Reserve families and employers that Congress does recognize the importance of this voluntary benefit  So  again  Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding this important hearing  I apologize for leaving  but as chairman of the Intelligence Committee  we have Porter Goss who is to give his yearly report  and the flak jacket that we were going to provide him is missing  and I have to find it   LAUGHTER ISAKSON  Senator Roberts  before you leave  I want to personally thank you for your leadership on the tax issue and associate myself with your remarks  your support for that change  You re exactly correct  Senator Burr BURR  Thank you  Mr  Chairman  Let me take this opportunity to welcome the panel  I had the opportunity this morning to spend time with Mr  Donovan and to get some insight as to the tremendous commitment that Home Depot makes  What we find is they re not alone  There are a lot of companies around the country that provide us the opportunity to tap into our Guard and Reservists at a time like this  where we do have very responsible corporate citizens  And where we don t  hearings like this  Mr  Chairman  are very helpful to help us fix the system  I might also point out that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill leads a collaborative effort funded by Congress with other institutions around the country called Citizen Soldier to look specifically at the deployment of Guard and reservists  from the time that they re notified of that deployment to the time that they get home  Rather than to wait for an after action report by DOD to be done after an event  this is done in real time to try to evaluate how we can do it better not next time we deploy  but tomorrow  And I think that already some of the information that that collaborative agreement has produced is beneficial to the quality of lives to the family members and to the troops who are deployed  It is indeed an honor today  Mr  Chairman  to also introduce a constituent  Sergeant 1st Class Ronald Fry  Sergeant Fry is a member of the North Carolina Guard since 1985  He was mobilized in September 2003 and deployed to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom from February 2004 to December 2004  He served as a platoon leader for a motorized infantry element during ten months of combat operations in Tikrit and Najaf  In peace time  Ron Fry s been directly responsible for missions execution  safety  supervision  training  near  and long term planning and logistics operations of 40 personnel for self propelled Howitzers in a fire direction center  He has multiple military awards that he has won  Sergeant Fry was selected as the Brigade Noncommissioned Officer of the Year in 1990 and the Battalion Noncommissioned Officer of the Year in 1990   97   98  and is a member of the Joint Counternarcotics Task Force  1990  Ron Fry works for Wachovia Bank in Charlotte  North Carolina  and has worked there since 1998  Wachovia  interestingly enough  Mr  Chairman  received the 2005 Secretary of Defense Freedom Award on October 15  2005  Currently  Ron serves as a portfolio manager associate for the credit products group at Wachovia Securities  and he manages the credit risk of multibillion dollar portfolios of the financial institution s clients  He s responsible for all senior debt underwriting for any new or existing clients in the portfolio  He received a B A  in business administration in 1998 from Belmont Abbey College in Belmont  North Carolina  and is currently in the MBA program for Wake Forest University s Babcock School of Management  an institution that is close to my heart  Mr  Chairman  in their Charlotte master s program  Mr  Chairman  it is indeed an honor to introduce not only a good Wachovia employee and North Carolinian  but a brave American who has served his country well  I welcome you  Ron ISAKSON  Thank you very much  Senator Burr  We appreciate that  And I at this time would like to ask unanimous consent that the statements of Senators Gregg and Kennedy appear in the record and that any other statements may be submitted during the next 10 days  the record held open  Without objection  so ordered  Now I will introduce three of our panel members and Senator Murray will introduce a fourth  And you ve just gotten a wonderful introduction  Sergeant Fry  We appreciate your being here today MURRAY  And I introduced Lisa in my opening remarks  So she s introduced to the committee ISAKSON  First  representing the views of the administration is Bobby Hollingsworth  executive director of the National Committee for Employment Support of the Guard and Reserve  Appointed by President Bush less than two months after September 11  2001  Mr  Hollingsworth serves as an adviser to the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs on all matters involving employer support programs for the reserve components of the United States Armed Forces  Second  I m very pleased to welcome Mr  Dennis Donovan  executive vice president of the Home Depot  Mr  Donovan oversees human resources functions for the Atlanta company s more than 300 000 associates  In just the Iraqi conflict alone  the Home Depot has catered to the needs of approximately 1 800 associates who have been called to active duty  On a point of personal privilege  I have had the occasion over and over again to witness the commitment of the Home Depot Corporation in the hiring of veterans  This year they ve already hired 13 000  last year they hired 16 000  They are a national leader in seeking out members of the armed forces and our veterans to serve  And their unparalleled support of the military and the young men and women who fight on behalf of this country is appreciated tremendously by this nation and by their families  Third  we welcome Christine Bierman  founder and CEO of Colt Safety  Incorporated  a small business from St  Louis  Missouri  A former teacher turned entrepreneur  she has supported two employees activated by Operation Nobel Eagle and Operation Iraqi Freedom  and we are delighted to welcome you here today  And to all of our panelists  we appreciate the example that you set  I will now open our hearing and ask Mr  Hollingsworth if you d like to make the first statement  We d like for you to keep the statement within five minutes if possible  If you go over a little bit  we ll let you fudge HOLLINGSWORTH  Chairman Isakson  Ranking Member Murray  Senator Burr  Senator Jeffords  it s indeed a privilege  We really thank you for the opportunity to come over and talk about the great things that are happening in America today for the members of the Guard and Reserve  Just in the past weekend the secretary of defense recognized 15 employers nationwide by presenting them with the Employer Support Freedom Award  which is the Department of Defense s highest award recognizing employers for going above and beyond the requirements of the law to support their employers who serve our nation s National Guard and Reserve  I am honored to be joined today by Dennis Donovan from the Home Depot  Christine Bierman from Colt Safety  Both of those were 2004 recipients of the Freedom Award  And  of course  I m also pleased to have Ronald Fry be here from Wachovia who is a 2005 recipient  And  Lisa  it s great to be here with you as well  The rigorous selection process for the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award begins with the Guard or reservist or family member of a Guard or reservist nominating their employer for this prestigious award  This year I m pleased to report to you that we had over 1 500 nominations for this award  In 1994  Congress passed the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act  or USERRA  as it s more commonly known  It updated the 50 year Veterans Reemployment Rights Act to provide a broader range of protections to incorporate many court decisions that were relative to the VRR  USERRA prohibits discrimination on the basis of military service and established the conditions under which an employee may return to employment following active duty for training or inactive duty for training  For guardsman and reservists who continue to serve  knowing his or her civilian employment is protected by law is extremely important  Knowing that his or her employment supports his or her service to guarantee our national security is equally important  Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve is a Department of Defense organization that you mentioned early that s responsible for gaining and maintaining support from all public and private employers for the men and women of the National Guard  Through an aggressive employer outreach effort  we educate and inform employers on their responsibilities under USERRA and encourage them to go above and beyond to support their employees serving the Guard and Reserve  We recognize that there are employees within private and public sectors that cannot provide differential pay or health benefits because of public policy or fiscal or economic constraints  Going above and beyond is not limited to differential pay or continuation of health benefits  There are many things that an employer can do that carry little or no price tag  and in many cases  these little things are every bit as meaningful  if not more so to the employees serving in the Guard and Reserve  Others  for example  Army Reserve Lieutenant Chad Souers from Northport  Alabama  sat down at a computer in Tikrit  Iraq  to nominate his employer for the 2004 Freedom Award  He acknowledged that his employer  which was Wal Mart  provided differential pay and paid his portion of the civilian health insurance  but elaborated on Wal Mart s personal touches  His boss  which was Mr  Fred Twilley  made regular phone calls to Lieutenant Souers  wife to ensure that she and their infant daughter were coping with his absence  Mr  Twilley and Lieutenant Souers  Wal  Mart associates invited Ms  Souers to the store on their wedding anniversary for a surprise anniversary party  Lieutenant Souers  Wal Mart associates sent flowers to Ms  Souers on Valentine s Day and on Mother s Day to help with the pain of separation on these important days  Lieutenant Souers says  and I quote  They have repeatedly gone out of their way to include my wife and my daughter in the Wal Mart family during my absence only as dear friends could  All of this has given me the peace of mind when I needed it the most  knowing that there were so many people looking after my loved ones when I was unable to  Close quotes  In Las Vegas  the Metropolitan Police Department is a public sector agency that goes above and beyond in supporting its employers of the Guard and Reserve  Sheriff Bill Young has assigned a family support coordinator to each of the department s area commands to maintain contact with the families of the deployed guardsmen and reservists  Not only do his area commanders e mail contact with the deployed soldiers and airmen and Marines and other service members  but they do so    also the members of the employee s squad do the same thing  The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has been instituted a leave donation policy allowing an employee to donate unused leave so that the guardsmen and reservists may have extra paid leave when they return from mobilization  To their credit  quotes Captain Gabriela Hatfield Cook  the officers and employees of the Las Vegas Metro Police Department stand behind their deployed comrades without reservation  Close quotes  In another situation  where Coast Guard Reservist Chief Warrant Officer Norm Chapman from Olympia  Washington  he s been a reservist the entire 18 years he s been employed by the South Puget Sound Community College  While the South Puget Sound Community College is unable to provide differential pay  Mr  Chapman notes that the college grants veterans preferential credit points for most positions  they provide recognition of Guard and Reserve service through various college wide activities  and upon several occasions the school s automotive department made repairs to his family s vehicle  reducing the stress on his wife during mobilization  Not only did the college s public relations department publish stories about his experiences on active duty  but they ensured that he was informed about the news from the college when he was away  which enabled him to return to work with some knowledge of what was happening in his absence  Mr  Chapman said  quote  After the events of September 11  a few of us employees have been called up more than once  and I have heard nothing but positive words of encouragement from the administrative team  I feel totally confident that my job and position is fully protected by my employer and that they truly care about my Reserve participation  Lieutenant General Steve Blum  the Chief of the National Guard Bureau  frequently says that we recruit the soldier but we retain the family  In order for an employer to feel secure in continuing to serve in the National Guard and Reserve  not only must he or she be confident that they will return to their job and face no penalty for their service  but also that his or her employer supports their service to our national security  The Department of Defense recognizes that we share almost half of our workforce with America s employers  and those employers share sacrifices of the guardsmen and reservists  On behalf of a grateful nation  the Department of Defense thanks these employers  If National Guardsmen and Reservists are indeed twice the citizen  then their civilian employers are twice the patriot  America s employers are inextricably linked to our nation s security  Thank you  and I m looking forward to answering any questions you may have ISAKSON  Thank you  Mr  Hollingsworth  Mr  Donovan DONOVAN  Good afternoon  I d like to start out by thanking Chairman Isakson and Senator Murray for inviting the Home Depot to participate in this subcommittee hearing  The Home Depot was founded just in 1978  We re the world s largest home improvement specialty retailer  the second largest retailer in the United States  We currently employ more than 325 000 associates  Home Depot operates more than 1 950 stores in all 50 states  the District of Columbia  Puerto Rico  10 Canadian provinces  and Mexico  Our headquarters are in Atlanta  Georgia  and we re proud to call the chairman of this committee our senator  At the Home Depot we take our support for the military very  very seriously  One of our core values at the Home Depot is taking care of our people  Since 2002  the Home Depot has had approximately 1 800 associates called to active duty for the current conflict  Beyond assuring that these associates have a good job when they return home  the company also implemented an extended and enhanced leave of absence benefit  The Home Depot equalizes pay between their military salary and their Home Depot compensation  and we extend health benefits to deployed associates as well as their family members  Our company s support of the military goes beyond our deployed associates  In September of 2004  the Home Depot joined forces with the U S  Departments of Defense  Labor and Veterans Affairs to launch Operation Career Front  This is an unprecedented program to provide job opportunities for veterans  separating active duty service members  National Guard  reservist and military spouses  In 2003  the Home Depot hired 10 000 veterans  In 2004  the company hired more than 16 000 former military personnel  and I m proud to say that we expect to surpass this number in 2005 since we ve already hired 13 000 veterans through September of this year  Home Depot has also hired a significant number of former junior military officers into our store leadership program  Since 2002  we ve hired a total of 1 147 people under this program  529 of them are former junior military officers  and out of that number 125 of the JMOs are academy graduates  The company also participates in the Marine Corps  National Fellows Program  This is a one year rotation inside of the Home Depot where the Marine works very closely with the senior leadership team of the company  Lieutenant Colonel Jim Izen  who is here with me today  is our fourth Marine fellow  The Home Depot also collaborates with the military to share best practices  We re hosting the Army s Strategic Leadership Program for the third time on November 16th  The focus will be on leadership  information technology  supply chain and logistics  Another one of the core values at the Home Depot is giving back to the community  and we do this through donations and volunteerism  Giving back to the military community is certainly part of this  In April of 2003  we launched Project Homefront  While they were protecting our homeland  we wanted to protect their home front  This program was designed to help military families with home repairs while their loved ones were deployed  The Home Depot donated  1 million and 1 million hours of volunteerism to help out during  03 and  04  and to date we ve repaired over 1 000 homes  In addition  in July of  04  the company donated  1 million in tools and materials to support the U S  military efforts in Iraq  I d like to close by saying that we view our support for the military as our responsibility to our country  We don t view this as a cost  We consider this as a valuable investment to our company s future  Again  this is something we take very seriously  and we will continue to support those who are defending our rights and protecting our freedoms  Chairman Isakson  Senator Murray  thank you again for inviting the Home Depot to be here today ISAKSON  Thank you  Mr  Donovan  Ms  Bierman BIERMAN  Mr  Chairperson  members of the committee and distinguished guests  as a citizen of this great nation  I am honored to testify before you today and trust that my ideas and opinions will be considered as we work together to continually improve the way we do business in government and in the public and private sector  My name is Christine Bierman  CEO and founder of Colt Safety Fire and Rescue located in St  Louis  Missouri  Colt Safety is a small  woman business enterprise celebrating our 25 year anniversary this year  We warehouse and distribute personal protective equipment and industrial safety supplies  I m a national founding partner of Women Impacting Public Policy  a long time member of NAWBO  National Association of Women Business Owners  and WBENC  Women Business Enterprise National Council  and a longtime member of the American Society of Safety Engineers  Our company s mission is to protect the American workforce  Our vision is to nurture a successful company poised to give back to our family of employees and to the community  After the devastation to our nation and our psyche as we watched the World Trade Towers vanish before our eyes on September 11  how could any American not step up to the plate and protect and defend this great nation and to support any and all efforts to that end  Colt Safety had two of our 17 employees activated after 9 11  That represents 20 percent of our entire workforce  Master Sergeant Jim Mixco  United States air force reservist and nine year Colt Safety employee  was called to action to support Operation Nobel Eagle shortly after those towers crumbled  My heart and my patriotic duty  and the fact that Jim was a longtime manager at our company  guided me to continue his full salary and benefits for the year he was activated  Another employee  Specialist Joey Petry from the 203rd Battalion  Fort Leonard Wood  was deployed directly to Baghdad during our company s busiest season  Only after our company received the ESGR Freedom Award and the government went out of its way to thank us with Waterford crystal eagles and Boss Lifts to military bases across the country did I learn that not all employers do what I felt in my heart was the right thing  I was moved by soldiers at Fort Benning  Georgia  who thanked us from the bottom of their hearts for supporting them in their efforts to protect us  Over the past year  soldiers have either been given my name or found us online  contacted me  asking us for advise on how to help them set up programs at their own companies  It is my hope that Colt Safety can serve as a role model to other companies that endeavor to do the right thing for our Guard and Reserve  Former Secretary Wolfowitz said to me as he was handing me that beautiful crystal eagle that he new it was easier to do if you re an American Express  He understood the financial impact on a company our size  I do believe I m the smallest company ever to win this award  I think I m the only woman owned business  and until last Saturday night  I was the first Missouri company to ever win until Enterprise Rent A Car just won  Colt Safety s revenue was directly impacted by 50 percent decrease in profits and sales during Jim s absence  Small businesses that extend themselves financially in support of our Guard and Reserve must be recognized not only with crystal eagles and conspicuous service medal awards  but also with government contracting opportunities  Colt Safety and other small diversity companies can only continue to do the good that we do that is documented in this testimony when we are afforded opportunities to do business with the largest procurement agency in the world  the United States government  I am asking you today to author a bill that supports by way of government contracts those small businesses  and large businesses of course  that support our president and our service men and women  This will encourage and afford others the financial stability to do the right thing  Thank you for the opportunity to testify today  and I will answer any questions ISAKSON  Thank you  Ms  Bierman  Ms  Nisenfeld NISENFELD  Mr  Chairman and members of the subcommittee  thank you for the opportunity to talk with you today about employment issues for returning Reserve and National Guard soldiers  The efforts of many employers to assure continued employment for our returning National Guard and Reserve veterans in both the public and private sectors is truly outstanding  These organizations well deserve the nation s recognition and thanks  Much more needs to be done  however  to make sure that all our returning National Guard and Reserve soldiers are employed and economically stable  The challenges facing these heroes are complex  Last spring  700 Oregon National Guard soldiers returned home  many of them residents of southwest Washington  Fully 40 percent of them were unemployed upon return  Another group of 700 is scheduled to return next month  and of these at least 30 percent anticipate being unemployed  An equal number  another 30 percent  describe themselves as underemployed  This occurs as our region s economy is in the midst of a strong recovery  So while the employment prospects for the public at large have improved  the options for our re entering service people are not as bright  In Washington State  citizen soldiers demobilized from the Washington National Guard s 81st Brigade demonstrating a 40 percent unemployment rate among 1 000 returnees  The largest number of these unemployed soldiers were jobless when they entered the Guard  That s especially true because we were in the midst of a recession at that time  To them  the challenges of securing gainful employment are even greater  They tend to be young people who have little  if any  college education  Some of them are students  Others were downsized during their period of service  The transition for these soldiers has been very  very difficult  Upon first returning to civilian life  they are provided with a substantial amount of information regarding employment and education resources in their communities  That information  however  often falls upon deaf ears because the soldiers aren t ready to jump into a job  They face many pressing issues  re introduction to their families  housing  debts and health challenges  So the usefulness of the information presented at demobilization is often limited  Further  those who worked low wage  low skilled jobs are no longer satisfied with that  During their deployment they learned many technical skills  lived in intense and demanding situations  They developed maturity unlike that of others their age  Their expectations for work and family change substantially  yet they often come home to minimum wage jobs  debts and challenging family situations  They may have physical and mental challenges as well resulting from their service  So they re given three weeks or less to decompress prior to entering civilian life  How can we help solve these challenges  There are a variety of possibilities  First  we should consider providing a military salary and benefits during a transitional year so individuals can afford to go to school  A wide variety of resources are out there to help pay the tuition and fees for vets returning to school  yet many have young families and financial obligations which preclude full time education  They simply can t afford the cost of living  Our economy needs these young people to pursue higher education and technical credentials  so this would be a sound investment  Number two  encourage civilians and veterans organizations to work together to reach out to returning soldiers  Congress has funded a comprehensive system of one stop employment centers throughout the country  These centers consider returning veterans to be their top priority populations for services  For the most part  however  these programs are not connected directly to the various military organizations that are demobilizing soldiers  These programs stand ready to actively reach out to returning vets  as well as their dependents  yet most are mystified about who to call and how to connect  Our system regularly mobilizes resources to deal with large layoffs and plant closures  Surely our experience in rapid response can be applied to working with these men and women  Making these connections is especially challenging for Army Reserve units  such as the 104th Division in Vancouver  because they draw soldiers from 12 states  They need to better understand how to connect with these local workforce systems  This is especially critical because their soldiers separate from the military one or two at a time  requiring much individual work  The best part about this strategy is that it s already paid for  Let s make the most of the resources already out there  A third option is to provide tax credits to assist small employers when National Guard and Reserve soldiers are deployed  In our experience  employers want to do the right thing  Small employers  however  have a difficult time bearing the substantial cost of training an employee to replace a deployed soldier  The result of this is some hesitation in hiring members of the Guard or Reserve  A tax credit to cover a portion of the replacement training costs would be very helpful  Finally  assure that military credentials are fully transferable  This already occurs in many arenas  but remains a challenge in others  It will require close coordination between the military and state licensing authorities for many occupations  especially in industries such as health care and transportation where demand is high  Both classroom and hands on experience should be transferable  I look forward to continuing our work with Senator Murray on these issues  and I thank all of you for your commitment to the success of our returning soldiers  and I d be happy to answer any questions ISAKSON  Thank you  Ms  Nisenfeld  Mr  Fry FRY  I d like to thank Senator Burr for the introduction  Mr  Chairman and members of the committee  I have the honor to speak to you as a representative of both the Wachovia Corporation and as a citizen soldier  When reservists deploy  they must rely on a support network that includes the businesses that they work for or own  In my experience  that level of support varies widely  I would like to detail the outstanding support that I received as I prepared to mobilize  mobilized  deployed and re deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and to relate to the committee what that level of support means on a personal level  At the time of my initial alert  Wachovia s existing corporate policy was already what I consider generous  providing for continued full pay and benefits for six months in the event of activation  In March of 2003  the corporation extended this policy to one year in recognition of the sacrifices being made to support the war on terror as more Wachovia employees joined the active ranks  Wachovia has since continued to extend that policy in subsequent months in support of our employees called to extended active duty for Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom  Let me explain what these benefits meant to my family  As an active duty sergeant 1st class  my pay was less than half of what I had been making at Wachovia even factoring in the additional allowances for the combat deployment  To compound this  my wife had to leave her job  which involved night and weekend work that she would no longer be able to perform since I was not there to care for our children  Day care was not available during those periods  and her employer would not grant her a leave of absence  so she was forced to resign and subsequently lost her benefits  I was faced with the prospect of losing two thirds of our annual income and benefits for my family while being halfway around the world and not being able to do anything about it  While TRICARE health benefits began upon my activation  they involved a change in medical service providers and new and unfamiliar paperwork  Without the financial support from Wachovia and the extended benefits  we would have been in serious trouble  Not having to worry about my family s financial condition or health benefits gave me a great sense of relief and made it easier to focus on my duties  I was initially concerned that the one year policy would leave a period where I would only have the Army salary  However  the extensions to the policy ensured that I was covered for the entire period of my service  The company also maintained the employer matching of my 401 k  funds  allowing me to continue pursuing our savings goals  Wachovia also counted my military service as qualifying toward the company funded pension plan  I was also paid my full incentive plan bonus for 2003 even though it could have been prorated to exclude the three months that I was on active service  These measures ensured that my future financial goals weren t derailed by the deployment  During the call up process I had a lot of questions and was relieved to find the answers readily accessible  Wachovia has the entire military policy on its Web site with frequently asked questions and linked me to a human resources representative whose support allowed me to plan thoroughly for the change  My Wachovia management team worked with me throughout the process and expedited it when possible  My employer didn t just make policy that benefited reservists  they made it easy to access and receive these benefits  The company continued to count my years of service while I was gone  and when I returned paid me retroactively for a raise that I would have received in 2004 had I not been activated  My co workers sent me a copy of the corporate newsletter applauding deployed Wachovia reservists that was published in the fall of 2004  There I learned  inaudible  company that the ESGR had named an outstanding employer  although by that time I already knew that I worked for an outstanding employer  I also learned that on 13 October   04  Wachovia teamed with the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce and the ESGR to sponsor a salute to the troops in the atrium of Wachovia s corporate headquarters  This public demonstration of Wachovia s ongoing support makes me very proud to be a part of this company  Upon my return to work in March of this year  I submitted a letter to the ESGR detailing the level of support that I had received from Wachovia and was pleased to see this letter included on Wachovia s military support Web page that was used as a source of information in consideration for the 2005 Secretary of Defense Freedom Award  Wachovia subsequently was awarded this honor here in Washington last Saturday on October 15 of 2005  Upon the announcement of the Freedom Award  the military s highest honor for a civilian employer  Wachovia interviewed several recently deployed reservists and broadcast our stories of support through company print and visual media  CEO Ken Thompson stated in the release at that time  Wachovia is proud to support the men and women who are serving our country  and we are honored to receive an award that demonstrates our unwavering commitment to them  Their selfless service exemplifies the values that we work hard to live up to every day  integrity  respect  teamwork  service  personal excellence and accountability  and winning  I would also like to relate the level of support that I received from the employees of Wachovia  Soon after the deployment  my department made me aware that they were starting a fund to donate airline miles so that my family could visit relatives while I was deployed  My wife and two sons were able to travel to Pennsylvania during the summer months and visit relatives thanks to their generosity  During deployment  I received from current and past co workers more than 50 large and unbelievably well stocked care packages that I was able to distribute to my battery  The flood of donations became so overwhelming that I started to donate large quantities of items to other units attached to the 1st and the 33rd Field Artillery whose soldiers were not as fortunate as us to have such a dedicated support channel  The regular Army soldiers were amazed when I told them I had received all the items from work  and I was proud to tell them about the company and my experience  The care packages included disposable cameras  food items  toiletries  games  books  magazines  signed banners of support  sun block  lip balm  insect repellent and  curiously  a 12 and one half pound box of sugar packets  which the coffee drinkers in the platoon took as a godsend   LAUGHTER  I also received Wachovia office forms in case I was missing work too much  I can t begin to imagine the effort involved  and I am sincerely grateful  I received countless letters and emails extending support and prayers  and discovered that my colleagues had told our clients about my experiences  and some of these clients in turn also started to send letters  emails and packages to support me and my soldiers in the field  Upon returning  I received an outpouring of support not only from my teammates  but also from individuals throughout the corporation as I learned that my team had been sharing my correspondence from Iraq throughout the company  I had an ever larger group praying for my unit s safe return and am still struck when someone whom I don t recognize will come up to me and thank me for my service and share with me that they too were praying for our safety  Upon my return to work in March of this year  my Wachovia teammates helped me raise over  2 000 for a severely wounded soldier in my platoon  My business unit donated over  1 000 to a local nonprofit  VALOR  which was conducting a fund raiser for our wounded soldier and through the Wachovia charity matching funds program  We Give  the corporation donated a matching amount  Again  I take great pride in detailing the encouragement and assistance that I received as I deployed with the 30th Brigade  North Carolina Army National Guard to Operation Iraqi Freedom  Over the 17 months of the deployment process  Wachovia was more than an employer with deployed reservists  Wachovia was a partner to me in the deployment  The company has created a culture of encouragement for its reservists consistent with our core values  The experiences of the soldiers in my unit who did not receive the same level of support made me all the more grateful for my experience  It also made me acutely aware that more can be done to convince the employers of the thousands of reservists still on or entering active duty to fight the war on terror how vital their support is to the citizen soldiers at home and down range  Thank you ISAKSON  Well  thank you  Mr  Fry  And thank all the members for their testimony  And to Wachovia and to Colt and to Home Depot  you re shining examples to the business community  and the contribution you are making to our country and to our men and women who work for you and serve is appreciated by your nation very much  Ms  Bierman  tell me how you would envision the contract preference proposal that you made working BIERMAN  I don t know if I d call it a preference  but I just think some kind of a bill   ISAKSON  That was my word  That wasn t yours BIERMAN  Right  First off  we ve been soliciting the federal government for 25 years and most recently for four years to help rebuild Iraq  now help rebuild the Gulf Coast and federal government  FEMA  Homeland Security and the DOD  I was actually    it was kind of their idea when I met  and I had a meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld  We were invited back to have a meeting with him in his private conference room last year after the awards  and one of the undersecretaries said  We owe you  And I said  Well  I never thought of it that way  but  you know  I don t want any handouts  but just  you know  help us get government contracting opportunities  which we re working on anyway  So that has come up  That particular undersecretary actually took me to the chief procurement officer for all chem bio personal protective gear and it didn t go anywhere  But I just think there needs to be a bill  There s bills out there  We have bills for small business  We have set asides  I don t like that term  I don t like goals  And I don t believe anyone owes us anything  But in this particular case  in order for me to continue the good that I do    I am a contributor to society and a good employer and to continue    this has all cost me money coming to receive these awards  You were kind enough to pay today  but most of the time I come to Washington  D C   it s on my    all the time    it s on my dime  and I cannot continue to be a profitable  viable company without growing my business  and the best way to grow the business is with the largest procurement agency in the world  the federal government  So I have been actively seeking contractual agreements there for four years  and I could use a little help  and I know I m not alone  I think there needs to be some kind of a bill or a sponsorship    or our names of those of us that have supported the Guard and Reserve specifically in this case    that our name goes before those buying agencies  that they take a really good  hard look at us ISAKSON  Well  your testimony that when you lost 20 percent of your employees due to deployment and that same year your profit reduction was 50 percent  that was a significant contribution that Colt made
