         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Boston  Massachusetts  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy met with recently returned veterans from Iraq and local community and business leaders to discuss how Massachusetts can use its resources to help our veterans and their families  The Senator led the dialogue on the challenges facing our veterans as they return home from war and are trying to re assimilate back into civilian life  often with extensive debts  injuries and economic with straints  The summit was the third in a series    The purpose of the meeting was to bring together the relevant government agencies  business leaders and service providers so that they would hear directly from veterans and focus on finding job opportunities for them  The conversation was geared towards applying the new skills these soldiers have learned overseas and put them to good use back home in Massachusetts  Senator Kennedy led a discussion with community leaders on services available to returning servicemen and women  and provided a new  one stop resource guide for soldiers and their families on how to navigate the often daunting process of readjusting to civilian life     In his remarks  Senator Kennedy said  Families have also told us of the heavy financial burdens that the call ups have caused  They have to struggle with mortgage payments  fuel costs  childcare and other costs of raising a family  Often  savings aren t adequate  and families live in fear of bankruptcy    Nationally  more than two hundred thousand reservists and National Guard troops across the country have been called to active duty  far away from their homes and businesses  As a result  many of their families are facing economic hardship  and their creditors keep calling  Some of them operated small businesses  and because of their absence  those businesses are now in trouble  Kennedy will build on Monday s summit by fighting for the economic needs of our veterans in the Senate s current bankruptcy legislation  The bankruptcy bill is being debated on the floor this week and currently does nothing to protect those who are fighting for us  In fact  it will put their families and their businesses in greater financial jeopardy     According to a Defense Department survey of Reservists  41  lost substantial family income when they were called up  The average self employed Reservist lost  6 500 in annual income  but many lose far more  For physicians  it was a loss of  25 000  These families have put our national security ahead of their financial security  and they deserve our help    The meeting   meant to serve as a fact finding discussion   will help produce next steps for the business  education and health care communities as well as the federal and state governments to best provide the resources and assistance needed to ensure that every American in uniform and their families can achieve the American dream       The Senator s remarks follow       REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY AT THE MASSACHUSETTS VETERANS JOB SUMMIT   Thank you  Peter  for that generous introduction and for your hospitality in hosting us today  Peter and I have been talking about the problems facing our veterans as they come home from active duty  and I m delighted we could assemble such an impressive group today to discuss ways to help our veterans return to the civilian workforce     We may disagree on our policy in Iraq  but there is one thing on which we all agree   we have the best and bravest military in the world  We owe so much to the courageous men and women who serve us so well  and we can t ignore the problems that many veterans face when they come home from the war    Since 9 11  more than 469 000 National Guard members and Reservists have been called up for combat tours in Iraq or Afghanistan  Currently  we have 150 000 military personnel in Iraq  In Massachusetts  it s been the largest mobilization of National Guard members since World War II  Nearly 850 members of the Massachusetts Air and Army National Guard are serving overseas today  and nearly 4 000 have served overseas since 9 11  This doesn t begin to count the soldiers  sailors  Marines  and Air Force personnel on active duty who return home to Massachusetts when their tours are complete    During their service  things have changed   they ve learned new skills in their military jobs  and for many of them  their former civilian jobs have changed as well  So they often need additional education and job training to meet the new demands of their old jobs  or to obtain their first civilian job  Some have serious disabilities    Families have also told us of the heavy financial burdens that the call ups have caused  They have to struggle with mortgage payments  fuel costs  child care and other expenses of raising a family  Often  their savings aren t adequate  and they live in fear of bankruptcy  According to a Defense Department survey of Reservists  41  lost substantial family income when they were called up  The average self employed Reservist lost  6 500 in annual income  but many lose far more  For physicians  it was a loss of  25 000  These families have put our national security ahead of their financial security  and they deserve our help    They need information on education  job training  and other services available to them  They also need information on the good job opportunities that are open in the area     In this room today we have some of our most knowledgeable people on these issues  Jane Edmonds is our state Director of Workforce Development  Tom Kelley is our state Secretary of the Department of Veterans  Services  We also have employers who want to help  members of our Armed Forces  members of our workforce boards  and representatives of our community colleges    To begin the conversation  I d like to introduce Sergeant Peter Damon  a fourth generation veteran from Brockton  In November  2003  Peter was in Iraq  changing the tire on his Blackhawk helicopter  when it exploded  leaving Peter without his arms  I ve gotten to know Peter and his family while he s been at Walter Reed Army Hospital  I m impressed with his positive attitude for the future  It s a privilege to welcome him here today to talk about what our returning veterans are going through   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
