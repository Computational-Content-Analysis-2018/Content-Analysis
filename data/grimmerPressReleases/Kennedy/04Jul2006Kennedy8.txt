         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    By Sen  Edward M  Kennedy   As we celebrate the 230th birthday of the Declaration of Independence  we should all pause to reflect on the basic values that have built America and made it great  One of the most important of these values  too often ignored  is our diversity  As Walt Whitman wrote  These states are the amplest poem  Here is not merely a nation but a teaming of nations    Congress and the country are now engaged in a controversial debate over that value as it applies to our immigration laws  As with every immigration debate  emotions run high and passions run deep  as they have since our first Independence Day  The issue goes to the heart of who we are as Americans    The debate will determine who is entitled to the privilege of citizenship  It will determine our ability to separate those who would harm us from those who are inspired by our values  who come to America to work and raise their families  contribute to their communities  and reach for the American dream  In large measure  the debate will determine the course of our future national progress and our future economic growth   Recently  I participated in a rally on the Mall in Washington in support of comprehensive immigration reform  When I looked at the sea of people standing between the Capitol and the Washington Monument  I could see in my minds eye the coming together of past Americans  new Americans and future Americans  all joined together for the common good    Comprehensive immigration reform is not conservative or liberal  Republican or Democratic  but vital for America  Above all  we must keep America safe  But we cannot do that just by building longer and higher fences or criminalizing undocumented workers  We must provide a path for those who are here to come out of the shadows and earn citizenship  We need new laws that not only protect American workers  but also allow employers to obtain the workers they need to help our economy prosper    The majority of Americans believe that the bipartisan Senate immigration bill  backed by President Bush  labor groups  business leaders and the religious community  is a sound blueprint for progress  It strengthens our borders  offers a path to citizenship for undocumented workers who are here  and creates a temporary worker program for the future  It is based on the belief that America is strongest when we keep out those who would hurt us  and also welcome those who would help us   As the debate continues  it would be a mistake to let election year politics get in the way of progress  Congress must act this year  the sooner the better  Each day we delay  more than a thousand additional people join the underground economy as undocumented immigrants  They come here to work and help their families  but in the underground economy they create  they undermine the jobs and wages of American workers   At its heart this debate is about people who love their families  their faith  their communities and America  Our history as immigrants has contributed immensely to our nations strength  and it can do so in the years ahead    As president Franklin Roosevelt reminded a convention of the Daughters of the American Revolution  remember always that all of us  you and I especially  descended from immigrants and revolutionists  On this Independence Day  lets heed these wise words and never forget that the America we love is a nation of immigrants    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
