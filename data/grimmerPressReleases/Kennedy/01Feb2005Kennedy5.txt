         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Mr  President  this is one of the most important votes the Senate will take this year  The issues raised by Mr  Gonzales s nomination go to the heart of what America stands for in the world and the fundamental values that define us as a nation   our commitment to individual dignity  our respect for the rule of law  and our reputation around the world as a beacon for human rights  not as a violator of human rights    President Bush said it well in his Inaugural Address last month  From the day of our Founding  we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights  and dignity  and matchless value  because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth  The world is watching to see if our actions match our rhetoric     How can the Senate possibly approve the nomination of Mr  Gonzales as Attorney General of the United States  the official who symbolizes our respect for the rule of law  when Mr  Gonzales is the official in the Bush Administration who  as White House Counsel  advised the President that torture was an acceptable method of interrogation in Afghanistan  Guantanamo  and Iraq     Torture is contrary to all that we stand for as Americans  It violates our basic values  It is alien to our military s longstanding rules and traditions  We send our men and women in the Armed Services into battle to stop torture in other countries  not to participate in it themselves     These values did not change  or become less relevant  after 9 11  Americans did not resolve to set aside our values  or the Constitution  after those vicious attacks  We didn t decide as a nation to stoop to the level of the terrorists    To the contrary  Americans have been united in the belief that an essential part of winning the war on terrorism and protecting the country for the future is safeguarding the ideals and values that America stands for here at home and around the world      Americans agree that torture is  and should remain  beyond the pale  A recent poll in USA Today showed that Americans strongly disapprove of the interrogation tactics that have been used in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo   including the use of painful stress positions  sexual humiliation  threatening prisoners with dogs  and threatening to ship them to countries known to practice torture     The American public has held fast to our most fundamental values   How could our government have gone so wrong     In many ways  the story of Mr  Gonzales s life represents the best of America  He was raised in a small house in north Houston  with no hot water or telephone  by parents who were migrant farm workers     As a teenager  he sold soft drinks in Rice Stadium and wondered what it would be like to attend that great university as a student  He enrolled at Rice after service in the Air Force  then obtained a law degree at Harvard  He became a partner at Houston s largest law firm and a justice on the Texas Supreme Court  and has served as one of the President s closest advisers over the past four years  I have nothing but the highest respect for his accomplishments  but that is not the issue     But  Mr  Gonzales is at the center of a torture policy that has run roughshod over the values that Americans hold so dear  On issue after issue in developing this policy  he has endorsed expediency over the rule of law     He adopted an absurdly narrow definition of torture in order to permit extreme interrogation practices     He advocated an unjustifiably expansive view of President power  purporting to put the Executive Branch above the law     He ignored the plain language of the Geneva Conventions in an attempt to immunize those who may commit war crimes     He continues to push a discredited interpretation of our treaty obligations to permit the C I A  to commit cruel  inhuman and degrading acts outside the United States     He refuses to be candid about his interpretations  policies  and intentions                 The Administration s policy on torture was established in August 2002  in a Justice Department document called the Bybee   or more accurately the Bybee Gonzales   Memorandum    This memorandum was written at Mr  Gonzales s request  Look at the first page  It reads Memorandum for Alberto R  Gonzales  Counsel to the President     The first two sentences read  You have asked for our Office s views regarding the standards of conduct under the Convention Against Torture and the Anti Torture Statute passed by Congress in 1994  As we understand it  this question has arisen in the context of the conduct of interrogations outside of the United States    After its release in August 2002  the memorandum became the official policy on interrogations by the Defense Department and the C I A  for two and a half years  until it was repudiated just last month at the last minute  on the eve of Mr  Gonzales s nomination    Yet Mr  Gonzales refuses to tell us anything about how the Bybee Gonzales Memorandum was written and why he ordered it  We know from press reports that the C I A  asked him for advice on how far the agency could go in interrogating detainees  In July 2002  he held meetings with other Administration officials to discuss how to legally justify certain interrogation methods  He refuses to tell us anything about those meetings    He says he can t remember what specific interrogation methods were discussed    He can t remember who asked for the Justice Department s legal advice in the first place    He can t remember whether he made any suggestions to the Department on the drafting of the Bybee  Gonzales Memorandum  although he admits that it would not be unusual for his office to have done so     He doesn t know how the memo was forwarded to the Defense Department and became part of its Working Group Report in April 2003  which was used to justify the new interrogation practices at Guantanamo  Those practices  in turn  to use the obscure word resorted to by the Administration  somehow migrated to U S  military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq  as if no human hand had been involved in the dissemination    Torture became a pervasive practice  The F B I  says so  The Red Cross says so  The Defense Intelligence Agency says so  The Defense Department says it has investigated more than 300 cases of detainee torture  sexual assault  and other abuse  Additional allegations of abuse   many of them too sickening to be described in open session on the floor of the Senate   are reported almost daily  Yet Mr  Gonzales can t remember the details of how any of it happened    The Judiciary Committee has repeatedly asked Mr  Gonzales to provide documents on his meetings  evaluations  and decisions on the Bybee Memorandum  These documents would speak volumes about all the issues Mr  Gonzales says he has trouble remembering  Yet he refuses to provide the documents  He won t even search for them  In his responses to our written questions  Mr  Gonzales stated eight times that he has not conducted a search for the requested documents  In other words  the documents we want may exist  but he s not going to look for them  It s hard to imagine a more arrogant insult to the constitutional role of the Senate in considering nominations    Mr  Gonzales refused to answer other questions and requests on the grounds that they would involve classified information  predecisional or internal deliberations  or deliberative material  None of these grounds is sufficient  There is no legal prohibition against providing classified material to Congress  It s routinely provided to Congress and discussed in closed meetings  There is no recognized privilege for predecisional or deliberative materials  The only exception is in the rare case where the President himself decides that his interest in secrecy outweighs the public interest in disclosure  and he himself invokes executive privilege  That hasn t happened here    It was clear when Mr  Gonzales was nominated that his involvement in the policy on prisoner detention and interrogation would be a major concern of the Senate  and that the Senate would need full information and materials on this subject  Serious abuses of detainees occurred in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo  Mr  Gonzales s role in developing their legal justification goes to the heart of the issue whether he should be confirmed as the nation s chief law enforcement officer      If we vote to confirm this nominee without insisting on answers to our questions  we ll be abdicating our advice and consent responsibility and weakening our oversight function precisely when it is needed most    The Bybee Gonzales Memorandum was not a law review article or newspaper op ed article  As Mr  Gonzales himself has said  it was the definitive legal opinion by the Justice Department on the rules on torture for the entire Executive Branch of the Government     We learned this past weekend from a New York Times article that the Justice Department s Criminal Division    then headed by Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff  now the nominee to head the Department of Homeland Security     was advising the CIA on the legality of specific interrogation techniques  using the Bybee Gonzales memo as its legal guideline     Further  the Times reported that there is a second Bybee memo which goes into even more detail than the first about which methods of coercion can be used  We have repeatedly asked for information about the original Bybee Gonzales memo and how it was used  The nominee and the White House have stonewalled us  We have repeatedly asked for other documents to be produced that would be relevant to understanding the first Bybee Gonzales memo  The nominee and the White House have stonewalled us     On Tuesday  Senator Durbin and I wrote a letter to the ranking members of the Judiciary and Government Accountability Committees outlining the pressing need for all relevant documents before we proceed to fully consider the nomination  Senator Durbin and I wrote    It is clear that the Senate should have the documents before it votes on these two nominations  since such materials go to the heart of the qualifications of the nominees to serve in the sensitive and important positions which they have been nominated for   We believe that both the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland Security Committee should separately or jointly take the necessary steps to obtain all of the documents referred to in the article  and any other documents relating to the events and activities described in the article  The Senate should have an opportunity to assess all materials relating to the First and Second Bybee memorandums before it begins debate on the Gonzales and Chertoff nominations   In short  I am deeply disturbed that our constitutional role to review these nominations is being intentionally subverted through withholding of extremely relevant and important material     As far as we know  until the Department released its revised version of the memorandum last month  the Bybee Memorandum was the official and definitive Justice Department opinion on the definition of torture  on the legal defenses for those who commit torture  and on the power of the President to override laws and treaties on torture  Given the recent New York Times article  it may be that  in addition to the Second Bybee memo  which we do not have  there are many other memos on torture  but the White House has refused to disclose any of them    Harold Koh   a leading scholar of international law and Dean of the Yale Law School who served in both the Reagan and Clinton Administrations   calls the Bybee Memorandum the most clearly legally erroneous opinion he has ever read  As he told the Judiciary Committee    If the counsel for the President had received such an opinion  you would have expected him to do at least one of two things       First  reject it on the spot and send it back or  second  send it to other parts of the government and have them give a second opinion  particularly the State Department  which I believe  following the policies in the U S  Report on the Convention Against Torture  would have said that the opinion is flatly wrong    Instead        that opinion was allowed to become executive branch policy  was incorporated into the DOD working group report  and remained as executive branch policy for some two and a half years  during which time I believe that a permissive environment was inevitably created     That s what Harold Koh said at the hearing  and I hope every member of the Senate will take the time to read his testimony    In his response to our questions about the Bybee Memorandum  Mr  Gonzales said that he has no specific recollection of  his  reaction to the conclusions  reasoning  or appropriateness as a matter of policy of any of the particular sections of the memorandum at the time  he  received it two and a half years ago    He did say  however  that he believed at the time that it was a good faith effort to interpret the Anti Torture Statute  At the hearing  he told Senator Leahy  I don t recall today whether or not I was in agreement with all of the analysis  but I don t have a disagreement with the conclusions then reached by the Department     Let s review those conclusions  They are summarized on the memo s final page   The Bybee Memorandum made three basic points     First  it said that torture means only acts that inflict the kind of pain experienced with death or organ failure  That s what the memo said  the pain must be of an intensity akin to that which accompanies serious physical injury such as death or organ failure    Second  the memo said that the President has the inherent constitutional power as Commander in Chief to override the prohibitions against torture enacted by Congress  Application of the Anti Torture Statute to interrogations undertaken pursuant to the President s Commander in Chief powers may be unconstitutional  the memo said    Third  the memo said that even if a government official were to commit torture under the extremely narrow definition set forth  abusers could still invoke the defenses of necessity or self defense  As the memo states  necessity or self defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability  The memo made this outlandish claim  even though the Convention Against Torture  which Congress ratified in 1994  states very clearly that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever may be invoked as a justification for torture    Fourth  the memo states that even if the person inflicting pain knew that severe pain would result from his actions  he would not be guilty of a crime even if he acted without good faith if causing harm was not his primary objective  This analysis defines intent in a way that defines away most instances of torture  This is one of the serious errors in the Bybee Gonzales memo that was contradicted in new OLC memo of December 30  2004  which replaced the original memo    None of these points qualify as a reasonable or good faith legal argument  The Bybee Memorandum defined torture so narrowly that Saddam Hussein s lieutenants could have claimed immunity from prosecution for many of their crimes  Beating you  suffocating you  ripping out your fingernails  burning you with hot irons  suspending you from hooks  putting lighted cigarettes in your ear   none of these barbaric methods are categorically prohibited under the Bybee Memorandum  since none of them necessarily involved near death or organ failure  the specific conditions required by the memo to constitute torture     As Chairman Specter himself said today  the orginal Bybee Gonzales memo was erroneous in its legal conclusions  and its definition of torture  was not realistic or adequate  Nevertheless  Mr  Gonzales allowed it to stand for over two years  and allowed it to be disseminated to other agencies  like DOD  where major portions were absorbed verbatim into official policy  And now we know from the Times  that it was used in the Justice Department to approve specific extreme methods for the CIA    Mr  Gonzales also refused to tell us whether the extreme conduct at Guantanamo described in the F B I  e mails is illegal      This conduct included burning detainees with lighted cigarettes  exposing them to extreme temperatures  giving forcible enemas and holding them in prolonged stress positions in their own urine and feces  He explained his refusal to respond by saying to us   W ere the Administration to begin ruling out speculated interrogation practices in public  by virtue of gradually ruling out some practices in response to repeated questions and not ruling out others  we would fairly rapidly provide al Qaeda with a road map concerning the interrogation that captured terrorists can expect to face     That s arrogant nonsense  Our laws  our treaties  and our military field manuals all provide specific and clear guidance on where to draw the line on torture  Mr  Gonzales s failure to condemn these acts of torture only weakens America s standing in the world and sets back our efforts against terrorism    How can we confirm as the chief law enforcement officer a nominee who is afraid to stand up for the rule of law    To reach their narrow definition of torture  the authors of the Bybee Memorandum relied on totally unrelated federal statutes that define emergency medical conditions for purposes of providing health benefits  The revision last December of the Bybee Memorandum repudiated this analysis  stating that the statutes relied on do not define severe pain even in that very different context       and they do not state that death  organ failure  or impairment of bodily function cause  severe pain   Clearly  the memo s original definition of torture was wrong  If it applied in other countries  U S  soldiers and citizens traveling abroad would clearly be at risk    The Bybee Memorandum s provisions on Executive Power are also wholly inconsistent with the separation of powers in the Constitution  Article II  Section 3 directs the President to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed  Yet the Bybee Memorandum states that the federal Anti Torture Statute would be unconstitutional if it interferes with the President s direction of such core war matters as the detention and interrogation of enemy combatants    At a press conference in June 2004  Mr  Gonzales refused to say whether this statement remains good law for the Bush Administration  He would say only that the President has not exercised his Commander in Chief override  he has not determined that torture is  in fact  necessary to protect the national security of this country    Mr  Gonzales evaded questions on this issue by Committee members  To this day  we still do not know whether the President believes he has the power as Commander in Chief to authorize torture    There is no such thing as a Commander in Chief override  It s certainly not in my copy of the Constitution  It appears to be something that Mr  Gonzales and his colleagues have invented    Congress has repeatedly passed laws and ratified treaties prohibiting torture and mistreatment of detainees  and the President does not have the power to violate them     When a nominee claims that such an override exists  or suggests that those who commit torture might be able to invoke the defense of necessity or self defense notwithstanding Congress s categorical prohibition against such a defense  it sends a message that anything goes to our troops and intelligence officers in the field  To allow such extreme claims to become official U S  policy for two whole years was reckless and  in my view  disqualifying in any nominee for Attorney General    Mr  Gonzales has also demonstrated a flagrant disregard for the rule of law in his effort to facilitate the C I A  practice of ghost detainees  The Administration has always claimed to be in full compliance with the Geneva Conventions in Iraq  Yet in the spring of 2004  we learned from General Taguba that between six and eight of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib Prison had not been registered as required by Army regulations and were being moved around the prison to avoid detection by the International Committee for the Red Cross  General Taguba described this practice as deceptive  contrary to Army doctrine and in violation of international law    In September  Army investigators told the Armed Services Committee that at the C I A  s direction  as many as 100 detainees at Abu Ghraib had been hidden from the Red Cross   and that the C I A  had refused requests to cooperate with the military investigation  This disclosure drew outrage from both Democrats and Republicans  Senator McCain said  The situation with the CIA ghost soldiers is beginning to look like a bad movie       This needs to be cleared up rather badly    Since then  we ve learned that Mr  Gonzales was a major architect of this policy  On March 19  2004  the Justice Department provided him with a draft memorandum   the so called Goldsmith Memorandum   to allow the C I A  to ship certain persons out of Iraq  Once again  the memo s first page reads  Memorandum for Alberto R  Gonzales  Counsel to the President  A separate cover page confirms that the opinion was requested by him  It s hard to imagine a clearer smoking gun    Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention specifically states  Individual or mass forcible transfers  as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country  occupied or not  are prohibited  regardless of their motive  Violations of Article 49 constitute grave breaches of the Convention and therefore qualify as war crimes under federal law    In spite of the clear  unequivocal language of this provision  the Justice Department ruled that Article 49 does not in fact prohibit  for the purpose of facilitating interrogation  the temporary removal from Iraq of protected persons who have not been accused of a crime  Scott Silliman  an expert in military law at Duke University  observed that the Goldsmith memorandum seeks to create a legal regime justifying conduct that the international community clearly considers in violation of international law and the Convention     Although the memo was labeled draft  it was put into action  In October 2004  the Washington Post reported that one intelligence official familiar with the operation said the C I A  used the memo as legal support for secretly transporting as many as a dozen detainees out of Iraq in the last six months  The agency has concealed the detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross and other authorities  the official said     The legal analysis in the Goldsmith Memorandum is preposterous  Yet it appears to have provided a legal justification for the C I A  to commit war crimes  As with the Bybee Memorandum  Mr  Gonzales has categorically refused to answer the Senate s questions about his involvement    He refuses to provide or even conduct a search for documents relating to his request for the Goldsmith Memorandum    He refuses to say anything about his discussions with the author of the memo    He says he doesn t know whether the C I A  acted on the memo  as the Washington Post reported    He even says that he has never had the occasion to come to definitive views about the analysis in the memo    Far from helping to clear the air  Mr  Gonzales has clouded it further  To let his nomination proceed would make a mockery of the notion of Congressional oversight and accountability    There are many other issues in Mr  Gonzales s record that should give members of the Senate pause    As predicted by Secretary Powell and senior military lawyers  Mr  Gonzales s memorandum of January 2002 on the applicability of the Geneva Conventions to the war in Afghanistan brought a strong negative reaction from even our closest allies and lowered the bar for the protection of our own troops     According to the Schlesinger Report  in September 2003 military commanders in Iraq cited this memo as legal justification for the use of extreme interrogation techniques at Abu Ghraib prison  The worst abuses there occurred from September to December 2003    In his answers to the Committee  Mr  Gonzales made clear that the Administration does not consider the C I A  to be bound by the prohibition on cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment in Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture  This shift in legal policy was apparently made in a separate Justice Department memorandum which has also not been provided to Congress     Today  therefore  C I A  agents are authorized to treat detainees in a cruel  inhuman  and degrading manner   even if it violates constitutional rules in the U S    so long as they do not commit torture under the Department s narrow definition  President Bush also exempted the C I A  from his directive in February 2002 to treat all detainees humanely  This shameful change in policy obviously endangers the safety of American soldiers who are captured abroad     Finally  the New York Times reported that Mr  Gonzales excluded important Administration personnel from deliberations on the Administration s plan to establish military tribunals at Guantanamo  a plan that was widely criticized as unjust  unworkable  and unconstitutional  Secretary of State Powell  National Security Advisor Rice  and the head of the Justice Department s Criminal Division  Michael Chertoff  saw the President s Military Order only after it was published in November 2001  Most of the Pentagon s top military lawyers were also kept in the dark  More than three years after the Order s publication  not a single detainee at Guantanamo has been successfully prosecuted  To the contrary  as predicted by officials who have expertise in the field  the military tribunal process there is falling apart                 Torture has never before been a Republican versus Democrat issue  Instead  it s always been an issue of broad consensus and ideals  reflecting the fundamental values of the nation  President Reagan signed the Convention Against Torture in 1988  President George H W  Bush and President Clinton supported its ratification in 1994  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee  led by Senator Helms and Senator Pell  voted 10 0 to report the Convention favorably to the full Senate     I hope that this tradition of bipartisanship and consensus will continue today  I hope that all members of the Senate will cast their vote in a way that upholds our fundamental values    A no vote is the right vote if we care about maintaining America s standing in the world and fighting the war on terrorism  The torture and other abuses of prisoners in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo have done immense damage to America s standing in the world  The extreme and irresponsible claims in the Bybee and Goldsmith Memorandums have raised basic questions about the genuineness of our commitment to the rule of law    It is the right vote for our troops  The Administration s shameful disregard for our laws and treaties on torture has lowered the bar for the protection of our own soldiers  It has violated the military s longstanding golden rule  treat captured combatants in the manner we expect our own soldiers to be treated  What can Mr  Gonzales possibly say to a country that justifies its torture of a U S  soldier by citing Mr  Gonzales s own record of support for it    A no vote is the only vote that is consistent with the fundamental values on which this nation is founded  justice  accountability  and respect for individual dignity    The continuing effort to blame the torture scandal on a few bad apples among our soldiers while rewarding Mr  Gonzales with promotion to Attorney General is a despicable signal for America to send the world  We should not support a nominee who has done so much to harm America s basic interests and fundamental values  I urge my colleagues to reject this nomination      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
