         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Senator Kennedy participated in the HELP Committees Roundtable discussion on the Family Medical Leave Act  Below are his remarks and a fact sheet on his Healthy Family s Act Millions of hard working men and women are facing an increasingly impossible choice today between the jobs they need and the families they love  The percentage of two parent families in which both parents work has doubled since 1970  more than 10 million single parents are struggling to balance their jobs and their family obligations  and nearly 21 million full time employees are also caregivers for elderly relatives The delicate balance between work and family becomes especially difficult when a new child arrives or a medical emergency strikes  I learned this first hand when my son was diagnosed with cancer and lost his leg in 1973  Months of difficult treatment followed  and he had the good fortune to become cancer free and return to a full life  I was fortunate enough to be able to take the time I needed to be there for him In 1993  with the strong support of the National Partnership for Women and Families and many others  Congress enacted the Family and Medical Leave Act  In the twelve years since then  the Act has been a significant success  enabling more than 50 million Americans to take time off when they needed it most without fearing the loss of their job  These enormous benefits to working families have come with little cost to businesses  A Labor Department report in 2000 found that the Act has had a positive or neutral effect on 90  of businesses  profitability and 84  of businesses  productivity Despite its success  however  the Act is now under attack by opponents who are calling on the Department of Labor to undercut its critical protections  They want to narrow the definition of serious health condition  The current regulations allow for job protected leave when an employee needs more than three days of treatment and recovery  and it s a fair and reasonable requirement If the opponents  current proposal had been in effect over the last twelve years  it would have excluded 25 million workers who used the Act for serious illnesses such as acute appendicitis  heart attacks  strokes  hernia repairs  and pneumonia Opponents also propose a change in the intermittent leave regulations  which could force employees who require frequent  short treatments   such as for chemotherapy  dialysis  occupational and physical therapy  or pre natal visits   to exhaust their leave  It would burden employers with additional administrative costs as well These changes would be flagrantly inconsistent with the needs of today s workers and would eliminate much needed flexibility  Surely  Congress and the Administration should not undercut the Act when the problem of the work family balance is now taking a heavy toll on working families  Instead  we should be building on the Act s success by expanding it  The current Act does not provide protection to employees in firms with fewer than 50 employees It also does not allow leave when parents need time to be more involved in their children s schools  I have co sponsored the Family Medical Leave Expansion Act  S  282  which Senator Dodd has introduced to address both of these issues As employees try to balance work and family  they also need paid time off for everyday illnesses and preventive care  such as annual check ups  or when their child is sick with a cold  or when an elderly parent needs to be taken to a doctor  To deal with these problems  I have introduced the Healthy Families Act  S 932  which would directly benefit 66 million Americans by guaranteeing workers seven paid sick days a year to meet their medical needs and those of their family members Senator Kennedy s Healthy Families Act will guarantee seven days of annual paid leave for workers to address medical needs and care for family members  It will   Guarantee paid sick days for an employee s medical condition  an employee s doctor s appointment  or other preventive or diagnostic treatment  and to care for a family member with comparable needs   Provide prorated leave for part time employees working between 20 and 30 hours a week or between 1 000 and 1 500 hours a year  seven days for workers with more than 30 hours a week    Apply to all employers with at least 15 or more employees   Place no new burden on employers that already meet the minimum standards   Encourage employers to provide greater benefits   Allow employers to request certification for leave for employees who request 3 or more consecutive days  Employers must keep health information confidential and separate from personnel files   Require employers to post notice of the availability of paid sick leave and how to file an enforcement action  Allow an employee or the Secretary of Labor to bring civil action in federal or state court for equitable relief or to recover damages   Require a GAO study of how these paid sick leave policies are implemented and the benefits and costs of the leave to employers and employees   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
