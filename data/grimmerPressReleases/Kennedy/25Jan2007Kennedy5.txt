         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY ON SENATE FLOOR The President continues to insist on his policy of escalating the war in Iraq  when many of us are increasingly convinced that de escalation is the only realistic strategy  The American people do not support further escalation of this war   Our top generals dont support it  and a bipartisan majority of Congress dont support it either   The Administration is still in deep denial about the perilous path it continues to pursue in Iraq    Just this week  Vice President Cheney denied that Iraq is a terrible situation   He said  Weve had enormous successes  and we will continue to have enormous successes     Its beyond belief that he could use such words  when General Petraeus told the Armed Service Committee this week that the situation in Iraq is dire  An escalation of American forces would be an immense new mistake  and will only compound the original misguided decision to invade Iraq     Public support for the war does not exist  and there is no support for sending more troops into the civil war in Baghdad   We have surged our forces four times in the past  and each time the underlying political conditions havent changed  In his State of the Union Address  the President called on the Iraqi people to act  and he said they know that our commitment is not open ended   In fact  our military commitment is open ended    That open ended commitment has made our troops a crutch for the Iraqi government and prevented it from making the political compromises essential to end the violence   The Administration has outlined benchmarks for the Iraqis to achieve  but there is no timeline for ensuring that the Iraqis will take key steps    There are no consequences  such as the withdrawal of American forces    if the benchmarks are not met    and there should be  The President talked about the dire consequences of failure in Iraq   But the Administrations policy ignores the importance of regional diplomacy in mitigating the damage caused by the reckless war in Iraq     Everyone acknowledges that Iran is an enormous problem  Tragically  the war in Iraq has made it far more difficult for America to deal effectively with Iran   Sending more American troops into Iraqs civil war is not the answer    It is not in the interest of peace  security  and stability of Iraq or the interest of our soldiers  We need a political solution and reconciliation  not more troops  Iraq is an enormous problem for the region and the entire international community  Rather than isolating  ignoring  and threatening Iraqs neighbors  including Iran and Syria  we need to talk to them and try to persuade them to stop stoking the flames of civil war  When the President addressed the nation on Tuesday night  he was talking about a very different war than what Americans know to be the reality in Iraq today   There is absolutely no doubt that the war today is not the war that Congress authorized four years ago  Now  its a civil war   Its not about weapons of mass destruction or Saddam Husseins alleged relationship with Al Qaeda   Its Iraqi against Iraqi   Iraq is at war with itself  and American soldiers are caught in the middle  Our people are becoming angrier by the day as the war rages on   They expect Congress to be an effective restraint on the President and his misuse of the war power    Opposition to the escalation of the Iraq war is becoming louder   How much clearer does the opposition have to be before the President finally listens and responds to the voices of the American people  the generals  and a bipartisan majority of Congress  General Abizaid doesnt support this escalation   He told the Senate Armed Services Committee more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more  from taking more responsibility for their own future   He said  Ive met with every divisional commander   General Casey  the corps commander  General Dempsey  we all talked together   And I said  In your professional opinion  if we were to bring in more American troops now  does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq  And they all said no   And the reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more  General James Conway  Commandant of the Marine Corps  doesnt support it   He said  We do not believe that just adding numbers for the sake of adding numbers  just thickening the mix  is necessarily the way to go  Secretary Powell said that he is not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purpose s of suppressing this communitarian violence  this civil war  will work  General Barry McCaffrey  former Vice Chief of Staff for the United States Army  thinks it wont work   He said  Putting another 20 000 to 30 000 troops  particularly into urban combat in a city of seven million Arabs of Baghdad  is a fools errand   It is sticking your finger in the water   When you pull your finger out  their presence will not have made a difference  General Hoar  former head of CENTCOM  told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week that The addition of 21 000 troops is too little and too late   This is still not enough to quell the violence  and without major changes in the command and control of forces within Baghdad  the current set up for shared control is unsatisfactory  Passage of the bipartisan resolution approved yesterday in the Foreign Relations Committee is an important statement about the need for a different course in Iraq   I will support it  The President cannot continue to unilaterally impose his failing policy on an America that has already rejected it   Congress has a constitutional duty to stop the President from sending more of our sons and daughters into this civil war   I have introduced legislation which would require the President to get the authority he needs from Congress before moving forward with a further escalation in Iraq  and I intend to seek a vote on it  This is a debate about what is best for our troops and our national security   Our forces have served with great valor   Theyve done everything theyve been asked to do   Sending more of them into a civil war will not make success any more likely   My proposal will obviously require additional planning by the military if a troop cap is put in place  and I have every confidence in the militarys ability to do that Congress did not authorize the President in 2002 to send our troops into the middle of a civil war    We have a responsibility  and a constitutional obligation    to vote on this escalation  We have the law and precedent on our side   Congress has exercised its authority to shape ongoing conflicts in the past  including by capping the involvement of U S  military forces   During the Vietnam War  as successive presidents escalated the hostilities in defiance of mounting opposition  Congress finally responded   We repealed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution  the original authorization for using military force in Vietnam     We cut off appropriations to prevent the escalation of that war into Cambodia and Laos   And then we took the decisive step of capping the number of American troops in South Vietnam   The Foreign Assistance Act of 1974 mandated that the number of American civilian and armed forces could not exceed 4 000 within six months and 3 000 within one year of the bills enactment  We have a responsibility to vote on this issue now  before it is too late   The American people deserve to know whether we intend to act to prevent the President from sending even more of our forces into the middle of this civil war in Iraq  President Bush is on notice   I look forward to early action by the Senate and the House of Representatives on the non binding resolution approved yesterday against the escalation of the war  and all of us hope the President will act accordingly  So far  however  he has given every indication that he intends to pursue his present course of escalation   That course is unacceptable  and we in Congress must be prepared to do more than pass a non binding resolution opposing it   The issue is too important  and we have a constitutional responsibility of our own to act in this crisis  not just talk about it       Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner       202  224 2633
