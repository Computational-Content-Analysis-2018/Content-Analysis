         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today s Senate action adding  1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program for this winter will hopefully become a step in the right direction  but much of it seems to be smoke and mirrors  Once again  we ve failed to provide enough actual assistance to millions of struggling families around the country  many of whom are elderly or disabled When we left for the holiday recess last December  we felt we had a commitment from the Senate Majority Leader to bring up a bill to add  2 billion for LIHEAP  But today s bill offers only half that amount  and it obtains that amount by taking it from the LIHEAP funds allocated for next winter under the Budget Reconciliation Bill  Shamefully  the budget released yesterday by President Bush for next winter requests no increase at all in LIHEAP from this year s level of  2 18 billion  which is far less than the  5 1 billion authorized by Congress for the current year  As a result  only  1 8 billion will be available for next winter  so this same battle will have to be fought all over again later this year  Robbing 2007 funds to pay 2006 home heating costs makes no sense  Republicans must think global warming will reduce the need for LIHEAP next winter  otherwise their callous neglect of this basic need to help millions of families is immoral and inexplicable Worst of all  under today s bill  only  250 million of the  1 billion in new funds for this winter must be released immediately through the LIHEAP formula grants to states  The other  750 million is in the form of emergency funds  which can be released or withheld at President Bush s discretion  That means the states may actually obtain far less  or none at all  of that amount  Families need this assistance urgently  and they will be watching George Bush closely to see how much he cares In fact  countless citizens in communities throughout America live year round with the constant threat of power shut offs because they can t pay their energy bills  and they have no confidence that either Congress or this President are on their side According to a report by the National Energy Assistance Directors  Association  since the winter of 2001 2002  the average cost of heating oil soared from  627 to  1474  natural gas from  465 to  1000 and propane from  736 to  1286  Yet  the Republican Congress and the Administration continue to ignore the fact that millions of Americans can t afford these steep increases Democrats have pressed for months to increase funds for LIHEAP to the authorized level of  5 1 billion  We ve urged the Republican leadership and the President to act  but the Republican majority has blocked our efforts at every turn  and families are paying a steep price for that neglect  The average LIHEAP grant has decreased by almost 10 percent since 2002  and is now only  288 In Massachusetts  the state government has provided  20 million in additional funds for LIHEAP this year  Low income families are more fortunate in our state than in most other states on this issue  but there is still great need  Even the poorest households with the highest bills will get no more than  840  less than half what is needed to get through the winter As Self Help  a community action program in Avon  Massachusetts has said  Many of our clients have exhausted their benefits  and virtually all of our clients that heat with oil will exhaust their benefit before the end of January   and the worst of the winter is still to come  The bottom line is that we need some kind of relief  as quickly as possible ABCD  a community action agency in Boston  reports that as of January 17th  the number of applicants applying for fuel assistance for the first time has increased by 26 percent  Its clients are currently exhausting all of their fuel assistance benefits  Even a benefit of  765 buys only one tank of oil at today s price of  2 40 per gallon  when at least two or three tankfuls are needed to get through the winter  and no other source of funding is available These aren t just numbers  They represent real people facing real hardships  An elderly couple lives in a modest home on the outskirts of Haverhill and both receive social security benefits  Their home is heated with oil and they use an old woodstove in the basement to supplement their steam boiler  Their  525 LIHEAP grant covered one delivery of 256 gallons of oil in late November  Attempting to cut wood for the woodstove  the husband fell from a ladder and was injured  If LIHEAP had been funded fairly  this injury could have been prevented It s wrong to let people like this suffer  It s wrong that we have a President and a Congress who continue to say Let them eat cake I ask unanimous consent that a table on LIHEAP authorizations and appropriations may be printed at this point in the Record   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
