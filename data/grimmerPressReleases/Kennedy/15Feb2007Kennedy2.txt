         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FACT SHEET INCLUDED   Mr  President  its a privilege to join Senator Bond in introducing The Arthritis Prevention  Control and Cure Act  Our goal in this important initiative is to provide a strong federal response to arthritis  Early diagnosis  treatment  and appropriate management of arthritis can control its symptoms  improve the quality of life of patients  and Federal action will improve the lives of the family members and caregivers of those affected by the disease  Arthritis exits in more than a hundred different forms  Its one of the most devastating diseases impairing the health of the American people  Its second only to heart disease as a cause of work disability  It undermines everyday activities such as walking  dressing and bathing for more than seven million Americans One out of every five adults in the United States suffers from some form of arthritis  The number of patients in the U S  with arthritis will keep growing as the number of older Americans continues to increase dramatically in the next few decades  Today  8 7 million adults  ages 18 through 44  have arthritis and millions of others are at risk of developing the disease In fact  arthritis is one of the most prevalent chronic illnesses and the leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15  More than 40 percent adults with arthritis are limited in their activities because of their arthritis  By 2030  nearly 25 percent of the projected United States adult population will have arthritis and these numbers dont account for the current trends in obesity  which may contribute to future cases of the disease Its an illness that affects all types of people in the U S   not just older Americans  Arthritis knows no boundaries  Men  women and children are all afflicted with the disease  According to the Arthritis Foundation  24 million women and 17 million men have been diagnosed with arthritis by their doctors  Women are still disproportionately affected by the disease  Nearly 3 out of every 1 000 American children are affected by arthritis  The devastating effects of pediatric arthritis justifies greater investment by the federal government in research and to identify more effective treatments Special concerns are raised by juvenile arthritis because of its impact on family relationships  school life  dating  sports and other aspects active  growing youths  Teens and young adults entering the workforce face even greater challenges Arthritis and other rheumatic diseases cost our economy  128 billion annually  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  In 2003  the cost was equivalent to 1 2 percent of the nations gross domestic product   80 million of that amount were direct costs for medical care and  47 million were indirect costs for lost earnings  National medical costs attributed to arthritis grew by 24 percent between 1997 and 2003  with an increase attributed to the growing number of people affected with the disease In 1975  Congress enacted the National Arthritis Act to encourage basic and clinical research  establish Multipurpose Arthritis Centers and expand clinical knowledge of the illness  The Act was successful in implementing and continued funding of research and has led to important advances in the control  treatment and prevention of the illness Early diagnosis  treatment and management can control symptoms and improve the quality of life  Weight control and exercise can help lower risks  Patient education  training and self management also contribute to greater control of these diseases  Innovative and increasingly effective drug therapies  joint replacements  and other therapeutic alternatives are being developed  Despite much research identifying effective interventions  many of them are being used well enough and the inevitable result is unnecessary loss of life  poorer health and poorer quality of life Our legislation will expand effort to find new ways to prevent  treat and care for patients with arthritis and related rheumatic diseases  It will enhance the National Arthritis Action Plan by providing additional support to federal  state and private efforts to prevent and manage arthritis  It will establish a National Arthritis Education and Outreach Campaign to inform the health care profession and the public about the most successful self management strategies for controlling the illness  With greater coordination and intensification of federal research  this bill will organize a National Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases Summit to look at the challenges and opportunities related to these efforts  In addition  the bill will provide greater attention to juvenile arthritis research by offering planning grants for research specific to juveniles and by prioritizing the activities that create better understanding of the incidence and outcomes associated with juvenile arthritis Finally the bill contains incentives to encourage health professionals to enter the field of pediatric rheumatology by education loan repayment and career development awards  I urge my colleagues to support this public health initiative to reduce the pain and disability of arthritis  Early diagnosis  effective treatment and greater investment in research and prevention can help us was a stronger battle against one of the most widespread and devastating conditions affecting our nation   S  626  THE ARTHRITIS PREVENTION  CONTROL AND CURE ACT Introduced by Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Senator Christopher S  Bond Arthritis  A National EpidemicArthritis and related rheumatic diseases are among the most common conditions in the United States and can cause severe and chronic pain  swollen tissue  ligament and joint destruction

the lives of their family members and caregivers   One out of every five  or nearly 46 million  adults in the United States suffers from arthritis or chronic joint symptoms  The number of individuals with arthritis will grow as the number of older Americans continues to increase in the next few decades   Arthritis and related rheumatic diseases are the leading cause of disability among adults in the United States  Over 40 percent  or nearly 19 million  adults with arthritis are limited in their activities because of their arthritis  Arthritis and related rheumatic diseases affect all types of people in the U S   not just older individuals  Arthritis and other rheumatic diseases disproportionately affect women in the United States  8 7 million young adults ages 18 through 44 have arthritis and nearly 300 000 children in the U S  or 3 out of every 1 000 have some form of arthritis or other rheumatic disease  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the total costs

were direct costs for medical care and  47 billion were indirect costs for lost earnings  National medical costs attributable to arthritis grew by 24 percent between 1997 and 2003  This rise in medical costs resulted from an increase in the number of people with arthritis and other rheumatic conditions  Fighting Back  Providing a Strong Federal Response to ArthritisEarly diagnosis  treatment  and appropriate management of arthritis can control symptoms and improve quality of life  The Arthritis Prevention  Control and Cure Act  S  626  would expand the federal governments efforts to find new ways to prevent  treat  and care for patients with Arthritis and related rheumatic diseases by  Enhancing the National Arthritis Action Plan by providing additional support to federal  state  and private efforts to prevent and manage arthritis  Developing a National Arthritis Education and Outreach Campaign to educate the health care profession and the public on successful self management strategies for controlling arthritis  Ensuring greater coordination and intensification of federal research efforts by organizing a National Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases Summit to look at challenges and opportunities related to basic  clinical and translational research and development efforts  Providing greater attention to the area of juvenile arthritis research through the creation of planning grants for innovative research specific to juvenile arthritis  as well as the prioritization of epidemiological activities focused on better understanding the prevalence  incidence  and outcomes associated with juvenile arthritis  Creating incentives to encourage health professionals to enter the field of pediatric rheumatology through the establishment of an education loan repayment
