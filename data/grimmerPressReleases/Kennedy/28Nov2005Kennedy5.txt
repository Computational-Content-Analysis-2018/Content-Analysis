         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     BOSTON  MA    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy discussed the challenges of poverty at Wheaton College upon receiving the Otis Social Justice Award  which is awarded to individuals who enhance the understanding of peace  human rights and economic opportunity  Kennedy shared his views of how the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina shined a spotlight on the economic and social injustice that persists in our communities and the work that remains unfinished  He outlined his fight for an increase in the minimum wage which has kept millions of working men and women in poverty  unable to achieve the American dream despite their efforts to work hard and play by the rules  He also discussed his war on poverty and his determination to cut child poverty in half within this decade     Raising the minimum wage is not just an economic issue  It s a women s issue  It s a civil rights issue  It s a family issue  But    perhaps more than anything    the minimum wage is a moral issue  Senator Kennedy said  Over the last five years the Bush administration has done a lot for the powerful and the wealthy  They have done a lot for corporate America  But they have done little to provide for the working people who are struggling to survive    Kennedy has led the fight to increase the minimum wage in the U S  Senate  but has been blocked at every turn by Senators who continued to turn a blind eye  In the aftermath of Katrina  he offered a minimum wage amendment to the transportation appropriations bill last month and the measure was defeated  Since the last increase in 1997 costs of health care  education  housing  home heating and fuel have skyrocketed  leaving many families left out and left behind  Also since this time  members of Congress have raised their own pay eight times     Next week  Senator Kennedy will join in a conference hosted by the Center for American Progress to address the groundswell of grassroost support for an increase in the minimum wage and in the activity happening across the country to push state initiatives through  This month  Senator Kennedy joined national religious leaders in Washington  DC to announce the Let Justice Roll Living Wage Campaign  This grassroots effort will team religious and community leaders with legislators to do right by the American worker and finally raise the minimum wage through ballot initiatives throughout the country  Frustrated by federal inaction  the Let Justice Roll Living Wage Campaign teamed over 50 religious and community groups with legislators to fight for an increased minimum wage through ballot initiatives on the ground in 2006    The minimum wage hasn t increased since 1997  yet Americans increasingly feel the squeeze of the Bush economy  Americans are spending 74 percent more on gas than they did at the beginning of 2001  Heating oil prices are expected to rise by 56 percent this winter  Such rapid price increases will force consumers  especially the poor  to cut spending on clothing  health care and food just so they can get to work and keep warm this winter  The minimum wage was intended to ensure the working Americans would not have to make choices between heating and health care  Instead  our stagnant minimum wage has done the opposite and left even those with multiple jobs desperately straining to make ends meet    Kennedy believes that we must marshal all our resources to combat poverty and he believes that cutting it in half within this decade is an attainable goal  To do this  Kennedy offered an amendment to the Tax Reconciliation bill earlier this month that would require a one percent surtax to be paid by our wealthiest citizens in order to take care of the needs of our most vulnerable citizens  With the 3 5 billion dollars generated from the one percent tax  the Child Poverty Elimination Fund will be created in order to combat child poverty in America where it starts  in the homes of low income Americans looking for a way to feed their hungry children  The amendment failed in the U S  Senate    Today  nearly one child in six is living in poverty  37 million men  women  and children in the United States live below the poverty linean increase of over 5 million since President Bush was first elected  The poverty rate for children in the United States is substantially higher    often two to three times higher    than that of most other major Western industrialized nations  And the number of Americans living in hunger or on the verge of hunger has soared to 38 million  including 14 million children    Wheaton College is dedicated to the value of community  integrity diversity and service  Each year  the Otis Social Justice Award has been awarded to those who promote these values and enrich the understanding of peace  world hunger  human rights and economic opportunity  Past recipients of the award include former Surgeon General C  Everett Koop  school reform advocate Jonathan Kozol and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson          Poverty in the United States   Massachusetts  570 000 people  9 2 percent  live below the poverty line in Massachusetts       182 000 children  12 5 percent  live in poverty      93 000 children  6 percent  live in extreme povertythey live below 50 percent of the poverty line  National  The official poverty rate in 2004 was 12 7 percent  up from 12 5 percent in 2003  The poverty rate has risen for four consecutive yearsthe rate was 11 3 percent in 2000      In 2004  37 million people were in poverty  an increase of 5 4 million people since 2000      Poverty rates remain unchanged for Blacks  24 7 percent  and Hispanics  21 9 percent   rose for non Hispanic Whites  8 6 percent in 2004  up from 8 2 percent in 2003   and decreased for Asians  9 8 percent in 2004  down from 11 8 percent in 2003       13 million children  17 8 percent  live in povertyan increase of 1 4 million since 2000  Children in the United States are more likely to live in poverty than any other age group      In 2004  more than one in five children under the age of five years  20 5   in the U S  lived in poverty      African American children and Latino Children are much more likely to live in poverty than white children  One third of African American children are low income  as are nearly a third of Latino children      7 out of 10 poor children live in a working family  and 1 poor child in 3 lives with a full time year round worker      Over 8 million children under 18 in the U S  lack health insurance  With a 2004 uninsured rate of almost 19 percent  poor children are more likely to be uninsured than children generally      Both the poverty rate and number in poverty increased for people 18 to 64 years old  11 3 percent and 20 5 million in 2004  up from 10 8 percent and 19 4 million in 2003       The poverty rate decreased for seniors aged 65 and over  9 8 percent in 2004  down from 10 2 percent in 2003  The number in poverty in 2004  3 5 million  remained unchanged      The increase in poverty under President Bush can be contrasted with the Clinton years    between 1993 and 2000  more than 8 million families  including four million kids    moved out of poverty  and the total poverty rate fell 25   from 15 1  to 11 3   the lowest level since 1974           Hunger in the United States   Massachusetts  In Massachusetts  over 7 percent of households  179 000 households  are food insecurean increase of 6 percent since the period between 1999 and 2001  Almost 3 percent of all households  66 000 households  are food insecure with hungera 35 percent increase since the period between 1999 and 2001      Hungry households  for the most part  live in pockets of poverty in the state  Among families with children in low income communities the prevalence of hunger is four times greater than it is statewide      Project Bread supports over 400 emergency food programs in 136 different communities across Massachusetts  This statewide network reported serving 40 million meals to people in need in 2004  representing a 29 percent increase since 2001      Project Bread s FoodSource Hotline answered over 35 000 calls between October 2004 and September 2005  Calls have increased by 59 percent in the last three years      Of all those served by emergency food programs funded by Project Bread  33 percent were children  even though children make up only 24 percent of the population in Massachusetts      National    Over 38 million Americans  13 2 percent  now live in hungry and food insecure households  This represents an increase of 5 million since 2000  Almost 11 million Americans are food insecure with hunger      13 5 million households are food insecure  4 million households are food insecure with hungera 43 percent increase over the past 5 years  1999 2004       Over 36 percent of the individuals living in food insecure households are children  Almost 14 million children under the age of 18 are food insecurean increase of 972 000 since 2000  3 3 million children are food insecure with hunger      Households with children have double the rate of food insecurity when compared to households without children  17 6 percent v  8 9 percent       Households with income below the official poverty line have a higher rate of food insecurity  36 8 percent   as do single female headed households with children  33 percent   black non Hispanic households  23 7 percent   single male headed households with children  22 2 percent   and Hispanic households  21 7 percent       Over 47 percent of all food insecure households have incomes above 130 percent of poverty  which in most cases would make these houses ineligible for food stamps     NOTE  Food insecurity refers to the lack of access to enough food to fully meet basic needs at all times due to lack of financial resources  There are different levels of food insecurity  Food insecure with hunger is the highest level           THE UNITED STATES MUST SET A GOAL OF ENDING CHILD POVERTY   Senator Kennedy s amendment sets a national goal of cutting child poverty in half within a decade  and to eliminate it entirely as soon as possible thereafter  It enacts a one percent surtax to be paid by our wealthiest citizens in order to meet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens      America s children are more likely to live in poverty than Americans in any other age group      One in six children lives in poverty in the United States      The poverty rate for children in the United States is substantially higher than that of most other major Western industrialized nations  Denmark and Finland have a child poverty rate of less than 3 percent compared to 17 8 percent in the United States      African American and Latino children are much more likely to live in poverty than white children  One third of African American children are low income  as are nearly a third of Latino children      A growing number of poor children are the children of immigrants  Children of immigrants comprise more than 26 percent of all low income children in the United States      Reducing child poverty is one of the best investments that Americans can make in their nation s future  Fewer children in poverty will mean     o more children entering school ready to learn   o more successful schools and fewer school dropouts   o better child health and less strain on hospitals   o less stress on the juvenile justice system  and  o less child hunger and malnutrition     We must commit to ending child poverty  They ve done it in Great Britain  with great success  It is possible  No child in this country should have to live in poverty          Remarks of Senator Edward M  Kennedy in Acceptance of the 2006 Otis Social Justice Award November 28  2005   Thank you President Crutcher for that generous introduction and for your leadership at this wonderful college and on this beautiful campus    And thank you Alexander Dewar    this year s Wheaton Rhodes Scholar  Alex is ably carrying on your strong tradition of leadership and scholarship as the third Rhodes Scholar from Wheaton in just five years  Well done  Alex  And well done to all of you here at Wheaton     It s a great  great honor to be at Wheaton today  I don t need to tell you that Wheaton is a special place  You have recognized that in today s world    with global challenges that transcend borders    we must prepare students to think in new ways  And you re doing that every day  as you encourage students to look beyond the horizon and to think across disciplines to develop creative solutions to the issues of the day    So it s a deep privilege to join you today   And it s a special honor to be awarded the 2005 Otis Social Justice Award today    In my family  we were taught that a just society is measured by its commitment to the least of those in our midst    to the poor  the oppressed  to those who need hope    And we were taught that to whom much has been given  much is expected and that each of us has an obligation to make a contribution to the best of our ability   If you look out over the past 50 years in American life  there s no doubt that we ve experienced an extraordinary march of progress toward a more just society    and for that we can be most certainly grateful    Institutionalized racism is rightly viewed as abhorrent  This was not the case when I entered the United States Senate  Today  Americans are protected by the Civil Rights Act  the Voting Rights Act  and other laws    and American society rejects calls for racial division    Women are no longer barred from pursuing courses of study and the vocations they choose  Title Nine and laws against employment discrimination have enabled our nation to reap an enormous economic benefit because those shackles have been removed    Our senior citizens no longer fall over a cliff of poverty just because they retire  You know  before Medicare passed some forty years ago  half of our seniors and the disabled lived in poverty  But today  over 40 million American seniors and disabled have a guaranteed right to quality care  and that depravation is but a fraction    And the Americans with Disabilities Act    now in its fifteenth year    represents our national commitment that the disabled must not be relegated to the shadows  Disabled does not mean unable  and those with disabilities are equal members of our society  too    These are great and bold achievements   They have made us a better  fairer  and stronger America      But our work is not over  Our march of progress must go on  America must always look forward and to lead our country to live up to its highest ideals    to make the American Dream a reality for all our citizens    We think of the unspeakable poverty revealed by Katrina and wonder how can our fellow Americans live in such neglect      We wonder how it can be that so many children and so many young people can be left behind with so little hope and so few opportunities    We think of immigrants who work their fingers to the bone toiling in the hot sun    in restaurant kitchens    in meatpacking plants    with few real protections from injury or exploitation    We think of the parents who work 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year and watch their children go to bed hungry because Congress has refused to increase the minimum wage for seven long years    even as they accept annual cost of living increases themselves that often amount to automatic  6 000 raises    That s right  A worker who works for the minimum wage in this country and works full time will earn  10 700 a year  That s  4 500 below the poverty line for a family of three  Surely we ve reached a point in our nation s history were we can say that no one who works full time should live in poverty    Yet that s the sad truth for millions of our fellow citizens today  More than 37 million Americans live in poverty    12 million of whom are children    and that number has increased every year for the past four years    And today 7 out of every 10 poor children lives in a working family    How can this be and how can we tolerate that 182 000 children in our own state of Massachusetts live in poverty    And the price of poverty weighs heaviest on America s minorities  One third of African American children are low income as are nearly one third of Latino children    We also think of the millions of American families without access to affordable health care  Today  more than 46 million Americans have no health insurance at all    For these of our fellow citizens  a sick child not only worries a family  but can send it into bankruptcy    Our work to fulfill the American dream must encompass not only the poor  but should open the doors of opportunity for all Americans  especially as we equip our citizens to rise to the challenges of the global economy    We should rise to the global challenge not by lowering our wages  but by raising our skills  so that America continues to chart a path of progress  not only at home  but around the globe    We should strengthen our public schools  so they are the envy of the world    We should make college affordable to every single American who completes high school successfully    We should expand opportunities in math and in the sciences  to enable the innovation that will improve lives at home and abroad    We should once and for all end the inequity of health care in this country  by ensuring that all our citizens have access to the care they need     And we should adopt enlightened policies that strengthen our cooperation with our allies  not policies that make our progress in the world more difficult    Without question  the concern at the forefront of our mind during this holiday season is the War in Iraq and the enormous sacrifices being made by the families and loved ones of the brave men and women serving us overseas     Today  there are over 150 000 US troops in Iraq  and more than 2 000 have made the ultimate sacrifice    in Massachusetts alone  we ve lost more than 40 men and women    Their service under the most difficult of circumstances requires all of us to demand a policy worthy of their sacrifice and not to rely on empty slogans such as stay the course    They deserve a plan that does not make them a target of violence overseas  and that provides for their safe and timely return home     They ve done everything that s been asked of them    they ve stayed true to the mission even when the rationale supporting it shifted    and this Congress and the President owe them an equal commitment to bringing them home with the honor and dignity befitting their rightful status as heroes     Beyond Iraq  we must now also redouble our efforts at finding real solutions to the world s great problems with our allies  because the task is too great for military solutions alone    We re reminded that this December 10th marks the 57th anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that recognizes that the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are the foundation of freedom  justice and peace in the world    But as we look out into the wider world  we see that the goals of that declaration are not being met    Freedom of the press is being undermined in Russia and other countries     freedom of religion is under attack for religious minorities across the globe in countries like China  Eritrea  and Vietnam    Poverty and disease run rampant through developing countries creating hopelessness among people and threatening the stability of nations across Africa and throughout the Middle East    Today nearly  30 000 children in the world still die before their fifth birthday    and 400 million children lack access to safe drinking water     140 million children have never been to school  and 90 million are severely food deprived    The scourge of AIDS runs rampant through entire civilizations in large part because of a lack of education as to its causes and a lack of affordable medicines to keep it at bay    When the human dignity of so many is undermined  we all suffer      From the former Soviet Union to South Africa to Chile to Afghanistan and Tibet  Americans have given comfort to those struggling for the basic freedoms we enjoy each and every day  and it s time to take up the mantle of leadership again    We cannot close our eyes to the seriousness of the problems that still haunt mankind across the globe    As the world s remaining great power  America must take the lead on addressing these issues    we must be the one who pulls other nations together    who drives the United Nations  humanitarian agenda    and who pushes all nations to come together to solve these great challenges    We can t continue to pretend that these are the responsibilities of others  because in this interconnected world they are our problems too     There is no question both at home and abroad that we face enormous challenges in living up to our ideals and to creating a better    fairer    more just    more secure    and more hopeful    planet    In many ways  the obstacles can seem daunting    the problems unsolvable    the task too difficult    for any one of us to address    But then we remember a time in America where segregation was the law of this land  and a time in the not to distant past when Apartheid in South Africa seemed unshakeable     And then we remember those individuals who stood up    Rosa Parks  who left us just recently    Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu in South Africa    and Dr  Martin Luther King  who marched on Washington and to Selma to demand change    We know from their example that change is possible  even in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles  because it s happened before    and it will happen again    All it requires of us is the will to stand determined and to force that change      It was my brother Jack s belief that each of us can make a difference  and all of us should try  and that principle guided his years in office    Through my career in public service  those words have always sustained me  and it s my great hope that they can do the same for all of you because our nation  and our world need your commitment  energy  and idealism to build a better tomorrow    I thank you all so very much for this great honor    and for allowing me to address you today    and I congratulate you for being part of this impressive Wheaton College family    Thank you all so very much   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
