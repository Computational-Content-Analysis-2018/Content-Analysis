         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Wal Mart s record profits announced today have a darker side that deserves a closer look by Congress and the country  Its soaring profits flow in large part from two key facts    it buys as many of its products as possible from overseas  and it pays its 1 2 million employees the lowest possible wages to sell them     Wal Mart now imports more than half its non food goods  And every day the employees who sell those goods work long hours for low pay    far too low for them to afford the health benefits that Wal Mart cynically claims it offers  Wal Mart breaks child labor laws  forces its employees to work off the clock to avoid paying them for overtime  closes stores when employees attempt to form a union  and discriminates against women and people of color     Hardworking Americans deserve fair treatment  fair pay and fair benefits on the job  But in today s global economy  fewer and fewer American workers are getting their fair share  Those harsh costs don t appear in Wal Mart s profit statement  but Congress can t ignore them      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
