         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  This afternoon  Senator Kennedy will offer his minimum wage bill to the Iraq Supplemental legislation    His bill  which raises the minimum wage from  5 15    7 25 in three steps  passed both the House and the Senate earlier this year   Unfortunately  Republicans have prevented the minimum wage bill from going to conference until they can make sure it includes a big enough tax giveaway for businesses   Had Congress sent the bill to the President right away  minimum wage workers would already be making 70 cents more per hour and 50 000 military families would be benefitting from this increase In the ten years since the minimum wage was last increased  weve given  276 billion in tax breaks for corporate America  along with an additional  36 billion in dedicated tax breaks for small businesses  Senator Kennedy said  Both the House and the Senate have passed tax packages to accompany the minimum wage bill   But still thats not enough   The Republican leadership still is still putting up roadblocks to stop us from doing the right thing for working families  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share my view that it is long past time to give minimum wage workers the raise they deserve  and that we can act quickly to approve this important amendment                                                                                                                                                                                        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
