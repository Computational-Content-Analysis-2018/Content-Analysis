         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  rrence Boyle has been nominated to a life time position on the U S  Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit     one of the most important federal courts in the nation  It often has the last word on laws affecting the daily lives of persons in its region The Fourth Circuit has also become the Administration s forum of choice for cases testing the limits of civil liberties in this post September 11 era  By choosing to hold certain detainees within the Circuit s jurisdiction  the Administration has ensured in several cases that this court would decide the outcome  This was true in the cases of Yaser Hamdi  and Jose Padilla  American citizens whom the government sought to hold indefinitely without access to counsel or judicial review  The Moussaoui case will be tried in the Fourth Circuit  and aspects of it have already been considered there  Although the Supreme Court eventually reviewed the Hamdi case  it hears so few cases  that as a practical matter  the Fourth Circuit has the final word on many vital legal issues The Fourth Circuit also has the highest African American population of any circuit and a rapidly increasing Latino population  As a result  it frequently decides cases affecting the civil rights of minorities It is also widely recognized as the nation s most conservative circuit court  and in recent years  it has taken a sharp turn to the right  Again and again  its decisions have shut the door on meritorious claims for civil rights and criminal justice In especially flagrant cases  the Supreme Court has stepped in  It overruled the Fourth Circuit s decision that states can t outlaw cross burning as a form of racial intimidation  It held that the Fourth Circuit was wrong to rule that federal law enforcement officials need not follow the Miranda decision requiring them to inform suspects of their right to counsel  It held that the Fourth Circuit was wrong when it upheld drug testing for pregnant women without their consent The last thing the Fourth Circuit needs is a judge who will decide cases based on ideology instead of the law  But that s exactly what the President is suggesting by nominating Judge Boyle  As all of us are well aware  Democrats have cooperated to confirm 210 of President Bush s judicial nominees In fact  Judge Boyle s nomination isn t even ripe to be listed on today s agenda  because he failed to fully comply with requests by the Committee to review his unpublished opinions  particularly those involving claims of basic constitutional rights and civil rights  The American people have a right to know Judge Boyle s record before he is promoted to a life time position on the federal court of appeals  They have a right to know how he has ruled on issues important to their everyday lives Judge Boyle indicated months ago during his hearing that all of his unpublished opinions are a matter of public record  and that he d be more than happy to provide them But we ve received opinions covering less than half of Judge Boyle s tenure on the bench  we received civil opinions dating back only to 1997 and criminal opinions back to 1992  But Judge Boyle was confirmed in 1984  So the materials we received leave more than a decade of his record unaccounted for    more than half the time that Judge Boyle has been on the bench In an attempt to move things along    I identified for Judge Boyle the areas that we d need to review first    such as unpublished opinions that have been reversed or criticized on appeal  and those involving basic constitutional and civil rights  We need to receive these opinions  and to consider this nomination based on the entire record  not half a record  His failure to fulfill this simple request shows disrespect for the Committee and for the American people s right to know his record Based on the record before us  it seems that Judge Boyle is an example of a nominee chosen for his radical views  not his qualifications  The Committee should admit that fact and send the White House a clear message that the American people deserve better  Try as they might  Judge Boyle s supporters cannot explain away his unacceptably high reversal rate  His decisions have been reversed or criticized on appeal more than 150 times  far more than any other district judge nominated to a circuit court by President Bush  Too often  these reversals took place because he made the same mistake more than once Time and again  the Fourth Circuit has reversed him for committing plain error  According to the Circuit  that means error so severe and obvious that it goes to the heart of the fairness  integrity  or public reputation of court proceedings  It s one thing for a judge to be overruled on legal issues that are a close call  or that have never been addressed by the court of appeals  It s quite another to be reversed over and over  as Judge Boyle has  for ignoring clear legal precedent His decisions in civil cases show a pattern of too quickly dismissing plaintiffs  claims without giving them their day in court  He s been reversed numerous times for that reason  particularly in cases involving claims of individual rights  He has been reversed at least three times for failing to give parties proper notice and a chance to respond before granting summary judgment against them  as is clearly required under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure In one case  the Fourth Circuit overruled him for granting summary judgment to the defendant without ever considering the plaintiff s objections  Less than a year later  he made the same basic error in another case  and the Fourth Circuit reversed him again on the same ground  This Committee should not confirm a judge who repeatedly makes such fundamental legal errors More troubling still  he has been reversed most often  and has made the most serious mistakes  in the cases that matter most to citizens  daily lives  Time and again  the conservative Fourth Circuit has ruled that Judge Boyle improperly dismissed cases seeking protection for important individual rights  such as the right to free speech  free association  the right to be free from discrimination  and even the right to a fair and lawful sentence in a criminal case In Edwards v  City of Goldsboro  he improperly dismissed the First Amendment claims of a police officer  Sergeant Kenneth Edwards  who had been suspended for teaching courses on concealed handgun safety  The Fourth Circuit held that Judge Boyle abused his discretion by failing to allow Sergeant Edwards to amend his complaint before dismissing the case  As the Fourth Circuit noted  the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure clearly require that permission to amend a complaint shall be freely given when justice so requires  The Fourth Circuit ruled that Judge Boyle ignored well settled law that permission to amend a complaint can be denied only if it would be futile  is requested in bad faith  or would result in prejudice to the defendant  It s difficult to understand how Judge Boyle could be unaware of this basic requirement and its well settled interpretation I m particularly troubled by Judge Boyle s decisions wrongly interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act  the landmark law to ensure that the disabled have genuine access to the American dream  Judge Boyle has repeatedly struck down or mis interpreted important parts of the Act  He ruled in two cases that all of Title II is invalid  In one of these cases  disabled persons challenged fees for the use of handicapped parking spaces  But Judge Boyle dismissed the case  declaring that although Congress had attempted to invoke powers under the Fourteenth Amendment  it had no authority to do so to advance the goals of the ADA  In the other case  he held that Title II is unconstitutional as applied to state prisons  saying that  u nlike traditional anti discrimination laws  the ADA demands entitlement in order to achieve its goals  This the Fourteenth Amendment cannot authorize In my written questions to Judge Boyle  I asked how he could possibly justify these decisions in light of the Supreme Court s holding that Title II is unquestionably valid Fourteenth Amendment legislation as applied to cases involving access to courts and judicial services  His answer was frankly incomprehensible  He stated that his analysis had been adopted by the Supreme Court in Garret v  Alabama  But the Garrett Court had been addressing an entirely different part of the ADA    Title I    which forbids discrimination in employment  The Garrett decision had nothing to do with the case before Judge Boyle  which involved Title II  the part of the Act prohibiting discrimination in public services and state and local government programs As the distinguished Duke University law professor and former ADA litigator  Erwin Chemerinsky  noted in a recent letter to this Committee  Judge Boyle s explanation is simply inaccurate  There is no way to reconcile Judge Boyle s decisions that Congress lacked power to enact Title II  with the Supreme Court s holding that Congress unquestionably had the power to do so  based on the long history of discrimination in state and local government programs  His answers cannot hide that fact  I can only conclude that Judge Boyle either does not understand the law  or is seeking to obscure the issue I am also concerned by Judge Boyle s decision in another case  in which he clearly mis interpreted the ADA s plain language  When Congress passed the ADA  we specifically listed examples of reasonable accommodations under the Act  including reassignment of an employee with a disability to a vacant position  But in this case  Judge Boyle ruled just the opposite of what the law says  concluding that reassigning a disabled worker to another  vacant position is never a reasonable accommodation He tried to explain away the ADA s clear language that specifically identified reassignment to a vacant position  as an example of a reasonable accommodation  He held that these plain words in the law were merely suggestive and have no force of law Although the Fourth Circuit upheld his grant of summary judgment on other grounds  it made absolutely clear that he was wrong in holding that the examples of reasonable accommodation listed in the statute don t have the force of law  As the court of appeals stated   o bviously  Congress considered these types of accommodations to be reasonable  Judge Boyle s willingness to ignore clear statutory language calls into doubt his willingness to enforce the law as written Equally disturbing is Judge Boyle s insistence  in the same case  that courts should not second guess an employer about whether an accommodation is reasonable  and should defer to employers on the issue  The conservative Fourth Circuit also criticized this part of his opinion  explaining that it s the court s job to decide if an accommodation is reasonable  rather than simply taking the employer s word  This Committee must ensure that nominees will give fair treatment to disabled persons who seek the protection of the law These aspects of Judge Boyle s record on disability rights are disturbing enough  because they show a clear disregard for the ADA  Worse still are his repeated comments showing hostility to the Act s reasonable accommodation requirements because  he feels  they grant special privileges to the disabled  He has stated that the ADA seeks to single out the disabled for special  advantageous treatment  and that the Act grants special treatment tailored to the claimed disability For a person who needs a wheelchair ramp to go through the courthouse door  or a deaf child who needs assistance in the classroom  denying an accommodation means an inability to obtain justice or to learn  Without taking into account the particular needs and circumstances of persons with disabilities  there is no way to ensure they have an equal opportunity  Judge Boyle s views would severely limit participation by these groups in our society The rest of Judge Boyle s civil rights record is equally unacceptable  He was unanimously reversed by the Supreme Court in a voting rights case  in which white voters challenged a Congressional district with a substantial African American population  claiming it had been unconstitutionally drawn up for racial reasons  The issue was whether the white voters could prove that the lines had been drawn for racial rather than political reasons  Judge Boyle granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs before the parties could gather evidence in discovery and without holding a trial Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court  Justice Thomas held that Judge Boyle had failed to follow the basic legal standard governing summary judgment motions  It held he was wrong to decide  without even holding a trial  that a Congressional district with a significant African American population necessarily resulted from an improper racial gerrymander The Supreme Court later reversed Judge Boyle a second time in the same case  In reviewing his second opinion  the Court stated that his decision was clearly erroneous and that he improperly relied on precisely the kind of evidence  the Court  said was inadequate the last time        Judge Boyle has also failed to adequately explain his serious mis statements of law in a gender discrimination case  He refused to enter a consent decree agreed to by the Justice Department and the State of North Carolina to resolve an alleged pattern or practice of discrimination against women in hiring and promoting prison guards  The Justice Department identified over 600 women who had been harmed by the discriminatory practices Judge Boyle refused to enter the decree  Instead  he encouraged the State to withdraw from its binding contract  and ruled that his court lacked jurisdiction over the case  On appeal  the Fourth Circuit unanimously held that his decision was an abuse of discretion and ordered him to enter the consent decree In the same case  Judge Boyle also went out of his way to criticize the Department of Justice for including evidence that North Carolina hired significantly fewer female prison guards than other states  He wrote that nothing is more offensive to the idea of federalism than the notion that the federal government will punish a state for having a non conforming culture  for being different than the other states  Although Judge Boyle has stated that he was not suggesting a cultural defense to discrimination  his words speak for themselves  There was no valid reason for including this statement in his opinion  At best it s irrelevant  and at worst it shows open hostility to the principle of basic equality under the law In the same opinion  Judge Boyle also clearly mis interpreted the 1991 Civil Rights Act  He stated that under the Act  proof of discriminatory intent is always required in a disparate impact case  In fact  the opposite is true  I was the principle author of the 1991 Act  and one of our main purposes in enacting its provisions was to allow plaintiffs to prove discrimination by looking at the effects of practices  not just their intent  That change amended Title VII to include the kind of disparate impact analysis that the Supreme Court recognized in Griggs v  Duke Power  when it held that supposedly neutral employment practices cannot be allowed to act as built in head winds limiting employment opportunities for any group  I m troubled that Judge Boyle so seriously mis read this important civil rights law In addition to these serious problems in his civil rights record  Judge Boyle has also made repeated errors on criminal law  The Fourth Circuit has repeatedly reversed his decisions in criminal cases  often for making the same  clear error more than once In several criminal cases  the Fourth Circuit held that Judge Boyle committed plain error  He was twice reversed for wrongly allowing a criminal suspect to go free He was reversed for committing plain error by allowing the government to violate a plea agreement  He was also reversed for plain error for mistakes in impaneling a jury  And he s been reversed for plain error in several sentencing cases  The list goes on and on Judge Boyle s record has generated widespread concern from citizens in the Fourth Circuit  including his home state of North Carolina  He s strongly opposed by law enforcement and other public servants  including the Southern States Police Benevolent Association  the Police Benevolent Societies in North and South Carolina  the Professional Fire Fighters and Paramedics of North Carolina  and the North Carolina Troopers Association The Director of the North Carolina Police Benevolent Society wrote that  o ur officers have appeared before Judge Boyle as parties and witnesses  We know Judge Boyle and his long judicial record  Our members have personally suffered from  his  repeated legal errors  We ve also heard from organizations dedicated to disability rights  other civil rights  and workers  rights opposing this nomination  including many in North Carolina We certainly expect President Bush to nominate judges who are Republicans and conservatives  But we really need judges with the highest legal qualifications and a record of excellence in the law  We need judges who will decide cases with an open mind and a commitment to fairness for all  not judges who believe they are free to ignore the law  Judge Boyle s record fails this basic test Finally  some of Judge Boyle s supporters make the preposterous claim that opposition to his nomination is somehow opposition to faith  Nothing could be farther from the truth  Each of us as Senators    Republicans and Democrats alike    has taken an oath of office to uphold the Constitution  including the fundamental principle of the separation of church and state  Freedom of religion flourishes in America because neither Congress  the Administration  nor the courts has the power to impose their own religious views on the nation or any of its citizens I do not question Judge Boyle s faith  and none of us who oppose his nomination do so either  But we do question his qualifications for this high judicial position  His record is appalling  and I urge my colleagues to reject it   Laura Capps Melissa
