         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to President Bushs comments on Iraq The American people are counting on their elected leaders to stop the President from compounding our mistakes in Iraq by sending tens of thousands more American soldiers into the cauldron of civil war  Unfortunately  the President is still refusing to face reality in Iraq  Even after the entire intelligence community has stated that Iraq is in a civil war  the President will still not admit that basic fact  This stubborn refusal to face reality has led this administration into blunder after blunder in Iraq  and is now behind the Presidents misguided plan to send American troops into the crossfire  By his words and actions  the President has made very clear why Congress must play its constitutional role in shaping our nations involvement in Iraq  and in blocking the Presidents escalation   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
