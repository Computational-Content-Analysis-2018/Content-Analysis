         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE             AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY ON SENATE FLOOR   Iraqi Prime Minister Malikis visit to the United States comes at an important time    All Americans want Iraqs new government to succeed  The principal measure of success will be whether the tide of violence recedes and full scale civil war is avoided   But for that to happen  the new government must deal quickly  decisively  and effectively with the principal threat to stability    the deadly influence of the militias  especially in Baghdad      It is time for the new government to move beyond vagaries and develop a viable strategy to deal with the militias and prevent Iraq from descending into full scale civil war    He needs to begin implementing a credible plan to disarm  demobilize  and reintegrate the militias into the security forces   He must obtain a real commitment from the political parties to assist in disbanding and disarming the militias    As the new violence in Lebanon demonstrates  political parties cannot govern with one hand and terrorize civilians with militias with the other hand    It did not work with Hezbollah in Lebanon   It cannot work with Hamas   And it will not work in Iraq     Militias are the engines of civil war  and there is no role for them in a legitimately functioning government of Iraq   Iraqs future and the lives of our troops are close to the precipice of a new disaster   The time bomb of full scale civil war is ticking  and our most urgent priority is to defuse it     America  too  must be honest about the situation in Iraq   President Bush  Vice President Cheney  and Secretary Rumsfeld continue to deny that Iraq is in a civil war   But the increasing sectarian violence  the ruthless death squads  and the increasingly powerful role of the privately armed militias tell a very different story     We cannot ignore this major danger   President Bush needs to consider the cold  hard  facts and prepare a strategy to protect our troops who are at risk of getting caught in the middle of an unwinnable sectarian civil war     Such planning is not an admission of defeat    It is responsible and necessary to protect the lives of our men and women in Iraq who are serving with great courage under enormously difficult circumstances            Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
