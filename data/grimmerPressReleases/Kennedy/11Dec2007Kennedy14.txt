         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Thank you President Sweeney  Its an honor to welcome so many distinguished international leaders to Washington for this historic meeting  We may speak different languages  but our goal is the same  dignity and respect for workers and their families    This era of globalization must be judged not just by growing profit margins and rising GDP  but by how we treat the workers who make that progress possible  In fact  we know that true progress and prosperity for our nations come only when our workers share in economic growth      But in far too many instances across our planet today  workers rights and economic security are under attack      In the United States we see this first hand     Im proud of my countrys history as a land of opportunity  a place where  with hard work and a will to succeed  workers can provide a good home and a hopeful future for their families  In the words of President Kennedy  we saw that a rising tide lifted all boats      Thats because strong unions make strong economies  As union membership reached its peak in America  wages and productivity rose together  Workers shared in corporate gains  and our entire society benefited as a result      But that picture has changed dramatically     Over the last 30 years  union membership has declined in America and working families are paying the price  Today  for the first time  young men are earning less than their fathers  Forty seven million Americans lack health insurance  Only 1 in 5 workers earns a guaranteed pension  The costs of daily needs like housing and gasoline are skyrocketing  but workers paychecks arent close to keeping up      With a crisis like this  its no surprise that 60 million workers across America want a stronger voice at work  They join with hundreds of millions of their fellow workers across the globe in demanding their fair share of the worlds economic progress     Its time to stop this global assault on labor rights  Its time to put the brakes on a global economy that creates a boom for business and a bust for labor  Its time to put an end to the harassment and violence that trade unionists face around the world      With the leadership of President John Sweeney and other leaders here  workers are uniting as never before  But they cant do it all alone  They need legal systems that uphold workplace rights  instead of trampling them down  They need laws that permit workers to organize without fear or coercion  and receive a fair share of the wealth they create      I am honored to stand united with you in our common cause  for justice  for democracy  and for a better life for working men and women everywhere            Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
