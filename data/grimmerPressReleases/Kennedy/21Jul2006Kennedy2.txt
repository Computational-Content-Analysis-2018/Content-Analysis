         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE          REMARKS INCLUDED      Andrew H  Weinberg Memorial Lecture Brings Together Leading Researchers and Doctors Treating Cancer  BOSTON  MA  Senator Edward M  Kennedy today delivered the 10th annual Andrew H  Weinberg Memorial Lecture at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute  Kennedy discussed the extraordinary potential for progress in this century of the life sciences  including advances in stem cell research and biotechnology that can revolutionize the way in which we treat cancer and other diseases  This week  President Bush issued his first veto  thwarting the historic bipartisan legislation that would have expanded hope for millions in expanding stem cell research    On Tuesday  the Senate approved legislation to unlock the hope that stem cell research can bring to patients and their families across America  said Senator Kennedy  Sadly  President Bush chose to exercise his veto power for the very first time to reject this powerful vote for progress  But that veto does not extinguish our hope in the promise of that research or end our determination to see that scientists can unlock the potential of stem cell research to seek new cures for the patients who so urgently need them   The Andrew H  Weinberg Memorial Endowment Fund is dedicated to bringing researchers and medical professionals in the field of chemotherapy development to discuss new approaches for cancer research  The Dana Farber Cancer Institute is the largest comprehensive cancer center in the world  comprised of over 900 researchers dedicated to progress in combating cancer          STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY DANA FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE WEINBERG LECTURE JULY 21  2006   As Prepared for Delivery    Thank you  Ed Benz  for that generous introduction  As always  its a privilege to work with you and Dana Farber  Your leadership has made the Institute a source of immense pride for our state   It s an honor to give this lecture today  and to be here with James Weinberg  Andrews father  and Stephen Sallan  Andrews doctor  As many of you know  Dr  Sallan and Dana Farber helped my son  Ted  and my daughter Kara and our family through their illnesses  and were forever grateful for all you did   Its a special honor to be the first non scientist to give the Weinberg lecture  and I hope I can bring a worthwhile perspective on the role of health policy in developing new strategies for combating cancer   It s an honor as well to give this lecture in the Jimmy Fund Auditorium  We all know what a difference the Fund has made in the lives of children with cancer    This week  Ive been thinking a great deal about the hope that medical research can bring to those who suffer from serious conditions such as Alzheimers Disease  Parkinson s Disease  spinal cord injury  diabetes and especially cancer  On Tuesday  the Senate approved legislation to unlock the hope that stem cell research can bring to patients and their families across America  That legislation passed by a strong bipartisan majority  with approval from both supporters and opponents of a woman s right to choose   Our strong vote in the Senate  matched by strong bipartisan support for the legislation in the House and throughout the nation  is a tribute to the hope and vast potential of that research  Sadly  President Bush chose to exercise his veto power for the very first time to reject this powerful vote for progress   But that veto does not extinguish our hope in the promise of that research or end our determination to see that scientists can unlock the potential of stem cell research to seek new cures for the patients who so urgently need them  Well try again next year and hope for success    Such hope is what I feel whenever I come to Dana Farber  This is the place where hope so often becomes reality   For the patients and their families who come here  this is one of the most important places they will ever visit in their lives  For those you treat  their lives are divided into a time before cancer and a time after  It is a tribute to your skill and your dedication and your genius that so many patients can look back after years of healthy life and say  Dana Farber made it possible     Youre the ones who make it possible for your patients to walk out these doors and enjoy the precious moments of lifethe holidays with family  the joy of children  the games at Fenwayfree from the ravages of cancer  Youre the ones who bring joy to the faces of those who pace anxiously in the halls and in the waiting rooms  hoping for good news from the surgeon or the oncologist    At Dana Farber  you have made the extraordinary routine  and patients across Massachusetts and throughout the world have benefited  The progress will continue on into the future  thanks to the astonishing research being done at the Institute today    In this century of the life sciences  cancer researchers are extending the boundaries of knowledge every day  Their innovations are opening doors of hope for the 1 3 million people who are diagnosed with cancer every year  In recent years  weve seen improved treatments and new methods of prevention for breast cancer  cervical cancer  lymphoma and leukemia  to name only a few    Scientists here at Dana Farber are leading the way to a better future for patients  Your discovery of cells that cause leukemia will greatly increase our understanding of the difference between cancer cells and normal cells  so that new and targeted drugs can be developed  Other research at the Institute  uncovering the key genes that allow skin cancer to spread  capitalizes on the human genome project  Perhaps most exciting is your finding that there is a small family of genes that control cancers  This oncogene engine is a prime target for research and drug development  and may well lead to miracle cures for families suffering from a range of cancers   Your success today is a tribute to the vision and leadership of many dedicated doctors and civic leaders  but none more so than the man it was my privilege to know for many years  Sidney Farber  His pioneering work in childrens cancer research led to the first successful induction of remission for children with leukemia  Even while raising funds to create what is today the worlds most distinguished Cancer Institute  he continued to innovate in cancer research and clinical pediatric care    It is impossible to know how many lives Sidney saved  how many scientists he inspired  and how many children he touched  with his great compassion and hope   But his contributions were never limited to the hospital or the clinic  From the early 1950s to his death in 1973  he was a dazzling witness at countless Congressional hearings on cancer research  He was a captivating speaker  and I remember him bringing his optimism and excitement to the halls of government  His brother called him a Amedical diplomat  and he certainly was    Sidney knew my brother  President Kennedy  who considered him an astute adviser and personal friend  I learned a great deal from him during my own early years in the Senate  when he was setting the tone for future cancer policy  When I became chairman of the Health Subcommittee in 1971  I had the opportunity to help bring Sidneys vision for cancer research into reality    Sidney and our great friend Mary Lasker were committed to creating a comprehensive  cutting edge National Cancer Institute that would do for cancer research what NASA had done for space exploration  But implementing that vision required long  difficult negotiations with scientists  physicians  and politicians  as well as an Administration that initially opposed every move we made    Through months of hearings and discussion on our proposed legislation to reorganize and revitalize the National Cancer Institute  Sidney led academic researchers and patient advocates alike  in support of a shared vision for the conquest of cancer  From the earliest suggestions of a National Cancer Authority until the last months before passage of our Senate bill  he testified countless times in support of that vision    We all had to fight hard to create the extraordinary medical innovations we enjoy today  and we have to fight just as hard now to maintain that progress  A culture of innovation and discovery and high quality health care does not just happen  It must be nurtured or it will wither    In the 1990 s Congress made a commitment to doubling the budget of the NIH  resulting in new breakthroughs  such as the mapping of the human genome and the greater understanding of the basic workings of the body s cells  The benefits of federal funding were not confined to research labs at hospitals and universities  but were multiplied by private investment in the dynamic young biotechnology firms that help bring the breakthroughs in the laboratory to the bedsides of the patients   Unfortunately  instead of building on the progress of recent years  the current Administration is undermining it  Under the Presidents budget proposal  NIH will receive a billion less next year than is needed to keep up with inflation  Its budget will be flat for two years running  That has not been allowed to happen in more than half a century   If these budget recommendations are enacted  18 of the 19 NIH institutes will effectively lose funding  which means that NIH will fall behind in the search for new cures  The National Cancer Institute will receive  237 million less than needed to keep pace with inflation  More than 4 out of 5 new grant proposals will have to be rejectednot for lack of merit  but for lack of funds    In an essay in the current edition of the journal Cell  Dr  Robert Weinberg of MIT warns that such cuts will result in a lost generation of young scientists  who will turn away from discovery in frustration at being unable to find support for their research  thus robbing American science of the creative young minds it needs to thrive in the future    Another essential part of bringing new and better drugs to patients who need them is an effective Food and Drug Administration  Its role is essential in balancing the need to get effective treatments to patients quickly with the need to assure that the new treatments are safe  Here again  however  progress is being undermined  Politics is too often replacing sound science as the basis for FDA decisions  FDA must have the resources  the authority and the independence from political interference it needs to safeguard public health  Im working now with the chairman of our health committee  Senator Mike Enzi  on legislation to help the agency do the job the American people are counting on it to do  and I look forward to hearing your ideas and suggestions as we continue to work on that legislation   Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America  One of the most important actions we can take as a nation to substantially reduce this public health menace is to give the Food and Drug Administration broad authority to regulate tobacco products  We cannot in good conscience allow the federal agency most responsible for protecting the public health to remain powerless to deal with the enormous risks of tobacco  the most deadly of all consumer products   Two years ago  a large bipartisan majority of the Senate voted to grant the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products  It was a major step forward in our long term effort to enact this legislation  Unfortunately  the legislation was blocked by the House Republican leadership  I have reintroduced the FDA bill in the current Congress and I am urging my colleagues to take the final steps necessary to make this extraordinarily important health legislation the law of the land   The stakes are vast  Five thousand children have their first cigarette every day  and two thousand of them become daily smokers  Nearly a thousand of them will die prematurely from tobacco induced diseases  Cigarettes kill well over four hundred thousand Americans each year  That is more lives lost than from automobile accidents  alcohol abuse  illegal drugs  AIDS  murder  suicide  and fires combined  Our response to a public health problem of this magnitude must consist of more than half way measures   We must deal firmly with tobacco company marketing practices that target children and mislead the public  The Food and Drug Administration needs broad authority to regulate the sale  distribution  and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco    The tobacco industry currently spends over eleven billion dollars a year to promote its products  Much of that money is spent in ways designed to tempt children to start smoking  before they are mature enough to appreciate the enormity of the health risk  The industry knows that more than 90  of smokers begin as children and are addicted by the time they reach adulthood  If we are serious about reducing youth smoking  FDA must have the power to prevent industry advertising designed to appeal to children wherever it will be seen by children    The tobacco industry has a long  dishonorable history of providing misleading information about the health consequences of smoking  These companies have repeatedly sought to characterize their products as far less hazardous than they are  They made minor innovations in product design seem far more significant for the health of the user than they actually were  It is essential that FDA have clear and unambiguous authority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future  The largest disinformation campaign in the history of the corporate world must end    Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they plan to develop what they characterize as reduced risk cigarettes  This legislation will require manufacturers to submit such reduced risk products to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed  No health related claims will be permitted until they have been verified to the FDA s satisfaction  These safeguards are essential to prevent deceptive industry marketing campaigns which could lull the public into a false sense of health safety    If our nation is serious about preventing disease  FDA regulation of tobacco products is an essential step we must take    Even the best new treatments are of little value if avoidable medical errors hinder their effective use  Everyone in the nation knows that Boston was the cradle of the American Revolution  and they are learning that Boston is the birthplace of a new revolution in health care quality too    Here again  Dana Farber is leading the way  You had the vision to seek new ways to improve the quality of care  You had the leadership to act where others had failed  You recognized early that providers must improve their use of information technology to prevent dangerous and even lethal medical mistakes     As part of the Partners Healthcare family  Dana Farber has been at the forefront of the health information technology revolution for more than a decade  You were the home for a computerized prescription project begun by Partners in 1992  which has led to a specialized system to prevent prescription errors in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy   Today Dana Farber is a recognized leader in patient centered electronic health systems  with a number of innovative health IT initiatives in the pipeline  Your unique approach is to integrate safety and personal care  so that new technology is easier for doctors and their patients to adopt  In 2003 Dana Farber began phasing in electronic medical records with built in patient safety features  A parallel initiative  currently in development  will enable patients to consult their doctors and make appointments online using the Patient Gateway  They will also be able to record any symptoms between visits to their doctor  by using a health diary that is part of the patients electronic medical record   I understand youre now developing a bar coded wristband  so that cancer patients can be matched against their chemotherapy prescription at every stage of treatment  from the physicians office to the pharmacy to the laboratory  By tracking chemotherapy electronically  youre ensuring that clinicians and care givers dont accidentally give a patient the wrong drug   Such leadership is paying off  Fewer than 3 percent of chemotherapy orders at Dana Farber contain errors  compared with an estimated 20 percent of such orders at other hospitals  I look forward to future such successes  and to hearing about the expansion of the Institutes information technology to Childrens Hospital  to improve the quality and safety of pediatric care    We in Washington have our responsibility as well  Innovative institutions have shown that we can reduce medical errors by moving away from a culture of blame and shame and cover up to a new culture in which health professionals can report their errors and near misses in an environment where such events are seen as an opportunity for learning and improvement  not punishment   Last year  Democrats and Republicans achieved a strong bipartisan success when Congress finally responded to the call of the Institute of Medicine s landmark report  To Err is Human  by establishing a national system for health professionals to report information on medical errors and near errors  without fear that these reports would be used against them    Also last year  the Senate approved bipartisan legislation to improve the use of information technology throughout the nation  We have work to do to make sure that this needed legislation is approved by the House and signed into law  but Im optimistic well succeed     We are reminded once again of the urgency of our task by yesterdays report from the Institute of Medicine  showing that medication errors harm 1 5 million Americans every year  and cost the health care system over  3 5 billion annually  Electronic health records and other innovations can sharply reduce this unacceptable toll  and further delay in modernizing our health system is unacceptable   Our greatest challenge of all is to see that every American can share in the benefits of this new century of the life sciences  Sadly  the nation is drifting farther and farther behind in reaching this goal  Six million more Americans now lack health care coverage than at the start of the decade     Even those who have insurance too often find that it provides coverage in name only  When disaster strikes  they learn to their horror that needed services are not covered  and the medical bills keep coming  Half of all bankruptcies in the nation today are caused by unpaid medical expenses   Our hospitals in Boston are an example to the nation of caring for the poor and the medically under served  And our state government has just showed the nation that it is possible to enact health reforms that provide quality coverage to every citizen   At work in the Senate  Im inspired by the commitment and dedication of the doctors  nurses  and staff at Dana Farber  Youre proof that with dedication and a commitment to excellence anything can be accomplished  In World War II  the Army Air Force had a motto that could just as easily apply to Dana Farber  The difficult we do immediately  The impossible takes a bit longer   But not much longer  I would add  in the case of Dana Farber       Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617
