         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The most disturbing thing about this supposed bankruptcy reform is the utter lack of fairness and balance in the legislation  It gets tough on working families who are facing financial hardship due to a health crisis  a job loss caused by a plant closing  or a military call up to active duty  The laws of bankruptcy are being changed to wrest every last dollar out of these unfortunate families in order to further enrich the credit card companies   However  the authors of this legislation look the other way when it comes to closing millionaires  loopholes and ending corporate abuse  The legislation fails to address the real crisis in corporate bankruptcy  where reorganization plans often benefit the very insiders whose greed and mismanagement brought down the company at the expense of workers  retirees  and creditors  It fails to address the shocking abuse of millionaires hiding their assets in so called asset protection trusts  placing them completely beyond the reach of creditors  And this bill also fails to deal effectively with the unlimited homestead exemptions in a few states which allow the rich to hold on to their multi million dollar mansions while middle class families in other states lose their modest homes   We truly cannot allow this bill to pass without closing the millionaires  homestead loophole once and for all  It has become a national embarrassment  Millionaire deadbeats buy a huge mansion in Florida and Texas to shield their wealth from creditors  The harsh rules of bankruptcy being established by this bill will trap hard working middle class families  but the unlimited homestead exemption will allow rich debtors to escape   Existing bankruptcy law allows those in bankruptcy to protect from their creditors certain assets  the nature of which is largely determined by state law  Most states make some allowance for the homes  or homesteads  people live in  but the allowance is a modest one  too modest in many states for elderly people with large equity in the homes they have lived in for most of their lives   However  five states  the most notorious of which are Texas and Florida  have unlimited homestead exemptions  This means that debtors in those state can stash away millions  even tens of millions  of dollars in estates and leave their creditors with nothing   S  256 would leave this gaping loophole wide open  it will allow the real abusers of the bankruptcy system to file for bankruptcy and to still keep their fortunes and properties intact while leaving their creditors with nothing  S  256 has created some minor exceptions to the homestead exemption  none of which would be applicable in many of the most egregious cases  The bill fails to deal with the problem head on  multimillionaires who abuse bankruptcy by stashing away wealth while they declare bankruptcy   My amendment would cap the amount allowed for the homestead exemption at  300 000  This is an adequate allowance for most people  and would end the exploitation of the homestead exemption to hide assets from creditors  It would add some measure of fairness and balance to a bill that sorely needs some fairness and balance   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
