         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court comes at a time of heated debate and great division in America  a debate that is reflected in the deliberations of a Supreme Court in which his vote  just like Justice O Connor s  will affect the freedoms and liberties of Americans on vital questions before the country    I will not pre judge the President s nominee   And I will not decide whether to support or oppose him based on any single issue    What all Americans deserve to know is whether Judge Roberts respects the core values of the Constitution and falls within the conservative mainstream of America  along the lines of Justice Sandra Day O Connor    That is the issue  and I look forward to asking the important questions that are on the minds of Americans as they consider his nomination to our nation s highest court    Supreme Court nominations involve far more than the hotly debated social issues so often discussed in the media  Presidents have four year terms  Senators serve for six years  But Supreme Court Justices serve for life  without ever having to face the electorate  Our decision whether to confirm a Supreme Court nominee affects the rights and freedoms not only of our generation  but those of our children and grandchildren as well          The Court s decisions affect whether employees rights will be protected in the workplace        They affect whether families will be able to obtain needed medical care under their health insurance policies        They affect whether people will actually receive the retirement benefits that they were promised        They affect whether people will be free from discrimination in their daily lives        They affect whether students will be given fair consideration when they apply to college        They affect whether persons with disabilities will have access to public facilities and programs        They affect whether we will have reasonable environmental laws that keep our air and water clean        And they affect whether large corporations are held accountable when they injure workers and consumers    Each of these issues  and many others  have been addressed by the Supreme Court in recent years   In many of these cases  the Court was narrowly divided  and these issues are likely to be the subject of future Court decisions in the years to come    Because so much hangs in the balance  Supreme Court nominees have a heavy burden to show that they will uphold justice for all   They must demonstrate a core commitment to preserving equal protection of the laws  free speech  workers rights  and other individual rights   Americans deserve to know if nominees will be on the side of justice and individual liberties  or if they will side with powerful special interests    The Senate s role will be to establish clearly whose side John Roberts would be on if confirmed to the most powerful court in the land   Because Judge Roberts has written relatively few opinions in his brief tenure as a judge  his views on a wide variety of vital issues are still unknown   What little we know about his views and values lends even greater importance and urgency to his responsibility to provide the Senate and the American people with clear answers    The key question is whether he will uphold core Constitutional and statutory principles     For instance  in a case involving the ability of Congress to protect the environment  he issued an opinion with sweeping implications not just for the environment  but for a host of other important protections  In it  Judge Roberts questioned the settled interpretation of the Commerce Clause  the Constitutional provision that is the foundation for not only the environmental laws that protect our natural heritage and ensure that we have clean air and clean water in our communities  but also for Social Security  Medicare  the minimum wage  and many other important national protections  I can imagine few things worse for our seniors  for the disabled  for workers  and for families than to place someone on the highest court in the land who would put these protections at risk    If applied in other cases  Judge Roberts  view could severely undercut the ability of Congress to respond to real challenges facing our nation    His decision raises questions about whether he would roll back a host of other laws protecting civil rights  workers  rights  and even many of our federal criminal statutes    I believe that most Americans would agree that we should not re fight the civil rights battles of the past  The spirit of America is to move forward to greater opportunity  not return to the days of second class citizenship for many  Too many of our fellow citizens over many generations have sacrificed everything  including their lives  so that others can fully enjoy the fruits of our liberties and freedoms  They ve given their all for the rights of people of color  of women  of the disabled  of immigrants  of workers  of senior citizens  and so many others who make up the vibrant American fabric that makes our nation the envy of the world    So it is important to know where Judge Roberts stands on this great question of opportunity and justice for all    The significance of the Constitutional principles at issue is clear from the comments of other judges who serve in the same court as Judge Roberts  They noted that the Constitutional provision he questioned not only is the basis of many of our civil rights laws  but also underlies important product safety laws and environmental legislation  Judge Roberts urged the full court to review the panel decision to reconsider the established interpretation of the Commerce Clause in the Rancho Viejo v  Norton case     Let me be clear  I do not pre judge Judge Roberts s nomination based on his decision in this case or any other  Nor should anyone else  But we must not fail in our duty to the American people to responsibly examine Judge Roberts legal views    Other aspects of Judge Robertss record also raise important questions about his commitment to individual rights                He has opposed programs to guarantee equal opportunity              He opposed the right to privacy and argued to overturn Roe v   Wade  saying the case is wrongly decided and finds no support in the  text  structure or history of the Constitution              As a private attorney  he represented coal companies against  workers rights                He sought to limit every Americans right to a lawyer by              arguing to narrow the Supreme Courts core precedent in Miranda v  Arizona    Judge Roberts represented clients in each of these cases  but we have a duty to ask where he stands on these issues  I don t pre judge them  but the American people deserve to know more    I join my colleagues in the hope that the process will proceed with dignity  But the nominee will be expected to answer fully  so that the American people will know whether Judge Roberts will uphold their rights   Anything less would make the Senate a mere rubber stamp in Supreme Court nominations    In recent days  some have suggested that the Senate should not ask full questions about the nominee s legal views and judicial philosophy   The President made clear that he would consider judicial philosophy in choosing a nominee  and the Senate should not turn a blind eye to that issue    When Justice Thurgood Marshall was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1967  I said that Senators should not vote against him just because they dont agree with him on every issue   But thats different from saying we shouldnt consider judicial philosophy at all  Particularly today  when philosophy is important to the White House in choosing nominees   Senators should consider it as well    To be clear  here is what I said in 1967    I believe it s recognized by most Senators that we are not charged with the responsibility of approving  justices  if  their  views always coincide with our own We are really interested in knowing whether the nominee has the background  experience  qualifications  temperament  and integrity to handle this most sensitive  important  and responsible job    But if someone would clearly fail to uphold basic rights  that should be considered and the Senate is entitled to know    There are few debates more important than this one  And I look forward to considering this important nomination   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
