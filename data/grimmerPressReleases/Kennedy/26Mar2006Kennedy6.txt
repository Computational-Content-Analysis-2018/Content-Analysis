         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C     Today on CBSs Face the Nation  Senator Edward M  Kennedy continued the call for comprehensive immigration reform and remained optimistic that the Senate will pass legislation that will adequately address the challenges we face today  Kennedy underscored the consensus made by leaders in the business  religious  and labor community that an enforcement only approach to immigration reform simply wont work and a comprehensive approach that addresses the economic realities of our underground immigrant economy is needed  The McCain Kennedy legislation for comprehensive immigration reform has received strong and diverse support since it was introduced on May 12  2005  many touting its realistic approach of both strengthen border protection and enforcement while reflecting our best values as a nation    of fairness  equal opportunity  and respect for the law  Below is the transcript of Senator Kennedy on Face the Nation and a fact sheet on the McCain Kennedy legislation BORGER  Let s get right to this debate on immigration  We saw hundreds of thousands of people marching in the streets of Los Angeles yesterday   And what they re marching about is a House bill that talks  really  about enforcement  It turns illegal immigrants into felons  It would build a 700 mile wall on part of the border   Would you filibuster that kind of a bill in the Senate  KENNEDY  Well  first of all  let me say it s better that we not pass a bad bill  just to pass a bill   But having said that  I m hopeful that we can have a bill that is going to really respond to the challenges that we re facing   We re facing a national security challenge on our borders on immigration  so we have to get immigration policy correct   Secondly  this issue is a values issue  Who will we permit to become citizens in our nation   And third  this issue is about economic progress and hope and opportunity   In the time that I ve been in the United States Senate  I ve never seen a coalition come together like it has in trying to find a common sense approach on immigration   We have the leaders of    the faith based leaders in our community  We have leaders in our business community and leaders in our labor community  They understand that we cannot solve the problem of illegal immigration just by law enforcement alone   We have spent  20 billion on chains and fences and border guards and dogs in the southern border over the last 10 years  And it doesn t work  What we need is a comprehensive approach   I think President Bush understands it  I think John McCain understands it  And I think we have Democrat and Republican members that understand it  And  hopefully  we ll have a chance to have that kind of an approach in the Senate   BORGER  Well  what do you say to people    you mentioned Senator McCain    you have a bill with Senator McCain that provides a path to citizenship   After six years  people pay their back taxes  they pay a fine  And then they get to apply for citizenship  What do you say to people who say you re just giving amnesty to people who have broken the law   KENNEDY  First of all  this is not amnesty  We are not putting anyone at the head of the line  Amnesty means forgiveness  It means pardon   What we are saying is that there are 12 million individuals that are here in the United States  Why did they come here   Basically  they came here for economic reasons because they wanted a job and they wanted to work  They wanted to provide for their families  And they wanted to continue dedication to their beliefs   We have 70 000  ph  permanent resident aliens in the military serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  And then  on the other side  you have employers that have got the magnet out there  that are willing to pay for those individuals   We have those individuals here  This is part of the challenge that we re facing  We are facing the issues on the border  We re facing the pressure on individuals who want to come in on a temporary  And how are we going to adjust the status   Our program puts those individuals here  First of all  they pay a penalty  They have to pay their taxes  They have to demonstrate they re working  They have to learn English  And they go to the end of the line    not to the front of the line  to the end of the line  That s what s important   BORGER  Let me ask you about President Bush because he says allow  these workers to be here temporarily and then send them home   Do you think you and President Bush can come to some kind of a compromise on this because he disagrees with lots of people in his own party   KENNEDY  Well  first of all  I respect President Bush and the fact that he s talked about this issue   We re finding out now  on a complex issue    we re finding out that the hard right of the Republican Party is doing everything they possibly can to make it a political issue  KENNEDY  Look at this  Gloria  At other times when we are facing major challenges in the country    the ones that were the most obvious to me are the civil rights issues    Republicans and Democrats came together on it  We came together even on the Medicare issue  We came together on the higher education issue   And the real question is  will the Senate yield to the hard right and be distracted with  in effect  criminalizing the 12 million individuals in this country  I m always interested in our Republican friends because they re talking about family initiatives   And one of their family initiatives is going to mean that Cardinal Mahoney from Los Angels may very well be a felon  because as Cardinal Mahoney says  my dedication is to helping the poor  and I don t make a judgment about whether the person is here as a green card worker or as a legal immigrant BORGER  Senator  I m going to now switch to other matters that involve the Senate  END McCain    Kennedy Secure America Act Selected Titles of the BillTitle I
