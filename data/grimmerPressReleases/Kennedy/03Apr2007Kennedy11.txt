         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The President couldnt be more wrong on Iraq  He was wrong to get us into this war  wrong to conduct it so poorly  wrong to ignore the views of the American people  and wrong to accuse those of us who are working to change course as harming our troops  Now he is wrong to threaten to veto this bill  delaying funds and keeping our troops in a civil war with an open ended commitment  Instead  President Bush should be listening to the American people and working with Congress to bring this terrible war to an end  Senator Reid is right    it is time to end the loss of American lives and begin to bring our soldiers home  For the sake of our troops  we cannot repeat the mistakes of Vietnam and allow this war to drag on long after the American people know it is a mistake  30   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
