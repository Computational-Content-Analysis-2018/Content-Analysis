         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      I commend Senator Larry Craig  Representatives Chris Cannon and Howard Berman for their bipartisan leadership introducing the Agricultural Jobs  Opportunity  Benefits  and Security Act of 2005  and I m pleased to be a cosponsor     The legislation reflects a far reaching and welcome agreement between the United Farm Workers and the agricultural industry  one of the most difficult immigration challenges we face  and we in Congress should make the most of this unique opportunity for progress    America has a proud tradition as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws  But our current immigration laws have failed us on both counts  Much of the nation s economy today depends on the hard work and the many contributions of immigrants  The agricultural industry would grind to a halt without immigrant farm workers  Yet  the overwhelming majority of these workers are illegal  and are therefore easily exploited by unscrupulous employers who can get away with paying shamefully low wages and forcing them to work in unacceptably dangerous conditions     The AgJOBS Act is a needed reform in our immigration laws  to reflect current economic realities  meet our security needs more effectively  and do so in a way that respects America s immigrant heritage  It provides a fair and reasonable way for undocumented agricultural workers to earn legal status  It reforms the current visa program  so that employers unable to find American workers can hire needed foreign workers      AgJOBS is good for both labor and business  It gives farm workers legal status to improve their wages and working conditions  and it meets the needs of farmer owners for a stable and legal workforce  Because of these need consensus reforms  more than 400 organizations across the spectrum of business  labor  and immigration groups support the bill     It will enhance national security and reduce illegal immigration  By bringing illegal farm workers out of the shadows  it will enable law enforcement officials to focus their efforts on terrorist and criminals  It will reduce the chaotic  illegal  and all too deadly flows of immigrants at our borders by providing safe and legal avenues for farm workers and their families      President Bush has said that the overhaul of U S  immigration laws is high on his agenda  In the State of the Union address  he called our current immigration system outdated and unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country  I welcome his role in this important debate and I urge him to wholeheartedly endorse the AgJOBS bill      The reforms it provides are years overdue  It is well designed to improve the lives and working conditions of all farm workers  and it is long past time for Congress and the Administration to act   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
