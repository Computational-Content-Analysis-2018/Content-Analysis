         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                    FACT SHEETS INCLUDED     Washington  DC   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy continued his fight on the war on poverty by offering an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations to raise the minimum wage from  5 15 to  7 25 an hour in three steps   Last week the House Appropriations Committee passed a similar plan  yet Republican leadership is refusing to bring the measure to the House floor despite its strong bipartisan support   Across the country  the momentum is building as 21 states have  higher rates and over 100 000 Citizen Co Sponsors joined on in support of Kennedys Fair Minimum Wage Act   Raising the minimum wage is a moral issue   Its wrong that hard working men and women cannot afford to put food on the table or heat their homes  Senator Kennedy said  Its deeply wrong to give billions upon billions of dollars in tax relief to the wealthy and give annual pay raises to senators  but turn our backs on the hard working families who live in poverty each day  and the 14 million children who go to bed hungry each night   During the bankruptcy bill debate in March of last year  50 United State Senators expressed their support for Kennedys plan to provide long overdue help for the millions of working Americans who are living in poverty    Five Republicans supported Kennedys measure  while only 38 senators voted for the competing proposal  offered by Senator Santorum    Below is Kennedys floor statement on the amendment as well as a fact sheet on the minimum wage  and a fact sheet on activity across the country         STATEMENT BY SENATOR KENNEDY ON RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE    AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY ON SENATE FLOOR   For generations  Americans have believed that if they work hard and play by the rules  they can achieve the American dream   They believed they could be better off than their parents  and could join the middle class   They could earn more each year  provide safety and security for their families  and save for their retirement     But today more and more Americans are losing faith in that dream   As prices for everyday necessities like gasoline  housing and health care skyrocket  too many hard working people are living on the edge  just one serious illness  or one pink slip away from bankruptcy   For minimum wage workers  the American dream is even farther from reality   Minimum wage workers are men and women of dignity   They care for young children in day care centers   They care for senior citizens in nursing homes     They check out groceries in the supermarket and clean our office buildings   But the minimum wage they receive no longer covers their bills     A minimum wage worker who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  earns just  10 700 a year   Thats almost  6 000 6000 below the poverty line for a family of three     At these wages  no matter how hard they work  minimum wage workers are forced to make impossible choicesbetween paying the rent and buying groceries  or between paying the heating bill and buying clothes   They cant afford health care   They cant earn enough to pay for adequate housing for their families anywhere in the country   For minimum wage workers  their daily fear is poverty  hunger  and homelessness     Our Republican colleagues continue to turn a blind eye to the struggles of working families in this country  particularly the hardworking people who work for the very lowest wages   Its been ten long years since Congress last raised the minimum wage     Time and again  many have called on the Senate to increase the minimum wage   Yet  time and again  our Republican colleagues have refused to give working people the raise they deserve  even though we grant annual pay increases to senators about every four years   What could be more hypocritical    Fortunately  the American people understand what the Republican leadership does not  that no one who works hard for a living should have to live in poverty     Thats why the American people overwhelmingly support an increase in the minimum wage   Year after year  as the GOP Congress keeps refusing to help minimum wage workers  the American people are rising up   They are marching in the streets and praying in their churches and synagogues   They are also taking their battle to the ballot box  telling us in no uncertain terms that a minimum wage increase is long overdue   This amendment I am offering will raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps over the next two years  70 cents now  70 cents a year from now  and 70 more cents two years from now   This increase will directly raise the pay of almost six and a half million workers  and indirectly benefit more than eight million more     Contrary to popular perception  these workers are not teenagers looking for a first job for pocket change   Eighty percent of those who benefit are adult workers   More than a third are the sole breadwinners in their families     Raising the minimum wage is a womens issue   Almost 60 percent of the workers who will benefit are women   Its a childrens issue   More than half of these women have children   Its a civil rights issue  because African Americans and Hispanic Americans are far more likely to work in low paying jobs     Most of all  raising the minimum wage is a moral issue   Its wrong that hard working men and women cannot afford to put food on the table or heat their homes    Its deeply wrong to give billions upon billions of dollars in tax relief to the wealthy and give annual pay raises to senators  but turn our backs on the hard working families who live in poverty each day  and the 14 million children who go to bed hungry each night     Americans understand fairness  and that is not fair   Americans understand right and wrong  and that is wrong   An increase in the minimum wage will make a profound difference in the lives of workers struggling each day to make ends meet     It will give workers more time to spend with their families  provide greater educational opportunities for parents and children  and help workers afford the rising costs of basic necessities like paying the rent or the utility bills     This amendment will add almost  4 400 to a workers annual income   Thats enough for a low income family of three to pay for      Almost two years of child care      Full tuition for a community college degree      A year and a half of heat and electricity       More than a year of groceries       More than 8 months of rent    In an economy where millions of Americans are suffering  37 million people are living in poverty  14 million children go to bed hungry each night  46 million Americans do not have health care  raising the minimum wage is an essential step to provide hardworking people with real security   Not just security for their nation  but security for their families and their futures     I urge my colleagues to support this amendment  which will improve the lives of millions of American families     RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS   A FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT FACT SHEET       Millions of minimum wage earners who work hard and play by the rules are forced to live in poverty   Too often  these hardworking Americans are forced to make impossible choicesbetween paying the rent and buying groceries  paying the heating bill  or buying clothes                          Senator Edward M  Kennedy  An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem of poverty in our nation        The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office        37 million Americans currently live in poverty  including 13 million children       Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s         Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year earn  10 700 per year  almost  6 000 below the federal poverty guidelines of  16 600 for a family of three     The minimum wage is losing value   Every day the minimum wage is not increased  it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind         Since then the minimum wage was last raised in 1997  its real value has eroded by 20 percent   Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase       Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  4 00 below what it was in 1968   To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  9 26 an hour today  not  5 15  Raising the minimum wage will make a significant difference in the lives of working families   Millions of hardworking Americans would benefit from a higher minimum wage       Nearly 15 million Americans will benefit from a minimum wage increase to  7 25 an hour  6 6 million directly  and another 8 3 million indirectly  Almost sixty percent of these workers are women  and forty percent are people of color         Eighty percent of those who would benefit are adult workers  not teenagers seeking pocket change   More than a third of these adults are sole breadwinners for their families       Increasing the minimum wage will help more than seven million children whose parents would receive a raise         Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 400 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families   It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy   o    15 months of groceries o    19 months of utilities o    8 months of rent o    Over two years of health care o    20 months of child care o    30 months of college tuition at a public  2 year college  A fair increase in the minimum wage is long overdue   Congress continues to line its own pockets while ignoring the needs of the poorest Americans       Its been more than 9 years since minimum wage workers last saw an increase in their wages  the longest period without a raise since the first minimum wage was passed in 1938       During that nine years  Congress has raised its own pay by  31 600   Its inexcusable that Congress continues to vote itself a pay increase while ignoring our nations lowest paid workers         Twenty one states and the District of Columbia have responded to this inexcusable inaction at the federal level by raising their minimum wages at the state level    A minimum wage increase will not hurt the economy   History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation         In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades   Nearly 12 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 248 000 per month         In contrast  in the last four years  the minimum wage has held steady  but only 4 7 million jobs have been created   A minimum wage increase will not hurt small businesses    The vast majority of small business owners agree that a minimum wage increase would not affect their business       A recent Gallup poll found that 86  of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business       Three out of four small businesses said that a 10  increase in the minimum wage would have no effect on their company         Additionally  nearly half of small business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased  and only 16  of owners think the minimum wage should be reduced or eliminated entirely   Other countries have benefited from minimum wage increases   International experience indicates that raising the minimum wage reduces poverty without hurting economic growth or job creation       Britain has the second largest economy in Europe  after Germany    They implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty   They raised their minimum wage to about  9 26 per hour last year  and they are planning to raise this rate to about  9 81 in October of this year        Ireland has an extremely robust economy  with impressive growth over the last decade  and the fourth largest GDP per capita in the world   The minimum wage rate in Ireland is 7 65  hour  about  9 60 an hour  and yet their unemployment rate is lower than the U S     SUMMARY OF  THE FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT         The wages that we pay our workers make a profound statement about who we are as a nation   The American Dream is about working hard to build a better life for your family   In the wealthiest country on the face of the earth  no one that works hard for a living should have to live in poverty                                                                                   Senator Edward M  Kennedy  The Fair Minimum Wage Act  S 1062 H R 2429  will provide a long overdue increase in the federal minimum wage   The bill would        Raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps         5 85 60 days after enactment       6 55 one year later       7 25 one year after that        Make the federal minimum wage applicable in the Commonwealth of Northern Marianas Islands  and gradually raise the minimum wage on the Islands by 50 cents per hour every six months until it meets the federal standard
