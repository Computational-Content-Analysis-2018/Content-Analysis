         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I support this amendment     It is wrong to provide yet another blank check to President Bush for his failed Iraq policy      I support our troops  but I oppose this war  Our military has served nobly in Iraq and done everything we have asked them to do  But theyre caught in a continuing quagmire  and the long hopedpolitical solution is still as elusive as ever      Our troops are being held hostage to both Iraqi politics and U S  politics  Sectarian leaders in Iraq are unable or unwilling to make the difficult judgments needed to lift Iraq out of its downward spiral      The best way to end this charade and protect our troops and our national security is to put the Iraqis on notice that they need to take responsibility for their future  Unless theres a binding timeline for the redeployment of our troops  the Iraqis will not feel the need to make the compromises essential for a political solution      Brig  Gen  John Campbell  deputy commanding general of the 1st Cavalry Division in Iraq  spoke bluntly about the faults of Iraqs political leaders  He said The ministers  they dont get outThey dont know what the hell is going on on the ground      Army Lt  Col  Mark Fetter put it this way  It is painful  very painful to deal with the obstructionism of Iraqi officials     Yet  the President Bush continues to ask us to pour hundreds of billions into Iraq based on a promise that success is just around the corner      The toll in Iraq is devastating     Nearly 4000 American troops have died  including 81 brave men and women from Massachusetts      Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed or injured  and over four million more have been forced to flee their homes     Nearly half a trillion dollars have been spent fighting this war that America never should have fought     Its time to put the brakes on this madness  Its up to us in Congress to say no to any further open ended commitment of our troops  the kind commitment that President Bush has been making year after year  We need to tell the Iraqis nowand tell them loud and clearthat we intend to leave and do it soon  Its the only way to create the urgency that is so clearly necessary for the Iraqi leaders to end their differences     Its wrong for Congress to write still another blank check to the President for the war  Its obvious that President Bush wants to drag this process out month after month  so he can hand off his Iraqi policy to the next President      If this issue were only about the tragedies of the war  that would be reason enough to end it  But its about so much more  This bill demonstrates the fallout were starting to see here at home as the President refuses to deliver on urgent domestic priorities of the American people     Last month  Congress passed an Appropriations Bill to provide billions greater funding for the priorities such as education  cancer research  and worker protections  But the President vetoed that bill  because of the American people are not his priorities  so he denied them the assistance they need and deserve      By contrast on Iraq  the sky is the limit  Billions and billions and billions of dollars for George Bushs war  But here in America  right here at home  a modest increased investment in the nations families is vetoed     Each month  American taxpayers are spending  10 billion on the war in Iraq  Thats real money and it could be used bring better lives and opportunities to American families           The war is also draining essential resources needed to protect our hard working men and women            We all know how important access to high quality primary care is to the health of our nation especially  Yet nearly 47 million Americans are uninsured today  including 9 million children                Mr  President  Its wrong to neglect priorities like these at home and pour hundreds of billions of dollars into the black hole the Iraq war has become  Its wrong to give the President yet another huge blank check for the war in Iraq  Enough is enough is enough is enough  I urge my colleagues to take a strong stand  and vote against this gigantic blank check for more war          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
