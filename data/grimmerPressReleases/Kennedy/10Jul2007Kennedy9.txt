         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      BILL SUMMARY  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  AND LIST OF SUPPORTERS INCLUDED  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senators Edward Kennedy and Tom Harkin and Representatives John Dingell and Frank Pallone introduced the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports  CLASS  Act of 2007 that would create an insurance program for adults who become functionally disabled  The measure would provide a cash benefit to help obtain services and supports  while providing those with disabilities more choices on community participation  education  and employment  Currently there are 10 million Americans in need of long term care services  and the number is expected to increase to near 15 million by 2020  Too often  many individuals are forced to live in poverty just so they can qualify for Medicaid to get the care they need  which is counter to the American way Because of its common sense approach to helping Americans take their future into their own hands while saving taxpayer dollars  the CLASS Act has gained the support of over 100 groups representing the disabled  the elderly  and Americas workers Too many Americans are perfectly capable of living a life in the community  but are denied the supports they need  said Senator Kennedy  They languish in needless circumstances with no choice about how or where to obtain these services  Too often  they have to give up the American Dream  the dignity of a job  a home  and a family  so they can qualify for Medicaid  the only program that will support them  The bill we propose is a long overdue effort to offer greater dignity  greater hope  and greater opportunity  It makes a simple pact with all Americans  If you work hard and contribute  society will take care of you when you fall on hard times The CLASS Act is a cost effective way to ensure individuals maintain freedom of choice throughout every stage of life  said Senator Harkin  This bill paves the way for more Americans to live independently and with dignity By removing barriers to independence  the CLASS Act will enable more Americans to remain in their communities and empower more individuals to make their own choices  said Congressman Dingell As America continues to age  we are faced with an impending crisis in long term care  Congressman Pallone said  Today  we offer a new approach that builds upon our existing safety net system and helps our elderly and disabled finance the long term care they need to remain active and productive members of their communities The CLASS Act is an important step in the evolution of public policy because it is a framework based on the principles of independence  choice  and empowerment  It is the framework needed to help individuals gain the access they need to live independently  The CLASS Act does this by establishing a national insurance program to be financed by voluntary payroll deductions to provide benefits to adults who become severely functionally impaired  To qualify for benefits  individuals must be 18 years old and have contributed to the program at least 5 years  All working adults will be automatically enrolled in the program  unless they choose not to be There are two benefit tiers  Tier 1 benefits   50 day  will be payable to eligible individuals who have 2 or more impairments on Activities of Daily Living  ADLs  or the equivalent cognitive impairments Tier 2 benefits   100 day  will be payable to individuals who have 4 or more ADLs or the equivalent cognitive impairment This legislation builds on the promise and the possibility of the Americans with Disabilities Act  and respects the rights and dignity of all Americans  especially our disabled and senior citizens  to live their life as they choose        Summary of the CLASS Act of 2007 Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act Purpose of the BillTo help adults with severe functional impairments obtain the services and supports they need to stay functional and independent  while providing them with choices about community participation  education and employment BackgroundCurrently there are 10 million Americans in need of long term services and supports  and the number is expected to increase to near 15 million by 2020 Most private sector disability or long term care insurance plans are constrained in the insurance protection they can offer at an affordable price  and neither Supplemental Security Insurance  SSI  nor Old  Age  Survivors  and Disability Insurance  OASDI  programs have any benefit differentials related to the extent and character of the disability Thus  most Americans who have or develop severe functional impairments can only access coverage for the services critical to their independence  such as housing modifications  assistive technologies  transportation  and personal assistance services   through Medicaid  Their reliance on Medicaid for critical support services creates a strong incentive for them to spend down assets and remain poor and unemployed  With Medicaid paying 50  of the costs of long term services  increased expenditures on long term services are expected to add  44 billion annually to the cost of Medicaid over the next decade Overview of the LegislationThe CLASS Act will offer an alternative path  It will create a new national insurance program to help adults who have or develop functional impairments to remain independent  employed  and stay a part of their community Financed through voluntary payroll deductions of  30 00 per month  with opt out enrollment like Medicare Part B   this legislation will help remove barriers to independence and choice  e g   housing modification  assistive technologies  personal assistance services  transportation  that can be overwhelmingly costly  by providing a cash benefit to those individuals who are unable to perform 2 or more functional activities of daily living The large risk pool to be created by this program approach will make added coverage much more affordable than it is currently  thereby reducing the incentives for people with severe impairments to spend down to Medicaid  It will give individuals added choice and access to supports without requiring them to become impoverished to qualify The CLASS Act is an important step in the evolution of public policy toward a new focus on helping individuals overcome barriers to independence that they may confront due to severe functional impairments  It is an important extension of concepts embodied in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA   the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  ADA   and Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 Specifics of the billScope The CLASS Act will establish a national insurance program  financed by voluntary premium payments to be collected through payroll withholding and placed in a National Independence Fund  The Department of Health and Human Services will manage the Fund as a new insurance program  and may enter into contractual agreements with those entities that states direct to assume administrative program implementation roles Enrollment in the Program Any individual who is at least 18 years old and actively working will be automatically enrolled  unless they op out   and pay their premiums through payroll deduction or another alternative method  Any non working spouse may enroll in the program and pay their premiums through an alternative payment procedure Triggering the Benefit To qualify for CLASS Act benefits  individuals must be at least 18 years old and have contributed to the program during at least 5 years  Eligibility for benefits will be determined by state disability determination centers and will be limited to   1  individuals who are unable to perform two or more activities of daily living  ADL  e g  eating  bathing  dressing   or  2  individuals who have an equivalent cognitive disability that requires supervision or hands on assistance to perform those activities  e g  traumatic brain injury  Alzheimers disease  multiple sclerosis  mental retardation Benefits  To account for differences in independence support needs  there will be two cash benefit tiers  Tier 1 benefits   50 day  will be payable to eligible individuals who are unable to perform 2 or more ADLs or have the equivalent cognitive impairment  Tier 2 benefits   100 day  will be payable to individuals who are unable to perform 4 or more ADLs or have the equivalent cognitive impairment The monthly case benefit will be posted monthly to a debit account or a Choice Account  Individuals who do not use the full monthly amount may roll it over from month to month  but not year to year However  once an individual becomes ineligible for CLASS benefits  by improvement in functional status or death   CLASS Act benefits will cease  Any residual balance of available services remaining on the individuals account will not be payable  If an eligible individual does choose to move into an institutional facility  CLASS Act benefits will be used to defray those associated expenses Relationship of CLASS Act Insurance Program to Social Security Disability InsuranceEligibility for CLASS Act benefits will be independent of whether or not an individual is eligible for SSDI  so participation in the CLASS Act insurance program will not impair an individuals ability to remain qualified for SSDI Relationship of CLASS Act Insurance Program to Social Security Retirement BenefitsSimilarly  eligibility for CLASS Act benefits will be independent of retirement benefits eligibility Relationship to MedicaidIf an individual is eligible for CLASS Act benefits  and are also eligible for the long term care benefit under Medicaid  CLASS Act benefits can be used to offset the costs to Medicaid  thus producing Medicaid savings for the state Relationship to Private Long Term Care InsuranceThe Class program benefit does not replace the need for basic health insurance     it provides a mechanism to pay for those non medical expenses that allow a disabled person to remain independent  The Class program benefit can be an addition to long term care insurance  It provides a consistent  basic cash benefit to glove with the insurance products that provide more intense medical services over a shorter period of time THE CLASS ACTOur nation has too long ignored the emerging crisis of addressing the long term service and support needs of seniors and younger persons with disabilities in a fiscally responsible manner that promotes independence  choice and helping families  Over 60 diverse national organizations have come to together to support the bipartisan CLASS Act  Community Living Assistance Services and Supports   which will soon be reintroduced  We urge you to contact Connie Garner with Senator Kennedys office at 224 6390 to become an original cosponsor the proposal  Our current system forces people prematurely into institutions  requires many to spend down into poverty before receiving the help they need  fails to provide realistic opportunities for personal responsibility  and fails to support families  America can and must do better  The CLASS Act addresses these problems  can receive broad support  and can provide a vehicle for our nation to come together to discuss the challenges we face in a meaningful  productive way  Key elements of the CLASS Act include  A fiscally responsible approach that is designed to be budget neutral and restrain future Medicaid spending   A structure that retains an important role for private insurance and promotes personal responsibility   Voluntary participation in the kind of broad based risk pool needed to keep it affordable  To qualify for CLASS Act benefits  individuals must have contributed  30 in monthly premiums  through a voluntary payroll deduction  unless they choose to opt out   for at least 5 years  Tier 1 benefits   50 day  will be payable to individuals unable to perform 2 or more ADLs or have the equivalent cognitive impairment  Tier 2 benefits   100 day  will be payable to individuals unable to perform 4 or more ADLs or have the equivalent cognitive impairment  These types of voucher payments avoid bureaucracies  and empower consumers by enabling them to control what services they get  how  where and from whom  These benefit levels would respectively cover only about one quarter or one half of the current average cost of nursing home care  thereby retaining an important role for private insurance  This balanced public private sector approach was supported by the 63 diverse members of Citizens for Long Term Care  which included insurer and employer groups  chaired by former Republican Senator David Durenberger  The coalition agreed on a structure envisioned under the CLASS Act  with a broad based public program that would provide a minimum floor of protection in a way that is sufficiently flexible to best help families and disabled individuals meet their unique circumstances  The CLASS Act will help employers by providing support both to persons with disabilities to better enable them to work  and to working caregivers to help reduce absenteeism and maintain productivity  The proposal can also relieve some of the current pressure on employers to pay for part of the cost of long term supports and services their employees families need  The CLASS Act of 2007Organizations
