         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      A month ago  in the face of a tragedy that has touched us all  America s workers showed their heroism  Many airline workers were killed in the line of duty that day and it took great courage for airline workers to keep us flying in the face of great personal loss  Yet  now more than 120 000 of those airline workers have been laid off as a direct result of the attacks  These workers  many without resources and health insurance for their families  need our assistance  Congress acted quickly to take care of the management of the airline industry  but sadly today  my colleagues have failed to deliver similar help to America s airline workers      Today s vote means that help for airline workers is delayed but not denied  We will not adjourn until help is provided for these workers and their families  Congress must act quickly get our economy moving again  The best way to do that is by helping America s workers      Stephanie Cutter  202  224 2633
