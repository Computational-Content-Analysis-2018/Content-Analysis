         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the Middle East  I am extremely concerned by the ongoing violence in the Middle East  which we cannot allow to escalate any further  The stakes are enormously high  and American leadership is essential   In 1996  Secretary Christopher brokered an agreement to end the violence between Israel and Hezbollah  and Secretary Rice could play the same role  This is an international crisis of the first order  While Im glad that Secretary Rice has announced shell go to the region some time in the future  she should be on the first plane to the Middle East  We should send high ranking diplomats across the region to avert an even larger crisis   We must do all that we can to find a diplomatic path away from the escalating violence  The Israeli people should not be terrorized by Hezbollah rockets coming over the border into their country   The Lebanese people should not be held hostage to Hezbollah terrorists and their backers in Syria and Iran  We all pray that Hezbollahs rockets will be silenced and that a diplomatic path away from the escalating violence will be found       Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
