         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       When it comes to national security  our country is far stronger when the government stands united  We all agree on the need for law enforcement and intelligence officers to have strong powers to investigate terrorism  to prevent future attacks  and improve information sharing between federal  state and local law enforcement  This is not a question of party or politics  It is a question of national security  and we should all come together to meet our obligations and protect the safety and security of the United States    Americans deserve national security laws that protect both our security and our constitutional rights  and we have not yet achieved the goal set by the 9 11 Commissioners  to adopt governmental powers that truly enhance our national security while ensuring adequate oversight over their use    For the past five years  Congress has stood ready to work with the President to give him the necessary tools to protect America  In fact  the Congress has worked with the President on the PATRIOT Act and many other important measures to strengthen our national security laws  However  through a rampant series of leaks  we find out that this Administration has pursued many secret programs and pursued a solitary path that rides roughshod over the historic legal standards that have made this country great    Other than President Bush and Vice President Cheney  no person has been more central to the policies of the Bush Administrationand their dubious legal justificationsthan you  Mr  Attorney General  Your name has been linked with a litany of troubling acts  implementing warrantless surveillance outside the scope of the law  endorsing legal opinions stretching the limit for our countrys treatment of detainees  and creating a legal limbo for detainees at Guantanamo Bay    On issue after issue  you have endorsed expediency over the rule of law  You advocated a breathtakingly expansive view of Presidential power  purporting to put the Executive Branch above the law   Youve been at the center of a torture policy that has predictably run amok  contradicting the values and cherished principles that Americans hold so dear    From the beginning  you adopted an absurdly narrow definition of torture in order to permit extreme interrogation practices  You signed off on interpretations of law that would allow any interrogation technique that stopped short of organ failure or death    You ignored the plain language of the Geneva Conventions in an attempt to immunize those who may commit war crimes  The Supreme Court has rebuked the Administrations treatment of detainees  Yet  it still remains an open question whether the Administration will continue to push a discredited interpretation of our treaty obligations to permit the C I A  to commit cruel  inhuman and degrading acts outside the United States  A very troubling characteristic of the way these policies have been formulated is that people who should have been involved in the process have been shut out  From Colin Powell  to career military lawyers and experts in the Departments of Justice or State  we have heard repeatedly that the normal process was not followed and voices that should have been heard during the internal debate were not consulted or  worse    ignored  Similarly  the Administration has consistently sought to avoid congressional oversight of its policies  The result  quite predictably  has been bad law and bad policy    In an interview last summer  you told the Academy of Achievement that the hardest part of his job is saying no to the President and others in the Administration  You said  to be an effective lawyeryou have to say nothere are limits to what can be done  even for the Attorney General and even for a president  Given the Administrations policies  it is alarming to imagine which  if any    policies you have said no to  We know now that you didnt say no when the President chose to ignore well established laws for domestic surveillance    Since 1978  Congress has never authorized nor approved domestic electronic surveillance of United States citizens without a warrant  The conference report makes clear that Congress was setting forth a standard for President Ford  and all future Presidents to follow  The laws purpose has always been clear  to put an end to any wiretapping under the blanket claim of national security  Congress also made clear that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act established the exclusive means by which such surveillance may be conducted    The Act was also intended to ensure that the Executive Branch  under any President  did not ignore basic civil liberties of the American people by utilizing an unchecked inherent power to eavesdrop on U S  soil  After September 11th  the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress did not authorize domestic electronic surveillance  and certainly not domestic electronic surveillance of American citizens  without a judicially approved warrant    At a minimum  the Committee should be able to know the details of the surveillance programs the President authorized    more than 30 times    since the September 11th attacks  On January 27th  every Democratic Senator on this Committee requested documents from the Attorney General to support the legal justifications for the program before he testified  We received no response    The Administration refuses even to give us an inventory of all the relevant documents  much less a legitimate reason for rejecting our document request  There is no rational purpose in denying Congressional access to the legal thought and analysis relied on by the Administration to develop  create and maintain these surveillance activities   The President does not have a blank check on matters of national security  Yet  over the past five years  the Administration has taken us down a dangerous path  violating the well established checks and balances of the Constitution  In Hamdan v  Rumsfeld  the Supreme Court said the President had gone too far  As Justice Stevens noted  the Executive is bound to comply with the Rule of Law    If our current national security laws are not adequate  the Administration should work with both Republican and Democratic Members of Congress to update our laws with due regard for the Constitution  treaties  and the laws of war  Today  and going forward  we will see whether the Administration is ready to get back on track and work with Congress on the urgent priorities facing our country today
