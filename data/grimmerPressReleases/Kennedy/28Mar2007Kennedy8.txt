         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I welcome our witnesses and thank them for their willingness to join us today  This hearing is one of many the Committee is having to prepare for the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act   This afternoon  well hear about successful strategies for involving parents in their childrens education  and for engaging communities as partners in helping children learn and succeed in school   Its clear that engaged parents can make a positive difference in students achievement  Parents are their childrens first teachers  and they have immense influence over their childrens attitudes  focus  priorities and goals  Well informed parents are more likely to be involved  to ask questions  to suggest constructive changes and to make a difference in their childs education  They deserve to know what their children are learning and being tested on  what their childrens grades and assessment scores mean  and how assessment data may be used for improvement   Informed and engaged parents can help turn struggling schools around We crafted the No Child Left Behind Act to recognize parents as full partners in their childrens education   The Act requires schools and districts to develop parent involvement policies and programs with input from parents  Schools  districts and states must release Report Cards to inform parents about how their childrens schools are doing  Schools must inform parents if they missed AYP or were identified for improvement or corrective action  Struggling schools must create a team of parents and community representatives to develop a plan to improve the school  Parents are also invited to be decision makers  such as choosing to transfer their children to another public school or enroll in a supplemental service program  Its important to continue these essential requirements and ensure their effective implementation   But in this reauthorization  we must also explore new and innovative strategies to engage parents and communities in helping kids succeed in school   Its especially important for schools to have effective ways to reach out to low income parents and parents whose primary language is not English   A recent report found that many schools struggle to communicate with these parents  but the parents often feel that school staff dont understand them  When lines of communication arent open and effective  students may not get the most out of their education  Better coordination among parents  schools and the community can help create a network that enables and empowers students to take advantage of every opportunity to learn   Thats particularly important for students needing the greatest help and attention in their learning  as well as for students at risk of dropping out of school Better ways of connecting schools with the communities around them can help respond to the social  emotional  physical  and intellectual needs of students  and provide a safety net of integrated services for children   This is especially important in the many schools where resources and staff are stretched thin  Involving community organizations enables teachers to focus on instruction and learning  while experienced community members offer other comprehensive services Last year  for example  a Massachusetts pilot initiative in Boston placed 15 full time Family and Community Outreach Coordinators in Title I schools to help families  teachers  and the community support students academically and socially   We know that comprehensive supports in school can increase graduation rates and student achievement   In one national study  82 percent of students improved their attendance in school  89 percent had fewer suspensions  98 percent stayed in school and 85 percent of eligible seniors graduated   Many districts have gone even further to involve the community by establishing full service community schools that offer comprehensive support to students and families  such as health and social services  parent training  youth programs  community service and service learning  and other opportunities  These schools open their doors to community members to use the facilities and resources  and to connect with students and parents  The Gardner School in Boston offers before school and after school programs  mentoring  academic tutoring  a full time nurse  counseling services  weekly parenting  ESL classes for immigrant parents  and other events with business leaders and community members  Community involvement makes an enormous difference in keeping families strong and helping students learn and achieve in school Its clear that we must make both community and parent involvement a top priority  and help schools involve families and community members in education  We need to develop the capacity of states and districts to prioritize and invest in effective programs  Students need and deserve support from their family and community to stay in school  study hard  graduate from high school  and go on to college or find good jobs  Many schools are already launching such programs and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about initiatives that are working  and about other strategies to meet this important goal   Thank you for being here   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
