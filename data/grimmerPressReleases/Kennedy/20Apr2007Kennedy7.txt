 Lehmann  I am writing about information that has come to my attention which raises concerns about possible improprieties in the federally guaranteed student loan program at Capella University   Specifically  my office has obtained information showing that you were paid pursuant to consulting arrangements with a student loan company that the Universitys financial aid office designated as a preferred lender  Student Loan Xpress   According to this information  you were paid more  13 000 pursuant to this consulting agreement between December 2005 and June 2006   The arrangements purportedly compensated you for work in developing a Virtual Financial Aid Office product for Student Loan Xpress   The most disturbing element of your relationship with Student Loan Xpress is contained in a document obtained by my office which seems to show a quid pro quo between you and the company with regard to your duties as financial aid director    In light of these events  I ask that you provide to my office information and documents concerning your relationship to and communications with Student Loan Xpress   Please see the attached Document Request for specifics   I ask that you coordinate the production of documents with Nicholas W  Bath  Counsel to the Committee  at  202  224 6912  Thank you for your consideration
