         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    GRAHAM AMENDMENT SACRIFICES FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF AMERICAN JUSTICE   As Prepared for Delivery   An enforcement only strategy for resolving our immigration crisis has not and cannot work  It ignores the underlying reasons for illegal immigrationpeople come to the United States to work and unite with their families  Without a comprehensive approach to resolving our broken immigration system we are merely ignoring the problem rather than resolving it  Any immigration discussion must give people hope for the future This side by side amendment recognizes that hope is an essential component of resolving our immigration crisis  There must be a balancewe must temper increased border enforcement with reasonable interior enforcement and some promise of resolving the plight of the undocumented  This amendment does that  addressing the border enforcement concerns  eliminating the draconian interior enforcement provisions offered by the Republicans  and giving hope through Agjobs and the Dream Act  We cannot support the Graham amendment because it sacrifices fundamental principles of American justice in the belief that we must do everything necessaryno matter how much it endangers our civil rightsto stop illegal immigration  We believe that the laws in effect now provide sufficient legal protections and tough enforcement capabilities without the draconian solutions proposed by the Republicans This amendment would force DHS to use its limited resources for imprisoning women and children who overstayed their visas rather than to find and remove criminals and terrorists  If the Republican amendment became law  nearly fifty percent of the undocumented population could be placed in jail  This is not how we need to spend our resources nor does this foster a fair but balanced approach to immigration This amendment would allow DHS to use secret and classified evidence against applicants  without any mechanism for seeing that evidence or challenging it The amendment would deny immigrants their day in court by creating burdensome  impossible standards for challenging immigration decisions in federal court And the amendment would go further by stripping immigrants of basic rights regarding convictions  If a conviction is overturned or expunged  under this amendment  the immigrant may still be subject to deportation even if a court has found him or her not guilty In America  we have a long and proud tradition of providing refuge to people who faced persecution and oppression in their lands  whose lives are at risk because they stood up for their beliefs We took in refugees from Cuba and Vietnam as they fled communism We helped people from Somalia  Bosnia and other areas of conflict and oppression And now were beginning to help people whose lives are at risk because they helped our troops in Iraq But often  these persecuted refugees had no choice but to cooperate with their oppressors in order to save their families lives and enable their escape The Graham amendment says if you do that  if you provide whats called material support to these oppressors and terrorist groups  then were not going to rescue you from the hands of your oppressors  You have to take your chances and hope your oppressors dont persecute or even kill your family Consider the case of Helene from Sierra Leone  Revolutionary United Front rebels attacked her home and hacked one family member to death with a machete  They set her son on fire  leaving him near dead with severe burns  They held her family captive  raping her and her daughter  and forcing them to cook for them and wash their clothes Under the Graham amendment  Helene would be ineligible to come to America as a refugee because she cooked for the rebels and washed their clothes  Under the Graham amendment  she and her family are ineligible because they provided material support for a terrorist group If thats not bad enough  the Graham amendment says she can be excluded based on secret evidence  evidence that neither she nor anyone else outside the government can see  She may never know why she was excluded    The door to freedom in America would be closed shut  End of discussion  You go back into the hands of your persecutors Surely  by now we have learned that closed proceedings conducted by executive branch officials based on secret evidence without any possibility of court review are inconsistent with Americas traditions and inconsistent with the search for justice  Lets not go down that road again Instead  let us give honest men and women hope for the future  Our amendment would do so by providing a down payment for the future  We may not be able to resolve the plight of all twelve million undocumented immigrants today  but we can make a start by enacting Agjobs and the Dream Act  which  taken together  would benefit several million undocumented workers and students      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
