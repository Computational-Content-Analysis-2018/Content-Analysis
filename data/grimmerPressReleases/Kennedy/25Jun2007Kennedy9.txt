         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Over the years  the American workplace has changed immensely for the better  It was not so long ago that the normal workday was 10 hours or even more  The workweek was six days  There was no overtime pay or minimum wage  Workers regularly risked injury or death on the job because there were no workplace laws  There was no workers compensation  Children often worked long hours in dangerous  unhealthy factories The progress that ended those practices did not come by accident  nor did it come easily  The American worker has more safety and dignity today because workers came together and joined their voices to demand these changes  They launched one of the greatest progressive movements of the 20th Century  the trade union movement  Unions have always led the fight for a safer  fairer workplace  They have always been the voice of working families Progress has been made  but there is no cause for complacency  American workers are facing major new challenges  Rapid advances in technology  globalization and other powerful changes are fundamentally altering our economy and our society  The new  global economy has helped the nation prosper  but the men and women who did so much to build this prosperity  Americas workers  are not seeing the benefits  They should  They are working harder than ever in the Bush economy  but theyre not receiving their fair share of our economic growth  Since President Bush took office  corporate profits have increased 83 percent  Productivity is up 18 percent  But household income has declined significantly and the wages of working Americans have been stagnant  For the first time  young men are earning less than their fathers did  Six million Americans have lost their health insurance  Their retirement security is fading as well  Only 1 in 5 workers earns a guaranteed pension  People feel insecure about their jobs  their incomes  their health insurance  their childrens futures  and their own prospects for a dignified retirement The American dream is increasingly out of reach  and the middle class is declining  Inequality is rising to record levels not seen since the gilded age  Today  more than 40  of the countrys total income goes to the wealthiest 10  of Americans  The top one tenth of one percent of Americans receive nearly 7  of the total income of our entire country  It didnt used to be this way  There was a time when all Americans shared in the benefits of the nations rapid growth  The rising tide truly did lift all boats  It was a time when union membership was growing  when unions were building Americas middle class  From the 1940s to the 1960s  union membership reached its peak  During that same time  wages and productivity rose together  Workers shared in corporate gains  and our entire society benefited as a result  I believe that we can overcome the challenges that the new  global economy presents for our country  We can return to a time of shared prosperity  But to do so  we must give employees back their voice  so they can come together again to obtain whats fair  and reclaim the American Dream  More than half of workers today say they would join a union if they could  which means almost 60 million workers across the country want a stronger voice at work  We know that strong unions mean a strong middle class  They mean higher wages    union wages are 30 percent higher than non union wages  Strong unions mean better health care  80 percent of union workers have health insurance  compared to only 49 percent of non union workers  They mean more security  union members are almost twice as likely to have paid sick days  and are four times more likely to have a secure  guaranteed pension  Its no wonder that so many American workers want union representation  The question is  why dont they have it  The reason is shamefully clear  our labor laws are too weak to protect workers basic rights  Workers who try to exercise their freedom to form a union find that the system is rigged against them   Jeff Lemon works at the Beaver County Times distribution center in Pennsylvania  When he and his coworkers were denied the raises promised by the company  they asked for a union election  As soon as they did so  the company launched an anti union campaign  Management threatened to eliminate jobs and replace workers with outside contractors  Employees were forced to attend anti union meetings  Managers spied on workers  And Jeff Lemon was fired for his union activity Despite the threats and intimidation  Jeffs coworkers voted for the union two years ago  But they still dont have a contract  The company keeps stalling and refuses to reach an agreement  The National Labor Relations Board says Jeffs discharge was illegal  But the company is fighting that decision and refusing to give Jeff his job back  It could be years before he gets back the job he needs  Or consider the story of Santana Blanca  who worked as a clerk at a waste management company  On her breaks from work  Santana often confided in her friend and coworker  Iris  and sometimes they talked about a union organizing campaign going on at the company  Unknown to Santana  company supervisors had recruited Iris to spy on workers union activities  They even asked Iris to try to change Santanas mind about the union  A few days after Iris reported to her employer that Santana supported the union  Santana was fired  Certainly  not all employers are bad actors  A responsible employer has nothing to fear from a union organizing effort  But  unfortunately  stories like Jeffs and Santanas are all too common  Unscrupulous employers routinely break the law to keep unions out  They intimidate workers  harass them  and discriminate against them  They close down whole departments  or even entire plants  to avoid negotiating a union contact  They fire union activists The problem is widespread  twenty percent of all workers who openly support unions during an organizing campaign are fired  More than 30 000 workers in 2005 were fired or retaliated against for their union activity  Its illegal and its unacceptable  but it happens every day An entire industry of anti union consultants coaches employers on how to oppose a union organizing campaign  They teach companies to lie and to cheat  They urge businesses to identify and fire union activists  in order to intimidate the rest of the employees  They taint the union election process  and deny workers the freedom of choice they deserve  The current NLRB process isnt a fair election  Its become a war where the playing field is slanted so theres no hope of a fair fight  If the elections that put Members of Congress in office were run this way  we wouldnt put up with it  No one would tolerate an election where one candidate could force the voters to listen to their campaign ads  but the other couldnt even enter the state  where one candidate signs the voters paychecks  but the other cant find out who the voters are  But thats how union elections are run Even when the union wins an election  employers can steal the victory by refusing to bargain fairly for a first contract  They drag their feet  delay bargaining  and prevent an agreement  Even if theyre caught and found to have broken the law  the only remedy is to go back and engage in more of the same Over a third of all the workers in hard won union elections are denied a contract because of employers delaying tactics  They put their jobs on the line to support the union  and get nothing in return except delay and frustration Workers deserve better  They deserve respect  They deserve fair treatment  They deserve the freedom to choose a union  Thats why we need the Employee Free Choice Act  This legislation will fix our broken system and restore employees basic freedoms  The core of this legislation protects the right of workers to choose their own representative through majority sign up  If a majority of workers sign cards saying they want a union  the employer has to recognize the workers choice  Majority sign up is nothing new  From 1935 until the mid 1960s  the National Labor Relations Board certified unions based on majority sign up  Since then  the NLRB has recognized bargaining relationships based on majority sign up if the employer agrees to do so Majority sign up means basic fairness for workers  They are subjected to less pressure from employers and from coworkers  Today  employees who have gone through an election campaign are twice as likely to report that their employer coerced them to oppose the union Majority sign up also benefits companies  For years  responsible employers such as Cingular Wireless and Kaiser Permanente have recognized unions chosen by their workers through majority sign up   These companies have found that majority sign up minimizes conflicts and promotes a more cooperative  productive workplace  Its good for the company bottom line too  Weve all heard the argument that its always better to have elections  But theres nothing more American than using your John Hancock to stand up for what you believe in  Just as you sign on the dotted line to join a political party  support a petition for a good cause  volunteer for community service  or make a donation to a charity  you should be able to sign a card saying you want a union Majority sign up is simple  Its fair  and it ensures that if a majority of workers want a union  theyll get one  Theres nothing more democratic than that Our legislation will also stop employers from taking away the victories of workers who have chosen a union  It requires employers to come to the table to bargain for a first contract  If theres a stalemate in negotiations  an employer cant just stonewall until workers get frustrated and give up  Our bill also provides for mediation and  when necessary  arbitration of first contract disputes  Finally  the Employee Free Choice Act puts real teeth in the law  Today  the penalties for misconduct are so low  employers benefit from waging war rather than complying with the law  They can dismiss the insignificant fines and penalties they pay years later as a minor cost of doing business  Certainly  many employers respect their workers and do what it takes to comply with the law  But we need to deal with the bad actors  We need to stop the lawbreaking that has become alarmingly common  Its the only way to restore the voice of American workers and put our country back on the right track  The Senate has a clear opportunity tomorrow to take a stand for working families  By restoring fairness to the American workplace  and strengthening the voice of American workers  we can rebuild the land of opportunity  a land with good jobs and fair wages and benefits that can support a family  We can revitalize the American middle class and restore the American dream I urge my colleagues to vote for the Employee Free Choice Act  Its vital legislation for the economic security of our country and the dignity of our workforce I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting to proceed to this important legislation       Laura Capps
