         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Todays debate involves one of the most important issues in our democracy  Dr  Martin Luther King called the right to vote civil right number one  Yet hundreds of thousands of Americans who live in the nations capital have been denied an equal voice in our democracy  Citizens in the District of Columbia live in the very shadow of the Capitol  Building  but they have no representative who can vote their interests within these halls  Its long past time for us to finally correct this basic wrong       I commend Senators Lieberman  Hatch and Bennett for their strong leadership on this legislation      Since the Revolutionary War  No taxation without representation has been a fundamental American principle  Its a famous phrase in our history  James Otis said it first in a historic speech in Massachusetts in 1763  and it was so inspiring that John Adams later said  Then and there  the child independence was born     Yet more than two centuries later  citizens who live in the nations capital still bear the unfair burden of taxation without representation  The more than half a million District of   Columbia residents pay significant federal taxes each year  In fact  D C  residents have the second highest per capita tax burden in the nation  Yet they have no say in how federal taxes are spent  and they have no role in writing the nations tax laws     Residents of the District have fought and died in every war to defend American interests  237 D C  residents died in the Vietnam War  Today  while we debate whether D C  citizens deserve a vote in Congress  many brave Americans who live in the District are fighting for voting rights in Iraq  Since the beginning of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  2813 D C  residents  2110 members of the active duty military and 703 members of the reserve forces  have been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan  In the course of these conflicts  28 D C  residents have been wounded or killed      Citizens of the District of Columbia have no voice when Congress considers whether to go to war  The brave soldiers from the nations capital have no representation in Congress when the votes are counted on funding levels for our troops and other issues relating to the war  When Congress debates assistance to war veterans or considers how to improve conditions at Walter  Reed Hospital  the patriotic veterans who live in this city have no vote  Its unconscionable     If were for democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan  we should certainly be for democracy in the District of Columbia as well      Ive long been a strong supporter of D C  representation in Congress  In 1978  I worked with Walter Fauntroy and many others on a constitutional amendment to correct this basic injustice  We finally passed the constitutional amendment in Congress  but we werent able to get it ratified by a sufficient number of states to take effect  Because we werent successful then  the issue remains just as urgent today       Fortunately  a constitutional amendment isnt the only option  The Constitutions District Clause provides another  legal means for providing citizens of the District of Columbia a vote in Congress  As respected constitutional scholars have made clear  Article I  Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to exercise exclusive Legislation  in all Cases whatsoever  over such District of Columbia  The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress s exclusive authority over the District   of Columbia is broad and national in the highest sense   O Donoghue v  United States  289 U S  516  539 40  1933         Some have questioned the constitutionality of this approach  Although I supported a constitutional amendment in the past  I disagree that a constitutional amendment is the only valid option  Nothing in the Constitution explicitly denies residents of this city a voice in Congress  Judges Patricia Wald and Kenneth Starr  both of whom served on the respected U S  Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit  have studied this approach to giving the District a vote in the House of Representatives  Both have concluded that it is constitutional  As they and others have noted  the Supreme Court has recognized that Congress has the power to treat District of Columbia citizens as citizens of a state in other contexts  For instance  the District is treated as a state for purposes of diversity jurisdiction in federal courts  although Article III  Section 2 of the Constitution provides for diversity jurisdiction in suits between citizens of different States  I ask unanimous consent to include in the record at the end of my remarks a letter from 25 legal scholars who support the constitutionality of this legislation       Its impossible to believe that the Founding Fathers  having just finished a war to ensure democratic representation in America  would then insist on denying that representation to citizens living in the capital of their new nation  Granting the District a vote in Congress is consistent with the spirit  as well as the letter  of our Constitution      Even if you disagree about the bills constitutionality  we should not filibuster this important measure  Surely even my colleagues who have a different view of the constitutionality can agree that this issue is important enough to deserve an up or down vote  The Senates filibuster of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 was one of its darkest days  We should not repeat that mistake now     This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue  When we passed the constitutional amendment in 1978  we had strong support from Republicans like Senators Goldwater  Dole  and Thurmond  in addition to Democrats  Today  the bill has strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate  Thats because this issue is so obviously an issue of simple justice      The Senate Judiciary Committee recently held a hearing to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1957  We heard moving testimony in favor of this bill from Congressman John Lewis  our distinguished colleague in the House of Representatives and a leader in the continuing struggle for equal voting rights  At the age of only 23  Congressman Lewis headed the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and helped organize a march on Washington  He and others were brutally assaulted during the fateful voting rights march at the Edmund Pettis  Bridge  but their sacrifices helped inspire the progress that was to come       Congressman Lewis reminded us of the sacrifices of those who gave their lives for equal voting rights in this country  and called on us to pass the D C  Voting Rights Act  He reminded us of our obligation to give the District a vote in Congress     I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on this important bill  and then vote for final passage of the bill  so that we can finally correct this historic wrong and to do it on our watch
