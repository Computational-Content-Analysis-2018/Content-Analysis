         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      PDF OF LETTER AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST   KENNEDY URGES COLLEAGUES TO REJECT EFFORTS TO INCREASE INTEREST RATE ON STUDENT LOANS IN EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy wrote a letter to Appropriations Chairman Senator Thad Cochran and Ranking Member Senator Robert C  Byrd urging the Senators to make college more affordable for families by rejecting efforts to increase interest rates on student loans in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act   As millions of middle class families struggle with college costs  Congress should stand with students and reject calls from the banks to raise interest rates on student loans  With higher gas prices  higher health costs  and higher college tuition  its time to give average families a break for a change   Kennedy urged Senators Cochran and Byrd to review last weeks editorial in the Washington Post that highlights the inappropriate and unseemly lobbying efforts to increase interest rates and urged them to reject such proposals in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill   June 6  2006    The Honorable Thad Cochran Chairman  Committee on Appropriations United States Senate Washington  DC 20510 The Honorable Robert C  Byrd Ranking Member  Committee on Appropriations United States Senate Washington  DC 20510   Dear Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Byrd  I know that conferees on the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act have been asked to include language to increase interest rates on student loans in the Direct Lending program  With college tuition at an all time high  I urge you to reject this request   As you may know  when the Deficit Reduction Act was signed into law in February of this year  it raised the interest rates on parent borrowers in the Federal Family Education Loan  FFEL  program  but not in the Direct Loan program  I understand that lenders and others are lobbying to equalize rates in the two programs by increasing rates on borrowers in the Direct Loan program  I hope you agree that this is an untenable solution  and I urge you to reject proposals that increase interest rates for any student loan borrower   Families already struggle to afford the cost of college  Since 2001  public college tuition has increased by 46 percent and more and more students are forced to borrow in order to attend college  The average debt of a public college graduate is  17 600 today  while a private college student graduates with an average of  22 581 in debt  According to the Congressional Budget Office  the interest rate increase being proposed by the lenders will cost parents in the Direct Loan program an additional  365 million over the next five years  I am attaching for your reference an editorial from last weeks Washington Post that highlights these inappropriate efforts to increase rates on student loans   Families need our help  especially in this era of globalization  when a college degree is more important than ever before  I hope you agree that we must do all we can to make college more affordable for families  and I urge you to reject any efforts to increase interest rates on student loans in Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act    Sincerely   Edward M  Kennedy  Fortuitous ErrorCongress mistakenly undercharged some student loan borrowers  which might be good news Friday  June 2  2006  Page A18IT S ONE OF those classic  only in Washington situations  In December  Congress passed a bill designed to cut the federal deficit    and made a mistake  One of the money saving measures in the bill  in fact a money raising measure  increased the interest rate on guaranteed student loans made to parents from 7 9 percent to 8 5 percent  However  in their eagerness to get out of town before Christmas  members drafted the legislation in such a way that parents borrowing money using banks and other lending institutions make the new payment  while parents borrowing through the Direct Loan program  which comes directly from the government  will still be paying the older  cheaper rate Congress had always intended to fix this anomaly  which kicks in on July 1  But in the meantime  the whole matter has become rather awkward  For one  the error drew attention to the little noticed fact that parents of college students are being squeezed to pay down the deficit  There has also been some unseemly lobbying by banks    and  alarmingly  by some college financial aid officers    to get the government to raise the rates on the direct loans  Many school financial aid offices operate symbiotically with lending institutions  accepting gifts of equipment and other perks in exchange for directing students their way  Clearly  they didn t relish competition from direct loans    nor did they seem to feel their role involved lobbying for lower rates all around The deepest irony  though  is that study after study has shown that direct loans are cheaper for taxpayers than loans that flow through middlemen  But because of the incentives that those middlemen offer colleges  not as many students wind up using the direct loans  Perhaps Congress should just leave its mistake in place  and let students start clamoring for the direct loans    which would  in the long term  help cut the federal deficit   Laura Capps
