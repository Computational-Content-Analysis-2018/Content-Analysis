         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       Im pleased that the Committee today will act on legislation to provide protection for the confidential sources of reporters  Ive long supported the need to enact protection for journalists sources  Shortly after the Supreme Court failed to find sufficient protection for journalists in Branzburg v  Hayes in 1972  I joined Sen  Alan Cranston in introducing the Free Flow of Information Act  The need for federal legislation remains strong     The First Amendment to the Constitution recognizes that a free press is one of the foundations upon which our democracy is built  Thomas Jefferson drove home the point in his famous statement  Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government  I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter      Throughout our history  the press has been an indispensable check on government  The information produced by the press contributes to our policy debates  exposes wrongdoing  and in fundamental ways makes our democracy work  A government that acts in the sunshine is far less likely to behave in unlawful or tyrannical ways  A citizenry informed by a free and robust press is essential to our nation     Confidential sources are important to the vigorous journalism that helps keep our society healthy  As government secrecy has grown  confidential sources who are willing to speak about policy matters or reveal corruption and governmental wrongdoing have become increasingly important  Release of the Pentagon Papers was instrumental in educating the country about the misguided decisions driving the Vietnam War  and the revelations about Watergate might not have reached the public but for the willingness of confidential sources to expose government malfeasance  We might not have learned about conditions at Abu Ghraib or Walter  Reed Medical  Center or the politicization that has stained the Department of Justice without the assistance of journalists and their confidential sources     Forty nine states and the District of Columbia now recognize some form of protection for journalists sources  either through legislation or judicial decision  It is time for the federal government to do the same     The bill before us is a compromise bill  It does not grant full protection to reporters sources  It recognizes the special needs of national security  It strikes a balance between the need to protect confidential sources and the need to ensure that our justice system can obtain essential information  The bill protects only confidential sources  It makes sure that a reporter rarely will be the first resort in obtaining information and requires a weighing of the public interest in disclosure      Even though the bill is a compromise  it is supported by a wide range of newspapers  networks and journalists associations  They recognize that although the bill provides only a qualified privilege for confidential sources  it gives them far more protection than they now have under federal law     I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to resist amendments that would narrow its protections further          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
