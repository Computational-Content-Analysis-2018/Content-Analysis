         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I intend to support the Iraq spending bill  Although I disagree strongly with some of the bill s provisions  these funds are clearly needed for our troops  All of us support our troops  We obviously want to do all that we can to see that they have proper equipment  vehicles  and everything else they need to protect their lives as they carry out their missions     It s scandalous that the Administration has kept sending them into battle in Iraq without proper equipment  No soldier should be sent into battle unprotected  No parents should have to go in desperation to the local Wal Mart to buy armored plates and mail them to their sons and daughters serving in Iraq    Our military is performing brilliantly under enormously difficult circumstances and we need to give them our supportnot just from our words but our pockets too    One aspect of this bill that I am particularly proud of is the increased funding for humvees for our troops on patrol in Iraq  The Bayh  Kennedy Amendment adds enough additional funds to keep production at increased levels  Some opponents claimed that the Army already had enough armored humvees  and objected to any further increase    But a front page article in the New York Times on April 25th told us the troops  side of the real need for more armor  and the difference it can make  Company E  a Marine Corps unit based at Camp Pendleton  returned from six months in Ramadi last year  and its members were so frustrated with this problem that they decided to tell their story    They did not have enough armored vehicles  13 of the 21 Marines from Company E who were killed in Iraq had been riding in humvees that failed to protect them from bullets or bombs     They saw problems up close  A year ago  eight of them were killed when their humvee was ambushed on the way to aid another unit under fire  The cargo section of the humvee where the troops were riding didn t even have hillbilly armor to protect them from the blast  They were totally unprotected  As one Marine described the attack  All I saw was sandbags  blood and dead bodies  There was no protection in the back     Captain Kelly Royer  Company E s unit commander asked his superiors when he would be getting more armored humvees  He was told that the additional armor hadn t been requested  and that there were production constraints  Another Marine says they complained about the shortages every day  to anybody we could  They told us they were listening  but we didn t see it    These Marines on the frontline knew the armor meant the difference between life and death    the difference between an essential mission and a suicide mission  They were desperate to get more armor  Day after day  they saw the brutal consequences of the Pentagon s incompetence and delay     The lessons learned from the war in Iraq are said to help us in future conflicts  but for all forces facing death every day  the future was yesterday    In fact  the Marines are requesting funds for the coming fiscal year to develop and produce new armored vehicles to avoid these deadly threats     The need is so clear that the request was submitted under the Marine Corps  Urgent Universal Need Statement  which was created to streamline the acquisition process and get equipment to the field faster  They have a plan to meet the future need    but what about the urgent need today    We do not have the luxury of time to wait for these new vehicles to roll off a future assembly line  The need for armored humvees is now  The hillbilly armor they scavenge for and add to their unprotected humvees does not provide adequate protection    The Army says that of the new requirement approved this month  none of it is designated for the Marine Corps  The Pentagon refuses to make this a top priority  They continue to drag their feet    In a report to Congress this month  the Government Accountability Office describes month after month after month of mismanagement by the Pentagon in supplying the armored humvees our troops urgently need to carry out their missions and stay alive    The GAO report found that the Army still has no long term plan to increase the number of armored humvees  The war in Iraq has been going on for two full years  Our troops are under fire every day  and the Pentagon still doesn t have a plan to protect them    In a briefing prepared by the Marines for Congress  they specifically state in their Vehicle Hardening Strategy that funding assistance is required to achieve optimum levels of armor protection    The GAO report clearly points out that the Pentagon s bureaucratic mentality infected its decisions  They tried to solve the problem in a slow and gradual manner  instead of solving it quickly  As the GAO report states  there were two primary causes for the shortages of armored vehicles  First  a decision was made to pace production  rather than use the maximum available capacity  Second  funding allocations did not keep up with rapidly increasing requirements    It is equally obvious that in addition to the bureaucratic mentality at the Pentagon  their cakewalk mentality is also a major part of the problem  Week after week  month after month  they refuse to believe that the insurgency would continue  They want to believe it will soon be over  They don t feel they need to waste dollars on armored humvees that soon won t be needed in Iraq  So month after month  our troops keep paying with their lives  The light the Pentagon sees at the end of the tunnel turns out to be the blinding flash of another roadside bomb exploding under another unprotected humvee in Iraq  They can t even get their story right  Armor Holdings    the company that makes the armored Humvee    told my office recently that its current contract with the Army will actually mean sharp cutbacks in production  Right now  they produce 550 armored Humvees a month  Their contract reduces that number to 239 in June  zero in July  then back to 40 in August  and 71 in September  The company is now negotiating for slightly higher levels of production in June  July  and August  but it still expects to decrease production to 71 by September  What possible justification can there be for the Pentagon to slow down current production so drastically in the months ahead  when armored humvees are so urgently needed    The Pentagon keeps saying  We ll work it out  On nine different occasions  we have asked the Pentagon for their requirements for humvees  and nine times they have been wrong    This bill tells the Department of Defense we won t let them get it wrong a tenth time  For the sake of our troops  Congress acted  and the Pentagon should not ignore it  The contract should be amended immediately to obtain maximum possible production of armored humvees for the months ahead  Our troops are waiting for our answer  and their lives depend on it    Another important part of this bill will be the periodic report it requires on the progress our forces are making in Iraq  Our military is performing brilliantly under enormously difficult circumstances  But they don t want    and the American people don t want   an open ended commitment  After all the blunders that took us into war  we need to be certain that the President has a strategy for success     The  5 7 billion in this bill for training Iraqi Security Forces is a key element of a successful strategy to stabilize Iraq and withdraw American forces     The report will provide the straight answer that we have not had before about how many Iraqi security forces are adequately trained and equipped  We re obviously making progress  but it s far from clear how much  The American people deserve an honest assessment that provides the basic facts    But that s not what we ve been given so far  According to a GAO report in March  U S  government agencies do not report reliable data on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped     The report goes on to say  The Departments of State and Defense no longer report on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are equipped with their required weapons  vehicles  communications  equipment  and body armor    It s clear from the Administration s own statements that they re using the notorious fuzzy math tactic to avoid an honest appraisal    On February 4  2004  Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said  We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces  now more than 200 000 strong     A year later  on January 19  2005  Secretary Condoleezza Rice said that We think the number right now is somewhere over 120 000     On February 3  2005  in response to questions from Senator Levin at a Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing  General Richard Myers  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  conceded that only 40 000 Iraqi security forces are actually capable  He said  48 deployable  battalions  around the country  equals about 40 000  which is the number that can go anywhere and do anything     Obviously  we need a better accounting of how much progress is being made to train and equip effective Iraqi Security forces    The President s commitment to keeping American troops in Iraq as long as it takes and not a day longer is not enough for our soldiers and their loved ones  They deserve a clearer indication of what lies ahead  and so do the American people     I m encouraged that the Administration is finally being required by this bill to tell Congress how many U S  troops will be necessary in Iraq through the end of 2006  The American peopleand especially our men and women in uniform and their families deserve to know how much real progress is being made in training Iraqi troops and how long our forces will be in Iraq  Hopefully  the Administration will submit these reports in good faith  and not attempt to classify this vital information     Another important aspect of the bill is the change in the number of H 2B visas for seasonal workers  The Senate voted 96 4 in favor of an amendment sponsored by Senator Mikulski and myself to provide additional visas for the current year  These visas are a lifeline for small family businesses on Cape Cod and many other firms that rely overwhelmingly on seasonal workers to meet their heavy summer needs  Many use the program year after year  because it is the only way to legally fill temporary and seasonal positions when no American workers are available  Without this amendment  they ll be out of luck this summer  and many will be out of business    This legislative change is designed to be a short term solution to the current visa crisis  in anticipation of comprehensive immigration reform to fix the long term problem  This bill has a two year fix  It does not raise the cap  It simply exempts returning workers who have played by the rules  Employees who have worked here before and returned to their home country are given the opportunity to return to the US to work another season under the H 2B visa program  Without it  many businesses will be forced to shut their doors     I appreciate the support of my colleagues on this important issue  We are one step closer to filling the labor needs of so many hard working small businesses and industries across the country   Unfortunately  not all the immigration provisions included in the bill have this kind of broad support     Included in the conference agreement are the so called Real ID immigration provisions that are highly controversial  harmful  and unnecessary  The Intelligence Reform Act we approved overwhelmingly last year provides real border security solutions  The so called Real ID bill added by the House to this spending bill  contains controversial provisions we rejected last year and likely would have rejected again if we had been given a chance to debate them on the floor of the Senate  They re a false solution on border security  and they serve no purpose except to push an anti immigrant agenda  More than ever  we need to take the time to get border security reform right  as opposed to pushing through legislation to meet the demands of anti immigrant extremists  The stakes are simply too great     In addition to the numerous substantive problems with the Real ID  the process through which they have been forced into this conference report is flawed and unacceptable  The Republican leadership in the House and Senate shut Democrats out of the conference negotiations  Why  Because the House bill has controversial provisions that have questionable support in the Senate and with the American people  Strong arm tactics are offensive and do a great deal of disservice to the important issues of our time  The White House too  once rejected these provisions  yet  they now support them  What important issues will the White House flip flop on next    Those who pushed through these Real ID provisions continue to say that loopholes exist in our immigration and asylum laws that are being exploited by terrorists  They claim these provisions will close them  In fact  they do nothing to improve national security  and leave other big issues unresolved     They want us to believe that its changes will keep terrorists from being granted asylum  But current immigration laws already bar persons engaged in terrorist activity from asylum  Before they receive asylum  all applicants must also undergo extensive security checks  covering all terrorist and criminal databases at the Department of Homeland Security  the FBI  and the CIA     Asylum seekers will find no refuge  Battered women and victims of stalking will be forced to divulge their addresses in order to get driver s licenses  potentially endangering their lives  Many Americans will have other problems with their driver s license  All legal requirements  including labor laws  can now be waived to build a wall  For the first time since the Civil War  habeas corpus will be prohibited  The Real ID provisions contain other broad and sweeping changes to laws that go to the core of our national identity    Each year  countless refugees are forced to leave their countries  fleeing persecution  America has always been a haven for those desperate for such protection  At the very beginning of our history  the refugee Pilgrims seeking religious freedom landed on Plymouth Rock  Ever since  we ve welcomed refugees  and it s made us a better nation  Refugees represent the best of American values  They have stood alone  at great personal cost  against hostile governments for fundamental principles like freedom of speech and religion  We have a responsibility to examine our asylum policies carefully  to see that they are fair and just     But  the Real ID bill tramples this noble tradition and will be devastating for legitimate asylum seekers fleeing persecution  It will make it more difficult for victims fleeing serious human rights abuses to obtain asylum and safety  and could easily lead to their return to their persecutors     Another section of conference report contains a provision that would complete the US Mexico border fence in San Diego  But it goes much farther than that  It gives the Department of Homeland security unprecedented and unchecked authority to waive all legal requirements necessary to build such fences  not only in San Diego  but anywhere else along our 2000 mile border with Mexico and our 4000 mile border with Canada  Building such fences will cost hundreds of millions of dollars  and they still won t stop illegal immigration  What we need are safe and legal avenues for immigrants to come here and work  not more walls     A major additional problem in the Real ID provisions is that it could result in the deportation even of long time legal permanent residents  for lawful speech or associations that occurred twenty years ago or more  It raises the burden of proof to nearly impossible levels in numerous cases    A person who made a donation to a humanitarian organization involved in Tsunami relief could be deported if the organization or any of its affiliates was ever involved in violence  The burden would be on the donor to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he knew nothing about any of these activities  The spouse and children of a legal permanent resident could also be deported too based on such an accusation  because of their relationship to the donor    The provision could be applied retroactively  so that a permanent resident who had once supported the lawful  nonviolent work of the African National Congress in South Africa  Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland  the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan  or the contras in Nicaragua would be deportable  It would be no defense to show that the only support was for lawful nonviolent activity  It would be no defense to show that the United States itself supported some of these groups    The driver s license provisions don t make us safer either  Let me explain what these provisions really do  They repeal a section of the Intelligence Reform Act which sets up a process for states and the federal government to work together to establish federal standards for driver s licenses and identification cards  Progress is already being made to implement these important measures  but this bill replaces them with highly problematic and burdensome requirements  The National Conference of State Legislatures says that these provisions are unworkable  unproven  costly mandates that compel States to enforce federal immigration policy rather than advance the paramount objective of making State issued identity documents more secure and verifiable    Indeed  it is a costly unfunded mandate on the states  The CBO estimate on the implementation of the driver s license provisions is  20 million over a 5 year period to reimburse states for complying with the legislation  But  that is not all  the provisions require states to participate in an interstate database that would share information at a cost of  80 million over 3 years     The driver s license provisions do nothing to address the threat of terrorists or to address legitimate security concerns  It would not have prevented a single 9 11 hijacker from obtaining a driver s license  or a single terrorist from boarding a plane  All 13 hijackers could have obtained licenses or IDs under this proposal  and foreign terrorists can always use their passports to travel     The result of these restrictive driver s license provisions will be raised insurance rates  higher numbers of fatalities on America s roadways  and an increased black market for false and fraudulent documents  The Real ID actually undercuts the original purpose of traffic safety  It is better to have licensed  insured  and trained drivers on our roads     By preventing immigrants from obtaining driver s licenses undermines national security by pushing people into the shadows and fueling the black market for fraudulent identification documents     The Real ID provisions do nothing to combat the threat of terrorists or to deal with legitimate security concerns  They have taken away precious time that could have been used to address genuine pressing issues    Hundreds of organizations across the political spectrum continue to oppose this legislation  A broad coalition of religious  immigrant  human rights  civil liberties and state groups have expressed their own strong opposition     In these difficult times for our country  we know that the threat of terrorism has not ended  and we must do all we can to enact genuine measures to stop terrorists before they act  and to see that law enforcement officials have the full support they need  The provisions of the Real ID bill in the conference report today will not improve these efforts  They will not make us safer or prevent terrorism  They are an invitation to gross abuses  and a false solution to national and border security     The Real ID bill with its controversial provisions should have been considered by the Senate through debate and discussion  not attached to a critical piece of legislation needed by our troops    I urge the Senate to get serious about immigration reform that will make genuine improvements where they are needed  and not in the piecemeal fashion that is contained in this report    This bill also provides nearly 12 million dollars to remedy a crisis in off site judicial security for our federal judges  With this bill  we have taken a small  but necessary step toward increasing security for the distinguished men and women of our country who have been appointed to the courts  In the wake of the recent murders of the husband and mother of Federal Judge Joan Lefkow at her home in Chicago  and the courtroom killings in Atlanta  it is clear we must do more to enhance judicial security  This is a matter of the highest urgency     The tragic deaths of Judge Lefkow s family demonstrate that judges may be safe inside the walls of our well guarded courthouses  but they are vulnerable to disgruntled litigants in other places  even in their own homes  In fact  security in the homes of judges has long been a concern for the Judicial Conference  the principal decision making group for the federal courts  Sadly  three judges had previously been killed at in their homes  Judge John Wood of Texas  in 1979  Judge Richard Daronco of New York  in 1988  and Judge Robert Vance  of Alabama  in 1989     The vast majority of threats are received from people who are angry with the outcome of a case in court  In the ten years since the first world trade center bombing  the federal judiciary has handled an increasing number of high threat matters    Judge Lefkow was the victim of an act of domestic terrorism stemming from what should have been a routine civil matter  Matthew Hale  the leader of a White Supremacist group known as the World Church of the Creator  was convicted in April 2004 of soliciting an undercover FBI informant to murder Judge Lefkow in retaliation for her ruling against him in a trademark dispute  This example highlights the environment in which our federal judges toil everyday    The Marshal Service  underfunded and understaffed as they are  struggles to keep up with security needs in this new high risk age  But there is no reason why our judges continue to remain so vulnerable16 years after Judge Vance was killed in his home  We need to stand up for our independent judiciary  We can do so by providing it with enough funds to make their homes safe    Mr  President  while this bill is imperfect  it has many important provisions that our soldiers cannot be denied and I urge my colleagues to support it      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
