         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  I support the bipartisan compromise legislation on Iraq  and I urge my colleagues to support it as well Its a stunning repudiation of the Presidents misguided strategy in Iraq  and it will put the Senate squarely on record in opposition to the surge  Its a clarion call for change  and a vote of no confidence in the Presidents failed policy  It was wrong for the President to take the country to war when we did  the way we did  and for the false reasons we were given  Its wrong to compound that mistake now by sending tens of thousands of additional American troops into the middle of the civil war now taking place  The American people oppose this escalation  Many generals oppose it  and a bipartisan majority of the Congress opposes it as well  I especially commend our colleague Senator Warner for his extraordinary service to the nation in making this compromise possible  Could our message to the White House be any louder or clearer  I intend  however  to press for binding action that will prevent the surge unless the President changes course  If he doesnt  I will seek a vote at the first appropriate opportunity  Its wrong for the President to escalate this war and send more American soldiers into the cauldron of civil war    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
