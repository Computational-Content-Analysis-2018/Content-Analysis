         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  For Immediate Release Contact  Leslie Phillips  Lieberman  202 224 0384 Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy  202 224 2633    WASHINGTON  Claims by the Department of Health and Human Services that federal bioterrorism grants for states and localities were sitting unused and unneeded are not true  although HHS cited those reasons to redirect the money for spending on other programs  Senator Edward Kennedy  Ranking Member on the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  and Senator Joe Lieberman  Ranking Member on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  conclude based on a Government Accountability Office report    Kennedy and Lieberman said Wednesday states and localities had obligated almost all of their Fiscal Year 2002 and 2003 grant money and that a surplus was not evident  As a result of HHS s decision to reprogram a portion of the 2004 grant money  34 states lost funds they had planned to commit to a variety of preparedness programs    In May 2004  Lieberman and Kennedy asked GAO to investigate state spending of bioterrorism grants after HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson informed Congress he intended to shift  54 9 million in grant money to other programs  He said states had drawn down only 30 percent of Fiscal Year 2003 funds and that 18 percent of FY 2002 funds remained unused     But GAO found that states had committed approximately 80 percent of their 2003 funds  and 86 percent of their 2002 funds    This report makes clear what we knew all along  States have lived up to their responsibilities to protect their citizens from bioterrorism  Kennedy said  There s no justification for diverting these funds to other purposes  and I urge the Administration to restore the funds as soon as possible  We know the danger  and we can t afford to be caught unprepared     If HHS had looked closely at what states and localities were doing with their grants  as GAO did  it would have realized that states were using the grant program to better prepare themselves for a bioterror attack  said Lieberman  Instead of working with jurisdictions to figure out what was going on  HHS reprogrammed the funds and undermined the ability of states and local governments to improve the very bioterrorism capabilities the grants were intended to create  States and local governments need more bioterrorism funding  not less    GAO also looked at why it took some states longer than others to use the bioterrorism funds  Contrary to the HHS conclusion that states and localities did not need the unspent grant funds  GAO found that some jurisdictions faced hurdles such as a lack of funding or staff to process the grant funds due to state budget cuts and hiring freezes  In Connecticut  for example  GAO reported that state budget problems resulted in the loss of approximately 60 health agency employees including the entire unit that was handling bioterrorism contracts    GAO also reported that states and localities faced a shortage of vendors to install bioterrorism equipment and services  difficulty in hiring new personnel because state and local salaries were not competitive with federal and private sector health positions  and a national shortage of qualified public health workers    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
