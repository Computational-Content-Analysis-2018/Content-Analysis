         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I strongly support Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid s call for Republicans to obey the rule of law and abandon their reckless threat to use the nuclear option to eliminate the Senate s right of extended debate on judicial nominees   President Bush has a better record of Senate approval of his judicial nominees than any President in the past twenty five years  Only ten of his 214 nominations have been turned down  Yet  Republican Senators  many of whom blocked over 60 Clinton nominees  now want to throw out 200 years of Senate rules and precedents by using the nuclear option to ram judges through the Senate   This to strip away checks and balances is about far more than judges  It is about the desire for absolute power  The Republican Party the White House and both Houses of Congress  and it is now attempting to control the judiciary in a shameful display of the famous saying  Power corrupts  and absolute power corrupts absolutely   Lifetime judicial appointments deserve a reasonable consensus  not a partisan rubber stamp  The right to extended debate on judicial nominees allow the Senate an opportunity to make a thorough examination of nominees  records and hold those records up to the light of day  Americans have a right to know nominees  qualifications before they receive life time appointment to the federal courts   The handful of judicial nominees blocked in the last Congress did not withstand close scrutiny  William Pryor had said the Supreme Court should cut back important voting rights laws and protections against discrimination  Janice Rogers Brown had stated that senior citizens cannibalize their grandchildren  and that policies against age discrimination don t benefit the public  William Myers  a lobbyist for big mining companies  would roll back important environmental protections   The right of extended debate in the Senate is a fundamental part of the principle of checks and balance at the core of our Constitution  Respect for that basic principle and for the rule of law means rejecting the lawless nuclear option   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
