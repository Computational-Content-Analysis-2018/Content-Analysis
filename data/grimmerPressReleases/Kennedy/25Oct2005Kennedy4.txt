         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I was pleased to hear that Wal Mart CEO  H  Lee Scott  Jr  called on Congress to raise the minimum wage  When even the head of Wal Mart  one of the most anti worker companies in the world  says that a minimum wage of  5 15 an hour is out of date  we know it s long past time for an increase    Katrina has shined a spotlight on poverty in this country and showed us all just how much more work is to be done to achieve equality and fairness in this country  37 million Americans are living in poverty  including 13 million children  As a country  we know we can do better     The minimum wage hasn t been increased since 1997  yet during that time Americans increasingly feel the squeeze of the Bush economy  Americans are spending 74 percent more on gas than they did in 2001  and oil prices will increase an additional 56 percent this winter    I have pressed for years to secure an increase in the minimum wage for millions of working families in America  The most recent attempt  just last week  was voted down by the Republicans in the Senate  leaving millions of families to continue to struggle to put food on their tables and pay the rent    Many have claimed that an increase in the minimum wage would hurt the business community  and yet as a head of the largest employer in the country with over 1 7 employees  Mr  Scott s announcement is an important signal  and I applaud him  I hope to work with him  and other business leaders  Democrats and Republicans  to make a raise a reality and improve the lives of millions of hard working Americans    If the CEO of Walmart can call for an increase in the minimum wage  the Republicans should follow suit on behalf of the millions of working men and women living in poverty   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
