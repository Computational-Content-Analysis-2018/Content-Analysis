         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  D C     Senators Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass  and Patty Murray  D Wash   today introduced legislation to finally and fully close a loophole in the federal student loan program that according to Education Department data has cost taxpayers billions over the past decade  Introduction of the Kennedy Murray bill comes at a time when Senate Democrats are trying to contrast their willingness to work on domestic issues like college affordability with Republican efforts to end the possibility of Senate filibusters over President Bush s judicial nominees     Kennedy and Murray want to end a controversial bank subsidy that guarantees lenders a government subsidized 9 5  rate of return on a certain class of student loans  Borrowers currently pay only 3 37  interest on loans  originally financed with tax exempt securities  but taxpayers provide loan holders like the Sallie Mae and Nelnet corporations with a subsidy for the remaining 6 13   The very lucrative 9 5  loans were supposed to have ended more than ten years ago  but continue to be newly issued to this day  In the first three months of this fiscal year  the federal government paid  262 million to holders of 9 5  loans  according to Education Department data    Kennedy and Murray s Student Loan Abuse Prevention  SLAP  Act would end the runaway 9 5  loan subsidy on new loans and give borrowers a  1 000 or 1  interest rate discount if they pay their loans off early  The lawmakers say their plan will save over  2 billion    Congress should stop pandering to the money lenders and close this outrageous loophole once and for all  This taxpayer rip off is costing us a billion dollars a year  nearly  3 million a day  and denying more students the chance to go to college  Kennedy said  Think about how many students we could send to college for the  3 million each day we waste on this unnecessary bank giveaway  College loans are supposed to help students  not banks    Our bill would permanently and completely stop banks and special interests from  gaming the system  at taxpayer expense  Murray said  Student loan programs were started to help students    not to line the pockets of lenders    and students should come before special interests     Both Murray and Kennedy also expressed deep disappointment that the Senate is ignoring the priorities of the nation    like helping our students to succeed    by debating the so called Nuclear Option     We should be focused on priorities like helping to support the dream of a college education  Murray said  Unfortunately  the majority party has chosen to focus on breaking the rules instead of breaking down barriers for America s college students    Republicans should join Democrats in working to protect the public treasury  instead of wasting time in Washington trying to pack the courts  said Kennedy    The SLAP Act corrects what was originally conceived in the 1980s as a temporary measure to encourage lenders to offer student loans in spite of what were  at the time  high interest rates  The program guaranteed lenders a 9 5  rate of return on student loans  However  as rates fell over the next twenty five years  lenders continued to make loans at the subsidized 9 5  rate  Although Congress attempted to phase out the guaranteed 9 5  rate in 1993  it has continued to this day      Melissa Wagoner  Sen  Kennedy  202  224 2633 Alex Glass  Sen  Murray  202  224 2834
