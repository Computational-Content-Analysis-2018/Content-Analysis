         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  its with sadness that I speak about my friend  the senior Senator from New Mexico  Pete Domenici  who will announce later today that he will not seek a seventh term and will return instead to his beloved New Mexico at the end of this Congress      Pete is the son of Italian immigrants  Alda and Cherubino Domenici  and he has never forgotten where he came from and what he was sent here to do by the people of his state  He grew up learning about the value of hard work  as an employee each afternoon in his fathers wholesale grocery business while attending school in Albuquerque during the day     At the University of New Mexico  Pete found an early calling for public service and earned a degree in education  He was a remarkable athlete as well and became a pitcher briefly for the Albuquerque Dukes  a farm team of the Brooklyn Dodgers  then taught math at a junior high school while he earned his law degree      In 1966  Pete was elected to the Albuquerque City Commission where he served until he was elected to the Senate in 1972  Hes now the longest serving Senator in New Mexico history  and for 35 years hes been an outstanding colleague  admired and respected by all of us on both sides of the aisle     Pete will be remembered by all Americans as a brilliant and tireless champion for the rights of those with mental illness  His tenacity and commitment led in 1996 to the passage of the first legislation to end discrimination against people with mental illness  More than anyone  Pete understood that such discrimination prevented vast numbers of people with mental illness from receiving the care and treatmentand frequently the curethey deserved      Over the past five years  Ive had the privilege of working closely with Pete to improve that original legislation  His passion and perseverance to achieve full equality for coverage of mental and physical illness has never wavered  Our recent Senate passage of the Mental Health Parity Act is a tribute to Pete and the result of his extraordinary dedication and ability     Im sure Pete and Nancy thought long and hard about the decision to retire from the Senate  and that it wasnt an easy choice to make  But I know theyll have much more time to spend with their eight children and the wonderful people and breathtaking mountains of New Mexico     We here are fortunate that well have at least another year to work together on the issues that we care about so deeply      As we prepare to say farewell to our great friend  Im reminded of the lines of New Mexicos state song     Oh  Fair New Mexico   We love  we love you so   Our hearts with pride oerflow   No matter where we go   Oh  Fair New Mexico      No matter where Pete goes  well always love and respect him  Well miss his leadership  his statesmanship  and most of all his friendship          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
