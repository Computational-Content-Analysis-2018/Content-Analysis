         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Many had expected that this might be the week when a Supreme Court vacancy occurred  Instead  it was the week when the Senate Majority Leader launched his own preemptive attack on those who are not prepared to rubberstamp the Supreme Court nomination that may soon reach the Senate The Leader may feel obligated to accept any nominee without question  even to the Supreme Court  But most Senators recognize that they have an independent responsibility to raise questions if the President makes an unwise choice Our Senate debates in recent weeks have included extensive discussion of the need for consultation by the President with the Senate on potential Supreme Court nominations  But such consultation was not mentioned by the Majority Leader in his address on judges earlier this week  and the omission is glaring  since consultation is the heart of the advice requirement in the constitutional requirement that the President appoint judges with the advice and consent of the Senate Under the Constitution and the Senate Rules  every Senator s hands are on the oars of this vessel  If a substantial number of us are rowing in the opposite direction from the Majority Leader  we will not make much progress  But if there is a consensus as to where we want to go  we can get there directly and quickly The 14 Senators who reached the landmark bipartisan compromise in the nuclear option debate made a pledge to one another and a plea to the President that the advice function must not be given short shrift  and that serious consultation with the Senate in the nomination process is the key to a successful confirmation process  Separate and independent assessments of nominations by each Senator are precisely what the framers wanted us to do  They wanted Senators to be a check on the Executive s proposed judicial selections  as a safety net for the Nation if the President overreaches by making excessively partisan or ideological nominations On the Senate floor last week  Senator Pryor gave a compelling explanation of the Agreement  He said that he was puzzled because people are ignoring a section of the agreement that is as important as any other section    the part dealing with advice and consent  He spoke of the past days of bipartisan cooperation between the Executive and legislative branches of government  He pointed out that he was a signatory to a unanimously supported letter from the Senate minority to the President calling for consensus and cooperation  and calling bipartisan consultation the best path to a fair and reasoned confirmation process He did not demand that the President sit down with the 14  or pretend that they will supplant the Senate Judiciary Committee and its leaders  But he did urge the President to seek the counsel of Senators from both parties as he makes future nominations  Their insight  Senator Pryor said  could help the President steer a smoother course when it comes to judicial nominations  Just as the 14 Senators did their part to smooth the way for future judicial nominations  the White House  can  do their part by reaching out to the co equal branch of government How can anyone argue with that wise prescription  How can anyone ignore it  since it comes from one of those who helped bring the Senate back from the brink of disaster  A President would have to be extraordinarily imprudent not to give it great weight Another of the signers on the agreement  Senator Salazar  wrote to the President last week with a clear message  A wide ranging and good faith consultation between the Executive and the Senate  as contemplated by the Founding Fathers  is the best way to smooth the path to rapid Senate consideration for all judicial nominations but will be especially important if a vacancy arises on our Supreme Court Another of the 14 signers  Senator Nelson of Nebraska  mentioned his own experience in selecting judges  In his letter to the President  he pointed out that even though as Governor  he was not required to obtain the advice and consent of his Legislature  nevertheless he consulted a great deal with them  and found it a very worthwhile and successful process  He encouraged President Bush to reach out to both sides of the aisle  so we can move forward on future nominees in a positive and less contentious manner  Without this consultation  he said  there could be difficulties  especially regarding future Supreme Court nominations  that might provide the basis for blocking an up or down vote which otherwise might not exist Even the President has said    once    that he would consult with Senators on judicial nominations  and I urge him to do so  But as yet there has been no meaningful consultation with the Senate  As the Minority Leader has made clear  off the cuff casual discussion about how nice it would be if a Senator were the choice is not meaningful consultation  To be meaningful  consultation should include information about who the President is really considering  so that we can give responsive and useful advice White House officials made time to meet last week with prominent outside allies on the right  who are so sure that the President will nominate a non consensus candidate  that they have put an  18 million war chest in place to defend that nominee  Their advice to the President was clear  they would consent to and support any right wing judge he selects for the High Court  No wonder he likes to get their advice and consent The Majority Leader s speech criticized other groups for gearing up against a nominee  But he ignored the fact that the President s friends have announced their own preparation for such a battle  The American people deserve a Senate that will be more than a rubber stamp for a Supreme Court nominee  A Senate that walks in lock step with the White House is not doing its Constitutional job  It is not doing the job the American people sent us here to do    to protect their rights and freedoms If the President abuses his power and nominates someone who threatens to roll back the rights and freedoms of the American people  then the American people will insist that we oppose that nominee  and we intend to do so   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
