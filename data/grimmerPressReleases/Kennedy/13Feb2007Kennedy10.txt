         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C   Today  a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced new legislation to boost college scholarships without costing taxpayers a dime  Senators Edward Kennedy  D MA   Chairman of the United States Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  Senator Gordon Smith  R OR   and Reps  George Miller  D CA  and Rep  Tom Petri  D WI  unveiled the bill  the Student Aid Reward Act  STAR   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would generate a savings of  13 billion by encouraging colleges and universities to use the less expensive of the federal government s student loan programs  The STAR Act would reinvest at least  10 billion of that in additional Pell Grant scholarships and graduate fellowships  Senator Kennedy said  Higher college prices are shutting more students than ever out of a college education  yet billions of dollars are wasted every year in taxpayer subsidies that line the pockets of the student lending world  for doing a job that could be done much more efficiently without them as middlemen  We can reverse the damage with the STAR Act  The plan encourages competition  it helps students  and it has no cost  Its time to inject some real competition into the loan programs  so that they help studentsnot banks  Higher education is essential to success in a competitive global economy  Oregon students  and those across the country  deserve as affordable an education as possible  Senator Gordon Smith said  My colleagues and I are working to improve the federal student loan system to give more money to students to invest in their futures  One of our top priorities in the new Congress is to ensure that every qualified student can afford to go to college  The Student Aid Reward Act is a win win bill that will put billions of dollars into scholarships for students at no new cost to taxpayers  said Miller  the Chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee  We promised to make college more affordable and we promised to restore fiscal responsibility to the Congress  This legislation is about good  responsible government that meets the key concerns of America s middle class  Congressman Petri said  The fact is  our subsidies to private lenders are so excessive that we can save the taxpayers a lot of money while providing a better deal for students simply by encouraging the use of the more efficient student loan program  The opponents of this legislation have a lot of government subsidized money to use against us in order to protect their gravy train  but I m confident that any objective observer will come to the right conclusion  Currently  there are two main student loan programs that offer loans to students at the same terms and interest rates  the Direct Loan program and the Family Federal Education Loan  FFEL  program  Independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office  OMB  and GAO have all demonstrated that the Direct Loan program is much less expensive than the FFEL program because in the FFEL program  the government underwrites and subsidizes the loans private lenders issue to students  By contrast  the DL program provides loan capital directly from the U S  Treasury and eliminates lenders as middlemen  cutting out billions in unnecessary subsidies to banks  The STAR Act generates additional Pell Grant aid by creating fair  market based competition between the Direct Loan and FFEL programs  It rewards colleges that choose the federal loan program thats less expensive for the government and taxpayers by giving a portion of the savings generated by that choice back to the colleges in the form of Pell Grants  A summary of the bill is below  BOOST COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS at NO COST to the Taxpayer THE STUDENT AID REWARD  STAR  ACT OF 2007The bipartisan Student Aid Reward  STAR  Act  introduced by Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA   Senator Gordon Smith  R OR   Congressman George Miller  D CA   and Congressmen Tom Petri  R WI   provides billions in additional college scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students at no additional cost to taxpayers  The plan is simple  the STAR Act encourages colleges to utilize the less expensive of the federal governments student loan programs  The Congressional Budget Office reports that the STAR Act would generate  13 billionin savings  at least  10 billion would go to increased scholarship aid  all at no additional cost to taxpayers  Currently  there are two main student loan programs that provide essentially the same loans and interest rates to students  but one costs billions more annually than the other  In the first program  loans are issued from U S  Treasury funds  and private companies are contracted to service and collect student loan payments  In the second program  the federal government underwrites and subsidizes loans issued by private lenders and banks  These loans bear virtually no risk for private banks  yet have an assured rate of return and are guaranteed against default by the government  The first program is much less expensive  because it secures loan capital at a lower rate  eliminates the middleman  lenders   and cuts out billions in unnecessary subsidies to banks  Congressional Budget Office  2006  10 year estimate  Estimate will be updated following release of CBOs March 2007 baseline  According to President Bush s 2008 education budget  student loans made through the more expensive program in 2007 cost  3 more for every  100 lent than the same loans made with U S  Treasury funds  Estimates from the Presidents 2008 budget include administrative costs for both loan programs  The STAR Act calls upon the Secretary of Education to determine which program is more efficient  Schools would then be rewarded with additional scholarship funds for utilizing the more efficient of the two student loan programs  The competition will encourage the federal loan programs to improve the efficiency of their operations  Schools  students  and taxpayers all would be the beneficiaries  If you have questions or would like additional information on the STAR Act  please contact Missy Rohrbach with Senator Kennedy at 202
