         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   IMMEDIATE RELEASE                  CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633    Washington  DC  Today Senator Edward Kennedy and his colleagues introduced a bill to rescind the President s suspension of the Davis Bacon law to ensure that men and women of the Gulf Coast get paid a fair wage as they rebuild the region  On September 8  President Bush suspended Davis Bacon for contracts related to Katrina  ending prevailing wage protection for thousands of construction workers  Kennedy s bill would stop the President s unfair action     The winds of Katrina exposed to all of America just how much more work is to be done to achieve equality and fairness in this country  We are a stronger country when we are a fairer country  Yet  as the Administration awards billions of dollars in contracts to many of their corporate friends  they decide that the men and women of the Gulf Coast don t deserve to be paid a fair wage  The victims of Katrina have lost everything  and now President Bush says it is okay for them to lose their fair wages too  This is blatantly unfair    and we re fighting it  Senator Kennedy said  As many as 1 million workers may become jobless  with the unemployment rate reaching 25  or higher in the Gulf region  Many of the good new jobs created will be in the recovery and rebuilding of the area    Below is a fact sheet on Davis Bacon and the impact of Bush s action    PRESIDENT BUSH HURTS WORKING AMERICANS BY SUSPENDING DAVIS BACON WAGE PROTECTIONS    On September 8  2005  President Bush issued a proclamation stating that federal construction contractors operating in the areas of hurricane recovery would be exempt from the prevailing wage protections of the Davis Bacon Act  The Davis Bacon Act has ensured since 1931 that workers earn local wages on federally funded construction contracts     Senator Kennedy is introducing the Fair Wages for Katrina Recovery Workers Act to reverse the President s suspension and ensure that the workers involved in the recovery and reconstruction effort will earn a prevailing wage      Many people harmed by Hurricane Katrina were already struggling to make ends meet  and the jobs and businesses they relied on have disappeared      Experts have said that from 400 000 to 1 million workers may become unemployed as a result of the hurricane  with the unemployment rate reaching 25  or higher in the Gulf region  Many affected workers will be unemployed for nine months or longer     Mississippi and Louisiana rank 1st and 2nd among states by the percentage of people below the poverty line  Moreover  Mississippi and Louisiana rank 2nd and 3rd by the percentage of children below the poverty line      Haven t these workers and their families along the Gulf Coast suffered enough  We are providing hundreds of billions of dollars in relief  and we should be sure that it goes toward decent wages for workers as they work to rebuild the vital infrastructure that is so desperately needed     These new jobs in the clean up  recovery  and rebuilding of the area will be a major source of new employment  and we need to be sure that they pay decent wages      This is all that Davis Bacon does  it simply ensures that workers on federal government projects earn a typical wage  Otherwise the large size of federal contracts can overwhelm a local labor market  and lead to bidding wars that drive wages down  Indeed  Representative Davis and Senator Bacon were Republicans who wanted to protect local contractors  who would not be able to compete in such a price war     Workers who take these jobs will already face special hazards  Each day the Administration reveals more details about workers  exposure to elevated levels of e coli  toxic chemicals from flooded Superfund sites  and contaminants from massive oil spills      Yet the President seems determined to use this disaster to advance his anti worker agenda  He apparently believes that workers in Louisiana  Mississippi  and Alabama and parts of Florida don t even deserve to earn a decent wage for a day s work      He would have you believe that Davis Bacon wages are exorbitantnothing could be further from the truth  Indeed  in areas affected by Katrina  some typical wages include    o  9 16 per hour for Sheet Metal Workers in Pearl River County  Mississippi o  10 00 per hour for laborers in Livingston Parish  Louisiana  o  8 54 hour for truckdrivers in Mobile County  Alabama  Additional examples of Davis Bacon prevailing wages can be found at http   www gpo gov davisbacon allstates html      The President has the authority to suspend Davis Bacon in times of emergency  but this authority has been exercised only three times before in our nation s history  in fact  President Bush declined to exercise it after September 11th      Federal spending post Hurricane Katrina should be lifting workers up  not forcing them into a race to the bottom  we should not be using federal funds to lower wage rates    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
