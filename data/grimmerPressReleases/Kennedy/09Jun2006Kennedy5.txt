         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE              REMARKS AND BILL SUMMARY INCLUDED   BOSTON  MA  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy addressed the Massachusetts Senior Action Councils at their 25th Anniversary Celebration  Senator Kennedy discussed the need for stronger Medicare coverage and prescription drug guarantees for seniors across Massachusetts and the nation  He addressed the cumbersome new Medicare prescription drug program and the doughnut hole that leaves so many seniors without drug coverage    Because the Administration and the Republican leadership refused to provide the funds needed for an adequate drug benefit in Medicare  more and more seniors are facing the ridiculous donut hole  said Senator Kennedy  In other words  many seniors wont be able to afford the drugs they urgently need  even though theyre paying for Medicare coverage   In order to address this critical problem for seniors  Senator Kennedy  along with Senator Stabenow  introduced legislation to offer a streamlined  user friendly prescription drug benefit administered directly through Medicare  The new benefit will offer seniors and people with disabilities a real choice that alleviates many of the problems with the new Medicare Prescription Drug program    The Stabenow Kennedy bill will establish a standard prescription drug benefit administered directly by Medicare  Seniors who choose this option will have a modest deductible and co payments for prescriptions  without any gaps in coverage  The benefit would also provide protection for seniors against drug costs above  5 100 per year  Everyone who chooses the Medicare guaranteed option would pay a low  uniform monthly premium  regardless of where they live    By instructing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices directly with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of those enrolled in the Medicare guaranteed option  the Stabenow Kennedy bill will help lower prescription drug costs  Negotiating group prices will result in lower expenses for seniors and savings for taxpayers   Currently  the bill awaits action in the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee    Founded in 1981  the Massachusetts Senior Action Council has worked tirelessly to promote the rights  needs  and health of all citizens  focusing on vulnerable seniors  In conjunction with labor  religious  and community organizations  MSAC has remained committed to the goal of social and economic justice  The organization has ten active chapters in the Commonwealth  50 affiliate groups  and over 2 500 members  Among other issues  the MSAC has empowered both citizens and elected officials to act progressively on matters pertaining to health care  housing  and transportation     REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY MASSACHUSETTS SENIOR ACTION COUNCIL 25th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION June 9  2006   As prepared for delivery   Thank you  Sara Ann Shaw  for that generous introduction  Its an honor to be with all of you this evening as you celebrate 25 years of senior activism    and what an amazing 25 years its been    Your successes are extraordinary  Youve truly shown what can be accomplished by a dedicated group coming together to work on a pressing issue of our time  Youve been effective in organizing for change  in making your voice heard  and in persuading those in power of the rightness of your cause    Just yesterday  John Bennett testified before the Massachusetts Senate on the crisis in care giving our society is facing  and its a privilege to work with you on that urgent issue   I also commend you for your strong advocacy for the needs of working families  Too often  theyre being forced to choose between the families they love and the jobs they need   Thats why its so important that we continue to strengthen our laws on work and family  The Family and Medical Leave Act has been one of our most significant successes  Its enabled more than 50 million Americans to take job protected leave to deal with serious health problems for themselves or members of their families   That was an important achievement  but the leave is unpaid  which means that many workers cant afford to take the time off  Legislation now pending would guarantee seven paid days of sick leave a year to care for medical needs  We need other work family balance measures  such as protections for flexible work arrangements   I know we stand together in strong support of fair solutions for working families in Massachusetts and the rest of our nation   Now more than ever  your voice is needed  We only have to read the headlines to know that Social Security and Medicare  two of the most successful programs ever enacted  are under intense attack by the Republican leadership in Congress   These two historic programs have been indispensable in enabling senior citizens and disabled persons to live their lives in dignity  The twilight years truly became golden years because Social Security and Medicare enabled so many seniors to avoid poverty and ill health and to live their lives with far fewer worries  Its no wonder these programs are so widely beloved today    Despite their success and popularity  theyre under more attack than ever today  and we need your help more than ever to protect them and improve them   Two out of every three retirees receive over half of their income from Social Security  Without their monthly benefit check  most would be in poverty  as they were before Social Security was enacted    Its not just retirees who are protected  The program also provides lifetime disability insurance for those who become seriously injured or ill before reaching retirement age  and it provides survivor benefits for widows and minor children of employees who have died   Social Security is an earned benefit  not a handout  Its the most cost effective and affordable way for most Americans to purchase disability insurance  survivors benefits for their children  and an inflation adjusted annuity to finance their retirement  Its worked well for four generations of Americans  and will continue to work well for future generations   The greatest threat to it is the danger of by privatization schemes  not the retirement of the baby boomers  Its true that the ratio of workers to retirees is declining  But the impact of that shift can be met without abandoning the guaranteed lifetime benefit thats the heart of the program    The real threat to Social Security is from those who would dismantle it under the guise of saving it  Its the old Vietnam excuse  we had to destroy the village in order to save it  We cant let that happen to Social Security    The Bush Administration is waging a relentless campaign of half truths and false alarms to convince the public that Social Security as we know it is on the verge of bankruptcy and cant be sustained    They know that the only way to sell their flawed privatization plan is to convince people that there is no alternative  Their goal is to frighten the American people into accepting private accounts that would take the security out of Social Security  and leave senior citizens to the tender mercy of the stock market to finance their basic needs   The truth is there is no imminent crisis  Social Security currently has enough funds to pay full benefits for nearly forty years  The latest Trustees Report says that the program has enough to pay full benefits until 2040  The Congressional Budget Office says theres enough until 2052  Even after that  annual payroll taxes will bring in enough new revenue to pay more than three quarters of the scheduled benefits   Instead of doing away with Social Security in favor of private accounts  what we need is to provide enough additional money to continue to pay full benefits over the long term  and we can do that without fundamental changes in the program    President Bush and Republican leaders in Congress want just the opposite  They dont want to fix Social Security  They want to dismantle it  even though its served the American people well for seventy years  They refuse to allocate a single new dollar for Social Security to help meet its future obligations   Instead  theyd take trillions of dollars in payroll taxes out of Social Security to fund private accounts  Obviously  this would make Social Security weaker  not stronger  Trillions of dollars less would be available to pay benefits to those whove earned them   Under privatization  benefit cuts would actually have to be much deeper and come much sooner than if Congress makes no change at all to the current program  Creating private accounts funded with Social Security dollars is not a way to save the program  its a way to destroy it    The Administrations privatization plan requires benefit cuts so deep that future retirees could no longer rely on Social Security to meet their basic needs  Future benefits for some current workers would be cut by more than a third  and over time would grow to a half    Claims that the privatization plan is voluntary are shamefully misleading  Participation in the private accounts would be voluntary  but theres nothing voluntary about the benefits cuts  Social Security as we know it would no longer exist  Its not a question of individual choice    benefits would be cut across the board  Younger workers would be denied the option of participating in the same Social Security system that helped their parents and grandparents did  Benefits would be drastically reduced for all younger workers   Privatization will leave Social Security worse off financially  and it will leave the federal budget worse off as well  The Bush plan would require over 4 trillion dollars in additional borrowing over the next twenty years  and much of that borrowing would have to come from countries like China and Japan  The huge new debt would be a crushing burden  with higher interest rates and a seriously weakened economy   The reality is that Social Securitys financial problems are actually quite manageable  The cost of making Social Security fully solvent for the next 75 years is only a third of the cost of the Bush tax cuts over the same time   Weve seen a similar attack on Medicare over the past decade  and many of you here have led the fight to protect it  Instead of a real prescription drug benefit that works for seniors  what Congress passed was a program that benefits insurance companies and drug companies  not seniors   Instead of a real Medicare drug benefit  Massachusetts has 45 different drug plans  and that number doesnt include HMOs that offer such plans  Seniors were expected to be able to use a computer to choose from among 45 different plans    but the Administration overlooked the fact that many seniors dont use computers   The complexity of the program was unnecessary  Many of us predicted in 2003 that if it was enacted  the plan would create chaos among those who it was supposed to benefit  and we were right    Many of the sickest and poorest seniors qualified for both Medicare and Medicaid and they already had good drug coverage under Medicaid  But when they went to fill their prescriptions  they were told they werent enrolled  Others were told their prescriptions would cost hundreds or even thousands  of dollars even though the same prescriptions at the same pharmacy the week before had cost them almost nothing   Thankfully the states stepped in to assist seniors until Medicare worked out the problems  but this fiasco never should have happened  The Administration had two years to get the program up and running  and they utterly mishandled it  When Medicare was enacted in 1965  it took only eleven months to implement it and that was before computers    The prescription drug experience is a lesson for all who say that Medicare and Social Security will be better off if theyre privatized  Republicans talk about giving seniors choice  but what seniors want is to choose their doctor or their hospital  not their insurer  They want a stable program thats there when they need it  and Medicare has done that for forty years   The chaotic beginning of the drug program may be subsiding  but seniors will still be forced to deal with its other flaws  Because the Administration and the Republican leadership refused to provide the funds needed for an adequate drug benefit  more and more seniors are facing the ridiculous donut hole   Thats the huge gap which leaves enrollees with major out of pocket costs  Most seniors will have no drug coverage once they reach the initial cap of  2 250 in drug spending  Coverage doesnt resume again until theyve spent  2 850 more dollars from their own funds  In other words  many seniors wont be able to afford the drugs they urgently need  even though theyre paying for Medicare coverage   Instead of protecting seniors  the Administration protected drug company profits by refusing to let Medicare negotiate drug prices  which the Veterans Administration does so well   Instead of putting adequate funds into the drug benefit  the Administration made sure that HMOs received large overpayments  which enable them to force Medicare beneficiaries into their plans by offering extra benefits  while still allowing the plans to make large profits  Just imagine    the Administration insists on overpaying HMOs and drug companies  and in the same breath it has the nerve to say that the Medicare Trust Fund is running out   In fact  Medicare is fully funded for a dozen years and its future is manageable if we just make the commitment  As in Social Security  privatization of Medicare costs more  not less  than the current Medicare  Seniors enrolled in private HMOs today cost more than they would under traditional Medicare  not because of the health care they need  but because were overpaying the HMOs   So be on guard when Republicans talk about modernizing Medicare  Its their GOP code for dismantling the program  When they talk about modernizing Medicare what they mean is putting seniors health needs in the hands of HMOs that care more about their bottom line than about providing decent care   Along with many of you  I remember the days before Medicare  We enacted it in 1965 because private insurers werent providing adequate coverage for seniors  At the time  only about half of all seniors had health insurance and the good care it provides  Now virtually all seniors have it  We should be moving forward  not backwards  not leaving seniors to the mercy of insurers and drug companies   Even worse  at the very time the nation is being told we cant afford to continue Social Security and Medicare  the Administration and the Republican Senate tried again to repeal the estate tax  which would cost the Treasury a hundred billion dollars a year    The hypocrisy of giving the very richest Americans a huge new tax break at the same time they say we cant afford Medicare and Social Security speaks volumes about Republican priorities  If we have a hundred billion dollars to spend each year  it would certainly be better to protect Social Security and Medicare for future generations       Hopefully the elections in November will put an end to irresponsibility like that and on countless other vital issues  The theme for this celebration is commemorating 25 years of senior action and dedicating ourselves to 25 more  More power to you  and I hope Ill be around for many of those years  You truly prove what can be accomplished through real grassroots efforts    All of us in the Commonwealth are very  very grateful to you for the extraordinary work you do so well each and every day  Well done  and keep the pressure on  Thank you very much      THE MEDICARE GUARANTEED PRESCRIPTION DRUG ACT  Passage of Medicare was one of the great triumphs of public policy of the past half century  In 1965  Congress and the President made a solemn promise to every senior citizen that if they worked hard and played by the rules  they would be assured of quality health care in their golden years  In 1965  medical care primarily involved doctor visits  hospital stays  and nursing care  and these were the costs that Medicare covered  Four decades later  medicine has changed dramatically  We now have a range of miracle drugs to treat a wide range of dangerous health conditions and illnesses that were once untreatable or required costly and invasive surgery   As a result  the great unfinished business of Medicare in recent years has been to provide coverage for the drugs that millions of seniors need to protect their health and save their lives  Sadly  the Republican Medicare bill failed to live up to the promise of Medicare    Instead of the Medicare that seniors know and trust  the drug benefit was turned over to HMOs and other insurance companies  Instead of allowing Medicare to bargain for discounts on prescription drugs  as the Veterans Administration does for drug for veterans  such bargaining for lower costs for seniors was made illegal   The result has been a disaster  The bill that passed was a nightmare of complexity and confusion  Seniors across the country were denied the drugs they need  or were forced to pay exorbitant fees to fill their prescriptions  The time has come to address these serious flaws and give seniors the Medicare drugs benefit they deserve   To address these serious problems  the legislation    Gives every Medicare beneficiary the choice of receiving their drug benefit through traditional Medicare  with a formulary that is not allowed to change from day to day or state to state       Allows Medicare to negotiate the same good discounts on drug prices that the VA gets for veterans       Establishes a consistent nationwide premium for Medicare drug coverage       Reduces the annual deductible for drug coverage       Increases the share of seniors drug costs that Medicare will pay    Eliminates the so called doughnut hole that will force seniors to bear the full costs of their drugs one a minimum is reached   Provides true security against runaway costs by assuming the full costs of drug purchases once a maximum out of pocket spending limit is reached  Stabenow Kennedy Medicare Guaranteed Prescription Drug Option  The one choice seniors dont have under the current program is the one they want   Medicare beneficiaries should always have the choice to stay in traditional Medicare and have a comprehensive  affordable prescription drug benefit administered by Medicare   A Real Choice  The Stabenow Kennedy legislation would establish a Medicare operated prescription drug plan in each region of the country  Seniors could continue to choose one of the many new private insurance plans currently being offered  or  they could choose to receive their prescription drug benefit through the traditional Medicare program    The legislation simply gives seniors and people with disabilities the choice to get their prescriptions filled through traditional Medicare   A Meaningful  Standardized Benefit The Stabenow Kennedy legislation would establish a standard benefit based on the current Part B benefit  a modest deductible  20  coinsurance  without any gaps in coverage  The benefit would also provide protection against catastrophic drug costs and would not require any cost sharing above the out of pocket threshold   Seniors enrolling in the Medicare guaranteed option would get the standard benefit  and would have the peace of mind of knowing they are receiving coverage similar to the coverage they have today for their physician and other Part B benefits   Private plans could provide the new standard benefit  or any actuarially equivalent package  as they do today  Plans could continue to offer multiple variations of deductibles and coinsurance levels   Affordable Coverage  Affordable Prices All seniors choosing the Medicare guaranteed option would pay a uniform  low monthly premium  regardless of where they live    The Stabenow Kennedy bill will also reduce drug prices by instructing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of beneficiaries choosing to receive their drugs through the Medicare guaranteed option    Seniors choosing to enroll with a private insurer would continue to pay the prices determined by the insurance company            Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
