         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The Bush Administration has been asleep at the switch in preparing for the threat of avian flu  They failed to stockpile needed flu medicines  cut funds for strengthening our health infrastructure and have failed even the basic test of having a plan to deal with the pandemic  I commend Roche for stepping into the breach during this time of urgent national need and allowing other companies to make generic flu medicine  Let us hope this generous action serves as a wake up call for the Administration to take the steps needed to protect American families from pandemic flu   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
