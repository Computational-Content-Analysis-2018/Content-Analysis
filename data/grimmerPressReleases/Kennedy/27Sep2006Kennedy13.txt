         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  DC  Tomorrow  Senator Kennedy plans to offer an amendment to the military tribunal bill  co sponsored by Senator Feinstein  that is designed to protect Americans who are protecting our country abroad  The measure requires the State Department to notify other signatories to the Geneva Conventions that if Americans are subjected to extreme measures  such as waterboarding or induced hypothermia  we will take action through war crimes prosecutions or other means   Support for this amendment is support for Americans who put their lives at risk overseas to serve this nation  Senator Kennedy said  Because the administration continues to evade the question of what practices it believes are prohibited by Article 3 when used on detainees in our custody  they have put Americans abroad at risk of abusive treatment if they are in the custody of others  This amendment says loudly and clearly that if our people are subjected to such abuses  we will respond   The amendment lists practices that the United States has already renounced by prohibiting them in the Army Field Manual  It states that the United States considers those practices to be punishable violations of Common Article 3 if they are committed against Americans  While our troops in uniform are protected under other provisions of the Geneva conventions  America has CIA agents  special forces members who operate out of uniform  and DOD contractors who need the protection of common article 3            Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
