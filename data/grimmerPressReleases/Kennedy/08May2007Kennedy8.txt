         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Im grateful to Senator Reed for chairing this hearing in my absence  Hes been a long time champion of mental health and the Committee is fortunate to have his expertise as we prepare for this reauthorization effort   As you know  I was asked by the President to represent the United States in Belfast on this historic day for the peace process today in Northern Ireland as the new parliament takes power  Hopefully  the reconciliation now achieved after so many years of conflict and violence can serve as a model for the resolution of other brutal conflicts that cause so much suffering in other parts of the world   I regret very much that I cant be here for todays hearing  My commitment to strengthening the mental health system in our country has never been stronger  The recent acts of violence on an unsuspecting college campus are yet another wakeup call to all of us on the importance of mental health issues    I look forward to working closely with all the members of the committee on this reauthorization  Our witnesses today struggle constantly to address very difficult issues related to mental illness and substance abuse  whether through personal struggle or by providing the support others need to live productive lives  You are the true heroes in this battle  I especially commend thank my son  Representative Patrick Kennedy  who will be testifying today  He never lets our family or the country forget the people we are leaving behind by failing to provide true access and needed treatment for those facing with mental illness on substance abuse  We also have with us today Dr  Terry Cline  the Administrator of SAMHSA  who has a distinguished record in innovation and in treating individuals with addictions or mental illness with dignity   It has been seven years since Congress last reauthorized this Act  The bill was written then in the aftermath of the Columbine tragedy and attempted to address the problem of violence in childrens lives  It created community partnerships of law enforcement with education  mental health and substance abuse systems to provide a comprehensive response to such violence   National and regional centers of excellence were established to address the psychological problems resulting from witnessing or experiencing traumatic events  such as community or school violence  These centers were indispensable as the nation struggled with the unthinkable attacks on September 11th   As events have made clear  however  we need a more comprehensive approach to mental health  especially in making sure that services and support are available to those who need emergency mental health treatment   The connection between overall physical health and mental health is well established  and we know that mental illnesses can be treated     Yet todays fragmented systems of care are slow to integrate mental health and substance abuse prevention  screening  and treatment into an overall approach to patients care  We need to invest in mental health prevention  particularly in the early years of a childs development and education  The tragedy at Virginia Tech shows us the importance of investing in college environments and in elementary and secondary environments as well  but for many students the college years maybe too late   We also need to integrate child welfare services and mental health services for our most vulnerable populations  Budgets are tight and resources thin  but I hope we can work together direct needed resources to these efforts   Im proud of the work that SAMHSA does to end discrimination against the mentally ill and those who suffer from addiction    Through research and treatment  we have been able to restore peoples dignity and help them improve their lives  Weve have been there to help when unexpected tragedy hits  as it did in Katrina  Later this year  we will celebrate the forty fourth anniversary of the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act  which was signed into law by President Kennedy in 1963  This important legislation gave dignity to the mentally ill by helping them to make the transition from institutions to communities We need to strengthen and fund the community resources that have emerged since then  so that persons living with mental illness can become successful  contributing members of their community  I look forward to hearing about todays testimony  and to working with the Committee to reauthorize a strong program that supports community investments in children and adults living with mental illness and addiction       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
