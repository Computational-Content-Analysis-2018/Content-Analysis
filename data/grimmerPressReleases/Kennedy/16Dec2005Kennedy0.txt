         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward Kennedy sent the following letter to Chairman Lott and Senator Dodd raising serious concerns over the nomination of Hans von Spakovsky to the Federal Elections Commission  The text of the letter is below    December 16  2005   Dear Chairman Lott and Senator Dodd    I m extremely troubled by reports that Hans von Spakovsky  Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the Department of Justice  may be nominated and recess appointed to the Federal Election Commission  There are serious questions about whether Mr  von Spakovsky is committed to upholding voting rights for all Americans  regardless of race or party affiliation  a quality that is critical for anyone appointed to the Commission  In recent weeks  reports in The Washington Post and other publications have indicated that partisan politics in the Civil Rights Division have tainted decisions under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act  It appears that Mr  von Spakovsky worked on or provided advice in these cases  and that he may be at the heart of the political interference that is undermining the Department s enforcement of federal civil laws     I m particularly concerned about reports that the conclusions of experienced career attorneys in the Civil Rights Division have been overruled by Department officials for politically motivated reasons  The Washington Post reported on December 2 that senior officials in the Division overruled the recommendation of career DOJ attorneys by approving a Texas congressional redistricting plan that the career attorneys found would discriminate based on race and ethnicity  According to the article  six lawyers and two analysts in the Division unanimously concluded that the Texas redistricting plan violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because it eliminated several districts where minorities had substantial voting power and illegally diluted African American and Hispanic voting power  Political appointees rejected their recommendation and approved the plan  which resulted in significant Republican political gains  Mr  von Spakovsky was involved in the decision  and I urge you to ask him about his involvement     The Washington Post has also reported that senior officials in the Civil Rights Division also overruled a career staff recommendation against approving a Georgia photo identification requirement for voters  which disadvantaged African American and low income voters  The requirement was approved by the Division  and has since been enjoined by a federal court  Mr  von Spakovsky should be questioned about his involvement in this matter as well    I urge the Committee to inquire about these important issues before the Administration proceeds with Mr  von Spakovsky s appointment to the Commission     With respect and appreciation     Sincerely     Senator Kennedy    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
