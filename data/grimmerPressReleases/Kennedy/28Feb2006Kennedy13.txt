         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Our men and women in uniform are serving ably in Iraq under enormously difficult circumstances  No one questions their commitment or ability  Nearly 2300 Americans have been killed and more than 16 000 have been wounded They    and the American people    deserve an answer and an honest assessment about whether we are winning in Iraq  or whether the country is sliding into full scale civil war  A recent Agency for International Development request for proposals already describes Iraq as a low intensity civil war On January 7  General Sanchez told soldiers preparing to deploy to Iraq during a ceremony in Heidelberg  Germany  The country s on the verge of a civil war General Maples says that sectarian violence is increasing  In his State of the Union Address  President Bush said  I am confident in our plan for victory  I am confident in the will of the Iraqi peopleFellow citizens  we are in this fight to win  and we are winning Your written testimony for today does not reflect that confidence  You said  even if a broad  inclusive national government emerges  there almost certainly will be a lag time before we see a dampening effect on the insurgency  You said that the insurgents  use increasingly sophisticated improvised explosive devices was the most significant day to day threat to coalition forces  That s very different from the rosy statements by President Bush that we re winning  The American people know the difference  and it s time to level with them The patience of the American people is wearing thin  Nearly three years after Mission Accomplished  it s hard to see progress  Our military cannot be caught in the middle of a civil war   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
