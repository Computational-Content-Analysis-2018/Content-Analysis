         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to the decisions today by the Supreme Court  Many of us predicted that with the confirmation of John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court  it would take a sharp turn toward the extreme right  Today  we saw the unfortunate fulfillment of that prophecy  The Court limited the Endangered Species Act  struck a blow against free speech  ruled against citizens seeking to hold government accountable and trampled recent precedent in order to strike down reasonable campaign spending limits enacted by Congress  When they were nominated  John Roberts and Samuel Alito insisted they would be neutral umpires  Now that they are on the Supreme Court  every big call seems to go in favor of corporate and government power  and against ordinary citizens      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
