         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      I commend Senator Enzi for holding today s hearing on  health care for employees of small businesses      In this century of the life sciences  it s unconscionable that the miracles of modern medicine are too often beyond the reach of all but the wealthy    Health care costs are out of control and more and more Americans are losing their insurance  Forty five million Americans today have no health insurance  We know that persons without coverage receive less care  suffer more  and are more likely to die than those who are insured    The vast majority of the uninsured    more than 80 percent    are members of working families  More than half are employees of small businesses or their family members  All businesses    especially small firms    find it harder and harder to provide coverage for their workers  Health insurance premiums have risen 59 percent over the past four years  and the average cost of coverage for a family today has climbed to almost almost  10 000    Some favor association health plans  but they have many problems  States across the country have enacted significant protections for consumers in health insurance plans    but association health plans would sweep those protections aside  Gone would be requirements to cover needed benefits like maternity care  child immunizations and cancer screenings  Study after study shows that the way such plans save money is by avoiding state consumer laws and state rating rules  putting patients at risk     A basic principle for every responsible health insurance plan is adequate financial resources to meet its obligations  But association health plans have much weaker solvency requirements and are clearly inadequate to protect consumers  We have extensive experience with health insurance sold through associations and other types of multiple employer welfare arrangements  and they ve had many problems over the years  Thousands of Americans have been left in financial ruin when their association plan has failed  In recent years  four large groups    two in New Jersey  one in Indiana  and one in California    have failed  leaving  45 million in claims unpaid for the 65 000 persons covered by the plans     The bottom line is that such proposals will do virtually nothing to reduce the number of the uninsured  and will actually cause premiums to rise for over 20 million employees and their families  according to the Congressional Budget Office  Small businesses with young and healthy workers may be attractive customers for such plans  but those with older employees or employees with serious health conditions will be left behind  A solution that offers no help to those most in need is no solution at all    That s why such plans are opposed by the the National Governors Association  the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  the National Conference of State Legislatures  the American Cancer Society  the American Diabetes Association  the American Academy of Pediatrics  the NAACP and more than 1 300 other organizations that represent patients  health care professionals  consumers and workers    We need to make affordable health care a top priority for all families  including those working in small businesses  That s why I support an approach that would provide access to good health coverage for all Americans  regardless of where they work  I call it Medicare for All     To promote competition and choice  enrollees could join Medicare  or have the option of choosing any of the plans offered to members of Congress  the President  and federal employees     Health care for all is our goal  and an important step toward reaching it is to help small businesses provide quality health care coverage    but association health plans have to many flaws to justify our support     I look forward to the recommendations of our witnesses and to working with the Chairman and our colleagues to find a realistic bipartisan solution to this major problem    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
