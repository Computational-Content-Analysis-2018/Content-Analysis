         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES Attorney General Gonzales  as you know  many of us are concerned about your role in preparing the legal basis for the Administrations use of torture and other extreme interrogation techniques  As White House Counsel  you dismissed the Geneva Conventions as quaint   You requested what became known as the Bybee Memorandum  which laid the legal foundation for any interrogation that did not inflict physical pain equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury  such as organ failure  impairment of bodily function  or even death   You participated in the legal analysis that led to the use of extreme interrogation practices at Guantanamo and spread to Abu Ghraib  with disastrous results for the nation  Following these episodes  we passed the Detainee Treatment Act  which prohibits abusive treatment for detainees in the custody of the Department of Defense  The Department published a revised version of the Army Field Manual  which lays out in detail the procedures governing interrogations and specifically prohibits a list of practices   But that Manual does not apply to CIA interrogations   As the Supreme Court made clear in Hamdan  contrary to your legal position in that case  the CIA must comply with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions                In response  we passed the Military Commissions Act last September   Part of that compromise with the Administration was that the President would publish in the Federal Register his interpretation of the practices that would violate the Geneva Conventions   This transparency was intended to be a safeguard against continuing CIA use of extreme interrogation techniques in secret              Last Friday  the Administration finally issued the Executive Order   But all it says is that practices already defined as war crimes or comparable to war crimes are prohibited   The Department only acts specifically prohibited are forced sex  using detainees as human shields  and denigration of religion   It also suggests that detainees will receive medical care and shelter   These guarantees dont begin to cover the scope of abuse that has been inflicted   The Executive Order doesnt provide the transparency that would reassure the public or allow Congress to perform its oversight   It asks us once again to trust the Administration to observe the rule of law  but you and the Administration havent earned that trust  These practices are specifically prohibited by the Army Field Manual  a public document  which shows we can openly take abusive interrogation off the table   By doing so  we reassure the world that we have rejoined the Geneva Conventions   It says to those who detain U S  soldiers that we expect them to comply with the Conventions   By refusing to do so for CIA interrogators  we invite our enemies to abuse Americans  and we have more people at risk than any other nation               During consideration of the Military Commissions Act  Colin Powell said this   The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism   To redefine Common Article 3  of the Geneva Conventions  would add to those doubts   Furthermore  it would put our own troops at risk  Doesnt keeping secret our interpretation of the Geneva Conventions run the same risk   It sends the world a message that we are doing things we dont want others to know about   Admiral McConnell  the Director of National Intelligence  said that one reason he didnt want to exclude specific techniques was that because  detainees  believe these techniques might involve torture and they dont understand them  they tend to speak to us  talk to us in very  a very candid way   In other words  he wants to use the threat of torture to force detainees to talk                The Executive Order is a sham   The Administration is willing to renounce harsh practices involving sex and religion  but not the other practices that have brought shame to our country   The reason seems to be that we want people to believe we will torture them   Thats an outrage  Its bad policy   Its destructive of our relations with other countries   Its contrary to the rule of law  and its immoral   In short  its consistent with this Administrations desire to use torture  POLITICAL BRIEFINGSWe already know that some 15 federal agencies and departments were subjected to briefings from Karl Roves political office in the White House  These briefings focused on key electoral contests   According to todays Washington Post  even U S  diplomats and the Peace Corps have been given briefings that went so far as identifying Democrats targeted for defeat in 2008  Has Karl Rove or anyone from his office given a similar briefing to the leadership of the Department of Justice   Who briefed and who attended  Is it your legal opinion that these briefings are consistent with the Hatch Act There seem to be no limits   There is no telling how deeply this rot would have penetrated our government if Congress had not finally begun to conduct oversight like this hearingVOTING RIGHTS The scandal over the firing of U S  Attorneys has done serious damage because it sends the signal that the Department has been playing politics not just in personnel matters  but also in the enforcement of voting rights  Several of the U S  Attorneys were dismissed after they refused to use their positions to influence the outcome of elections   David Iglesias was fired after he decided not to indict New Mexico Democrats in the weeks before last Novembers election   John McKay was fired after he declined to pursue voter fraud charges as a means of challenging a Democrats close victory in the 2004 election for governor of the State of Washington  In addition  during this Administration  the Department has all but stopped enforcing the law against those who prevent African Americans from voting   Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Wan Kim recently sent us a letter naming four cases  but one of them was actually investigated and approved during the Clinton Administration  U S  v  Crockett County  W D  Tenn     and another involved language discrimination  not discrimination based on race  U S  v  Miami Dade County  S D  Fla       So the Bush Administration actually has filed only two voting rights cases on race discrimination against African Americans  and it took them until 2006 to file those   The Clinton Administration filed 18 voting rights cases alleging race discrimination against African Americans under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act alone   That record is unacceptable  At the same time  the Department found time to approve Tom DeLays Texas redistricting plan  despite the unanimous objection of career attorneys that the plan was discriminatory   The plan was later struck down by the Supreme Court   The Department also oversaw the approval of the 2005 Georgia photo identification requirement for voting  which was later blocked by a federal courts as tantamount to a Jim Crow era poll tax    You rewarded Bradley Schlozman  who helped preside over the decline in voting enforcement  with an interim appointment as a U S  Attorney in Missouri   He had helped with the discriminatory voting changes in Georgia and Texas  and as U S  Attorney  he brought controversial voter fraud prosecutions on the eve of the 2006 election   Mr  Schlozman told this Committee that he bragged about hiring Republicans in the Civil Rights Division  and his personnel decisions are being investigated by the Departments Inspector General   Attorney General Gonzales  there is no doubt that the Department of Justice is in disarray  and that you have presided over the destruction of the Departments hard                won reputation for putting the law ahead of politics    Any prior Attorney General with this record would have been fired long ago   The Presidents continued support for you demonstrates that the problems at the Department of Justice do not originate with you  It is the White House itself that has sought to turn the Department of Justice into an arm of the Republican Party   This effort goes against the very foundation of our system of justice  and you would have served the country much more faithfully if you had opposed this partisan agenda   It is past time for us to recognize that your record is only a symptom of a much larger problem   This Administration has been willing to ignore facts  twist the law  and destroy our institutions in the service of its narrow political interests         Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
