         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      This morning  on National Public Radio  I heard a story about young Americans joining the Marines  Instead of offering education opportunities  the Marines are attracting new recruits with appeals to national service in times of war  Marine recruiters don t skirt the fact that recruits are likely to end up fighting in a real war  As one Marine put it  After all  that s what we do  I found it very moving  and it re enforces my sense that young Americans really do want to devote their lives to service   in the military  in their communities  or in so many other ways  But the basic fact remains  when our brave young men and women sign up for service to this country  we owe it to them to ensure they have the best protection that American ingenuity and industry can provide    But  the President sent our soldiers into battle without the armor they need  Last year  President Bush s budget did not begin to fund all the armor the troops needed  It offered only  300 million to pay for armored humvees    far short of what was needed to protect our troops  Now we hear  that  as of last month  the Marine Corps still needs  300 million for armor kits and humvees  and the Army needs an additional  450 million for its armored vehicles     I recently received an email from a soldier who described his efforts in Iraq just last month to get armor for the trucks in his unit  First  he was given scraps from other units  armor  When that ran out  he went through a scrap dumpster to find the rest of the material he needed to armor the cabs of their trucks  The soldier wrote in his email  The first day we had to make do with small scraps of 1 centimeter thick steel plating  These scraps were what was left from the up armoring detachment efforts and they were gracious in letting us collect their scrap to use to protect our drivers  I volunteered to try and get more scrap  I was beginning to think my effort a waste when XXX came by with a huge forklift with several tons of steel plate  not scrap  but entire plates up to 5 ft  by 4 ft in size and asked me if I wanted it  Frankly it was more than I thought we could use by half but I new we had struck gold for our unit    Still  after all this  here we are again today  debating the merits of arming our troops with what they need for basic survival  How can we send our men and women into harms way without the body armor and uparmored humvees they need in order to stay safe  How can we ask their families here at home to make huge sacrifices when this Administration isn t willing to protect their loved ones    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
