         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for calling this hearing today  I want to join you in welcoming our witnesses here today  I particularly want to express my personal gratitude and that of the members of the Committee to Admiral Clark for the wonderful performance of the men and women of the armed forces during the past year     First  Mr  Chairman  I want to congratulate you on your second session serving as chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee  I specifically want to compliment you on your leadership of the Subcommittee and say that I look forward to continuing to work with you in the same bipartisan fashion that has been a significant aspect of your chairmanship      The Subcommittee meets this afternoon to discuss Navy shipbuilding and the status of the shipbuilding industrial base      Just about every year  we are presented with long term shipbuilding plans that show how much better things will be if we can only hold on until the last years of the Future Years Defense Program  This year  we see major reductions in the plan  including the prospects for building more than one attack submarine or more than one DD X  per year     In particular  the Navy has indicated a desire to conduct a winner take all competition for the DD X  program  This raises substantial concerns about what effect this would have on the shipbuilding industrial base  not only for building DD X  vessels  but also for building CG X  cruisers or other major surface combatants in the future     I believe that the world we face will continue to be one of uncertainty and unrest  Decisions we make this year will have a direct effect on the forces and capabilities that future combatant commanders will use to protect our interests  We all know that our men and women in the armed forces will have responded admirably in any crisis  just as they have been doing to support the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq  It is our obligation to provide them with the tools they need to ensure that they are not exposed to extraordinary risk that could have been prevented  Over the long term  we cannot count on continual heroic performance from our sailors and Marines to make up for inadequate or inappropriate investment      Again  thank you Mr  Chairman for convening this hearing today     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
