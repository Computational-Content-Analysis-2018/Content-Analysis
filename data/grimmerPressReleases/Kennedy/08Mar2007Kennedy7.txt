         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    All over  New Bedford on Tuesday  hundreds of women and men woke up  kissed their children  goodbye  and left for another day of work at Michael Bianco Inc   They knew it  would be a grueling day because there was no other kind of day in the  sweatshop like conditions of the factory  But they were willing to work hard and  without complaint because they believed in the American Dream  in which hard  work creates a hope for a better life    if not for them  then for their  children  What happened next was a tragic example of the desperate state  of our current immigration policy  Hundreds of armed police and immigration  officers raided the factory  creating panic among the workers   They handcuffed  unarmed men and women in the same factory where the workers had already known  nothing but indignity at the hands of their employer    While DHS was  ready with hundreds of officers to subdue a group of frightened workers  they  were woefully unprepared to deal with the aftermath of their own raid   The DHS  knew that it would be detaining young parents  and yet had no effective plan to  identify and help the children who would be left alone   The photographs of  bewildered  crying children told with eloquence the story of a government  operation distinguished by its callousness  Hours after the arrests  and  only after intervention at the highest levels  personnel from the Massachusetts  Department of Social Services were finally allowed access to detainees    The owner and three of the companys managers were also arrested and  charged in connection with the alleged hiring of undocumented immigrants    Although briefly detained  they were treated like royalty by comparison with  the workers   After an initial court appearance  all of them were released on  bail  and the owner was reportedly told he was free to keep his scheduled  business trip to Puerto Rico   As heartbreaking as these raids were for  the individuals involved  their families and communities  and those of us who  care about immigrants rights  they are a symptom of a much larger problem   namely  our broken immigration system   We must enforce our nations immigration  laws  But the raids in New Bedford and elsewhere are merely a stopgap solution  that unfairly penalizes vulnerable workers in an already flawed system   Notwithstanding their important contribution to the U S  economy  many of this  countrys twelve million undocumented immigrants are horribly exploited by  unscrupulous employers   In the weeks ahead  I will propose a comprehensive  immigration reform bill that seeks to create an earned legalization program for  undocumented workers who are already in the United States   It will also hold  employers accountable for verifying the immigration status of the workers they  hire in the future  and significantly increase penalties against employers who  hire and exploit undocumented workers    I am hopeful that we in  Congress can work together to find a better solution to the current immigration  crisis than raids that rip families apart   Now is the time to pass a tough  but  fair immigration law that protects our borders  strengthens our economy  and  maintains our humanity   Our current policy fails that test   The  writer is a Democratic Senator from Massachusetts and Chairman of the Senate  Immigration  Border Security and Refugee Subcommittee   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
