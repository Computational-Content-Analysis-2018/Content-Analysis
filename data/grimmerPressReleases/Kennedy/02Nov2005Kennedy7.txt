         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The recent sordid revelation of the CIA s shameful secret detention sites in other countries is further distressing proof of the Bush Administration s utter contempt for the rule of law and a severe new blow to our respect in the world community  The White House obviously learned nothing from Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo    Vice President Cheney s irresponsible proposal to exempt the CIA from John McCain s prohibition on abusing detainees is an obvious attempt to make Congress compliant in these notorious abuses  and the Senate and House should categorically reject it  The use of secret detention centers around the world is an ugly insult to America s ideals that can only make the war on terrorism harder to win   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
