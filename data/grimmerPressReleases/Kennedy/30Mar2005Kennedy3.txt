         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Boston  MA    Today Senator Edward Kennedy participated in the dedication of the new Schepens Eye Research Institute Laboratories    the world s largest independent eye research institute  The Senator was joined by Congressman Michael Capuano  Senate President Robert Travaglini  and Schepens Eye Research Institute CEO Michael Gilmore at the ceremony     Senator Kennedy stressed the importance of setting ethical guidelines for medical research  while ensuring proper resources are devoted to Massachusetts scientists and doctors  like those at Schepens who are working to find cures and treatments for diseases afflicting millions of families  including childhood diabetes and blindness  Senator Kennedy believes that through stem cell research  cures for many of these diseases  including Alzheimer s  may be found  And he is determined to help Massachusetts continue its national leadership in exploring all forms of medical research  including stem cell research  which could help save the lives of millions of suffering Americans     Too many of our citizens suffer from chronic disabilities  and even life threatening diseases that do not respond to contemporary treatments because they are beyond the reach of even our most advanced medical research  said Senator Kennedy  Recent discoveries hold great potential to completely revolutionize the way we treat illnesses such as Alzheimer s Disease  Parkinson s Disease  Diabetes  paralysis  and blindness  With such great assets in Massachusetts  such as those at Schepens  we re uniquely poised to lead the nation and the world in this new age of discovery by supporting research breakthroughs and by fulfilling the great potential of stem cell research     The dedication of these new laboratories at Schepens marks the end of a two year   37 million expansion and renovation project  Schepens Eye Research Institute scientists explore various areas of study including  stem cell research to regrow damaged retinas  treatments for dry eye syndrome  treatments to stop blood vessel growth in the eyes of diabetics and the development of retinal imaging technology       30   FEDERAL STEM CELL LEGISLATION FACT SHEET   Senator Kennedy is an original cosponsor of the Specter Harkin stem cell bill  introduced on February 16th  It does the following      It overturns the Bush policy that prohibits NIH and other Federal agencies from supporting or conducting research on stem cells lines created after August 9  2001       It allows NIH to support stem cell research provided that the following ethical requirements are met      the embryos from which the cells are derived were leftover from the process of IVF     the embryos were donated for stem cell research after informed consent     the embryos were donated for stem cell research without any financial inducements   Scientists have told us that since the policy went into effect three years ago we have learned that the embryonic stem cell lines eligible for federal funding will not be suitable to effectively promote this research     Example  Professor Douglas Melton  at Harvard  is a distinguished medical researcher and his experience illustrates the folly of the Bush restrictions  Professor Melton has created numerous stem cell lines that meet all the ethical guidelines laid down at NIH  But his stem cell lines were created after the date set in the President s executive order  He receives no federal funding for his work  He has had to create a whole separate lab to conduct his research  because his regular lab has received federal funds  For this dedicated researcher the barriers created by President Bush s policy in lost time  in denied resources  and most of all in potential missed opportunities for patients  have been tragic  Senator Kennedy will also be an original cosponsor of legislation  to be introduced soon by Senators Hatch and Feinstein  to ban reproductive cloning  which is implanting the product of somatic cell nuclear transplantation  SCNT  into a uterus in order to try and make a baby  The Hatch Feinstein bill would make it illegal for anyone to clone a baby  whether using private funds or public money    The Hatch Feinstein bill allows the therapeutic use of the technique of SCNT  under strict ethical guidelines  Many scientists believe that this research will allow new cures to be developed for serious illnesses  in ways that would not otherwise be possible     The ethical guidelines in the Hatch Feinstein bill are      Oocytes or blastocysts must be donated without payment  with informed consent    No oocyte or blastocyst may be sold    Research will be conducted in accordance with federal regulations    SCNT will not be conducted on fertilized eggs    SCNT derived blastocysts will not be maintained more than 14 days after the first cell division    SCNT labs will be separated from in vitro fertilization labs    Those who violate these ethical provisions will be subject to civil penalties     30    REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY AT THE DEDICATION OF THE NEW SCHEPENS EYE INSTITUTE LABORATORIES   Thank you so much Michael Gilmore or that generous introduction  and I m especially honored to be here for this impressive dedication    I commend Senate President Bobby Travaglini for his bold and effective leadership to support cutting edge medical research and better health care for all Massachusetts residents      It s nice to be with a President that I can agree with    I d also like to thank my friend and colleague Mike Capuano  who s such an effective voice for the academic and medical research communities in Washington  Thanks Mike    We all know what this impressive new facility means to field of medical discovery and the continuing leadership of our Commonwealth in health research    The 21st Century  I believe  is the century of the life sciences with extraordinary new discoveries to treat chronic and debilitating illnesses  surpassing even the landmark discoveries of the 20th Century     We know today that too many of our citizens suffer from chronic disabilities  and even life threatening diseases that do not respond to contemporary treatments because they are beyond the reach of even our most advanced medical research    With the aging of the baby boom generation  the number of Americans suffering from these diseases will only increase in the years ahead unless we find more effective methods of prevention  treatment  and care    Recent discoveries hold great potential to completely revolutionize the way we treat illnesses such as Alzheimer s Disease  Parkinson s Disease  Diabetes  paralysis  and blindness     And we know that the brilliant work being performed at Schepens can help to lead the way    Just this month  the Journal of Cell Science reported that Dr  Chen and her team of researchers accomplished a medical breakthrough    they regenerated a damaged optic nerve from the eye all the way to the brain    It s long been thought that such nerve injuries cannot be repaired  We think of spinal cord injury sufferers and the brave men and women who ve come home from Iraq with serious vision loss     But Schepens is bringing new hope with this latest break through for them and for millions of others whose vision is impaired    An estimated 1 out of every 4 people over 75 suffers from such loss  Glaucoma  a leading cause of vision loss  is the direct result of damage to the optic nerve     The possibilities for medical conditions are equally profound    With this new facility  Schepens is investing in the bold future of the life sciences  and I m sure that your remarkable founder Charles Schepens would be proud    Massachusetts is blessed with the world s greatest academic and medical research institutions and many of the most brilliant scientists     We re also blessed with a generous spirit of philanthropy that enables our great institutions like Schepens to reach higher and achieve even greater goals     We re blessed with some of the finest biomedical research companies in the entire world    With these incomparable assets  we re uniquely poised to lead the nation and the world in this new age of discovery by supporting research breakthroughs and by fulfilling the great potential of stem cell research    In the years ahead  I look forward very much to working with you  and to do all I can in the Senate to advance your goals  and help all of those struggling with illnesses that have no cure today    but that very well might be healed tomorrow because of your bold efforts    Robert Kennedy loved the words of Yeats    some people see things as they are and say why  I dream things that never were  and say why not      Schepens lives those words  and all of us are greatly in your debt    We have the tools in place  we need to put them to work  We need to enable our great scientists  researchers  and doctors to explore new therapies  new research  such as stem cells  new procedures  And we need to do it without delay    Together  we can build an environment where Massachusetts continues to lead in this new century while we establish a gold standard for medical research ethics that will serve as a model to regions across the country     We can do it here at Schepens     I want to close by thanking all of you for allowing me to join you here today  I ve been proud of our work together on behalf of our fighting men and women  and I believe we re making a difference    I very much look forward to continuing to work together to advance our shared goals of improving the health of those who struggle so mightily with diseases that have no cure today    but that very well may tomorrow     Congratulations     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
