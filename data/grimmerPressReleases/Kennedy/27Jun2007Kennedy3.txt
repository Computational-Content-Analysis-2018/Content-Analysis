         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  the United States Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee passed The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act  The measure is sponsored by Chairman Edward M  Kennedy  Senators Orrin Hatch  Hillary Clinton  Mike Enzi and Charles Schumer  The legislation includes standards for the FDA to approve follow on biologics  a procedure designed to help resolve patents in an expedited way  and strong but responsible incentives to encourage innovation and the development of new therapies  Senator Kennedy said  This bill reflects a balanced approach that enables patients to have safe  effective and affordable biological drugs  while preserving the incentives that have brought these life saving advances to the American public  This century of the life sciences offers unlimited promise of new hope and new help for millions of patients  Congress has a responsibility to encourage the innovation that leads to these new medical miracles  and to see that they are affordable for the patients who need them  Our bipartisan legislation also includes strong and responsible incentives to encourage dynamic new biotechnology companies to invest in the innovations that will produce the cures of tomorrow Biologics are the future of medicine  and this bill ensures that we will continue to lead the world in biotechnology  Hatch said  We ve achieved a good balance  We give incentives to continue biological development  We allow generic companies to do what they do best  bring low cost versions to the market  And we ensure that patients and providers not only have access to low cost biologics but that they re also safe This has real life  real world consequences  As soon as we enact this bill  there are medications for Hepatitis C  multiple sclerosis  cancer and diabetes that will be available for generic versions that will be more affordable for many more people than currently is possible  With this committees action today  I am proud that we will both continue the creativity and innovation that is absolutely essential to our pharmaceutical industry and the lifesaving treatments and interventions they are able to provide for us and create a generic path that will begin to lower prices and extend the availability of so many of these treatments to more who need them  said Senator Clinton Biologics are the skyscrapers of the drug world  They are towering monuments to medicine  science and biotechnology that cant easily be duplicated  and the slightest differences can be fatal  Our bill recognizes the need to make sure that biologic therapies are both safe and affordable  Senator Enzi said  In addition  the legislation weve approved today holds new hope that we can further expand access of these remarkable medicines to more patients who need help  Biologics already are making it possible for thousands of Americans to live productive lives and changing the way we treat deadly diseases like cancer and infectious diseases Giving the FDA authority to approve follow on biologics is the first step to introducing competition into the market  and thus the first step to giving more people access to potentially life saving drugs  said Senator Schumer  This bill represents a solid compromise and shows the great strides we can make when working together  even on very complicated issues like biologics The bill gives the FDA the flexibility it needs to apply the latest scientific advances in the regulatory process  so that new follow on products will be safe and effective  The bill also gives the FDA the flexibility to adapt to changes in scientific knowledge and does not freeze in place an inflexible regulatory structure  A summary of the bill is below  Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2007This Act amends section 351 of the Public Health Service Act to provide for an approval pathway for safe biosimilar and interchangeable biological products  relying in part on the previous approval of a brand product  while preserving the incentives that have fueled the development of these life saving medicines  Approval Process A biosimilar applicant is required to demonstrate that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety  purity and potency between its product and the brand product  A demonstration of biosimilarity includes analytical data  animal testing and 1 or more clinical studies  unless such a requirement is determined by the FDA to be unnecessary FDA may approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable  meaning it can be substituted for the brand product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed it  Showing interchangeability requires evidence that the biosimilar product will produce the same clinical result as the brand product in any given patient and that it presents no additional risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy if a patient alternates or is switched between products The legislation allows  but does not require the FDA to issue guidance documents to inform with the public of the standards and criteria the agency will use in approving biosimilar and interchangeable products  Development of these guidance documents will require public input  Applications can be filed in the absence of guidance documents Exclusivities The Act provides incentives for the development of both new life saving biological products and interchangeable biosimilar products  12 years of data exclusivity for the brand company during which a biosimilar product may not be approved  and 1 year of exclusivity for the first interchangeable biological product Patent Resolution The legislation includes a multi step process to identify and resolve patents that the biosimilar product may infringe  The biosimilar applicant must provide its application and information about its manufacturing process to the brand company  A series of informational exchanges then occur in which the biosimilar applicant and the brand company identify patents in question and explain their views as to their validity or infringement  The two parties then either agree to a list of these patents to be litigated first or exchange lists when they cant  and the brand company must then sue the biosimilar applicant within 30 days to defend them  If the brand company wins a final court decision that a patent is valid and infringed by the biosimilar product before the 12 year data exclusivity has run  the court must enjoin infringement of the patent until it expires  For identified patents not included in this initial litigation  the biosimilar applicant must give the brand company notice 180 days before it intends to launch its product  and the brand company may then seek a preliminary injunction to block the launch  If the brand company fails to identify a patent  it cant later enforce it against the biosimilar product  If it fails to defend a patent identified for initial litigation  the brand company may only later receive a reasonable royalty  If the biosimilar applicant fails at any step to do what it is required to do  the brand company may immediately defend its patents      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
