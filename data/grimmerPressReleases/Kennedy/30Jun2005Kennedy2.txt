         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  We live in a time of medical miracles Vaccines mean that parents no longer have to fear that their children will be paralyzed by polio  or face the fevers of diphtheria or cholera Modern electronics have given doctors implantable pacemakers to save patients from cardiac failure The sequencing of the human genome offers extraordinary opportunities for new cures and better treatments But there is another medical miracle to add to the list Modern information technology can transform health care as profoundly as any of these discoveries We have a moral responsibility to make the miracles of modern medicine available to every American    but we have failed to meet that responsibility  Costs are crushing our health care system  Premiums are going through the roof  The ranks of the uninsured grow every day  Families are having to choose between health care and groceries  rent  and college tuition  That s not the American dream  We can    we must    find a better way Information technology alone can t solve these problem  but it can help  Electronic medical records  software that can warn if a treatment could harm a patient  computerized prescribing    all these can save lives and dramatically cut costs Despite the wonders of modern medicine  too many patients today are harmed by preventable mishaps  Too many patients waste hours and face risk from tests that must be duplicated when a crucial record is locked in a distant archive  Too many doctors must only guess at the right course of treatment because they don t know their patients  medical histories  As a result  patients are put at risk and billions of dollars are wasted When millions of Americans struggle to afford health care for their families  it is profoundly wrong to squander more than half a trillion dollars each year on administrative expenses The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that better use of IT will save  140 billion every year  Those savings would produce a technology dividend of over  700 on the cost of an average family s insurance policy  That s like getting one month free every year Our economic competitors have already taken action to use this extraordinary technology to cut costs and save lives    but America lags behind  We cannot continue to allow the high cost of health care to price American goods and services out of the global marketplace The need to invest in health IT is urgent  The need to reward high quality care is just as great  In the words of Secretary Leavitt  Every day that we delay  lives are lost  The time to act is now  and the right way to act is to approve the proposals that we are introducing today to improve care  save lives and make health care more affordable for every American I thank Senator Enzi  Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for their dedication and commitment to improving health care for all Americans  and I look forward to working closely with them and with all our colleagues to see these important proposals signed into law this year  30 Better Healthcare through Information Technology Act BackgroundThe need to invest in modernizing health care cannot be ignored any longer  Patient care declines in quality when physicians do not have access to timely information about the patients they serve  Health care costs skyrocket when tests or procedures are duplicated because critical records are missing or inaccessible  Wasting scarce health care dollars on needless administrative costs drives up insurance premiums  and means that care is less affordable and less available IT systems linked securely and with strong privacy protections to a patient s medical records can improve care by warning a doctor or nurse if an order or prescription may harm a patient  These systems can issue reminders for screening tests  so that needed preventive care is not overlooked  Computerized records also allow doctors to look at a patient s entire medical record at once  improving care coordination in our fragmented health care system The savings from better IT use are enormous  The Federal government s estimate is that the nation would save  140 billion each year from proper IT use  These savings from health IT could cut the cost of a family s insurance policy by over  700  Despite the benefits of investment in health IT  utilization is low  The Health Information Technology Quality and Improvement Act will give health care providers the assistance they need to invest in lifesaving health IT The legislation enhances the development of standards for IT and improves Federal use of health IT by  Requiring the developments of standards on interoperability and other technical measures for health IT system  and establishing a public private consultation to develop those standards  Ensuring that strong protections for privacy and security are a central element of these standards  Authorizing in statute the National Coordinator for Health IT  Requiring all Federal IT purchases to conform to these standards The legislation provides financial assistance to cash strapped providers to enhance their use of IT systems that meet these technical standards by  Giving grants to financially needy providers to enhance their use of health IT  Providing financial assistance to establish regional health IT networks  Creating an innovative Federal State public private partnership to modernize the health care system by allowing States to fund low interest loans to help health care professionals in financial need acquire the health care IT systems that will improve the quality and efficiency of health care The legislation will help providers improve use of IT to improve quality by  Establishing a Best Practices Center where IT users can learn from the previous experience of others who have established regional health IT networks  Setting up a Help line at HHS to assist providers with technical questions on implementing IT systems and complying with technical requirements  Funding novel training programs to help train health professionals at the start of their careers in better use of IT  Establishing a certification program so that providers can quickly determine whether particular IT systems meet the applicable technical standards  Creating a targeted and limited safe harbor to the Stark and anti Kickback Acts to facilitate investments in health IT  Developing risk adjusted measures of health care quality through extensive consultation with health professionals  and providing for reporting of the degree to which health care providers receiving funds achieve those measures Facts About Health Care and Health Information TechnologyHealth Care Quality Has Significant Problems Between 44 000 and 98 000 Americans die each year from inpatient medical errors according to the Institute of Medicine  Overall  adult Americans receive recommended care only 55  of the time  Nearly 30  of health care spending  or up to  300 billion each year  is for treatments that may not improve health status  may be redundant  or may be inappropriate for the patient s condition Health Care is Expensive National health care spending now exceeds  1 7 trillion per year  Health care spending and health insurance premiums continue to rise at rates much higher than the rate of general inflation Health Information Technology Improves Quality and Saves Money Computerized entry of physician orders  such as prescriptions  can reduce adverse drug reactions by 75   Automated computerized reminders can increase physicians  use of recommended medical interventions by up to 46   Savings in the range of  140 billion per year  close to 10 percent of total U S  health spending  could be achieved through widespread adoption of health IT  System wide savings would result in a reduction of  700 in family in medical insurance premiums per year Health Information Technology is Underutilized Only 10  of hospitals have operational computerized prescribing systems  with another 20  of hospitals currently installing them  This means 70  do not use these systems  The United States ranks just 12th in adoption of health information technology when compared to 15 European Countries Frequently Asked Questions About Better Healthcare through Information Technology Act of 2005  Senators Enzi  Kennedy  Grassley and Baucus What does this Health IT bill do There are several important components First  it will establish public private partnership to establish national technical standards for health ITa common language for how one doctor s computer system will talk with another s  This is crucial to getting providers and technology venders in the gamethey must know what the standards are before they will invest in health IT Second  it will provide 3 new funding mechanisms to help doctors and hospitals acquire the health technology that they need for their patients by   Giving grants to financially needy providers to acquire health IT systems   Providing financial assistance to establish regional health information technology organizations  RHIOs    Creating an innovative Federal State public private loan fund to make loans available at below market rates to help health care professionals to acquire health care IT systems  The state fund would accept private sector contributions from health plans and large hospital systems that would benefit from having more doctors using health IT systems Third  the bill will help providers enhance use of IT to improve quality by   Establishing a Best Practices Center where IT users can learn from the experience of others who have established regional health IT networks   Setting up a Help Line at HHS to assist providers with technical questions on implementing IT systems and complying with technical requirements   Funding novel programs to help train health professionals in better use of IT   Creating a targeted and limited safe harbor to the Stark and anti Kickback Acts to facilitate investments in health IT  Currently  large hospital systems who want to give health IT systems to providers  are inhibited from doing do by fear of contravening these laws What is the difference between this and the health IT bill recently introduced by senators Frist and Clinton There have been many recent expert recommendations on improving the use of health IT  A consensus has developed on several major points   1  there should be a public private partnership to establish technical standards on interoperability  and  2  providers need financial assistance to enhance their use of IT Many of the bills on health IT reflect these recommendations  and thus contain similar elements  For example  Senator Kennedy s legislation in the 107th Congress and in the 108th Congress both included provisions to provide financial assistance to providers to acquire health IT  Senator Dodd s and Senator Kennedy s legislation in the 108th Congress provided support to develop regional IT networks  Similar forms of financial assistance were included in the legislation introduced by Senators Frist and Clinton in the current Congress The Enzi Kennedy Grassley Baucus bill includes these familiar elements  but also contains innovative ways to stretch Federal investments in health care  Recognizing the importance of getting health IT systems in the hands of individual doctors and hospitals  the bill goes beyond the Frist Clinton bill by providing two additional programs to help providers acquire health IT  First  it establishes a program to award direct grants to providers to purchase the health IT systems they need  Second  the bill establishes a novel public private loan fund within states in order to make low interest loans available to providers to implement health IT systems  The Enzi Kennedy Grassley Baucus bill also includes a technical assistance center to assist providers in implementing health IT systems  and provides grants to help train medical professionals in better use of IT Last  while the Frist Clinton bill includes some demonstration projects and studies on realigning the incentives of the health care system to value quality  the companion Grassley Baucus Enzi Kennedy bill to be referred to the Finance committee actually does realign incentives in the Medicare program to reward better care  This will create strong additional incentives for providers to adopt health IT systems in order to have high quality care rewarded How would widespread adoption of Health IT systems in doctors  offices and hospitals enable doctors to take care of the their patients better Currently  physicians and other care providers face information overload  and a fragmented medical system where information is not available when needed  We would not expect a pilot to land a jumbo jet without the aid of a computer  but we expect physicians to keep in their heads the thousands of treatments they might prescribe and the effects of combining each of them   No wonder the system occasionally breaks down  With the fully interoperable national health information network this bill helps create  this will change  The right clinical information will be available where and when it is needed  decision support tools will improve clinical decision making and keep doctors up to date on the latest medical knowledge  A patient s care will be better coordinated and reduce redundant tests  meaning that doctors can spend more time with patients Why is this Health IT bill being introduced with the Medicare Value Purchasing Act  MVP what is the relationship These two bills both address 2 critical issues in medicine  quality of care and health information technology  These issues are inextricably linked  The ultimate goal of both bills is to improve the quality and lower the cost of health care  The MVP Act will provide incentives to health care providers to improve the quality of care they provide  But in order for this to work  there must be widespread adoption of health information technology  since it is difficult and time consuming to measure quality without use of a health IT system  Without data on quality  incentives will have a diminished impact  It will also be much easier to improve the quality of care with health IT systems that reduce medical errors and improve coordination of care  The MVP bill creates the incentives to improve care and the Enzi Kennedy Grassley Baucus bill gives help to providers to acquire the health IT systems that will improve care  Together  they make a powerful package One of the biggest concerns people have about plans to create an interoperable national health information network is that patients  right to privacy and confidentiality will be compromised  How does your bill make sure these rights will be protected The vision of a national health information network will never be achieved if patients don t have full confidence that their privacy and confidentiality rights will be protected  The Enzi Kennedy Grassley Baucus bill will ensure that strong protections for privacy and security are developed with input from a broad range of stakeholders  including patient advocates  The very strong protections of patient privacy apply to all aspects of this bill  In addition  the American Health Information Collaborative established in the bill is explicitly tasked with developing uniform national policies that will protect privacy and security of and prevent unauthorized access to personal health information  It will also develop policies to ensure accurate patient identification and secure patient access to health information The bill creates a public private state loan fund that would accept private sector contributions in order to have greater capital to make low interest loans to providers to acquire health IT systems  Why would the private sector contribute to these state funds Most estimates are that there are enormous savings to be had if all providers used modern health information technologyperhaps as much as  140 billion   year  Yet  90  of these economic benefits will go to health insurers and large integrated health care systems  while only 10  goes to physicians practicing in the community  Thus  there is a strong incentive for the private sector to promote health IT adoption among health care providers  Many insurers and large integrated health care systems currently would make this investment now but are constrained from doing so by fear of the applications of Stark and anti kickback laws  While this bill creates a safe harbor from these laws for health IT  contributions to a fund which disconnects the contributor and recipient of the loan would not be subject to these laws  The fund provides a way for the private sector to help reduce costs while providing an opportunity to demonstrate responsible corporate behavior and to receive public recognition for doing so   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
