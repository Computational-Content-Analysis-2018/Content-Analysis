Senator Edward M  Kennedy s Keynote Address to the Memorial Concert and Tribute to Today s War Heroes Sunday October 15  2006  As Prepared for Delivery    We are gathered here today to pay tribute to each and every one of them   heroes all  serving far from home  protecting us in this time of crisis  and too often giving the last full measure of devotion to our country    And we are here also to embrace the loved ones they leave behind  to share in their pride for their sons and daughters and husbands and wives  and if we can  to bear some of the weight of their loss   We knew the fallen when they were one of us  from our schools  our churches  our playing fields  our neighborhoods and communities  They now march in that distinguished line of courageous patriots who  from the earliest days of our history  answered the call to arms to protect our basic freedoms  From Lexington and Concord to Normandy and Iwo Jima to Korea and Vietnam to the Middle East today  we owe a vast debt we can never truly repay to all those who stood their ground and with uncommon valor sacrificed so much for us    Six years ago  we came together here in this very hall to pay tribute to the fallen heroes of another war  and commemorate  among others  those who landed at Inchon those who gave their lives to defend the frozen reservoir at Chosin in Korea   Today s heroes continue that honorable tradition  They volunteered to meet the unique challenges of the modern battlefield  They serve us faithfully  despite the pervasive dangers they face at every moment  despite the mounting casualties they endure  despite their lengthening deployments far from homes and families and friends   Since the murderous attacks by Al Qaeda five years ago  millions of Americans have proudly and voluntarily defended the Constitution by serving in our armed forces and their reserves  They volunteered knowing the vast danger to life and limb  aware that  at any moment  they might make the ultimate sacrifice  Their devotion to duty is beyond question and their valor proven  President Kennedy would have called each of them a profile in courage   Their words and their deeds echo among us today    They are the words of Marine Lance Corporal Alexander Arredondo of Randolph  Before falling in battle in Iraq   he wrote this simple and stirring note to his family   I am not afraid of dying  I am more afraid of what will happen to all the ones that I love if something happens to me I feel so lucky to be blessed with the chance to defend my country   Like so many who have answered the call  Lance Corporal Arredondo s thoughts went first to others  to his family and loved ones he left behind  and to his country    He speaks for the more than 3 000 men and women who have given their lives in Iraq or in Afghanistan or on other fronts in the Global War on Terror  Each of these brave departed has a poignant story to share  as do the nearly 22 000 service members wounded in the line of duty  and the millions of others who have served us so courageously    When our country was severely tested in the Cold War  Adlai Stevenson wisely said that  Men who have offered their lives for their country know that patriotism is not the fear of something  it is the love of something     He insisted that America s patriotism is not fueled by hatred   even for our staunchest and most embittered enemies  Instead  it is fueled by a love of this great nation and for the principled values it has long embraced     The men and women we honor today would agree with that  Day in and day out  they confront their fears and conquer them  and they perform their duties brilliantly because of the extraordinary love they have for our country   Just as poignant are the fond memories of those on the home front of those they loved and lost  My Mother was proud that each of her four sons wore our nation s colors  But she also felt the loss  She was a Gold Star Mother  and it still seems like only yesterday when the knock on our door came in 1944  and we learned that my oldest brother Joe had been lost  In the end  three of her sons gave their lives in service to their country   Some years later  Mother ran across some lines by the poet John Buchan  She included them in her memoirs   In perfect honor  perfect truth   And gentleness to all mankind   You trod the golden paths of youth   Then left the world and youth behind   Ah  no   tis we who fade and fail   And you  from Time s slow torments free   Shall pass from strength to strength and scale  The steeps of immortality    She went on to include her own thoughts  She wrote that she was sustained by her belief that those she lost now enjoy forever the presence of God in heaven  This faith and assurance give life  with all its struggles and earthly disappointments and frustrations  a sublime meaning and are a source of wonderful strength and constant guidance    She continued  So my life went on  with both an overwhelming sense of loss and a determination to remember with dearest love  yet to meet the future with my head into the wind   So  today we remember with dearest love  And we do our best to carry on  with family  faith and country to help us through    May their examples constantly enrich our own lives  May they inspire us to face our own challenges with similar skill and determination  We honor our heroes best and most by doing so  We add new meaning to their sacrifice and help to carry on their mission in the years ahead  We owe our heroes nothing less       Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
