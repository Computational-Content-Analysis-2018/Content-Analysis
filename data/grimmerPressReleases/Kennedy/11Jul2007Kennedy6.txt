         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  sent the following letter to Secretary Michael Leavitt raising concerns over the conduct of political appointees in the Department of Health and Human Services  Senator Kennedy said  Dr  Carmonas strong testimony yesterday is yet another disturbing account of how the Bush Administration has put ideology ahead of the health needs of the American people  this time in the Office of the Surgeon General  Americans want their families to be safe and healthy  As we consider the Presidents nominee for Surgeon General tomorrow  we owe it to the American people to be sure that he will base his policies on sound science and best medical practices  and not the politics and ideology that have put our health care at risk The letter is below  July 11  2007 Secretary Michael LeavittDepartment of Health and Human Services200 Independence Avenue  SWWashington  D C  20201Dear Secretary Leavitt I am writing about information that has come to my attention which raises concerns about the conduct of political appointees at the Department of Health and Human Services  Specifically  former United States Surgeon General Richard Carmona has indicated that political appointees at the Department inappropriately sought to censor his public comments and restrain his public advocacy for ideological reasons unrelated to the Surgeon Generals public health mission Specifically  Dr  Carmona stated that administration officials blocked an important report on stem cell research  prevented him from discussing the effectiveness of comprehensive sex education  insisted that he mention the Presidents name frequently in speeches  and sought to prevent him from testifying about the dangers of tobacco use in the governments lawsuit against tobacco companies  Other information obtained by my office corroborates Dr  Carmonas account  indicating that political appointees hampered the work of the Surgeon General for ideological reasons In light of these events  I ask that you provide to my office information and documents concerning certain political appointees interaction with the Office of the Surgeon General  Please see the attached Document Request for specifics  I ask that you coordinate the production of documents with Nicholas Bath or Sandra Gallardo  Counsel to the Committee  at  202  224 3112 Thank you for your consideration   Sincerely  Edward M  Kennedy ChairmanEnclosure  Document Request and InstructionsPlease
