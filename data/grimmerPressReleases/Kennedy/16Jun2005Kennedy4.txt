         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Statement by Senator Edward M  Kennedy at Cultural Bridges receptionIt s a special privilege to welcome all of you to the Senate  We re honored that so many of you could be here to join us to celebrate the continuing success of the Cultural Bridges Youth Exchange and Study Program and to honor its second class of students Senator Lugar and I are very proud of the Cultural Bridges Program  and I welcome Travis Horel of the State Department  who s done so much implement it I also thank AYUSA and its consortium partners  Some said it couldn t be done    but with your help  we successfully launched this important program I also commend the Senators who were able to join us today  With your help  we hope to be able to reach out to even more students in the Islamic world in the years to come Every spring  thousands of American students your age come to this city to see its monuments and to learn about the nation s history  They walk along the Mall    from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial    and through the halls of Congress  In addition to being the seat of government  Washington is also full of inspiring reminders of our past  and they help us live up to the ideals our nation Over the last year  I m sure you ve seen many different aspects of life in America  I hope the overall impression is as positive as we like to think it is  We face many challenges  but there are many blessings and opportunities as well  and I hope you were able to enjoy some of them Recently  I had the privilege to meet one of your classmates from Afghanistan who was living and studying in Massachusetts for the year  During his time in Massachusetts  he told me that he had become an avid Boston Red Sox baseball fan  A few weeks ago he had the opportunity to meet President Karzai of Afghanistan when President Karzai was in Massachusetts to speak to the graduating class at Boston University  He said it was an experience he ll never forget  and that he never dreamed he would have such an opportunity I understand you all had the opportunity to go to the White House and hear President Bush speak on Monday  Experiences like that will stay with you forever  and hopefully inspire you in the years ahead It s said that democracy is the worst form of government  except for all the others that have been tried from time to time  We have a long history in Congress of debating nearly everything our government does  We often disagree with one another  but we share some fundamental American ideals  The most important are our beliefs that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed  and no one is above the law Sharing these ideals was one of the reasons Senator Lugar and I worked together to create this program after the tragedy of 9 11  We believe that the people of the Islamic world and the people of the United States need to do more to understand each other and work together  so that all our peoples can live in peace As President Kennedy said  we can help make the world safe for diversity  For in the final analysis  our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet  We all breathe the same air  We all cherish our children s future  And we are all mortal We used to believe that the oceans could protect us  and what we didn t know couldn t hurt us  Now we know better The challenge we share    you and your families at home  the Americans you ve lived and studied with  our citizens and your citizens    is to understand each others  ideals and aspirations  and avoid the negative stereotypes After a year here  all of you are now unofficial American ambassadors to your home countries  I m sure you don t agree with everything the United States says and does  but I hope you ll be able to explain our country and our values to your friends and family Most of you have probably spent the year explaining your own country and your lives to Americans  I m sure you ve helped bring our countries a little closer  Each time you do  you send forth a new ripple of hope  As my brother Robert Kennedy said  those ripples  gathering force  can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance Thank you all for participating in the Cultural Bridges Program  Thank you for the bridges you ve built here and  I hope you ll continue to build them throughout your lives and careers Below are short

according to Khalil Khalil participated on a public town debate as part of his Government and Law class where he was in support of the Patriot Act  Ultimately the town did not pass a resolution either

at night because she feels that it s just not right to give up  After deliberating about her participation on the YES program for months  Ruba decided that she would take the step that needed to be taken because people in Iraq are so misrepresented  I wanted to show Americans that we are normal  She has been living Falmouth  MA with the Cole Family  Dave and Kara Cole were international teachers
