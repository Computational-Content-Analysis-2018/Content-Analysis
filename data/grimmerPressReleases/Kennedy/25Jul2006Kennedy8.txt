         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            I thank Chairman Hatch and Senator Rockefeller for inviting me to testify this afternoon   Your leadership in creating and sustaining the Childrens Health Insurance Program has improved the lives of children across the nation       Many of the best ideas in public policy are the simplest   CHIP is based on one simple and powerful idea  that the nation s children deserve a healthy start in life           My own state of Massachusetts has long recognized the importance of this basic idea   In 1993  Massachusetts enacted the Childrens Medical Security Plan to bring quality health care coverage to children in low income families not eligible for Medicaid         That pioneering program owed much to the leadership of John McDonough  and he urged Congress to enact federal legislation to cover the nations children       Massachusetts provided the inspiration for another major element of our success ten years ago   In 1994  Massachusetts expanded eligibility for Medicaid  and financed the expansion through a tobacco tax  the same approach we used successfully a few years later for CHIP       Rhode Island and other states took similar action  to create a nationwide call for action to address the health needs of children       Congress acted on that call  and the result was CHIP  a program that can make the difference between a child starting life burdened with disease  or a child who is healthy and ready to learn and grow   In every state in the nation and in Puerto Rico  CHIP covers the services that give children the right start in life  well child care  vaccinations  doctor visits  emergency services  and many others       Thats why every organization representing children  or the health care professionals who serve them  recognizes that preserving and strengthening CHIP is essential to the health of children   The Childrens Defense Fund  the National Partnership for Women and Families  the American Academy of Pediatrics  the March of Dimes  and countless other organizations dedicated to children all strongly support CHIP       According to the American Academy of Pediatrics  Enrollment in SCHIP is associated with improved access  continuity  and quality of care  and a reduction in racial ethnic disparities   As pediatricians  we see what happens when children dont receive necessary health care services such as immunizations and well child visits   Their overall health suffers and expensive emergency room visits increase       Today  we are here to dedicate ourselves to the job begun ten years ago  and make sure that the lifeline of CHIP is strengthened and extended to more children          Millions of children eligible for CHIP or Medicaid are not enrolled   Of the over eight million uninsured children  three quarters  or over 6 million    already are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP   These programs are there to help them  but these children are not getting that help  because their parents are unaware of their eligibility or because there are barriers to enrollment       We should look at innovative ways of working with our schools  our churches  and state and local governments to make sure that parents know that this health insurance is available for their children         By improving outreach  and providing the funding needed to make that outreach a success  we can see that CHIP continues its remarkable success in reducing the percentage of children who are uninsured   Over the last decade  employer after employer has dropped coverage  yet  due to CHIP  the percentage of children who are uninsured has actually dropped over this period  from 22 6 percent in 1997 to 13 5 percent today       To build on this success  Congress needs to renew its commitment to CHIP   The Presidents budget assumes that CHIP funding will remain at about  5 billion per year   But with rising health costs  we will need an additional investment of  12 billion over the five years between 2008 and 2012 just to break even   If we fail to provide that funding  the consequences will be disastrous        Since its enactment  enrollment in CHIP has steadily increased  but this positive trend will be reversed if Congress does not increase funding for the program over this baseline   Without that additional investment  1 5 million children will be dropped from the program  according to the CMS Actuarys own figures         If funding is not increased  states across the nation will face worsening funding shortfalls  so that by 2012  36 states will run out of the funds required just to meet current needs       Our final priority should be not merely to hold on to the gains of the past  but to see that all children have an avenue to health coverage   Families with greater means should pay a fair share of the coverage   But every single parent in America should have the opportunity to meet the health care needs of their children         I thank you for your time and attention  and I look forward to working with the members of the committee on this important legislation          Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
