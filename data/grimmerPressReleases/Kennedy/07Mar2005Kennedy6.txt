         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  For eight long years  Democrats have been trying to pass an increase in the minimum wage from its current level of  5 15 an hour  For employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  that s  10 700 a year     5 000 below the poverty line for a family of three   That s why we re offering this amendment  which will raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps    by 70 cents 60 days after enactment  70 more cents a year later  and another 70 cents one year after that   The Santorum amendment gives half that increase to minimum wage workers with one hand  and then takes away minimum wage  overtime and equal pay rights from over 10 million workers with the other hand  It takes just one page of Senator Santorum s amendment to raise the minimum wage  the next 84 pages are special interest give aways that take rights away from workers   The Senator from Pennsylvania has a record of opposing increasing the minimum wage  He has voted against it  and against hard working Americans  on this issue at least 17 times in the last 10 years   Today is no different  The Santorum amendment will increase the minimum wage by  1 10 per hour  It will benefit only 1 8 million workers    5 5 million fewer than our amendment   The difference between an increase to  7 25 and an increase to  6 25 for a minimum wage worker is 15 fewer months of child care  16 fewer months of tuition at a community college  10 fewer months of heat and electricity  6 fewer months of groceries  and 5 fewer months of rent   The Santorum amendment makes more than 10 million workers no longer eligible for the minimum wage  no longer eligible for overtime pay  no longer eligible for equal pay rights by repealing the individual coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act and raising the threshold to  1 million a year from  500 000  The Santorum amendment means the death knell of the 40 hour workweek and the American weekend   After the Administration s denial last year of overtime protections for 6 million workers  this proposal would further undermine overtime by allowing employers to refuse to pay workers up to ten hours of overtime pay every two weeks   That means a pay cut of  3 000 a year for a median income earner and an  800 pay cut for minimum wage workers  Employers are already free to offer more flexible schedules under current lawthe only difference is that now they have to pay workers overtime when they work more than 40 hours in a week   The Santorum amendment also prohibits states from providing stronger wage protection than the federal standard for waiters and waitresses and other employees who rely heavily on tips for their earnings  Today  in Pennsylvania  employers are required to pay their tipped employees  2 83 an hour  Yet  this amendment would deny hard working waiters and waitresses seventy cents an hour in employer provided wages   Twenty two year old Julie Phillips in Johnstown  Pennsylvania is working two part time jobs    one as a minimum wage worker making  5 15 an hour  and the other as a waitress at a Chinese restaurant This amendment would deny Julie seventy cents an hour in wages from her minimum wage job  She d have to rely on unpredictable tips from her second job instead   The amendment also gives a free pass to violators of a broad range of consumer  environmental  and labor protections by prohibiting federal agencies from assessing civil fines for most first time reporting violations  It also preempts states  ability to enforce these laws   Once again  we are on the floor with legislation written by the special interests that it will help the most  The bankruptcy bill was written by the credit card companies  The class action bill was written by corporations that are deceiving and overcharging their customers  And now we have a minimum wage bill written by the restaurant industry and retailers looking for a way to fatten their bottom lines   If Republicans were truly interested in raising the minimum wage  they would not have loaded down their proposal with these anti worker poison pills that are special interest give aways   It s hard to believe our Republican colleagues are serious about this thinly veiled attack on low income workers  There are many ways to help small businesses without denying rights to millions of minimum wage workers  We ve worked together in the past to provide reasonable small business tax relief along with the minimum wage  I would be willing to do that again   In fact  in an effort to reach a reasonable compromise with my colleagues  I ask unanimous consent to add the tax package for small businesses that is in the Santorum amendment    Subtitle G  Small Business Tax Relief    to my minimum wage proposal   Three times in the last Congress the Republican leadership brought down a bill rather than let us have a vote on the minimum wage    first on the State Department Bill  then on the Welfare Bill  and finally on the Class Action Bill   How can they say with a straight face now that they are supporting an increase  when they are loading up their proposal with so many anti worker poison pills   Actions speak louder than words  A week ago  the Republican Leadership was touting their so called anti poverty agenda last week  But as we see with their amendment  what they really have is a create deeper poverty agenda  If they are not truly serious about helping hard working families rise above the poverty line  they will support our amendment to give a fair raise to America s low income workers   It is shameful that in America today  the richest and most powerful nation on earth  nearly a fifth of all children go to bed hungry at night because their parents are working full time at the minimum wage and still can t make ends meet  That s a key part of any real anti poverty agenda    ending childhood poverty  But the Republican proposal will actually plunge even more children into poverty   Nearly three and a half million children have parents who would get an immediate raise under our proposal  Hundreds of thousands of those children would be left behind by the Santorum amendment   The poison pills in the Santorum amendment will be particularly harsh for children  It is unacceptable for the Senate to feed such poison to the nation s children   Think about the single mother with two children working as a waitress in Minnesota  Under the Santorum amendment  she will lose her guaranteed right to the minimum wage  leaving her paycheck smaller and her children less secure   Think about a garment worker working 80 hours a week to provide for her family  Her husband  a janitor  relies on overtime as well to pay for food  rent  and clothes for their children  They will lose their overtime coverage under this amendment  and both parents will take a pay cut  Some anti poverty agenda   According to the Families and Work Institute  among the most important things that children would most like to change about their working parents are these  They wish their parents were less stressed out by their work  They wish they were less exhausted by their work  They wish they could spend more time with them   But this amendment will deny overtime protections for more than 10 million workers  leaving them less time to spend with their children   What s more  this amendment would tie the hands of federal and state agencies trying to enforce the federal laws that protect families and children and communities  It weakens gun safety protections under the Brady Act  which could lead to an increase in weapon sales to criminals  jeopardizing our neighborhoods and our children s safety  It weakens environmental laws that require companies to disclose their toxic emissions  It weakens reporting requirements under the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act  It undermines consumer protection laws that require companies to report on the safety of their food  These provisions put all Americans  especially children  at risk of increased exposure to pollution and toxic substances and serious illnesses from unsafe foods   We teach our children the importance of hard work  We encourage them to do their best in school and to be good citizens  We tell them their reward will be good jobs that fulfill their hopes and dreams and enable them to support strong and healthy families   That s what America is about   But for 36 million Americans who live and work in poverty today  that dream is unfulfilled  They work as hard as any American often even harder  But too often they re forced into bankruptcy  because the minimum wage won t cover their bills and give their families the support they need   We can no longer turn our backs on our fellow citizens  But that is exactly what is happening here in the United States Senate   Raising the minimum wage is critical to preventing the economic free fall that often leads to bankruptcy  Amending the bankruptcy bill to increase the minimum wage will help many of the people this so called bankruptcy reform is likely to hurt    low income families  minorities and women   Nearly one third of those who file for bankruptcy are in poverty at the time they file  That s half a million families who are already living below the poverty line  and will be plunged into further hardship with this bankruptcy bill  Many of them are minimum wage earners   In the current economy  millions of Americans are suffering  Eight million are unemployed  Forty five million are without health insurance  Thirteen million children live in poverty  Poverty has doubled for full time  full year workers since the 1970s  Minimum wage employees work 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  and they deserve to be fairly paid   Today  workers who lose their jobs often have an impossible time finding new jobs with comparable wages  benefits  and hours  Over the next eight years  the occupations with the highest job growth will be the low paying  low security  low benefits areas like retail sales  nursing aides  customer service representatives  food preparation workers  and janitors  Many of these jobs are minimum wage jobs today  and we can t ignore their plight   Low income families are being squeezed in every direction by the economy  Families are just barely balancing on a cliff of piling bills  hoping they won t topple over  Their costs are rising  but not their wages   Since President Bush took office  the cost of housing has gone up 33 percent  college tuition has gone up 35 percent  and health insurance has gone up 59 percent  but the minimum wage has gone up zero percent   For minimum wage workers  prices have increased every year since 1997  but their paychecks have remained exactly the same  They are still earning  5 15 an hour  If inflation is taken into account the real value of the minimum wage has declined to  4 38 an hour today   With few savings  and little safety net  minimum wage workers are one pink slip or one medical emergency away from bankruptcy   To make matters worse  credit card companies prey on low income workers  They know these workers are desperate  They offer loans at exorbitant interest rates that are made to seem cheaper than they are by three of the most deceptive words in the English language    minimum monthly payment  While workers struggle  credit card companies reap skyrocketing profits from their hardship  In 2004  credit card companies made  30 2 billion    470 percent more than they made in 1990   This is not only an economic issue  It is also a family issue  Low income families struggling to meet their obligations often find themselves facing bankruptcy  Some argue that the rise in bankruptcy filings is due to a lack of responsibility  But too often the problem is a matter of basic home economics  Families going into bankruptcy have less income than most Americans  A raise in the minimum wage will give many of them the economic boost they need to avoid bankruptcy  It will give these low income wage earners the help they deserve to care more effectively for their families    to buy the food and clothing and health care they need  without going into debt   It is also a women s issue  Mothers are three times more likely than men without children to go bankrupt  If things continue as they are  one in six single mothers will file for bankruptcy by the end of the decade   Divorced women are 300 percent more likely than single or married women to find themselves in bankruptcy court often because they are owed child support or alimony and can t collect it   They re trying to raise their children  but they face a daunting challenge  and this bill will make it even harder to meet that challenge  Sixty one percent of those who will benefit from a minimum wage increase are women  and one third of those women are mothers   This is also a civil rights issue  African American and Hispanic families disproportionately face the threat of bankruptcy and the burden of a low minimum wage  African American and Hispanic homeowners are 500 percent more likely than white homeowners to land in bankruptcy court  often because of discrimination in mortgage lending  in housing purchases  in hiring  in wages  and in health insurance   African American and Hispanic workers often end up in low paying jobs  They comprise more than a third of those who will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage  This amendment will help these families meet their basic needs  In fact  one million African Americans  and more than 1 4 million Hispanic workers  will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage   The level of the minimum wage is so low today that many workers have to work long hours to make ends meet   The increase in work hours has a damaging impact on every aspect of life    on families  on personal time  and even on employers  who get less productivity from overworked employees   Raising the minimum wage won t solve all of these problems   But a higher minimum wage will mean that more employees can work fewer hours  and have more hours a week of family time and personal time  Fewer minimum wage workers will be forced into bankruptcy because they could no longer make the impossible choice between paying the rent and buying groceries  or between paying the heating bill and buying clothes   An increase in the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour for full time  year round workers will add  4 400 to their annual income  enough to make a difference in their lives  It s enough for a low income family of three to pay for   More than a year of groceries   Over 9 months of rent   A year and a half of heat and electricity  or  Full tuition for two years to earn a community college degree It s long past time for Congress to give these hard working Americans a raise  In the past eight years  Members of Congress have raised our own salaries seven timesby a total of  28 500while minimum wage workers still earn the same  10 700 a year they earned in 1997  Minimum wage workers deserved a raise more than Congress did  but they didn t get it   At the current minimum wage  workers can t afford adequate housing in any area of this country  A worker earning the minimum wage in Massachusetts  Pennsylvania  Utah  or many other parts of the America  would have to work more than 100 hours a week to afford a two bedroom apartment  That means working more than 20 hours a day five days a week  or more than 14 hours a day seven days a week  We can t ask people to do that if we care about our country   Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than three dollars and fifty cents below its peak in 1968    three dollars and fifty cents  To have the same purchasing power it had then  the minimum wage would have to be  8 70 an hour today  not  5 15   That s the difference between a Congress that used to care  and a Congress that no longer cares  We can t let that continue   More than 7 million workers will directly benefit from this minimum wage increase  Nearly two thirds of these employees are adults  and more than a third of them are the sole breadwinners in their families   History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage does not have a negative effect on jobs  employment  or inflation  In the first four years after the last minimum wage increase  the economy had its strongest growth in three decades  More than 11 million new jobs were added  at a rate of more than 200 000 a month   Compare that to the 530 000 private sector jobs lost since President Bush took office  Raising the minimum wage won t cause more job losses    but staying the course on our failed economic policies will   We must act at long last to raise the federal minimum wage  Overwhelming numbers of citizens in Nevada and Florida showed the way last November  by voting for a higher minimum wage in their states   It s time for the Republican Party to stop obstructing a fair increase in the minimum wage for all employees across the nation  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment  and improve the lives of millions of American families   Laura
