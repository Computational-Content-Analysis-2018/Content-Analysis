         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I welcome our committee members and our distinguished witnesses to todays  hearing on improving the drug user fee program and enhancing drug safety   Patients across the nation look with hope to our biotechnology and  pharmaceutical research to develop medical breakthroughs for the illnesses they  face  Every day that such breakthroughs are delayed is another day of hope  denied for patients afflicted with cancer  Parkinsons disease  spinal cord  injury  or other serious conditions  We in Congress have a  responsibility to see that FDA has the expertise  the information and resources  it needs to make the right decisions as quickly as possible for the patients who  need such treatments  Obviously  the need for swift review does not mean that  drugs should be rushed to market  regardless of proper safety precautions  A  review conducted with inadequate regard for safety subjects patients to  unacceptable risks of serious side effects  or even death The user fee  program that the committee considers today is an attempt to strike the right  balance  Its goal is to give FDA the support it needs to review new drugs as  swiftly as proper regard for safety allows  Most drugs are now approved first  in the United States  due in part to the user fee program  which has reduced  both review times and approval times for new drugs  I commend FDA and the  biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries for having reached agreement on  recommendations to Congress for the renewal of this essential program  All of us  are committed to moving the reauthorization through Congress as quickly as  possible The user fee program  however  demonstrates the failure by  Congress to give FDA the funds it needs to do the job that the American public  counts on it to do  Congress ought to correct this failing  so that FDA does  not have to rely excessively on user fees for its basic  budget Thorough reviews are essential in assuring drug safety  but  the commitment to safety does not stop when the initial review is completed  As  the recent Institute of Medicine report emphasized  there must be a life cycle  approach to drug safetythat includes both a thorough initial review and ongoing  reviews to oversee safety throughout the life cycle of the drug  Part of the  ongoing responsibility for assuring safety is to take effective action to  protect patients from unacceptable risks that are detected after drugs reach the  market  The approach described by the IOM is at the heart of the  bipartisan legislation that Senator Enzi and I have introduced on drug safety   Our legislation gives FDA clear authority to require label changes after drug  approval  and to make certain that additional safety studies are conducted where  needed  Our proposal includes a structure to oversee safety that is flexible  enough to be tailored to the unique characteristics of each new drug  and strong  enough to protect patients from unacceptable risk The same goal of  improving safety and protecting patients also underlies the legislation that our  colleague  Senator Dodd  has introduced with Senator Grassley on the issue   Senator Dodd was among the first to recognize that Congressional action is  needed to improve drug safety  and I commend him for his vision and leadership  in this important area Although there are significant differences in  our two bills  their basic goal is identicalto see that consumers receive the  best  most effective  and safest drugs possible  Our bills also share the goal  of giving patients and doctors access to the best possible information about  risks and benefits when they choose among different drugs to treat a disease  I  look forward to working with Senator Dodd  and all the members of the committee  on these important issues Its an honor to welcome all of our  distinguished witnesses to todays hearing  but it is a particular pleasure to  welcome Dr  Andrew von Eschenbach for his first hearing in which the word  Acting has been removed from his title as Commissioner of FDA  The agency  needs a strong  effective and confirmed leader  and I commend our colleagues   and particularly the skillful chairmanship of Senator Enzi  for enabling FDA  once again to have a confirmed Commissioner at the helm We are also  graced today by the presence of one of his illustrious predecessors as  Commissioner  Dr  Mark McClellan  I understand that he comes to us after  attending a conference that IOM convened on this issue on Monday I also  welcome  Ms  Kim Witczak  who will describe in personal terms the tragic loss  that can occur when we fail to get it right on drug safety I also  welcome Diane Dorman of the National Organization for Rare Disorders and Dr   Bruce Burlington of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals who will provide valuable perspective  from the viewpoints of patients and the pharmaceutical industry on this  important issue Your recommendations will help guide our  committee and Congress as we take up the vital work of renewing the drug user  fee program and giving FDA the resources and authority it needs to do the job  that American families are counting on it to do   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
