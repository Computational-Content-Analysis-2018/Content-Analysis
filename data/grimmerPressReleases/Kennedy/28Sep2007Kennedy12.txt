         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     At this critical time  when we face major challenges to our national security  America relies more than ever on the Department of Defense and its dedicated employees at home and abroad  More than 675 000 civilian workers serve our country every day repairing planes  ships and tanks  or overseeing the storage and distribution of vital weapons and supplies  These hardworking Americans are the backbone of our commitment to keep our troops safe and protect our nation      But these vital civilian employees of the Department of Defense have been under sustained attack from the Bush Administration  Instead of honoring and fairly rewarding their patriotic service  the Administration has gone on a binge of outsourcing  forcing federal workers to fight just to keep their jobs  in a competition where the deck is stacked against them      The Department of Defense has been an aggressive accomplice in the Administrations efforts      More than 121 000 civilian defense employees could lose their jobs in the next three years  In fact  these employees are more likely to lose their jobs than employees of any other federal agency      Ill advised outsourcing is not only hurting DOD employees  who are deprived of their jobs and benefits  It also has a massive impact on our brave men and women in uniform  Our armed forces deserve the very best workers supporting them  They also deserve the opportunity to continue serving their country after they come home from the battlefield     Thirty five percent of civilian defense employees are veterans  These loyal Americans deserve to be commended and cheered for choosing to continue to serve their country when they return home  Yet  the Administration is bent on taking this opportunity away from them and from Americans currently serving overseas  as well  by outsourcing their jobs      At the very least  we owe these patriotic Americans a fair chance to compete for this important work      But the Administrations irresponsible outsourcing rules are heavily biased against federal employees  The points insidious  The rules are different for contractors than for federal workers  Private companies get advantages that dedicated federal workers dont  The current system is designed to promote outsourcing  even when it doesnt save money  One of the most appalling roadblocks preventing fair competition is the unjust advantage that contractors gain by shortchanging workers health and retirement benefits       At a time when 47 million Americans dont have health insurance and only 1 in 5 Americans have a secure retirement plan  we should be doing all we can to encourage more companies to provide fair benefits to their employees  But current federal contracting rules actually discourage private companies from providing health coverage or helping employees to save for retirement      Firms that provide no benefits or inadequate benefits often win bids to perform government work  even when the cost savings from their bid are attributable solely to the fact that theyre shortchanging their own workers      This unfair practice creates a dangerous race to the bottom  in which private sector companies compete against each other to see who can provide the fewest benefits to their workers  It penalizes companies that want to do the right thing for their workers  As a result  the bidding process is actually increasing the number of Americans whose health and future security is in jeopardy  Thats irrational and unconscionable      Its patently unfair to the thousands of federal employees who lose their jobs every year because of these irresponsible contractors  Workers shouldnt be unfairly disadvantaged and lose contracts simply because they receive decent benefits       Each and every member of Congress has good health insurance and a secure retirement  Americans who serve our country in the Department of Defense deserve the same     One of the key protections in the Fair Competition amendment corrects this injustice  It prevents contractors from winning bids to perform government work solely because they provide inadequate benefits  or no benefits at all  The Department is instructed not to consider health care and retirement costs in comparing contract bids  The winners of competitions should be employers who operate more efficiently  not employers who provide the fewest benefits  The amendment does not dictate the benefits that employers must provide or require contractors to modify their existing benefits  All it does is eliminate the perverse incentives that discourage contractors from providing fair benefits  and give federal employees a fair chance to prove theyre the best workers for the job     Its a realistic solution to improve the process of public private competition  and it has bipartisan support      The health care provision has been part of appropriations legislation for several years  and a bipartisan Kennedy Hatch amendment providing the same treatment for retirement costs was accepted on the Defense Appropriations bill last year  Members on both sides of the aisle recognize that it is not good policy for the government to shift work from public sector employees to private sector employees solely because its cheaper to deny health and retirement benefits to employees      The Fair Competition amendment contains other important protections to level the playing field for civilian defense employees in public private competition  It allows federal employees to appeal unfair privatization decisions  just as contractors can do now  It allows managers to extend a contract when federal employees perform well  just as they can for private contractors under current law  It prohibits the use of outsourcing quotas  so that agencies arent forced to such privatization against their will      It ensures that outsourcing will occur only when it produces real savings to the taxpayer  And it calls on the Department of Defense to stop dragging its feet and issue long overdue guidelines so that civilian employees have a fair opportunity to compete for new work  or work that has been outsourced incorrectly or unfairly in the past     This amendment is an issue of basic fairness  fairness to taxpayers  fairness to civilian  government workers  and fairness to our men and women in uniform who deserve the best possible support for their missions at home and abroad  I urge my colleagues to support the Fair Competition Amendment          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
