         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   This is the seventh day that weve been on this legislation  Weve voted on 17 amendments  There are 13 other amendments pending to the bill  We will begin voting on those later this morning  Over the past week as the Senate has been in recess for Memorial Day  weve witnessed a healthy debate across the country as Americans across the political spectrum have expressed their views on this legislation  Some support our legislation  Others oppose it  But with all the editorials and newspaper articles and phone calls from constituents  one theme comes through loud and strong  Americans know that our immigration system is broken and they want us to fix it  This week is our chance to meet that challenge for the good of the nation  We have a bipartisan bill before us  It has the support of the President  And I believe that when we complete our debate in the Senate  we will adopt it  It enforces our borders  It cracks down in the workplace by going after employers who hire illegal workers  It brings the 12 million families who are here out of the shadows  It speeds up the reunion of families waiting legally in line that otherwise may never make it here  And it sets up an immigration system for the future that continues to reunite families while stressing our nations economic needs  Thats our program  Its strong  Its practical  And its fair      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
