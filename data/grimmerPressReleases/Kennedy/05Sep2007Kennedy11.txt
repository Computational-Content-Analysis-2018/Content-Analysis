         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  There are few issues more important to the future of our nation than the one before us today  By making college more affordable for young Americans  we not only open doors of opportunity for them  but we equip a new generation of Americans to compete and win in the global economy We are hopeful that we can move this important piece of legislation forward without delay and take advantage of the window before both the House and Senate recess for the Jewish holidays next week  We are also committed to moving forward promptly with our Higher Education reauthorization bill  That is an equally important piece of legislation and Chairman Miller has committed to working with us to complete action on that legislation in the next few weeks  Both the House and Senate bills provide an historic investment in student aid    the largest since the G I  bill  The landmark success of the GI Bill shows us what a difference higher education makes  The bill granted veterans up to  500 each term   the equivalent of  5 600 today  It swung the gates to college wide open  and half of all veterans went through those gates determined to create a new life for themselves and their families  And for every dollar we invested  the nation saw a seven dollar return because of the significant contributions of those who were able to obtain a college degree More than five million veterans received vocational education or job training  and more than two million attended college  It produced 67 000 doctors  91 000 scientists  238 000 teachers  and 450 000 engineers  It also funded the education of three Presidents    three Supreme Court Justices and about a dozen Senators Today  we need a similar bold new commitment to enable the current generation of Americans to rise to the global challenges we face  Chairman Miller and I are committed to ensuring that the final Conference Report does just that  In the Senate  this also has been a shared goal  Senator Enzi and I have worked closely together and with our Committee Members on a strong bipartisan package  I have shared with Chairman Miller several key priorities for Senate Conferees  including  Prioritizing funding for the Pell grant and maintaining a substantial increase in the maximum Pell grant   Providing debt relief to those struggling with increasing student debt levels through flexible repayment plans and loan forgiveness   Protecting working students by not penalizing their earnings  The Senate bill also reflected the priority of several of our Members by recognizing that non profit lenders in their states invest much of their profits in students  We believe we can move forward with a package that respects these priorities  as well as those of our colleagues in the House  Our students and families deserve fast action on this legislation  We all know that a college education is more important than ever  but its never been more expensive  The cost of college has tripled in the last 20 years  Yet  family incomes are not keeping up with rapidly rising college prices  Last week  the Census Bureau released new data showing that median household income in America increased just seven tenths of one percent last year  Meanwhile  the cost of college increased 6 percent Grant aid has not kept up pace with increasing costs  Twenty years ago  the maximum Pell Grant covered 55 percent of costs at a public four year college  Today  it covers only a third of those costs  As a result  each year  400 000 students dont attend a 4 year college because they cant afford to do so  In 1993  fewer than half of all students took out loans to finance their education  but today  more than two thirds of students borrow for college  No student should have to mortgage his or her future in order to pay for higher education today  For many years  Congress was guided by one clear principle with respect to higher education  that no qualified student should be denied the opportunity to attend college because of the cost  I recall how important that principle was for President Kennedy  My brother believed very strongly that if you work hard  study hard  and get accepted to college  you should be able to attend the college of your choice  without regard to cost  That view resonated powerfully with students and families  and it helped create the groundswell that led to the creation of the Higher Education Act five years later  Weve lost sight of that principle in recent years  but with this legislation  we will renew it once again      Laura Burton Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
