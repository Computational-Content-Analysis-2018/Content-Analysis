         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to the cloture vote on the Employee Free Choice Act  The American people spoke uploudly and clearlyin the last election  saying they want a Congress that stands up for working families  The Employee Free Choice Act is exactly the kind of bold action they were calling for  It is a key part of the Democratic plan to help the struggling middle class and restore the economic security that has been lost during the Bush years  Today  I am proud that a majority of my colleagues stood up for working families  I regret that more of my Republicans colleagues do not share this vision for a better America  Their obstructionism has stopped us from moving to debate on this important bill  Todays vote sends a clear signal to the American public about which party stands with working people    and although we were blocked today we will not give up and we will not give in  I can promise that we will be back  There may be obstacles along the way  but well keep up the fight until we get a victory for working families      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
