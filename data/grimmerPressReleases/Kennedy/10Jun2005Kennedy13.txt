         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Congress must act this year to save workers  pensions  I commend Chairman Boehner for taking a serious look at this complicated issue  This bill is an important step forward  but workers need a home run that fully addresses the pension crisis  We must to do more to ensure that workers receive the valuable retirement benefits they have earned  Too many workers already have lost their pensions while their CEOs receive million dollar benefits  and that s wrong  We owe it to these workers and their families to pass fair and workable reforms that protect the benefits they have been promised  I look forward to working with Chairman Boehner and my other colleagues to stop the erosion of private pensions It s wrong for the Bush Administration to try to privatize Social Security and cut benefits  It would also be wrong if Congress fails to do everything it can to protect pensions  too   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
