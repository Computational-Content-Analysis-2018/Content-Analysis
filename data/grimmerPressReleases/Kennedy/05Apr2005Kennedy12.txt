         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY AT THE 2005 PROFILE IN COURAGE AWARD FOR PRESIDENT VIKTOR YUSHCHENKO   Thank you Paul Kirk for that gracious introduction  Paul has been a great friend of the Kennedy family and the Kennedy Library for many years  We re honored by his friendship  and grateful for all he s done to support the Profile in Courage Award over the years    In Profiles in Courage  President Kennedy wrote  A man does what he must    in spite of personal consequences  in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures    and that is the basis of all human morality  Our honoree this evening vividly embodies my brother s words  and is renowned throughout the world for his extraordinary courage    As we all know  at a critical moment in his nation s history  he took a strong and courageous stand for what he knew was right  He risked his life    and nearly lost it    in the ongoing struggle for democracy in Ukraine  His story is the story of honor  decency  and the will of the people triumphing over fraud  deceit and intimidation  And because of his great courage  the rule of law prevailed against the oppressive rule of the powerful over the powerless    A few months ago  the world held its breath as the Orange Revolution took place in Ukraine  We were transfixed by the scenes of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators filling Independence Square in Kiev as Ukrainian citizens  young and old alike  defended the principle of free and fair elections against the mendacity and corruption of the old regime  Night after night  they stood tall in the bitter winter cold and warmed the hearts and minds of the world with their human chains that blocked access to government buildings    Throughout those dramatic and nerve racking days of last fall  Viktor Yushchenko was their unquestioned leader and moral authority  He was clear about the ultimate goal    upholding the right of the Ukrainian people to choose their president freely and fairly  He was clear that non violence was the only acceptable means to achieve that great goal  As he insisted to his supporters  A path to a compromise through the people demonstrating their will is the only path that will help us find a way out of this conflict    The Orange Revolution succeeded because of his courage and the courage of the Ukrainian people  He won the new election  and became the third president of a free and independent Ukraine  He stood up for what he believed in  even in the face of direct threats to his personal safety  It is difficult to imagine a more dramatic example to the world of a true profile in courage    Viktor Yushchenko was born in northeastern Ukraine into a family of teachers  He chose to pursue a career in finance  beginning as a village accountant and rising to ever higher positions in the banking system of the former Soviet Union  He continued in that career when the Cold War ended and Ukraine gained its independence  and  in 1993  he became head of its national bank     His skillful management of Ukraine s monetary system led President Leonid Kuchma to name him Prime Minister in 1999  and he boldly pursued sometimes unpopular but needed reforms that laid the foundation for the impressive economic growth of Ukraine over the past five years     But others feared his rising popularity and in 2001 he was dismissed from the government  Refusing to be silenced  he became the head of a political party and helped create a bloc of reform parties called Our Ukraine  which won a plurality of seats in the parliamentary elections of 2002 and became a significant force in the legislature    As the presidential election approached in 2004  it was obvious that he appealed to Ukrainian citizens in ways no other politician could  His popularity was higher than any others because he had the ability to relate to people s lives  and was so clearly seeking public office for the public good  not private gain     These qualities endeared him to the people  but made him a special threat to the corrupt leaders of the regime in power  Nothing    not even a vicious attempt to poison him    could break his spirit and prevent him from speaking out against corruption and for a democracy grounded firmly in the rule of law    During the presidential campaign last year  the playing field was anything but level  The government s candidate was supported by most of Ukraine s powerful politicians and business leaders  who were threatened by his strong anti corruption stand     State owned media shamelessly opposed him  and independent media were subjected to violence and intimidation in a largely successful effort to silence their support     Opposition rallies faced constant harassment  Government employees  factory workers and students were threatened with dismissal unless they opposed him  President Putin of Russia openly intervened by declaring his support for the government candidate and sending a team of his top political advisers to assist him     But perhaps the most alarming incident during the campaign occurred when Mr  Yushchenko became mysteriously ill  from what doctors later determined was an attempt to poison him  It took tremendous courage on his part and the part of his family to continue the campaign in spite of this vicious criminal act that threatened to take his life     The atmosphere of intimidation and corruption persisted throughout the campaign and the election itself  In the first round of balloting  international observers cited numerous problems and irregularities  Names were missing from voting rolls  and local election officials were excluded at the last minute from their posts  Nevertheless  Mr  Yushchenko prevailed by a small margin and advanced to the second round as the opposition candidate    As the stakes increased  so did the electoral fraud and abuse  Absentee ballots were falsified to inflate the government s support  Suspiciously high turnouts took place in key government strongholds  Intimidation and even violence occurred at polling places     In desperation  before the legal challenges were resolved  the election commission announced preliminary results showing its candidate had prevailed    In outrage and anger  Yushchenko supporters poured into the streets  their ribbons and scarves creating a sea of orange  They vowed court challenges  non violent protests  and other civil disobedience to overturn the fraudulent result  Demonstrators in Kiev numbered in the hundreds of thousands and peacefully blocked the parliament and other government buildings  Secretary of State Powell s declaration that the United States did not recognize the legitimacy of the results also had a galvanizing effect    The Ukrainian Supreme Court prohibited official publication of the election result  pending its review of the charges of fraud  The parliament approved a resolution calling the election invalid  adopted a motion of no confidence in the election commission  and later adopted a motion of no confidence in the government     Finally  the Supreme Court declared the election invalid because of the widespread fraud  and ruled that there should be another vote  The parliament passed a series of reforms to reduce the chance of fraud  Mr  Yushchenko was the clear winner  and the people s will was vindicated  When he took the oath of office  hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians looked on  and people watched in awe throughout the world     In his inaugural address  he said  We have already taken an irrevocable step towards democracy  Only democracy guards the most valuable things for every person    family and children  peace and order  work and well being  Only in a democratic state are the highest values those of human dignity  freedom  equality and solidarity  Only in a democratic Ukraine can the bright palette of languages  cultures and views become the country s wealth    These dramatic events last fall marked a historic turning point in Ukraine s long journey  The path was difficult  but the people never abandoned their dream of a true democracy  and it was Viktor Yushchenko s unparalleled courage that made it possible    Ukraine s poet laureate  Taras Shevchenko  brilliantly wrote in 1845  in an earlier time of great ferment  The spirit is immortal and free in spite of the tyrants  and human speech cannot be stifled  Because of our honoree  the people of Ukraine know that those words have great power in the 21st century as well     I know how much President Kennedy would have cherished this occasion  Rarely  if ever  in our time has there been a more vivid example of a Profile in Courage     Last weekend  several of us in the Kennedy family visited the church in Richmond where Patrick Henry made his famous appeal in March of 1775  urging the people of Virginia to join the people of Massachusetts in the struggle for independence     Responding to those who urged caution  he said  It is vain  sir  to extenuate the matter  The gentlemen may cry  Peace  peace  But there is no peace Our brethren are already in the field  Why stand we here idle Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery  Forbid it  Almighty God  I know not what course others may take  but as for me  give me liberty of give me death    As I thought of those inspiring words  I wondered who President Kennedy would think best exemplifies their spirit today    the love of freedom and the courage to build a nation dedicated to that principle  I m sure that President Kennedy would think of President Yushchenko    In his own Inaugural Address  my brother pledged that America would pay any price  bear any burden  meet any hardship  support any friend  oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty  President Yushchenko has shown the world that there are extraordinary leaders who feel that way today  and who have the courage to live by them  He deserves our nation s admiration and strong support  and so do the Ukrainian people    Persons of good will throughout the world are heartened by his shining example that freedom  tolerance and hope are the common birthright of every human being on our planet    I know how much President Kennedy would have valued this moment  and we are honored that his daughter Caroline is here this evening to present this Profile in Courage Award  She s the inspirational leader for the library  an accomplished author in her own right  a devoted mother  and a powerful and eloquent symbol of the values her father cherished  It s a privilege to introduce her to you now    Caroline Kennedy     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
