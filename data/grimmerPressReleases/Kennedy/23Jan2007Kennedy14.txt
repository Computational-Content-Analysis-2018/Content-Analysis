         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement The Supreme Court will soon hear arguments in United States v  Claiborne and Senators Hatch  Feinstein  and I have filed a friend of the court brief urging the Supreme Court to harmonize its jurisprudence with the structure and goals of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984  Congress enacted and President Reagan signed this bipartisan legislation after a decade if inter branch  bicameral and bipartisan deliberations    the most careful examination of sentencing policy ever conducted by Congress  The issue in Claiborne is very important for federal sentencing  Our brief urges the Supreme Court to affirm the ruling of the 8th Circuit remanding the case for resentencing because the sentencing judge failed to state a sufficiently clear and principled rationale that can be readily applied by other courts in similar cases  In United States v  Booker  the Court held in 2005 that the Sixth Amendment is violated by the imposition of an enhanced sentence based on findings of fact made by a judge rather than a jury  To correct this violation  the Court made the federal sentencing guidelines advisory  not mandatory  It chose this remedy to achieve a sentencing system that satisfies constitutional standards and advances the intent of Congress to eliminate unwarranted disparities  achieve transparency in sentencing  and impose sentences tailored to the offender and the crime In our brief  we agree that these goals should continue to guide the Courts sentencing jurisprudence and the surviving provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act  If respected faithfully by the courts  the Sentencing Commission  and Congress  the federal sentencing guidelines can still provide the framework for a cohesive and effective sentencing system  We urge the Court to apply these provisions with the purpose of establishing a more effective national law on sentencing  a body of principled rules  developed through the reasoned judgment of judges across the nation  to enhance fairness and achieve transparency and consistency    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
