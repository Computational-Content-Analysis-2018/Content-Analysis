         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  as many of us are well aware  the cap in current law on the number of H 2B visas is too restrictive  and it s imposing needless hardships on many businesses that rely on seasonal workers to meet the heavy demands of the tourism industry   Once again  these small industries are facing a crisis this summer if the number of visas isn t increased immediately   Senator Mikulski s timely amendment will provide the much needed relief they deserve  and I urge the Senate to support it    For several years in a row  the cap has created a crisis for the tourism industry in Massachusetts and nationwide   Countless small  family run businesses depend on the ability to hire more workers for the summer season  and they can t possibly find enough U S  workers to fill the need   Without this amendment  many of these firms can t survive because the seasonal business is the heart of their operation    This fiscal year s allocation of 66 000 visas was exhausted just a few months on into the year   Senator Mikulski will make about 30 000 additional visas available  and it should be enacted as soon as possible  so that these firms can make their plans for the coming months    Obviously  this amendment is only temporary relief   It should be achieved through comprehensive immigration reform   We all know our immigration system is broken  and many other reforms are needed as well   The nation needs a new immigration policy that reflects current economic realities  respects family unity and fundamental fairness  and upholds our enduring tradition as a nation of immigrants    Enacting these other reforms will take time    time we don t have if we want to rescue countless seasonal employers around the country  Senator Mikulski s proposal provides the immediate relief needed to enable employers counting on H 2B workers to keep their doors open this summer  and I urge my colleagues to support it   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
