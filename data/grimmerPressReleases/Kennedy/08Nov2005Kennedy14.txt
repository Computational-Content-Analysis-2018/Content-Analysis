         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     A year and half ago  Americans were stunned by the revolting images of men and women wearing the uniform of our nation  torturing and abusing prisoners at Abu Ghraib    At the time  we hoped those photos pictured an isolated instance  But we ve learned since that our own leaders  at the highest levels of our government  in the White House  in the Pentagon  and in the Central Intelligence Agency  have allowed a wide pattern of abuse to occur  Abu Ghraib  it seems  was only the tip of the iceberg    American officials abused prisoners in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo  And now we learn that the CIA maintains secret prisons in Eastern Europe where Vice President Cheney arrogantly and unapologetically hopes to permit torture as permanent American policy    These actions deeply offend American honor and ideals  They invite retribution on our own troops by those who treat them as we treat their prisoners  And they harm America s image around the world  and make the war on terror that much harder to win    These abuses should not be swept under the rug and forgotten  The American people deserve to know what their government is doing  Those who have violated our norms and values under the color of the American flag should be held accountable    That is why I strongly support the Levin amendment to create a commission with responsibility for learning the truth  Its findings not only would bring much needed accountability of those responsible for these abuses  but also would guide our handling of the detention and interrogation of detainees in the future    From what we have learned to date  it is clear that our political leaders made deliberate decisions to throw out the well established legal framework that has long made America the gold standard for human rights throughout the world  The Administration left our soldiers  case officers  and intelligence agents in a fog of ambiguity  They were told to take the gloves off without knowing what the limits were  Top officials in the Administration endorsed and defended practices that we ve condemned in other countries  And the consequences were foreseeable    In rewriting our human rights laws  the Administration consistently overruled the objections of experienced military personnel and those who represent American interests abroad  As Secretary of State Colin Powell warned the White House  It will reverse over a century of U S  policy and practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine the protections of the law of war for our troops  Senior Defense officials were warned that changing the rules could lead to so called force drift  in which  without clearer guidance  the level of force applied to an uncooperative detainee might well result in torture    But these wise words fell on deaf ears  Officials at the highest levels of the Administration somehow viewed the rule of law as inconvenient and quaint  As Lawrence Wilkerson  former Chief of Staff to Secretary Powell said  I don t think  in our history  we ve ever had a presidential involvement  a secretarial involvement  a vice presidential involvement  an attorney general involvement in telling our troops essentially carte blanche is the way you should feel    We have created legal and literal black holes where individuals have been placed without hope of receiving due process or fair and humane treatment and that is nothing short of a travesty    The warnings are all there    The military s Judge Advocate Generals    people who have dedicated their lives to the defense of the country    warned that undoing the rules against abuse would undermine protections for our troops    The FBI warned the abuses at Guantanamo may violate longstanding American practices and policies    The International Red Cross warned that our actions violate and undermine international agreements that serve to protect our own troops when they are captured    But the Bush White House still is doing everything it can to avoid accountability  Only yesterday  President Bush said that the United States does not torture  Yet  his own Vice President is lobbying Congress to allow the CIA to use these abusive techniques    There is little doubt that many of those detained are cold blooded killers intent on harming Americans  They should be charged for their crimes and locked away    But we do not win the war on terror by stooping to their level  We do not win by desecrating the very ideals that our soldiers are fighting for  We win by setting an example    by doing unto others as we would have them do unto us     We now know now that the prisoner abuse scandal is not merely the responsibility of a few bad apples  as the Administration initially claimed  We cannot simply blame a few lower ranking soldiers  without looking at the role of William Haynes  David Addington  Jay Bybee  John Yoo  Timothy Flanigan  Alberto Gonzalez  and the Vice President in crafting these policies that led to these abuses     There have been eleven investigations into the treatment of detainees  Eleven  But not one has fully examined the extent to which officials at the top levels of the Administration are responsible for these abuses  And not one has looked beyond the Pentagon to the CIA  the Justice Department  and to the White House itself  Not the Schlesinger report  and not the ten military investigations that have taken place  We can no longer let the White House off the hook    By refusing to act like the truth is important  the Administration is only making the crisis worse  further embarrassing the nation in the eyes of the world  and casting greater doubt on its commitment to the rule of law  We will not be able to move past this scandal as a nation until there is full independent investigation of all that has gone wrong in our detention and interrogation policy  and all the persons found responsible for these shameful policies are held accountable    I urge my colleagues to support this amendment   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
