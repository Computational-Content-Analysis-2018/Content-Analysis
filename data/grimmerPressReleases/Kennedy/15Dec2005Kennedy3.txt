         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today Senator Kennedy and over a dozen of his colleagues urged Chairmen Cochran and Byrd to reject any effort to include in the DoD Appropriations bill a cynical plan that takes advantage of the flu pandemic to enact sweeping drug liability protections  The Republican proposal would absolve the pharmaceutical industry of any responsibility to patients injured by dangerous drugs or vaccines with no compensation for those who are harmed  Senator Kennedy has been leading the fight against this sweetheart deal that would fail to protect the American people and instead protect companies that make ineffective or harmful medicines  Kennedy supports limiting the liability of vaccine manufacturers provided that patients are properly compensated for injuries and companies do not get a free pass for grossly negligent actions  He objects to the method of slipping this Republican deal into an appropriations bill without scrutiny and Senate debate  Senator Kennedy said  Congress should see that liability concerns don t force pharmaceutical companies to abandon plans to manufacture new vaccines and other medications against pandemic flu  The obvious answer is what s worked before    make clear that responsible companies can t be sued if they make an experimental vaccine or drug available to the public  and include an alternative method of compensation if patients are injured  But some Republicans want to reject this tried and true approach  and let pharmaceutical companies ignore basic safety standards with impunity    while providing no compensation for patients injured by faulty drugs  Worse yet  they are trying to insert this outrageous giveaway to the drug industry into a massive spending bill without public scrutiny or debate  Congress should reject any back room deal that gives a free pass to companies that act irresponsibly or denies fair compensation to injured patients  Senator Kennedy supports and has proposed indemnifying drug companies that make pandemic flu and countermeasures for responding to terrorist attacks and a compensation program modeled after the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for routine childhood vaccines  Under Kennedy s plan  injured patients could either seek redress from the administrative compensation fund or  if they think they could prove negligence or worse  sue the government in Federal Court  If the Federal government believes the company was grossly negligent or reckless in producing a vaccine or drug  the government could sue the company directly in Federal Court  This proposal offers compensation to injured patients and it protects companies from suits by patients  Drug company liability to the government deters the reckless manufacturing of vaccines and countermeasures that would cause patients to be injured  Below is the text of the letter from Senators Kennedy  Stabenow  Murray  Feinstein  Akaka  Reed  Feingold  Clinton  Mikulski  Wyden  Sarbanes  Boxer  Durbin  Kohl  Obama  Cantwell and Kerry   At the time of release more were signing on   A PDF copy of the letter with signatures is available upon request    December 15  2005   The Honorable Thad Cochran    The Honorable Robert C  Byrd Chairman       Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations    Committee on Appropriations 113 Dirksen Senate office Building    311 Hart Senate Office Building Washington  DC 20510     Washington  DC 20510   Dear Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Byrd    The responsibility of Congress is to protect the American people from threats to their health and security  We know that pandemic flu could easily threaten the lives of millions of Americans  and we must do all we can to strengthen the nation s defenses against this ominous danger    An effective vaccine is an essential part of our national preparedness for pandemic flu  It is certainly proper for the Senate to consider liability limitations for companies that develop and manufacture such vaccines and for the health professionals who administer them  But an essential element of such limitations must be an effective program to provide compensation to those injured by the vaccine    We are concerned by reports that some of our colleagues are seeking to bypass the normal process of Senate debate by inserting into a major appropriations bill a non germane provision to grant broad immunity from liability to those who manufacture and administer a wide range of vaccines and drugs  yet provide either no compensation or inadequate and uncertain compensation to those injured by faulty products  even when companies recklessly disregard basic safety procedures or act with gross negligence    We know from experience that this reported proposal will fail to protect the American people  Instead  it will protect companies that make ineffective or harmful medicines  and it will discourage first responders and other individuals from taking any medicine at all to counter a biological attack or disease outbreak  Three years ago  the program to inoculate millions of first responders against smallpox failed to provide compensation for those who might be injured by the vaccine  Doctors  nurses  firefighters and other first responders were not willing to risk the future of their families without compensation for their losses if they were injured  disabled  or even killed by its side effects  Many refused to participate  Congress should not repeat this mistake  which will fail to protect the public from pandemic flu  A provision such as this should be subject to scrutiny and Senate debate  not inserted into an appropriations conference report without the possibility of amendment  We urge you to reject the inclusion of any such provision in an appropriations conference report  The Senate deserves the opportunity to debate and improve legislation on this important issue  and this opportunity should be respected    Sincerely  Senators Kennedy  Stabenow  Murray  Feinstein  Akaka  Reed  Feingold  Clinton  Mikulski  Wyden  Sarbanes  Boxer  Durbin  Kohl  Obama  Cantwell and Kerry  Laura Capps
