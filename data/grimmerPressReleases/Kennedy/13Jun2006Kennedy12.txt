         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE              Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on President Bushs trip to Iraq   I hope the President will deliver a clear message in Baghdad  now that a democratic government has been elected and the Al Qaeda leader in Iraq has been killed  its time for American troops to begin to come home   We need to view disengagement as part of the solution in Iraq  Our overwhelming military presence and our open ended military commitment have fueled the insurgency and made America a crutch for the Iraqi government   If America really wants the new Iraqi government to succeed  we must begin to disengage from Iraq  and they from us  The Iraqi government must begin to make its own decisions  make necessary compromises to avoid full scale civil war  and take responsibility for its own future         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
