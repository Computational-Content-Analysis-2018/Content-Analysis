         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CLate last night  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to the passage by the United States Senate of the Improving Head Start Act   For forty two years  Head Start has been a lifeline of support for our nations neediest children and families   I am pleased that we were able to work together in the Senate to produce a bill that will advance and strengthen this important program   This legislation builds on Head Starts proven track record  sets ambitious goals to expand the program  and upgrades Head Starts educational services to better focus on preparing children for school  The bill will increase the scope of the Head Start program  doubling the size of Early Head Start over the course of the authorization  and deliver services to over 56 000 additional children  It re designs the Head Start Collaboration Office in every state to maximize services to Head Start children  align Head Start with kindergarten classrooms  and strengthen its local partnerships with other agencies    The bill sets a goal to expand Head Start over the next several years  It calls for increases in funding  from  6 9 billion in the current fiscal year  to  7 3 billion in FY 2008   7 5 billion in FY 2009  and  7 9 billion in 2010   These funding levels are critical to advance the essential reforms in this legislation  and to serve thousands of additional children in the Head Start program   To improve and expand the availability of quality early childhood education  the Senate Head Start bill designates an Early Care and Education Council in each state to develop a coordinated and comprehensive system of early childhood education and development   The Councils are tasked with conducting an inventory of childrens needs  developing plans for data collection and for supporting early childhood educators  reviewing and upgrading state early learning standards  and making recommendations on technical assistance and training for programs   For those states ready to move forward and implement their statewide plan  our bill will offer a one time incentive grant to implement these important efforts  Additional flexibility for the Head Start programs is also included  allowing local programs to better tailor services to additional families and children in need   By expanding the eligibility requirements in the program  families who previously were excluded by very slim margins will now qualify for participation in the program   Often  these are the neighbors of Head Start children with similar needs who have been barred from participating in the program   SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON HEAD START REAUTHORIZATION As Prepared for Delivery I welcome the Senates action on this important legislation  the Head Start for School Readiness Act   I commend Senator Enzi  Senator Dodd  and Senator Alexander for their bipartisan cooperation on this legislation  and I thank all the Senators on the HELP Committee for their contributions to improving Head Start to meet todays challenges   We began this process four years ago   Today  our bipartisan efforts have resulted in the strengthening of a forty two year old program that has been a lifeline of support for millions of low income children preparing for school and for life               Since the War on Poverty  Head Start has delivered the assistance needed to enable disadvantaged children to arrive at school  ready to learn   Its comprehensive services provide balanced meals for children  support visits to the doctor and dentist  and teach young children important learning and social skills   It helps families with the greatest needs get on their feet  and encourages parents to participate actively in their childs early development Years of evaluation have demonstrated that Head Start works   A federal survey found that Head Start children make both academic and social gains under the program  and that these gains continue when children enter kindergarten   Once Head Start children complete their kindergarten year  they are near the national average of 100 in key areas  with scores of 93 in vocabulary  96 in early writing  and 92 in early math Over the years  weve also learned more about how Head Start can be improved   This reauthorization applies that knowledge to make modifications in the program  and it will enable Head Start to be even more effective in the years ahead In this legislation  we expand Head Start to include thousands of low income children who are not yet served by the program   We provide for better coordination of Head Start with state programs for low income children   We strengthen Head Starts focus on critical early learning skills and school readiness   We enhance the educational goals for Head Start teachers   We preserve the community based structure of the program to ensure that the needs of local neighborhoods and their children are the top priority   We also provide greater accountability for the program  including new policies to provide improved monitoring visits and guarantee that programs with deficiencies receive needed attention and support   To strengthen Head Start  we must begin by providing more resources for it   Child poverty is on the rise again and the need for Head Start is greater than ever   Today  less than 50 percent of children eligible for Head Start participate in the program   Hundreds of thousands of three  and four year olds are left out because of inadequate funding  Early Head Start serves only 3 percent of eligible infants and toddlers   It is shameful that 97 percent of the children eligible for Early Head Start have no access to it   This legislation expands access to Head Start to serve as many infants  toddlers  and preschool children and their families as possible  The bill establishes goals to increase funding and expand the program to provide nearly  8 billion worth of services by 2010   These funding levels are essential to carry out the essential reforms in the legislation and to serve thousands of additional children and families In 1994  we enacted Early Head Start to benefit infants  toddlers  and their families   It has worked ever since   Early Head Start children have larger vocabularies  lower levels of aggressive behavior  and higher levels of sustained attention than children not enrolled in the program    Early Head Start parents are more likely to play with their children and read to them  These activities increase a childs desire to learn and strengthen a familys commitment to education  Our bill doubles the size of Early Head Start over the course of the authorization  and includes a commitment to serve 56 000 additional children             The bill also establishes a Head Start Collaboration Office in every state to improve support for Head Start children  to align Head Start with kindergarten classrooms  and to strengthen its local partnerships with other agencies   These offices will work hand in hand with the Head Start network of training and technical assistance to support grantees in meeting the goals of preparing children for school             Im especially pleased that the bill provides the blueprint needed to upgrade and strengthen other early childhood education programs and services in the states   The bill provides an active role for states in coordinating early childhood education and development programs  and designates an Early Care and Education Council in each state to undertake the activities essential to developing a comprehensive system for the nations youngest children   The councils will conduct an inventory of childrens needs  develop plans for data collection  support early childhood educators  review and upgrade early learning standards  and make recommendations on technical assistance and training   For states ready to move forward and implement their statewide plan  the legislation offers  100 million to support incentive grants for states to implement these important efforts Over the past four decades  Head Start has developed quality and performance standards to guarantee a full range of services  so that children are educated in the basics about letters  numbers  and books  and are also healthy  well fed  and supported in stable and nurturing relationships   Head Start is already a model program  but we can enhance its quality even more   The bill strengthens literacy efforts currently underway in Head Start programs   We know the key to future reading success is to get young children excited about letters and books and numbers   The bill emphasizes language and literacy  by enhancing the literacy training required of Head Start teachers  continuing to promote parent literacy  and working to put more books into Head Start classrooms and into childrens homes In addition  we make a commitment in the bill to upgrade all of the educational components of Head Start  and ensure that the services are aligned with expectations for childrens kindergarten year and continue to be driven by the effective Head Start Child Outcomes Framework At the heart of Head Starts success are its teachers and staff   They are caring  committed leaders who know the children they serve and are dedicated to improving their lives   They help children learn to identify letters of the alphabet and arrange the pieces of puzzles   They teach them to brush their teeth  wash their hands  make friends and follow rules   Yet their salary is only half the salary of kindergarten teachers  and the turnover is high  about 11 percent a year   Because teacher quality is directly related to a childs outcome  our bill establishes a goal to ensure that every Head Start teacher earns an A A  degree  and that half earn their B A  degree by the next time Congress revisits the program   Head Start teachers and staff are the greatest resource for children and families in the program  and investing in their development must be a priority   I look forward to working with my colleagues to match these ambitious goals with the funding needed to make them a reality     Our legislation also gives local Head Start programs greater authority to assess the needs of families in their communities and define the services necessary to meet those needs   Weve lifted the eligibility requirements under the program  so that families living below 130 percent of the federal poverty rate can qualify and participate in Head Start  Yet we still prioritize services to children who need them the most   If programs determine that a greater share of infants and toddlers need services  our bill allows them to apply to the Secretary to convert and expand services to our youngest children   If programs identify a need to provide full day or full year care for children and families  they can take steps to do this as well                 Accountability is a cornerstone of excellence in education and should start early   Head Start should be accountable for its commitment to provide safe and healthy learning environments  to support each childs individual pattern of development and learning  to cement community partnerships in services for children  and to involve parents in their childs growth             Head Start reviews are already among the most extensive in the field   Our bill takes a further step to improve this process by ensuring that monitoring results and feedback are available to programs and used for their improvement   We also take steps to address programs with serious deficiencies  and ensure that substantial problems in programs do not languish at the expense of children   If a local program is unable to meet Head Starts high standards of quality  others should step in   Every Head Start child deserves to develop and learn in a high quality program      Our bill also takes an important step to suspend the Head Start National Reporting System   Four years ago  many of us insisted that instead of rushing forward with a national test of hundreds of thousands of children  Head Start would be better served if plans were developed more deliberately to ensure an appropriate means to gather and report child outcomes in programs   That appeal was ignored  and the Administration proceeded with an assessment  without sufficient authorization or oversight from Congress  that was later proven flawed and inconsistent with professional standards for testing and measurement   This legislation requires that the assessments used in Head Start must be held to the highest standard   Head Starts measures must be valid and reliable  fair to children from all backgrounds  balanced in what they assess  and sufficient to reflect the development of the whole child   Weve called on the National Academy of Sciences to survey and study the state of assessments and outcomes appropriate for young children in environments like Head Start   Their study will be of great value as we consider how best to move forward in Head Start and other early childhood settings    Finally  the bill maintains the essential federal to local structure of Head Start  and rejects other proposals that would dilute this important focus   Head Starts design enables it to tailor its services to meet local community needs   Head Starts regulations guarantee a universal standard of quality across all programs   Yet each program is unique and specifically adapted to its children and families   The focus on local neighborhoods and their children must always be at the heart of Head Start               One of our highest priorities in Congress is to expand educational opportunities for every American  In this age of globalization  every citizen deserves a chance to acquire the educational skills needed to compete in the modern economy   This process starts early  it begins at birth and continues throughout the early years  long before children enter kindergarten     The Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 will keep Head Start on its successful path  and enable this vital program to continue to thrive and improve   I look forward to swift passage of this legislation in the Senate  and a productive Conference with the House on the important reforms in this bill     Head Start for School Readiness ActKey Policy HighlightsExpanded Access     Expands eligibility to Head Start programs for additional low income children and
