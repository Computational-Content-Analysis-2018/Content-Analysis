         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     This is welcome news for the city of Taunton and its residents  As Mayor Nunes and the Taunton first responders continue to work to keep people out of harm s way and prevent the Whittendon dam from collapsing  this declaration will bring needed relief    In the days ahead  I will continue to work with the Governor and Congressional delegation to ensure that those impacted by the floods get the relief they need  We must upgrade this declaration from covering public expenses to a full disaster declaration so that homeowners and businesses can get needed financial assistance too  We must also work to ensure the declaration includes all impacted communities across the state  including cities such as Brockton  Springfield  Worcester and Greenfield that have already spent millions dollars to protect citizens and begin recovery efforts    I m optimistic that the White House will approve this request and recognize the need of Massachusetts residents   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
