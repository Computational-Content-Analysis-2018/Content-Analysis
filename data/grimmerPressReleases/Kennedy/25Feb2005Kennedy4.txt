         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The revelations about hidden conflicts of interest among members of the committee that reviewed Vioxx  Celebrex  and Bextra emphasizes the need to restore public confidence in the FDA and its ability to protect the public health and safety of the American people  One step is to help restore that confidence is a great deal more transparency about how and why FDA makes the decisions it does  Minimizing conflicts of interest and full and complete disclosure of conflicts on public advisory committees is just one part of the more transparent FDA that the American people need and deserve  I look forward to working with the Administration to put reforms in place that achieve the best possible protections for the American people   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
