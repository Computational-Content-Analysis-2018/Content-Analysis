         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I am glad the Secretary is looking for ways to implement NCLB in a common sense manner  while not sacrificing the core principles of the law  Our schools need a partner in the Department of Education and an effective roadmap to carry out these reforms    It is important that all states succeed in implementing NCLB  Rather than rewarding some states and punishing others  however  I hope that the Department will set consistent rules and rigorously enforce all requirements of the law in every state so that children in every state can benefit from its reforms    No student or group of students should be sacrificed in the name of flexibility  I commend the Department of Education for recognizing the unique needs of disabled students  but I hope that any new policies ensure that the rights of children with disabilities are protected    Parents  teachers and children also need the resources promised under the Act    highly qualified teachers  small classes  and extra help for students who need it  The Administration should work with Congress to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
