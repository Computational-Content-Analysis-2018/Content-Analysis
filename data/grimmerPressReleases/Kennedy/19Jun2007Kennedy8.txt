         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Because of the war in Iraq  more than two million Iraqis have been internally displaced in their own country  and two million other Iraqis are in neighboring countries throughout the region  primarily Jordan and Syria  The United States has allowed less than 500 Iraqi refugees into the country since the conflict began  only 63 have been admitted this year  The Judiciary Committee highlighted the urgency of this issue in January  Assistant Secretary Sauerbrey has said the U S  Will accept 25 000 Iraqi refugees this year  but our current system of refugee processing is not working well enough or fast enough Today  on the eve of World Refugee Day  Senators Kennedy  Smith  Biden  Hagel  Leahy  Levin and Lieberman  introduced a plan to develop a comprehensive and effective approach to meet the rapidly growing needs of Iraqs refugees and internationally displaced persons  especially those who are associated with the United States  The bill would create a special category of applicants for refugee status for those who have helped the United States and expand the current special immigrant program for translators and interpreters to include others who have supported the American effort in Iraq  The bill would also allow Iraqis denied asylum after March 2003 based on changed conditions to file a new petition with an immigration judge to reopen their cases  America has a special obligation to keep faith with the Iraqis who now have a bulls eye on their back because of their association with our government  Senator Kennedy said  At our hearing in January  chilling testimony was presented about the dangers Iraqis face because of their association with America  Clearly  we cannot resettle all of Iraqs refugees in the United States  but we have a fundamental responsibility to help the vast number of Iraqis displaced in Iraq and throughout the region by the war and the associated chaos  especially those who have supported Americas efforts in Iraq  America has a fundamental responsibility to aid the courageous Iraqis who risked their lives to help our efforts in Iraq  Senator Smith said  It is only right that we work to find a way to meet the needs of the countless individuals whose assistance to our nation has left them in great peril within their own country  This legislation is a step in that direction The Iraqi refugee situation is dire  and we owe it to our Iraqi friends  many of whom have risked their lives to help us  to help them  said Senator Joe Biden  Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  This legislation does just that  but the only long term solution to Iraqs refugee problem will occur when people feel safe enough to return to their homes  That requires a comprehensive and sustainable political settlement in Iraq  I urge the Bush Administration to lead a concerted international effort to produce such a settlement based on Iraq s communities exercising control over the fabric of their daily lives at the local level  The longer the Bush Administration waits to lead such an effort  the worse the refugee crisis will become America has always led the world in helping refugees find a new life  Our legislation will help the Administration resettle thousands of Iraqis who are the most in need  and have risked their lives to help the United States  Hagel said  We have a responsibility to help Iraqi refugees who have put their lives in danger helping the United States  said Levin  I am hopeful that this comprehensive reform plan will help to ensure that they are not punished for the bureaucratic backlogs of our immigration judicial system  I am pleased to join this effort to provide some hope to those who have risked their lives assisting the United States in Iraq  Senator Leahy said  Showing loyalty to those who have been loyal to us is the honorable thing to do  and its the right thing to do The United States has a profound moral responsibility not to abandon the people of Iraq  Senator Lieberman said  Just as our brave soldiers are fighting in Baghdad today to ensure that all Iraqis have a country safe from terrorist barbarism  the rest of our government must mobilize to help the Iraqis who have been displaced by the violence The Democrats sponsoring this bill are chairs of the Foreign Relations  Armed Services  Judiciary  and Homeland Security  Senator Kennedy is the Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration  Border Security and Refugees   FACT SHEET ON IRAQI REFUGEESThe NumbersNumber of Iraqi

the United States military and embassy  Under Secretary of State Paula Dobriansky May 2007The people that Im most worried about in the near term are the people whove worked for and with us who might

ACTCreate a P 2 Category For Refugees of Special Humanitarian Concern  The legislation would create a special category of applicants for refugee status  Those eligible for this program would be Iraqis that are most closely associated with the United States  Iraqis who qualify would be those who  1  have been employed by or worked directly with the United States government in Iraq   2  were employed in Iraq by a media or nongovernmental organization based in the United States or were employed by an organization or entity that has received a grant from  or entered into a cooperative agreement or contract with the United States Government  3  are spouses  children  sons  daughters  siblings and parents of those who worked for with us as outlined in  1  and  2   or  4  Iraqis who are members of religious or minority communities and have close family members in the U S  All applicants would need to demonstrate a well founded fear of persecution  Slots for P2s would come out of the existing overall authorized annual admissions number  established at 70 0000 for fiscal year 2007   which is determined every year by the President in consultation with the Congress  Those eligible would not have to be referred by UNHCR or a U S  Embassy  They would be required to go through recently approved extensive security screening  Create a Special Immigrant Visa  In addition to a new category of refugee applications  the legislation would create a special immigrant visa program for Iraqis that have been employed by or worked directly with the United States for one year in the aggregate since 2003  Applicants would not need to demonstrate a well founded fear of persecution  but would need to meet security requirements  demonstrate that they provided faithful service to our government  and provide a recommendation or evaluation  The Secretary of State would be required to provide applicants with protection or immediate removal from Iraq if these applicants are in immediate danger  This program complements the existing program for Iraqi translators and interpreters  and would cover individuals in other professions who worked directly with the U S  Government  5 000 visas would be available yearly for five years  Require Processing in Iraq and In The Region  The Secretary of State would be required to establish a program for processing P 2 refugees and SIV applicants in Iraq and in countries in the region  The Secretary would be required to report to the Congress within 60 days on plans to establish this program  Currently  there is no mechanism for applying for refugee status in Iraq  Those fleeing persecution and seeking refugee status must find their way to Jordan or Syria  locate an official from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  and then be referred back to the United States Government by the United Nations  The bill does not eliminate the referral system through the United Nations  or any other existing system  but it does create a new mechanism for direct applications in country  Create Special Coordinators for Iraqi Refugees  The Secretary of State would be required to establish in the Embassy in Baghdad a Minister Counselor for refugees and Internally Displaced Persons  He or she would be responsible for overseeing the in country processing of P 2 refugee and special immigrant visa applicants and would have authority to refer people directly to the U S  refugee resettlement program  A parallel position would be created in the American embassies in Egypt  Jordan  Lebanon  and Syria to oversee the application process of P2 refugees of special humanitarian concern  SIV applicants would work through regular consular channels in Embassies in those countries  Resettlement and Host Nation Support  Recognizing that the U S  can only resettle a small number of the most vulnerable refugees within our borders  the Secretary of State would be required to consult with other countries about resettlement of refugee populations and to develop mechanisms in and provide assistance to countries with a significant population of displaced Iraqis to ensure the refugees well being and safety   Asylum  Allows Iraqis who were denied asylum after March  2003 based on changed conditions  i e  Saddam Hussein is gone and we are building democracy in Iraq  to file a new petition with an immigration judge to reopen his or her case  Reports  After 90 days  the President would be required to submit a report  unclassified with classified annex  to Congress with an assessment of the financial  security  and personnel considerations and resources necessary to establish the programs required in the Act  After 90 days  the Secretary of Homeland Security would be required to submit a report to the Congress outlining plans to expedite processing of Iraqi refugees  including a temporary expansion of the Refugee Corps  and plans to enhance existing systems for conducting background and security checks for Iraqis applying through the program   Endorsements of Iraqi Refugee BillThe International Rescue Committee has long advocated for a comprehensive U S  response to the Iraqi refugee crisis that addresses the essential components of humanitarian assistance  protection in the region  and the admission to the U S  of vulnerable Iraqis  Your legislation takes such a comprehensive approach  International Rescue CommitteeWe applaud your bold effort to provide a comprehensive framework to meet the growing needs of Iraqs two million internally displaced and the two million refugees in the regionYour legislation is a greatly needed effort to address this crisis and ensure that the United States takes the lead in accepting responsibility for providing safety and security for greater numbers of Iraqi refugees and IDPs  Refugees InternationalAlthough aware of this crisis  the United States has thus far failed to take the meaningful steps necessary to provide protection to these refugees and internally displaced persons  Your legislation is a welcome step in addressing the pressing protection needs of IraqisYour legislation commits the U S  government to provide support and protection to Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons in the region  In doing so it recognizes our nations longstanding tradition of extending protection to people who are targeted because of their political opinions  ethnicity  or religion  among other reasons  As a result  we stand in support of this important effort  Refugee Council USA on behalf of Amnesty International USA  Arab American and Chaldean Council  Chaldean Federation of America  Church World Service Immigration and Refugee Program  Episcopal Migration Ministries  Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society  HIAS   Human Rights First  International Rescue Committee  Jesuit Refugee Service USA  Womens Commission for Refugee Women and Children  World ReliefThe bill directly addresses several of these glaring inadequacies in our countrys current approach to the Iraqi refugee crisis  Taking particular note of the United States obligation to those who worked with and are therefore endangered by their association with U S  based organizations and institutions it significantly expands the numbers of Iraqis to be resettled in the United States and creates direct  efficient mechanisms for Iraqis to petition for resettlement  It expands and streamlines the Special Immigrant visa program for Iraqi and Afghan translators and interpreters  and creates a new P2 visa category for Iraqi refugees of special humanitarian concern  a category that includes Iraqi writers  journalists  and media workers who worked with and for U S  based media organizations in Iraq  Perhaps most significantly  it requires the United States to establish direct visa processing outside the UNCHR system in neighboring countries  and for the first time  inside Iraq  We strongly support these proposals  PEN American Center     Laura Capps  202
