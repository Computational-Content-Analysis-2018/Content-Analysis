         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C  Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement following President Bush s remarks this morning at Quantico    The President argues that we need to take the fight to the enemy in Baghdad so we do not have to fight them here at home  But the President cannot escape responsibility for the fact that this decision to go to war in Iraq has made it even more likely    not less likely    that we will fight the terrorists in America  As CIA Director Porter Goss said in February  The Iraq conflict  while not a cause of extremism  has become a cause for extremists Islamic extremists are exploiting the Iraqi conflict to recruit new anti U S  jihadists     Radical Islamic terrorists have never lost their resolve to strike our homeland again  Yet  nearly four years after the 9 11 tragedy  and three years after the war in Iraq  our ports  chemical and nuclear plants  and transportation system remain extremely vulnerable to terrorist attacks  Our fire fighters and police still lack proper equipment  We are grossly unprepared to respond to a bioterrorist attack  Nuclear materials are still unsecured in many parts of the world     Much of this could have been avoided had the President stayed focused on the real war on terrorism    the war against Al Qaeda    and put urgently needed funds into homeland security  rather than rushing headlong into a misguided war in Iraq    Today the president s report on the war in Iraq is due to Congress  The report  requested by Senators Kennedy  Durbin  and Levin  became law as part of the recent Iraq Supplemental  It holds the Administration accountable for making sure that the American people  and our soldiers    know the real progress of training Iraqis and our ability to transfer responsibility for security over to Iraqis  The measure requires the Secretary of Defense to provide Congress with an updated assessment of the number of troops we will need in Iraq through the end of 2006 and report every three months on Iraqi security forces  The first report was to be provided today    60 days after the President signed the bill into law    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
