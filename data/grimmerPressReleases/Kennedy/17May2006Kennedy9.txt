         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the 33 66 defeat of the Vitter AmendmentOnce again  the Senate stood up in support of comprehensive reform and overwhelmingly defeated an effort to derail our bipartisan bill  No credible or realistic immigration reform measure would ignore the 12 million undocumented people living in this country  House Republicans took one tactic  by branding them all felons and calling for their deportation  The bipartisan Senate compromise bill takes a more reasonable approach by offering a tough but fair path to earned citizenship  A comprehensive strategy is the only way we can gain control of our borders and I applaud my colleagues for their commitment to this bipartisan solution   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
