         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington DC  Tonight the Senate passed the Kennedy    Collins Amendment to ensure that the Department of Defense maintains the workforce that it needs to stay globally competitive and invests in crucial research and development efforts  The measure includes  10 million to double the Committee s funding for the Department s current SMART Scholars program  which is essentially an ROTC program for the agency s civilian scientists  This represents a  17 8 million increase over the  2 5 million funding level provided last year    the program s first year in existence  It increases by  30 million the Department s funding of basic research in science and technology  to ensure that its investment in this field is maintained and our military technology remains the best in the world    Below is a fact sheet on the measure and a statement by Senator Kennedy    Kennedy Collins SMART Amendment Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act   The Kennedy Collins SMART amendment s goal is to ensure that our national defense agency remains globally competitive by building the corps of civilian scientists and engineers at the Department of Defense and increasing funding for research and development efforts that help create new science to make our military the best in the world  The amendment doubles the Committee reported funding level    10 million  for the existing Department of Defense SMART Scholars program and increases funding for basic research by  30 million     SMART SCHOLARS PROGRAM    Need for Increased Funding for the

employees is projected to rise by 10 percent by 2010   Source  Bureau of Labor Statistics  2001    The Existing SMART Program   The Defense Department Has a Small Scale Civilian Scientist Recruitment Program  Modeled on a successful National Security Agency scholarship program  sponsored by Senator Roberts  the Department of Defense last year began a SMART scholars program that provides full cost of education scholarships to highly talented undergraduate and graduate students in science and engineering who are willing to commit to civilian Defense Department work after graduation    The Defense Department SMART Scholarship Program Began Last Year and had Sufficient Funding for Only Approximately One in Five Qualified Applicants  The SMART Scholars program only served 35 students last year  In its first year and with only four weeks notice before the submission deadline  SMART attracted over 160 applications last year  Approximately 100 applications were highly rated    The Senate Reported Fiscal Year 2006 DoD Bill Funds 50 SMART Scholars    Half the Number of Highly Rated Applications From 2005  Defense officials estimate that approximately 50 SMART Scholars will be supported at the Senate Committee Reported bill level of  10 3 million    a marked increase over Fiscal Year 2005 funding  but still a level that DoD believes falls short of agency need and anticipated growth in student demand as more prospective applicants become aware of the SMART program in its second year     The Kennedy Collins Amendment   Doubles the Senate Committee Reported Funding Level for the DoD SMART Scholars Program to  20 Million in Fiscal Year 2006    Still Only One Third of Defense Department Officials Requested Level  Provides sufficient funding for full cost of college scholarships and graduate fellowships to approximately 100 star science  technology  engineering and math undergraduate and graduate students  Students will receive funding for their full cost of attendance

Research Matters  Investments by DOD in science and technology through the 1980s helped the US win the Cold War  DOD sponsored research resulted in new nuclear technologies  spy satellites  precision guided munitions  stealth materials and advanced radar  It also generated technology that served the civilian economy such as microelectronics  global positioning satellites  supercomputing  the Internet  composite materials and magnetic resonance imaging     Funding for basic research in the physical sciences  math and engineering has not kept pace with research in other areas  Federal funding for life sciences has increased four fold since the 1980s  Over the same period  appropriations for the physical sciences  engineering  and mathematics have remained essentially flat  Funding for basic research fell from FY1993 to FY2004 by more than 10  in real terms   Source  National Research Council   Between 1980 and 2005  DOD s focus on basic research fell from 20  of total ST funds to less than 12    Source  Council on Competitiveness      The defense mission has always pushed the envelope of technology  but particularly those that rely on advances in the physical sciences  math and engineering  Over the last 50 years  the most dramatic increases in research have been in the life sciences   with a fourfold increase in federal funding for life sciences research  But  the growth in the physical sciences and engineering has been virtually static in inflation adjusted dollars  This has created a tremendous skew in the nation s research portfolio with worrying implications for future advances in defense   The lack of attention to basic research at DoD spills over into the workforce  Because graduate students tend to follow the research dollars  there have been steady declines in the number of students pursuing degrees in the physical sciences and engineering     Current Funding for Science and Technology Research    Defense Science Board  DSB  has recommended that funding for Science and Technology  ST  reach 3  of total Defense spending  The Administration and Congress have adopted this goal in the past  They also recommend that 20  of that amount be dedicated to basic research  The Administration s budget authorizes  10 5 billion for ST research  which is approximately  2 billion short of the 3  goal and a  2 5 billion cut compared to last year  The proposed funding level for basic research is  1 318 billion  which is  1 2 billion short of the 20  goal   195 million cut compared to last year     The President s FY06 budget cuts ST funding by 20  from last year s appropriated level  and 20  from last year s president s request  Funds for basic research are cut by 12      Kennedy Collins Amendment    Increases funding for research  development  test and evaluation in the Science and Technology areas through university research initiatives  Increases are directed to the Army  Navy  Air Force  National Defense Education Program and the DARPA University Research Program in Computer Science and Cybersecurity     Includes a sense of the senate that the Department of Defense set a goal to invest 15  of its science and technology budget in basic research programs     Statement on Amendment to Increase Department of Defense Sponsored Math and Science Research Senator Edward M  Kennedy October 5  2005    as prepared for delivery    Our military is first in the world  because of the quality and training of our personnel and because of the technological sophistication of our equipment and weaponry  A large portion of the best civilian scientific minds in the Defense Department are nearing retirement age    I rise to thank my colleagues for their support and passage of the amendment Senator Collins and I offered to ensure that the Department maintains the workforce that it needs to stay globally competitive and invests in crucial research and development efforts    Our amendment includes  10 million to double the Committee s funding for the Department s current SMART Scholars program  which is essentially an ROTC program for the agency s civilian scientists  This represents a  17 8 million increase over the  2 5 million funding level provided last year    the program s first year in existence     It increases by  30 million the Department s funding of basic research in science and technology  to ensure that its investment in this field is maintained and our military technology remains the best in the world    Our amendment provides sufficient funding for the full cost of college scholarships and graduate fellowships for approximately 100 science  technology  engineering  and math students  It increases basic research in the Army  Navy  Air Force  DARPA  and National Defense Education Program  It is supported by more than 60 of the most prestigious institutions of higher education in America    Defense Department sponsored research has resulted in stunningly sophisticated spy satellites  precision guided munitions  stealth equipment  and advanced radar  The research has also generated new applications in the civilian economy  The best known example is the Internet  originally a DARPA project    Advances in military technology often have their source in the work of civilian scientists in Department of Defense laboratories  Unfortunately  a large percentage of these scientists are nearing retirement  Today  nearly one in three DoD civilian science  technical  engineering  and mathematical employees is eligible to retire  In seven years  70 percent will be of retirement age     Another distressing fact is that the number of new scientists being produced by our major universities at the doctoral level each year has declined by four percent over the last decade  Many of those who do graduate are ineligible to work on sensitive defense matters  since more than a third of all science and engineering doctorate degrees awarded at American universities go to foreign students     It s unlikely that retiring DoD scientists will be replaced by current private industry employees  According to the National Defense Industrial Association  over 5 000 science and engineering positions are unfilled in private industry in defense related fields     The nation confronts a major math and science challenge in elementary and secondary education and in higher education as well  We are tied with Latvia for 28th in the industrialized world today in math education  and that s far from good enough  We ve fallen from 3rd in the world to 15th in producing scientists and engineers  Clearly  we need a new National Defense Education Act of the size and scope passed nearly 50 years ago     At the very least  however  the legislation before us needs to do more to maintain our military s technological advantage  Last year  over 100 highly rated SMART Scholar applications were turned down because of insufficient funding  Our amendment has sufficient funds to support every one of those talented young people who want to learn and serve    It also increases the investment in basic research in science and technology  Investments by DOD in science and technology through the 1980s helped the United States win the Cold War  But funding for basic research in the physical sciences  math and engineering has not kept pace with research in other areas  Federal funding for life sciences has risen four fold since the 1980s  Over the same period  appropriations for the physical sciences  engineering  and mathematics have remained essentially flat  Funding for basic research fell from FY1993 to FY2004 by more than 10  in real terms     The Defense Science Board has recommended that funding for Science and Technology reach 3  of total defense spending  and the Administration and Congress have adopted this goal in the past  The Board also recommended that 20  of that amount be dedicated to basic research  We must do better  and our amendment makes progress on this issue     I thank my colleagues for recognizing the importance of this amendment and for their support in its passage  I hope that we will continue to see similar increases in these programs in the future   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
