         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633    I commend Senator Reid for offering this amendment to deal with avian flu  and I strongly support it     The last thing the country needs now is a major health crisis  but the warning signs are there  and we need to be prepared  The avian flu virus now spreading in Southeast Asia is highly lethal  Unlike typical flu  it kills half the people infected  In the past week  Indonesia has confirmed that at least ten adults and children have died from the virus     In this era of globalization  infectious diseases in any part of the world can quickly spread across geographical borders  What s plaguing Southeast Asia today  could easily threaten the lives of Americans tomorrow  and we are far from well prepared  In fact  many experts feel we re no better prepared for avian flu than we were for Hurricane Katrina  With no formal response plan  weak public health infrastructure  limited hospital capacity and low supplies of vaccine and antiviral drugs  the health of the nation is obviously at risk     Experts estimate that if the current strain of avian flu mutates to a form that can more easily spread from human to human  millions of people will be sick and millions more will die because we were caught unprepared to protect them     We should have had a national flu plan in place years ago  Not only would it help us now with avian flu  but it would have helped us efficiently distribute vaccine during the shortage last year and get drugs to those in need after the recent hurricanes    Avian flu originated in birds  but has infected humans again and again in recent years  and it s only a question of time before a highly contagious version strikes us  It is time for Congress and the Administration to apply the lessons of Katrina to biological threats too     We particularly need to strengthen our avian flu surveillance capability  The majority of the outbreaks have occurred in Southeast Asia  but we have only a limited ability to track the virus there  We need stronger cooperation with other governments  and with the World Health Organization  to develop a coordinated and effective surveillance strategy    We also need to address the links between human health and veterinary health  Here  the Department of Agriculture should have a vital role in assessing these problems and developing solutions    If there is an avian flu outbreak  we will need an ample supply of vaccine and Tamiflu  the only antiviral drug regarded as effective  Japan has enough Tamiflu to treat 50  of its population and Western Europe has enough to treat 25   But the Department of Health and Human Services has stockpiled only enough medication to treat 2  of the population     In last year s flu vaccine shortage  public health officials were unable to distribute life saving vaccine efficiently to the people most at risk of dying from the virus  We couldn t even get diabetes medication to the people of the Gulf Coast after the hurricanes  We don t know when an avian flu pandemic may hit  but now is the time to prepare for this growing threat  not to ignore it     There are many uncertainties with flu  but one of the certainties is that our public health infrastructure needs help now  Yet  year after year  we reduce funds for state and local preparedness and diminish our ability to respond     Again  I commend Senator Reid for taking this action to prepare the nation for the impending threat of avian flu  and I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment for  3 9 billion and put us on the right track before we re caught unprepared again    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
