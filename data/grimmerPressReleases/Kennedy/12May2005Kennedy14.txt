         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I urge my colleagues to oppose Mr  Pryor s nomination  Contrary to the widespread impression of a partisan breakdown in the judicial nominations process  Democrats in this closely divided Senate have sought to cooperate with the President on the issues  And we ve largely succeeded  We ve confirmed 208 of President Bush s 218 nominees in the past four years  95  of the nominees have been confirmed     Only 10 nominees did not receive the broad bi partisan support needed for confirmation  because their records showed they would roll back basic rights and protections     Mr  Pryor s nomination illustrates the problems  His views are at the extreme right end of legal thinking  It s clear from his record that he doesn t deserve confirmation to a lifetime seat on an appellate court that often has the last word on vital issues for the millions of people who live in Alabama  Georgia  and Florida  the states that comprise the Eleventh Circuit    Mr  Pryor is no true conservative  He has sought to advance a radical agenda contrary to much of the Supreme Court s jurisprudence over the last forty years  and at odds with important precedents that have made our country more inclusive and fair over the past forty years    Mr  Pryor has fought aggressively to undermine the power of Congress to protect civil and individual rights  He s tried to cut back on the Family and Medical Leave Act  the Americans with Disabilities Act  and the Clean Water Act  He s been contemptuously dismissive of claims of racial bias in the application of the death penalty  and has relentlessly advocated the use of the death penalty  even for persons with mental retardation  Mr  Pryor has even ridiculed the current Supreme Court justices  calling them nine octogenarian lawyers who happen to sit on the Supreme Court  He even has his facts wrong  Only two of the nine justices are 80 years old or older    In addition to these serious substantive concerns his nomination was rushed through the Committee in violation of Committee rules  before the Committee could complete its investigation of major ethical questions raised by the nominee s own testimony at his hearing and by his answers and non answers to the committee s follow up questions  When these serious problems in Mr  Pryor s record prevented him from receiving the Senate support needed for his confirmation  President Bush made an end run around the constitutional system of checks and balances by giving him a recess appointment during a brief Senate recess that was  in all likelihood  an unconstitutional use of the recess appointment power    In the last Congress  some members of the majority presented a version of the history of the nomination and the Committee s investigation which did not comport with the facts  That history is important  because it shows that Democrats have in fact acted expeditiously and responsibly  and that the rush to judgment in the committee in the last Congress was clearly an effort to cut off a needed further investigation     As the extraordinary roll call vote in the Committee on July 23  2003 shows  every member of the minority voted  no  under protest for the violation of Rule IV     Democrats did not invent the issue that provoked such an unprecedented protest  Years before Mr  Pryor s nomination  lengthy articles in Texas and D C  newspapers raised the question of the propriety of the activities of the Republican Attorneys General Association    It was reported that the organization sought campaign contributions to support the election of Republican attorneys general  by arguing they would be less aggressive than Democratic attorneys general in challenging business interests for violations of the law  Some descriptions of this effort characterized it as a shakedown scheme  The leaders of the Association denied the allegations  but refused to disclose its contributors  They were able to maintain their secrecy by funneling the contributions through an account at the Republican National Committee that aggregated various kinds of state campaign contributions  and avoided separate public reporting of the contributions or the amount of their gifts     The issue received significant press coverage during the 2002 Senate campaign in Texas  especially after several Republican attorneys general denounced the Association as fraught with ethical problems    Because Mr  Pryor had been identified publicly as a leader of the Association s efforts  and the ethical issues raised by it were obviously relevant to his qualifications  he was asked about the issue at his nomination hearing and in written follow up questions  His responses avoided the issue and raised more questions than they answered    In July 2003  the Committee began a bi partisan investigation of the matter  in accordance with an investigative plan provided to the majority  Contrary to some of the assertions made during previous Committee meetings  no witnesses were ever questioned under oath as a part of the investigation  and in fact  the investigation was cut short by the Committee majority almost as soon as it began  The Republican investigator actually instructed interviewees that they did not have to answer questions from the minority investigator  or comply with document requests from the minority    As a result  all of the Committee Democrats  having considered the information available up to that point  wrote to the Chairman and informed him that the investigation was producing serious and disturbing information  that it would require substantial additional time  that his investigators were interfering with it  and that after it was complete  the minority members would want to question the nominee under oath    The Republican staff had offered informal staff interviews with the nominee before that time  but the Democratic investigators had  as any serious investigator would  declined that offer until the basic investigative work had been done  In any event  the Democratic members wanted to question the nominee in person under oath at the appropriate time    At the Committee meeting to consider the issue  the Chairman rejected the minority s unanimous request out of hand  He insisted on a vote on the nomination without completion of the investigation and without further questioning of the nominee under oath  That was the situation when Senator Leahy invoked the Committee s Rule IV to prevent a premature vote on the nomination  Under rule IV  the party line vote was 10 9     The fact that no minority member was among the ten should have prevented an immediate vote on the nomination and allowed the investigation to continue  But the Chairman refused to follow Rule IV and insisted on an immediate vote     The nine Democrats on the Committee all voted against reporting the nomination  each noting an objection to the violation of Rule IV  The ten Republicans voted to report it  with one Republican stating that his vote to report it did not mean he would necessarily vote for the nominee on the floor  He also stated that he would want to review the results of the investigation with the nominee before any Senate vote    Despite the lack of co operation from the majority staff  the minority staff attempted to obtain further information  and did develop new information which expanded both the scope and the gravity of our original concerns  However  in the face of the majority s refusal to cooperate  a further investigation involving witnesses was impossible     I mention this to make clear that the matters raised by this investigation are very serious  and we should not sweep these questions under the rug  We are not doing our job as a Committee if we look the other way in the face of these serious ethical questions  The Committee should have completed the investigation in 2003  reviewed its findings  heard from the nominee under oath  and then decided whether he should be listed for debate and consideration  The majority s recent offer of a few phone calls to witnesses whose telephone interviews were not completed or who could not be found in 2003  was appreciated  but was  as was obvious from the first call  too little and too late  The well of evidence had been poisoned by the majority investigator s negative statements to witnesses in 2003  and now it would take an even more concerted inquiry to elicit the full story from witnesses who were adverse to begin with  Nevertheless  because some day that story will probably come out  this aspect of the nomination remains a ticking ethical time bomb    The rush to judgment on this nomination is particularly troubling  given the serious substantive problems in Mr  Pryor s record  His supporters say that his views have gained acceptance by the courts  and that his legal positions are well within the legal mainstream  but many disagree  Mr  Pryor has consistently advocated views to narrow individual rights far beyond what any court in this land has been willing to hold    The Supreme Court rejected his argument that States could not be sued for money damages for violating the Family and Medical Leave Act  Had Mr  Pryor prevailed  it would have been far more difficult to protect workers who need time off because of their own health problems or to care for a loved one     The Supreme Court also rejected Mr  Pryor s sweeping argument that Congress lacked authority to pass the Clean Water Act s protections for wetlands that are home to migratory birds     The Court rejected his argument that states should be able to criminalize private sexual conduct between consenting adults  It rejected his far reaching argument that counties should have the same immunity from lawsuits that states have  It rejected his argument that the right to counsel does not apply to defendants with suspended sentences of imprisonment  It rejected his argument that it was constitutional for Alabama prison guards to handcuff prisoners to hitching posts for hours in the summer heat    Mr  Pryor s opposition to the rights of the disabled is particularly disturbing  In one case  in an opinion by Justice Scalia  the Supreme Court unanimously rejected his argument that the Americans with Disabilities Act doesn t apply to state prisons    In another case  the Supreme Court rejected his view that section II of the ADA on state and local programs and services is unconstitutional  A plaintiff who used a wheelchair challenged the denial of access to a public courthouse  He had refused to crawl up the courthouse stairs to reach the public courtroom  In his brief in the case  Mr  Pryor argued that Congress had no power to require states to make public facilities accessible to the disabled  He argued that denying access to the courthouses doesn t violate the principle of equal protection  because the disabled have no absolute right to attend legal proceedings affecting their rights    In arguing that the legislative history did not show a need for them to act  Mr  Pryor dismissed Congressional findings of discrimination against the disabled  and evidence that the University of Georgia had located its office of handicapped services in an inaccessible second floor room  According to Mr  Pryor  such anecdotes provide no indication of the extent of the inaccessibility  or whether the inaccessibility lacked a rational basis and was therefore unconstitutional  Contrary to his claim  it is obvious that the wording of this legislative history clearly describes the extent of the inaccessibility  There is no rational justification for a state university to put an office serving disabled students in an inaccessible second floor location     The Supreme Court also rejected Mr  Pryor s radical view of what constitute cruel and unusual punishment in the death penalty  It rejected his argument that executing retarded persons does not offend the Eighth Amendment  The Eleventh Circuit  a court dominated by conservative  Republican appointees  later unanimously rejected Mr  Pryor s attempt to evade the Supreme Court s decision  He had tried to prevent a prisoner with an IQ of 65    who even the prosecution agreed was mentally retarded    from raising a claim that he should not be executed     The Supreme Court also rejected his attempt to limit the right to counsel for the poor  Mr  Pryor argued that the poor have no right to counsel in misdemeanor cases  even if they risk imprisonment if found guilty  He told the Court during oral argument that it is reasonable only for the State to preserve its own resources  just as a more affluent defendant would preserve its resources and not incur the cost of counsel in this kind of circumstance  The Supreme Court held that the right to counsel when the accused faces possible imprisonment is more important than Mr  Pryor s financial concerns     Again and again  his far reaching arguments like these have been rejected by the Courts  Mr  Pryor is not a nominee within the legal mainstream     He and his supporters pretend that he is only following the law  but in fact Mr  Pryor repeatedly tried to make different law  using the Alabama Attorney General s office as a political platform for his own radical agenda     We are expected to believe that despite the intensity with which he has advocated these radical legal positions and the many years he has devoted to dismantling basic rights  he will start to follow the law if he receives a lifetime appointment to the Eleventh Circuit  Repeating that mantra again and again in the face of his extreme record does not make it credible that he will do so    His many intemperate  inflammatory statements show that he lacks the temperament to serve on the federal court  He ridiculed the Supreme Court of the United States for granting a temporary stay of execution in a capital punishment case  Alabama is one of only two states in the nation that uses the electric chair as its sole method of execution  The Supreme Court granted review to determine whether the use of the electric chair was cruel and unusual punishment     For Mr  Pryor  however  the Court should not even have paused to consider the Eighth Amendment  He said the issue should not be decided by nine octogenarian lawyers who happen to sit on the Supreme Court  This doesn t reflect the thoughtfulness we seek in our federal judges     He is dismissive of concerns about fairness in capital punishment  He has stated  make no mistake about it  the death penalty moratorium movement is headed by an activist minority with little concern for what is really going on in our criminal justice system     In a 1997 statement to Congress  Mr  Pryor opposed Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act  which has been indispensable in ensuring that all Americans have the right to vote  regardless of race or ethnic background  He called this important law an affront to federalism and an expensive burden that has far outlived its usefulness     A little more than a month ago  we commemorated the fortieth anniversary of Bloody Sunday  in which Martin Luther King  Congressman John Lewis  and others were brutally attacked on a peaceful march in Mr  Pryor s home state of Alabama supporting the right to vote for all Americans regardless of race  Today we re being asked to confirm a nominee who opposes that Act based on a claim of federalism and states  rights     The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of the Section 5  but Mr  Pryor s derisive statements    criticizing both the Act and the Supreme Court itself    give no confidence that he will enforce the law s protections  There s too much at stake to risk confirming a judge who would turn back progress on protecting the right to vote    It s no surprise that this nomination is opposed by leaders of the civil rights movement  including the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth  a leader of the Birmingham movement  the Reverend C T  Vivian  and many of Dr  King s other close advisors and associates     It s clear that Mr  Pryor sees the federal courts as a place to advance his political agenda  When President Bush was elected in 2000  Mr  Pryor gave a speech praising his election as the last best hope for federalism  He ended his speech with these words    a prayer for the next administration  Please God  no more Souters     In another speech  he said he was thankful for the Bush v  Gore decision  I wanted Governor Bush to have a full appreciation of the judiciary and judicial selection so we can have no more appointments like Justice Souter    Some have argued that Mr  Pryor s record in his year as a recess appointee on the Eleventh Circuit somehow erases his long career of opposition to basic rights  The fact that Mr  Pryor has voted with other judges during the period when he was temporarily appointed to the Court says nothing about what he would do if given a life time appointment and the freedom from Senate oversight  It s no wonder that he might be cautious when he has only a temporary appointment to the court  We should not be swayed by confirmation conversions  and especially not by recess appointment conversions    My colleagues on the other side have brought up every argument they could find to save him  His record is full of examples of extreme views  and they try to rebut each one  They call Senate Democrats and citizens who question Mr  Pryor s fitness    including more than 204 local and national groups    a variety of names  and accuse us of bias    The claim that those who oppose Mr  Pryor s nomination do so because of his faith is ridiculous given his record  such a claim is unworthy of the Senate  Most of us would have had no idea what religious views are held by Pryor or other nominees if Republicans had not raised the issue     The real question is why  when there are so many qualified Republican attorneys in Alabama  the President would choose such a divisive nominee  Why pick one whose record raises so much doubt as to whether he will be fair  Why pick one who can muster only a rating of partially unqualified from the American Bar Association     At stake is the independence of our federal courts  We count on federal judges to be intelligent  to have the highest integrity  to be open minded  Mr  Pryor is free to pursue his agenda as a lawyer or an advocate  but he does not have the open mindedness and fairness needed to be a federal judge  I urge my colleagues to join in protesting any vote on this nomination  until we complete our investigation  and to oppose this nomination again if the Chairman calls for a vote    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
