prepared for delivery   When North Shore Community College was established in the 1960s  Congress had just begun to pay needed attention to workforce development and adult education  and to build the bridges for adults to make the transition to new careers and job opportunities  Congress had passed legislation to train and re train thousands of workers displaced by growing automation and technology in our industries    In the Economic Opportunity Act  part of LBJs War on Poverty  we created the first Adult Basic Education program to provide the skills needed by adults who hadn t completed high school  We recognized then    as we do now    that literacy is the cornerstone of well being and success of individuals and of society    North Shore was an early recipient of federal funds from these initiatives and others  and has been ever since  Your accomplishments since that time are all around us  You ve grown from one campus and five academic and career programs to over 90 programs in Danvers  Beverly  and Lynn  Many of them today are now geared toward the high tech jobs that drive today s economy in Northeastern Massachusetts  You serve more than 7 500 students each year  including new immigrants  older students  persons just out of high school  and members of the current workforce seeking new skills  Over the years  you ve touched the lives of more than half a million residents in Northeastern Massachusetts with your lifelong learning opportunities  It s an impressive legacy  and we re all very proud of the enormous contribution you ve made    We re here this morning because each of us believes in the importance of education and literacy  both to enlighten our lives and the lives of those around us  and to improve the well being of our community  There are many important issues of our day  but few of greater significance to the future prosperity and security of our Commonwealth than education  It truly is the engine of the American dream    Each of our citizens deserves the opportunity to learn in a good school  prepare for a good job  raise a healthy family  and become a productive member of society  More than ever  in this increasingly global age  education is the gateway to opportunity and success for both young people and adults   In a sense m its always been that way  John Adams included a specific provision that the education of the whole people was necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties when he drafted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780   Providing a quality education for every American is a national obligation  and today I commend each of you for your dedication to live up to that ideal    Literacy  as we know  is the most important key to unlock the world of knowledge and opportunity  Its a talent for a entire lifetime    for success in the early years  in high school  in college  and in careers  It enables each and every one of us to participate as active citizens in our democracy    It begins in early childhood  as young children develop their skills at home and in child care and preschool  Even before kindergarten  they awaken to the letters and sounds of the alphabet and to a love of learning  High quality early education programs provide a solid foundation for literacy for our youngest children  and we need to see that each and every child has that early benefit    In the early years  parents are a child s first and most important teacher  Weve learned that family literacy programs can bring extraordinary benefits  Parents learn about their child s language development and reading  and learn how to provide the best early literacy support for them  Programs such as Even Start provide an important benefit to both children and parents  and they deserve strong support   Once children reach public schools  we ve taken steps at the national level to improve professional development for teachers and support high quality reading instruction and interventions in the early grades    Far too many students get little support in building the vocabulary and comprehension needed to do well in middle school and high school  Here  too  we re adopting a national strategy to provide literacy coaches and individual support to students who need extra help and attention  Our goal is to see that all students are proficient readers by the time they graduate from high school    Sadly  it s an uphill battle  Studies indicate that only half the nation s students are ready for reading in college or the workplace once they graduate from high school  Six million children in American middle and high schools are reading below grade level  Three thousand students drop out of high school each day    often because they lack the literacy skills to keep up with their coursework    That s unacceptable  especially at a time when the Department of Labor tells us that nearly two thirds of all jobs created over the next decade will require a college degree  We know the consequences when students  young adults  and older citizens in the workforce don t receive the education and training they need  It s estimated that the typical high school dropout can qualify for only 12 percent of all jobs between 2000 and 2010    The shortage of basic literacy skills also imposes a heavy burden on business and universities  costing as much as  16 billion a year in remedial training and reduced productivity    Fortunately  we also know how large the benefits are when we provide the additional education  literacy  and skills training for those who need it  Those who succeed in increasing their skills through adult education benefit from a sizable increase in their salaries  Annual earnings go up by 30 percent for those who complete their GED  and 47 percent for those who go from adult education to higher education   What each of you are doing is so important to these goals   At Operation Bootstrap  youre a life raft in troubled waters for thousands of young and older adults  many whom were unable to complete their high school diploma  They receive the one on one help they need to have a second chance to improve their academic knowledge  learn new skills  increase their job readiness  and reach their goals and dreams in life  Your investment makes all the difference  helping them improve their literacy so that they can connect with their community  their workplace  and the world around them    I m commend you especially for the important effort launched earlier this year here at North Shore Community College  to build an innovative partnership to strengthen the regions economic development and growth  EdLink brings together North Shore  Middlesex  Northern Essex  Salem State  and U Mass Lowell to use business planning  health care  commercial development  literacy  and technology to respond to the economic challenges and opportunities of the region  Together  youre developing a roadmap to meet the long term economic needs of our state  and we re proud of your leadership    Youre keeping our region competitive and ahead in the global economy  and your pioneering work in linking education and employment is vital to the future of our Commonwealth  Were very proud of all the progress youve made  and I look forward to working with you in the years ahead to continue our progress in expanding literacy and educational opportunities for all who need them    Thank you very much     Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
