         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      As prepared for delivery    Earlier this week  several of our Republican colleagues came to the Senate floor and attempted to blame individual Democratic Senators for their errors in judgment about the war in Iraq     It was little more than a devious attempt to obscure the facts and take the focus off the real reason we went to war in Iraq  150 000 American troops are bogged down in a quagmire in Iraq because the Bush Administration misrepresented and distorted the intelligence to justify a war that America never should have fought     As we know all too well  Iraq was not an imminent threat  It had no nuclear weapons  It had no persuasive links to Al Qaeda  no connection to the terrorist attacks of September 11th  and no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction     But the President wrongly and repeatedly insisted that it was too dangerous to ignore the weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein  and his ties to Al Qaeda     In his march to war  President Bush exaggerated the threat to the American people  It was not subtle  It was not nuanced  It was pure  unadulterated fear mongering  based on a devious strategy to convince the American people that Saddam s ability to provide nuclear weapons to Al Qaeda justified immediate war     Administration officials suggested the threat from Iraq was imminent  and went to great lengths to convince the American people that it was    At a roundtable discussion with European journalists last month  Secretary Rumsfeld deviously insisted  I never said imminent threat    In fact  Secretary Rumsfeld told the House Armed Services Committee on September 18  2002  Some have argued that the nuclear threat from Iraq is not imminent    that Saddam is at least 5 7 years away from having nuclear weapons  I would not be so certain    In May 2003  White House spokesman Ari Fleischer was asked whether we went to war because we said WMD were a direct and imminent threat to the United States  Fleischer responded  Absolutely    What else could National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice have been suggesting  other than an imminent threat    an extremely imminent threat    when she said on September 8  2002  We don t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud    President Bush himself may not have used the word imminent  but he carefully chose strong and loaded words about the nature of the threat    words that the intelligence community never used    to persuade and prepare the nation to go to war against Iraq     In the Rose Garden on October 2  2002  as Congress was preparing to vote on authorizing the war  the President said the Iraqi regime is a threat of unique urgency     In a speech in Cincinnati on October 7  President Bush Specifically invoked the danger of nuclear devastation  Facing clear evidence of peril  we cannot wait for the final proof    the smoking gun    that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud    At an appearance in New Mexico on October 28  2002  after Congress had voted to authorize war  and a week before the election  President Bush said Iraq is a real and dangerous threat    At a NATO summit on November 20  2002  President Bush said Iraq posed a unique and urgent threat    In Fort Hood  Texas on January 3  2003  President Bush called the Iraqi regime a grave threat    Nuclear weapons  Mushroom cloud  Unique and urgent threat  Real and dangerous threat  Grave threat  These words were the Administration s rallying cry for war  But they were not the words of the intelligence community  which never suggested that the threat from Saddam was imminent  or immediate  or urgent     It was Vice President Cheney who first laid out the trumped up argument for war with Iraq to an unsuspecting public  In a speech on August 26  2002  to the Veterans of Foreign Wars  he asserted  We now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weaponsMany of us are convinced that Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon  As we now know  the intelligence community was far from certain  Yet the Vice President had been convinced     On September 8  2002  he was even more emphatic about Saddam  He said   We  do know  with absolute certainty  that he is using his procurement system to acquire the equipment he needs in order to enrich uranium to build a nuclear weapon  The intelligence community was deeply divided about the aluminum tubes  but Vice President Cheney was absolutely certain     One month later  on the eve of the watershed vote by Congress to authorize the war  President Bush said it even more vividly  He said  Iraq has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubeswhich are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons  If the Iraqi regime is able to produce  buy  or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball  it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year  And if we allow that to happen  a terrible line would be crossedSaddam Hussein would be in a position to pass nuclear technology to terrorists     In fact  as we now know  the intelligence community was far from convinced of any such threat  The Administration attempted to conceal that fact by classifying the information and the dissents within the intelligence community until after the war  even while making dramatic and excessive public statements about the immediacy of the danger     In October 2002  the intelligence agencies jointly issued a National Intelligence Estimate stating that most agencies believed that Iraq had restarted its nuclear program after inspectors left in 1998  and that  if left unchecked  Iraq probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade     The State Department s intelligence bureau  however  said the available evidence was inadequate to support that judgment  It refused to predict when Iraq could acquire a nuclear device or weapon    About the claims of purchases of nuclear material from Africa  the State Department s intelligence bureau said that claims of Iraq seeking to purchase nuclear material from Africa were highly dubious  The CIA sent two memorandums to the White House stressing strong doubts about those claims    But the following January  in 2003  the President included the claims about Africa in his State of the Union Address  and conspicuously cited the British government as the source of that intelligence     Information about nuclear weapons was not the only intelligence distorted by the Administration  On the question of whether Iraq was pursuing a chemical weapons program  the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded in September 2002 that there is no reliable information on whether Iraq is producing and stockpiling chemical weapons  or whether Iraq has    or will    establish its chemical warfare agent production facilities    That same month  however  Secretary Rumsfeld told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Saddam has chemical weapons stockpiles     He said  We do know that the Iraqi regime has chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction  that Saddam has amassed large clandestine stocks of chemical weapons  He said that he has stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons  and that Iraq has active chemical  biological and nuclear programs  He was wrong on all counts    Yet the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate actually quantified the size of the stockpiles  stating that although we have little specific information on Iraq s CW stockpile  Saddam probably has stocked at least 100 metric tons and possibly as much as 500 metric tons of CW agents    much of it added in the last year  In his address to the United Nations on February 5  2003  Secretary of State Colin Powell went further  calling the 100 to 500 metric ton stockpile a conservative estimate    Secretary Rumsfeld made an even more explicit assertion in his interview on This Week with George Stephanopoulos on March 30  2003  When asked about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction  he said  We know where they are  They re in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east  west  south and north somewhat    The Administration s case for war based on the linkage between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda was just as misguided    Significantly here as well  the Intelligence Estimate did not find a cooperative relationship between Saddam and Al Qaeda  On the contrary  it stated only that such a relationship might develop in the future if Saddam was sufficiently desperate    in other words  if America went to war  But the estimate placed low confidence that  even in desperation  Saddam would give weapons of mass destruction to Al Qaeda     A year before the war began  senior Al Qaeda leaders themselves had rejected a link with Saddam  The New York Times reported last June that a top Al Qaeda planner and recruiter captured in March 2002 told his questioners last year that the idea of working with Mr  Hussein s government had been discussed among Al Qaeda leaders  but Osama bin Laden had rejected such proposals  According to the Times  an Al Qaeda chief of operations had also told interrogators that it did not work with Saddam    Mel Goodman  a CIA analyst for 20 years  put it bluntly  Saddam Hussein and bin Laden were enemies  Bin Laden considered and said that Saddam was the socialist infidel  These were very different kinds of individuals competing for power in their own way and Saddam Hussein made very sure that Al Qaeda couldn t function in Iraq    In February 2003  investigators at the FBI told the New York Times they were baffled by the Administration s insistence on a solid link between Al Qaeda and Iraq  One investigator said  We ve been looking at this hard for more than a year and you know what  we just don t think it s there    But President Bush was not deterred  He was relentless in playing to America s fears after the devastating tragedy of 9 11  He drew a clear link    and drew it repeatedly    between Al Qaeda and Saddam     On September 25  2002  at the White House  President Bush flatly declared  You can t distinguish between Al Qaeda and Saddam when you talk about the war on terror    In his State of the Union Address in January 2003  President Bush said  Evidence from intelligence sources  secret communications  and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists  including members of Al Qaeda  and that he could provide lethal viruses to a shadowy terrorist network     Two weeks later  in his Saturday radio address to the nation  a month before the war began  President Bush described the ties in detail  saying  Saddam Hussein has longstanding  direct and continuing ties to terrorist networks     He said  Senior members of Iraqi intelligence and Al Qaeda have met at least eight times since the early 1990s  Iraq has sent bomb making and document forgery experts to work with Al Qaeda  Iraq has also provided Al Qaeda with chemical and biological weapons training  An Al Qaeda operative was sent to Iraq several times in the late 1990s for help in acquiring poisons and gases  We also know that Iraq is harboring a terrorist network headed by a senior Al Qaeda terrorist planner  This network runs a poison and explosive training camp in northeast Iraq  and many of its leaders are known to be in Baghdad    Who gave the President this information   The NIE  Scooter Libby   Chalabi    In fact  there was no operational link and no clear and persuasive pattern of ties between the Iraqi government and Al Qaeda  A 9 11 Commission Staff Statement in June of 2004  put it plainly  Two senior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that any ties existed between Al Qaeda and Iraq  We have no credible evidence that Iraq and Al Qaeda cooperated on attacks against the United States  The 9 11 Commission Report stated clearly that there was no operational connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda  That fact should have been abundantly clear to the President  Iraq and Al Qaeda had diametrically opposing views of the world     The Pentagons favorite Iraqi dissident  Ahmed Chalabi  is actually proud of what happened  We are heroes in error  Chalabi said in February 2004  As far as we re concerned  we ve been entirely successful  That tyrant Saddam is gone and the Americans are in Baghdad  What was said before is not important  The Bush Administration is looking for a scapegoat  We re ready to fall on our swords  if he wants    What was said before does matter  The President s words matter  The Vice President s words matter  So do those of the Secretary of State  the Secretary of Defense and other high officials in the Administration  And they did not square with the facts     The Intelligence Committee agreed to investigate the clear discrepancies  and it s important that they get to the bottom of this  and find out how and why President Bush took America to war in Iraq  Americans are dying  Already more than 2000 have been killed  and more than 15 000 have been wounded     The American people deserve the truth  It s time for the President to stop passing the buck and for him to be held accountable    Laura Capps
