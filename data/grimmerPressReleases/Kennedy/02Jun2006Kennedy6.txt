success   Remarks of Senator Edward M  KennedyAt the Dedication of the Tip ONeill TunnelJune 5  2006     Its a great honor to be here today to see so many friends  theres no place any of us would rather be at this moment   For a politician  theres no greater compliment than to have people say youve never forgotten where you come from  of no one in American political life was that ever more true than Tip ONeill  He never forgot   Today  Bostons getting the chance to tell Tip that well never forget  what he meant to us  or what he did for us    We know hes looking down on us today with Millie and Michael  and it fills us with great joy to acknowledge a man whose vision and determination and unwavering commitment has transformed Boston forever   Because of Tip ONeils love of this city  and his concern that we do something dramatic to retain our economic vitality  were celebrating the completion of a project that will ensure that despite the richness of our 376 year history  the best days are yet to come for this shining city on a hill              And that project could never be complete until it bears the name of the person who made it all possible   The Kennedy family loved Tip  and he shared the same Congressional seat as our grandfather Honey Fitz and later my brother Jack and nephew Joe    In Jacks first election back in 1946  Tip wasnt with him because Jack was running against his friend Mike Neville  and to Tip ONeill  friendship was a bond never to be broken   Jack won and in the coming years he and Tip forged their own strong friendship  based on their common heritage  their shared love of their fellow man  and their unfailing optimism that government should be a force for good in peoples lives              Ill always remember the story Jack loved to tell of his 1958 reelection to the Senate   He called Tip up to go over results in Cambridge and Tip told him he did well  Howd I do in Ward 1  Precinct 1  Jack asked  And Tip said  You won by 1 003 votes to 12  I won 999 votes to 16               Jack asked what happened and Tip responded  It was the Lefebvre family  theyre off me for some reason   On Inauguration Day 1961  Jack caught his friend Tip and checked in again on Ward 1  Precinct 1  Tip told him  A thousand more people voted this time  You won 2 003 to 12  and I won 1 999 to 16  And Jack said  Well I see the Lefebvres are still off you Tip   I often think of these two sons of Boston swapping stories in heaven  with Tip leading all his many friends in a glorious round of Ill Be With You in Apple Blossom Time to his beloved Millie               Tip was a leader of the deepest decency  and of limitless friendship that he shared freely and openly with all   His life and career was defined by the belief that public servants can and must do all they can to improve peoples lives  The widow struggling to provide for her children and the disabled veteran fighting to live in dignity had a friend in Tip ONeill   He was so committed to getting things done  that hed often pretend that he wasnt involved at all if it would break a logjam and get the ball rolling  I can remember time and time again where hed say Teddy  Sil Conte and I spoke  were lining it up over here  but no thanks are necessary on this one    More than any other powerful person Ive ever met  Tip had no interest in power as an end in itself  For him  it was only a tool to be used to build a stronger  fairer  more hopeful America    It wasnt always easy  His courageous decision to break with party leadership over the Vietnam War helped mark a sea change in public opinion about a war that was costing far too many lives    And at another time of turmoil in Washington  his steady hand helped keep the Watergate hearings focused  principled  and bipartisan  He was an anchor for Congress and the nation amid a sea of chaos              All politics is local  hed often say  but our Tip ONeill was a national treasure   Tip wanted the same things for all people that he wanted for his own family  educational opportunity  health care security  and the chance to get a fair shake   Even as he rose from Barrys Corner  to the State House leadership  and then to the Speakership of the U S  House of Representatives  he stayed true to those values and vigorously pursued them    Sometimes today when we survey the political landscape  were saddened to see that these bedrock principles have yielded to poll tested sound bites  This new approach may help win elections  but it has diminished the public square and left the concerns of the American people unattended   We long for the day when the spirit of Tip ONeill  his unwavering commitment to promoting the public good  once again guides our great national debates    And it is in that spirit that we continue to believe that we can build a stronger country by appealing to the very best in people  We know that approach works because we saw how Tip ONeill did it himself   So let us celebrate his great legacy today  and thank him for all hes done for us  But let us all recommit to advancing the great causes he championed and remember that our job in public life is to improve the lives of others              Congratulations Mr  Speaker on a job well done  and thank you from the bottom of our hearts   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
