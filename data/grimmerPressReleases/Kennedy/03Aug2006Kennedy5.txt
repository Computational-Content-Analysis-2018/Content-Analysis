         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Contacts       Washington  D C    U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R WY   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  along with the Committees Ranking Member  Senator Edward Kennedy  D MA   today introduced a bill to require drug makers to engage in better safety planning before a drug is approved for release to the public while improving the FDAs response to risks identified after a drug is on the market    Our bill  the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act  will raise the bar to ensure that drug safety is not an afterthought  but an integral part of the process from the very beginning  Enzi said  It requires drug makers to engage in better safety planning before a drug is approved for release to the public  and will improve both the understanding of and response to risks that arise after a drug is on the market     FDA needs better authorities and more resources to monitor and manage drug safety after drug approval  said Kennedy  and this bill gives FDA both   This bipartisan bill is designed to provide better  flexible  adaptive  and rapid safeguards to protect the millions of Americans who take prescription drugs daily  Enzi added   Enzi and Kennedy have spent months developing the proposal in hopes of restoring public confidence in the FDAs review process to weigh the benefits and risks of prescription drugs   The bill will also require disclosure of the results of clinical trials involving drugs  added Kennedy  which will help patients and their health care providers make better informed decisions about treatment   The Senators said the bill  which reflects the comments and input of dozens of stakeholders  including the FDA  patient and consumer groups  industry trade associations  individual companies  and scientific experts  will       Integrate safety issues and the approval process by requiring earlier and more focused consideration of safety issues        Establish a flexible planning mechanism to obtain the necessary safety information about each unique new drug or indication        Permit adaptation of the safety plan in response to new information  and        Bring fairness  timeliness and finality to the dispute resolution process    As Chairman of the HELP Committee  I am deeply grateful for the cooperation and support of Senator Kennedy  as well as the dozens of stakeholders  who have worked tirelessly to make this bill a reality  Enzi concluded   Other key provisions of the bill       Establishing a collaboration among the FDA  academic research institutions  and the biomedical research industry to improve the process of drug development and evaluation  and advance the FDA s Critical Path Initiative        Establishing a publicly available database of clinical trials to help enhance patient enrollment in clinical trials of drugs  provide a mechanism to track subsequent progress of trials  and ensure that the results of trials are made public  and that patients  doctors  and pharmacists have the most up to date information        Making improvements to the FDAs process of screening advisory committee members for financial conflicts of interest to ensure that these committees provide independent expert advice  and to bolster the credibility of the product review process    S  ____  The Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act of 2006  S  ____  The Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act of 2006  was introduced by Senator Mike Enzi and Senator Ted Kennedy on August 3   The bill contains four titles  drug safety  establishment of the Reagan Udall Institute for Applied Biomedical Research  clinical trials registry and results databases  and reform of conflicts of interests on FDA advisory committees  S    reflects the comments and input of dozens of stakeholders  including the Food and Drug Administration  patient and consumer groups  industry associations  individual companies  and scientific experts   Its provisions are outlined below   Drug Safety   It is not possible to know everything about a drug at the time of approval   Requiring sponsors to obtain all safety information before allowing the drug on the market would unduly delay patient access to new therapies   The bill creates a framework for better pre approval planning of how sponsors and FDA will identify  assess and manage risks post approval   The result will be both a more efficient and effective way to obtain safety information  without compromising access   FDA has post approval authorities now  but they are not always the ideal tools to do what is needed   For example  if the agency believes a labeling change is necessary  it can request that the product sponsor make the change   If the product sponsor does not agree to the change  the agency cannot order the labeling change   FDA may initiate a misbranding action in the courts  but a sponsor who disagrees about a labeling change will contest the litigation  which can take months or even years to resolve   Moreover  such enforcement actions   seizing the product  or enjoining its distribution once FDA proves misbranding in court   may have the negative consequence of removing the drug from patients hands     In most cases  the agency and the sponsor will reach agreement about how to address a safety concern  However  there is currently no clear way to reach a decision and move forward to action when there is disagreement    By creating a structured framework for resolving safety concerns  the bill solves this problem   The framework   Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy  REMS   Under the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act  FDA would begin to approve drugs and biologics  and new indications for these products with risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  REMS   The REMS is designed to be an integrated  flexible mechanism to acquire and adapt to new safety information about a drug   Sponsors would propose a REMS and FDA would approve it after structured discussions  The sponsor and FDA will assess and review the REMS at least annually for the first three years  as well as in applications for a new indication  when the sponsor suggests changes  or when FDA requests a review based on new safety information    Minimal Elements of a REMS   Every REMS would have the following elements       The drugs FDA approved professional labeling      15 day  quarterly  and annual reports of adverse events for the drug      A pharmacovigilance statement that explains and justifies whether standard adverse event reporting for the drug is adequate to assess known serious risks and to identify unexpected serious risks  or whether and what additional studies or clinical trials are needed      A timetable for periodic assessment of the REMS   Additional Elements   Based on the nature and magnitude of the safety issues with a particular drug  the drugs REMS may include one or more of the following elements  if specific criteria are met       Required distribution of a Medication Guide or patient package insert when the drug is dispensed      A communication plan to health care providers regarding elements of the REMS      Post approval registries or epidemiological studies to assess signals of serious risks or to screen for serious risks in expanded patient populations  or  when necessary  clinical trials to assess signals of serious risks       Pre clearance of advertising  specific disclosures in advertising  or a prohibition on DTC advertisements for no more than 2 years after approval when disclosures alone arent adequate to protect public health      Restrictions on distribution and use for a drug that presents a serious risk to the public health but offers significant benefit to patients   Currently  only about 30 drugs are approved with restrictions on distribution and use  what is known as a RiskMAP   and such restrictions are intended to remain an infrequent requirement under S       Timeframes   Assessment  FDA review  and discussion of a drugs REMS would take place within set timeframes       In the context of an application or supplement  FDA must begin to discuss the proposed REMS with the sponsor at least 60 days before the drug user fee action deadline to ensure time for thorough review of the REMS and to minimize the chance that dispute resolution  if invoked  would delay regulatory action      If there is new safety information about a serious risk  FDA may order the sponsor to submit an assessment of a REMS and must begin discussions within a set time period      A sponsor may submit an assessment of  and propose modifications  which may include reductions  to  a drugs REMS at any time   Dispute Resolution   When there is disagreement between FDA and the sponsor about a drugs REMS  the drugs sponsor may initiate a structured dispute resolution process   This process will bring fairness  timeliness  and finality to the response to new safety information       The process begins by the sponsor proposing a REMS or assessing whether changes to an existing REMS are needed  and can be terminated by FDA and the sponsor reaching agreement at any point before the issuance of an order      After discussions begin between FDA and the sponsor regarding the proposed REMS  the sponsor may request review by the Drug Safety Oversight Board from day 15 until day 35      Both the sponsors proposed REMS and FDAs alternative go to the next monthly meeting of the Drug Safety Oversight Board for review  or a specially scheduled meeting can be called if the dispute needs quicker resolution      The Drug Safety Oversight Board reviews both proposals and makes recommendations to the Secretary within 5 days      The FDA issues a final order within 7 days of receiving the recommendations      From the time FDA sponsor discussions begin  the dispute resolution process takes from 36 days to 89 days  depending on circumstances   Compliance and enforcement    A REMS requirement that is not working can  and should  be modified through the assessment process   Should a sponsor still fail to comply with a REMS requirement  however  FDA can enforce the requirement as follows       Non compliance with an element of a REMS would be a prohibited act       Civil money penalties could be imposed for knowing violation of any REMS component   Application to generic drugs       A generic drug would be required to meet each element of a REMS except post approval clinical trial requirements that were imposed on the drug before it lost patent protection     Resources        Drug user fees will be increased to review REMS proposals and assessments and for FDAs general drug safety surveillance    Reagan Udall Institute for Applied Biomedical Research  Title II of the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act would spur innovation by establishing a new public private partnership at the FDA to advance the Critical Path Initiative and improve the sciences of developing  manufacturing  and evaluating the safety and effectiveness of drugs  devices  biologics and diagnostics     The development of tools to evaluate medical products has not kept pace with discoveries in basic science   New tools are needed to better predict safety and efficacy  which in turn would increase the speed and efficiency of product development and evaluation  Creation of a new generation of performance standards and predictive tools will provide faster and more certain answers about the safety and effectiveness of products in development   This has enormous potential both to speed product development and increase safety   This public private partnership  known as the Reagan Udall Institute for Applied Biomedical Research  will facilitate these improvements in drug  biologic  device  and diagnostic sciences by coordinating research activities between government regulators and academic and industry researchers     Activities of the Institute         The Institute would identify and pursue research priorities to aid in the modernization of medical product development and enhancement of product safety so that research findings are quickly incorporated into regulatory regimes      The Institute would coordinate and participate in government research and development programs and award grants and establish collaborations to carry out research priorities       The Institute would broadly distribute the knowledge and intellectual property developed through this research to ensure that the fruits of the research are incorporated into the medical product development and evaluation processes      The Institute would sponsor scientific conferences or symposia to assist in the evaluation of new tools to assess the safety of therapeutic products    Governance Structure of the Institute           The Institute would be supported by Federal funds  which could be complemented by contributions from the pharmaceutical and device industries as well as from philanthropic organizations        The Institute would have a Board of Directors comprised of  o    Government officials   o    Pharmaceutical and device industry researchers  o    Academic researchers  and o    Patient and provider representatives           The Board of Directors would  o    establish by laws to carry out Institute activities   o    award contracts and peer reviewed grants  o    select an Executive Director to oversee the day to day operations of the Institute  and o    report to Congress annually on the support and operations of the Institute    Clinical Trials Registry and Clinical Trials Results Database  Clinical trials are an essential part of drug development   However  issues such as patient recruitment and timely access to information add complexity and cost to trials   The current NIH database  ClinicalTrials gov  is a listing of trials for serious and life threatening conditions  so that patients can learn more about these trials and find out how to participate   However  not all clinical trials are required to register  and information about trial results important to providers and patients  particularly negative results  may or may not be released by sponsors   A central clearinghouse for information about clinical trials and their results would help patients  providers and researchers learn new information and make more informed health care decisions     Clinical Trials Registry   Title III of the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act would establish a publicly available database at NIH to enhance patient enrollment in clinical trials of drugs for any disease or condition and provide a mechanism to track subsequent progress of trials   This database would build on ClinicalTrials gov  which would remain publicly accessible       Late Phase II  Phase III  and Phase IV clinical trials would be required to register         Information about the trial would be searchable by key data elements  and the entry would include the data set developed by the World Health Organization and accepted as the international standard   Information must be truthful  not misleading  and non promotional         The information would be submitted within 14 days of the date the first patient enrolls in the trial   Clinical Trials Results Database   Title III would also establish a database to ensure that results of trials are made public  and that patients and providers have the most up to date information       Results of all Phase III and Phase IV clinical trials would be required to be submitted to the database   There would be a process instituted to determine whether and how to require submission of the results of late Phase II trials  since these results may contain commercially sensitive information         Basic pieces of information would be placed in searchable fields in the database  while the bulk of the results information would be in two summary documents  lay and technical    Both summary documents would be publicly available   There is not yet an agreed upon set of international standards in this area  so S   specifies the data elements that must be submitted       Results would be submitted to the database one year after the trial concludes   If regulatory action or publication is pending  the results would not be publicly available until that is resolved  which would protect both commercially valuable trial results and the ability of researchers to publish their results         The submitted results must be truthful  not misleading  and non promotional       Compliance       There are a variety of tools to enforce compliance with the registry and results database requirements   o    Submission to the registry database would be a requirement for an investigational new drug exemption   o    Unless information for a trial of a drug is submitted to the both the registry and results databases  FDA would not be permitted to file an application for approval of the drug  and the application could not be reviewed  o    If a clinical trial is funded from NIH or another Federal agency  but the trial is not registered or the results are not submitted  the grant money would not be released  o    FDA and the Inspector General Office at the Department of Health and Human Services would review the content of submissions to the results database  o    Medical journals would be able to query the database to determine whether or not results had been submitted  since many journals require submission of results to a database for publication  and o    Failure to submit required information  or the submission of false  misleading or promotional information would be a prohibited act under the Federal Food  Drug  and Cosmetic Act   Effect on other laws       State clinical trial databases would be preempted  and the fact of compliance with data submission requirements could not be used as evidence of off label promotion of the drug   Conflicts of Interest and FDA Advisory Committees   Title IV of the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act would make improvements to FDAs process for screening advisory committee members for financial conflicts of interest   FDA relies upon its 30 advisory committees to provide independent expert advice  lend credibility to the product review process  and inform consumers of trends in product development   Advisory Committee recommendations are non binding on the agency  but the recommendations are usually followed     Recently  questions have been raised about conflicts of interest that panel members on FDA Advisory Committees may have because of industry funding or other financial interests   When a potential conflict is identified  FDA considers whether the persons expertise is essential and whether the need for that persons service outweighs the risks of the potential for a conflict   Based on that evaluation  FDA has the statutory authority to grant a waiver and allow that person to serve     Current FDA guidance on how to implement that authority contains inconsistent requirements that make it difficult to predict whether an individual under consideration will emerge as eligible for service  eligible only with a waiver  or recused   While the potential for a conflict should not automatically disqualify someone  a lack of transparency and predictability in how potential conflicts will be reviewed endangers the integrity of the review process   Finally  FDA faces a key challenge in identifying a sufficient number of people with the necessary expertise and a minimum of potential conflicts of interest to serve on advisory committees     Evaluation of candidates for appointment       New candidates for appointment to advisory panels would be screened by FDA with the goals of identifying qualified candidates and minimizing potential conflicts of interest           FDA would be directed to enhance public nomination of individuals for service on advisory committees in order to expand the pool of qualified candidates     Evaluation of panel members for service at a meeting       The categories of financial involvements used to evaluate a panel member for service at a panel meeting would be streamlined and clarified       FDA would be directed to define how interests imputed to an individual  such as financial interests of an employer  bear on eligibility for service on an advisory committee       FDA would be directed to standardize how individuals are evaluated for service on advisory committees across the centers of the agency   Disclosure of information       The identity of panel members recused from service or who receive a waiver for service at an advisory committee meeting would be disclosed prior to a meeting       All financial involvements of panel members at a meeting would be required to be read into the public record of advisory committee meetings   Review of past panel members       The HHS Inspector General would be directed to periodically evaluate current financial involvements of past advisory committee members to assess whether individuals are being rewarded for their past votes as members of an advisory committee     Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
