         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Secretary Rumsfeld is the wrong person to try to convince the American people that our nation is on the right track in Iraq  He has been consistently wrong about Iraq  He was wrong about Iraq s nuclear weapons program  wrong about Saddam Hussein s links to Al Qaeda  wrong about the amount of troops that would be required to keep order  wrong not to have a plan to win the peace  and wrong to claim that insurgency was a few dead enders  The best thing for Iraq s future would be for President Bush to accept Secretary Rumsfeld s resignation  Only a competent Secretary of Defense can outline a viable plan for Iraq that will enable our troops to begin to come home   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
