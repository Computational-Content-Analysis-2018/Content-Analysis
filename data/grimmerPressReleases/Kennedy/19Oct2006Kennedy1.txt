         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the recess appointment of Richard M  Stickler   This action by President Bush is an affront to the men and women who risk their lives every day in our nations mines   After so many lost their lives this year  our miners and their families deserve better than a mine safety director with a track record of looking the other way   The Administration knows that Mr  Stickler could not pass the Senate because of his poor safety record  but they chose to put the interests of the industry ahead of the safety of the miners and installed him in the job anyway    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
