         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner September 28  2006         202  224 2633     Washington  DC  Today Senator Kennedy expressed his strong opposition to the military tribunal bill and offered an amendment designed to protect Americans who are protecting our country abroad  The measure  co sponsored by Senator Feinstein  requires the State Department to notify other signatories to the Geneva Conventions that if Americans are subjected to extreme measures  such as waterboarding or induced hypothermia  we will take action through war crimes prosecutions or other means   On his amendment  Senator Kennedy said  The failure of this administration to be clear on issues of torture has weakened the protection of Americans who work or travel abroad  This amendment is a straightforward attempt to make clear that Americans around the globe must be afforded the full protections from abusive practices like waterboarding and induced hypothermia  Who here in the Senate is unwilling to demand that other nations refrain from inflicting these types of practices on Americans  This vote will tell us all we need to know about whether this Republican Congress has become a rubber stamp for this administration   The amendment lists practices that the United States has already renounced by prohibiting them in the Army Field Manual  It states that the United States considers those practices to be punishable violations of Common Article 3 if they are committed against Americans  While our troops in uniform are protected under other provisions of the Geneva conventions  America has CIA agents  special forces members who operate out of uniform  and DOD contractors who need the protection of common article 3   In opposition to the bill  Senator Kennedy said   In times of war  we have a special obligation to protect those men and women who risk their lives to defend us  This bill fails that duty  By failing to renounce abusive interrogation techniques  this bill inflames an already dangerous world  There is no question that the rush to pass this bill    which is the product of secret negotiations with the White House    is about serving a political agenda  That is no way to produce careful and thoughtful legislation on profound issues of national security   Below are Senator Kennedys opening and closing remarks during the floor debate on his amendment     OPENING FLOOR REMARKS BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON MILITARY TRIBUNALS   AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY    Mr  President  I send to the desk Amendment No  5088 and ask for its immediate consideration  I yield myself ten minutes   Mr  President  in times of war  we have a special obligation to protect those men and women who risk their lives to defend us  This bill fails that duty  By failing to renounce abusive interrogation techniques  this bill inflames an already dangerous world    But the bill in its present form poses a very specific risk to those who serve our nation without putting on a uniform  The Fourth Geneva Convention offers special protection for our men and women in uniform  But what about those who serve our nation without a uniform  What about our Navy SEALS and other Special Forces  What about our CIA personnel abroad  What about civilian contractors and aid workers    All of these brave men and women are given legal protection by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions  Unfortunately  this administration has recklessly undermined that protection by refusing to take a tough stand in defense of Common Article 3  There has long been consensus that abusive practices like waterboarding and induced hypothermia are forbidden under Common Article 3  And I agree with Senator McCain and others that they continue to be illegal under the present legislation  But this administration has failed to make that fact clear to the world    Instead  this administration has engaged in a long string of abhorrent practices that have made the world doubt the United States commitment to the Geneva Convention    There were the horrors at Abu Ghraib  in which photos depicted members of our own armed forces engaging in barbaric practices   There was the use at our base at Guantanamo techniques so harsh that the FBI and Navy Criminal Investigators objected    There was the discovery of the infamous Bybee memorandum  in which a high ranking Justice Department official went so far in justifying torture that even this administration had to eventually reject his conclusions    There was the administrations admission that they had operated secret prisons and engaged in alternative methods of obtaining information    even though our Army tells us that such methods simply do not work    Most recently  the National Security Advisor and others in the administration have refused to answer the simple question of whether the United States considers practices like waterboarding to violate the Geneva Conventions    The failure of this administration to be clear on issues of torture has weakened the protection of Americans who work or travel abroad  Our enemies may now mistakenly or cynically conclude that the United States no longer stands behind the guarantee of humane treatment set forth in Common Article 3  Such confusion imperils the millions of Americans who work or travel overseas    Mr  President  this amendment is a straightforward attempt to make clear that Americans around the globe must be afforded the full protections of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions  It would require that the State Department notify other countries of our continuing commitment to Common Article 3     The notification would remind the world of the United States long history of enforcing Common Article 3 to prohibit a wide range of cruel  inhumane  and degrading treatment of Americans  It would warn countries that we will aggressively seek to punish any person who subjects an American citizen to treatment that violates Common Article 3    Of course  such a warning must be clear  This administration has repeatedly told us that clarity is essential so that those in charge of detention and interrogation understand what can and cannot be done  That statement applies with equal force to those in other countries who detain and interrogate Americans  For that reason  the amendment is specific  and adopts the list of abusive practices set forth in the US Army Field Manual on Interrogation  That Manual was adopted by this administration  and this Senate voted 90 9 to require that all Department of Defense personnel adhere to it    Today  my amendment seeks to ensure that other nations renounce these same abusive practices  They include    forcing a detainee to be naked  perform sexual acts or pose in a sexual manner    beatings  electric shock  burns  or other forms of physical pain    waterboarding    using dogs    inducing hypothermia or heat injury    conducting mock executions    depriving the detainee of necessary food  water or medical care   I ask my colleagues  Who here is unwilling to demand that other nations refrain from inflicting these types of practices on Americans    In demanding that other nations refrain from these practices  we will be reaffirming our historic place in the world  After World War II  the United States learned that the Japanese had engaged in cruel interrogation practices that sound all to familiar today  They had forced captive Americans to endure stress positions for hours  sometimes in the nude or while exposed to severe cold  They also deprived Americans of sleep  food and medical treatment  In some cases  Japanese captors forced water into the mouths and noses of their captives to simulate drowning  a technique that we now call waterboarding    On the basis of those practices  the United States tried and convicted Japanese war criminals  who were sentenced to prison at hard labor    This kind of international leadership continued through a decade ago  when Congress enacted the War Crimes Act to authorize prosecution of individuals who violate the Geneva Conventions  Like todays amendment  the War Crimes Act was designed to authorize prosecution of individuals who abused Americans  It passed the Senate with unanimous consent    This amendment should pass by an overwhelming margin as well  It has been made necessary by an administration that has sown confusion about our commitment to the Geneva Conventions  This amendment will serve as a much needed reminder to our enemies  today and in the future  that the United States will hold them accountable for any mistreatment of Americans    In the end  I can conceive of only one reason why any Senator would vote against an amendment to protect Americans  It would be out of fear that if we reaffirm our commitment to enforcing Common Article 3  we will be expected to live up to it ourselves  That kind of thinking is enormously mistaken  It should be our great hope    not our great fear    that other nations act as we do  If we cannot live up to the principles we rightfully expect from others  then it is our conduct    and not our principles    that must change     CLOSING REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY   AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY   This vote will tell us all we need to know about whether this Republican Congress has become a rubber stamp for this administration    The proposed amendment would simply tell the world that we will not stand for the abuse of any American anywhere  Similar legislation the War Crimes Act was proposed by a Republican Congressman in 1996  and passed without opposition  Likewise  this Congress passed  90 9  legislation prohibiting our armed services from using certain practices  All the present amendment would do is tell the world that they cannot use the practices that this Senate has already renounced    I believe that if every Senator voted his or her own conscience  this measure would pass unanimously  For that reason  I believe a vote against this amendment is a vote of blind loyalty to the party and the President who negotiated this legislation in secret and then had the nerve to tell the United States Senate that it must not add or subtract a word  It would show that this Republican Congress is so focused on providing our President with unlimited authority that it would open the door to tyrants abroad who would claim the same authority over American citizens  I fear not only for Americans  but for this great institution  if this Senate can no longer agree to the simple proposition that the United States will not tolerate the abuse of Americans overseas
