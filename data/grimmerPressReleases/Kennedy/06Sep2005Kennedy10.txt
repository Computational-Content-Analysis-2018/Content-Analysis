         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633    Mr  President  millions of Americans on the Gulf Coast have endured an almost unspeakable tragedy over the past ten days  Thousands are likely dead  Hundreds of thousands had their lives upended and wondered so rightly why their government seemed to have abandoned them  Millions of Americans across the country are asking themselves when the suffering will end     We can t undo what s happened  but there is one thing we can do to redeem ourselves and to live up to our greatest American ideals    We can commit that we will not stop  that we will not rest  until these communities are back and stronger than before  until families have been reunited  and until the survivors of this catastrophe are restored into the full measure of American life     If six months from now we are still referring to American citizens as refugees  if we are content that American families are holed up without jobs  without homes  without security  then we will have failed and failed miserably     Our response to date has not been worthy of our nation    and we ll have to examine why it wasn t until last Friday that our brave and committed National Guard forces were deployed to deliver supplies to the starving  suffering Americans stranded at the New Orleans Convention Center    The time will also come to determine why the mandatory evacuation order wasn t implemented effectively  and why the Army Corps of Engineers wasn t given the resources long ago to prevent the collapse of the levees that caused most of the loss of life  especially when FEMA had called such a hurricane one of the likeliest  most catastrophic disasters facing the country    Clearly  mistakes were made that cost lives  displaced thousands  and left one of America s most unique and treasured cities under water and abandoned  There will come a time to hold accountable the responsible officials who allowed this disaster to become even more disastrous     But our first priority now is to do everything we can to meet the needs of our fellow citizens and to provide a helping hand to the countless generous Americans throughout the nation their homes  their schools  and their communities to our displaced fellow citizens  Today  our job is to meet the great  daunting  and unprecedented challenge of rebuilding the entire region    Our obligation is to guarantee that the Americans thrust into the darkness of despair and homelessness last week emerge with a restored faith in their fellow citizens and a renewed belief that this is a land of opportunity     This is a challenge for all of us    as individuals  as public officials  and as members of religious and charitable organizations     But above all it is the job of our national government  which alone has the resources  the manpower  and the authority to lead this enormous effort  The eyes of the world are upon us    watching to see how we take care of our own    The  10 5 billion Congress passed last week was an initial gesture  but it s just a small fraction of the amount needed to address the unprecedented challenges this entire region faces  It s only the beginning  and we need to recognize that    We should move quickly  for example  to address the health needs of these citizens  The disaster area is a public health hazard as well  The floodwaters are potentially disease ridden  Countless people have been injured or taken ill as a result of the disaster  The physical and mental health needs of thousands must be met as they try to cope with the horror that they ve endured    We also need to ensure that the elderly and disabled who rely on supplemental assistance to live continue to get it  even though they ve been dislocated     We must do all we can to see that school children and college students don t miss a year of their education      We ve learned that there are 70 000 children in the New Orleans public school system  80  of which live below the poverty line  Their school districts are wiped out  and all the school records are gone     Some 7 000 teachers are still missing  and the school system is down to its emergency cash reserves just to pay employees    School districts across the country are taking in children from the disaster area  Thirty five cities as far north as Detroit have come forward to date  we understand  with Houston working to serve 6 000 students  Dallas Fort Worth making room for 5 000    These school districts are doing our nation a great service and we need to make sure they have the support they need as they step forward    And Colleges are volunteering to admit displaced students from the region  We must offer them additional aid for generously admitting these students  and we must assure that adequate student aid is available to those who temporarily attend a new college    The hundreds of thousands of workers who now have no jobs need an income to help them overcome the delay in finding new employment  We must amend our disaster unemployment assistance laws to enable these men and women to qualify for help  We should allow them to defer payments into their pensions without losing their retirement benefits    We need to rebuild the public health infrastructure  which is under increasing strain as the number of uninsured continues to climb  Sadly  Hurricane Katrina has only made this crisis worse    These are but a few of the actions we must take    and take now    to deal with the immediate needs of those displaced by Katrina and of the communities that have so generously taken them in    In the longer term  I believe we should establish a New Orleans and Gulf Coast Redevelopment Authority  with cabinet rank  to coordinate planning and funding needed to restore the infrastructure of that battered region    the electricity  water  gas  roads  railroads  and bridges  and  especially  the levees and flood control facilities  These actions are beyond the ability of any single community  city  and state to handle on their own  It is a national responsibility  and we need a capable authority to work with state and local officials and local citizens to rebuild the future     The scope of this national crisis exceeds anything since the Great Depression  It s the first time a major US city has been leveled since the San Francisco earthquake of 1906  It will likely exceed the cost in human lives of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900  where more than 8 000 persons are thought to have perished    It s the kind of disaster we no longer thought possible in an age of instantaneous global communications  rapid transportation  highly accurate weather forecasts  and advanced engineering  It was most certainly the kind of suffering that should not be tolerated by a modern society with so many tools at its disposal    In the weeks  months  and even years ahead  the recovery from this disaster    the complete  total  and unambiguous recovery    must become a primary focus of our national government     As elected officials we cannot allow this work to be sidetracked by lesser priorities  If we don t get this right for our fellow Americans  little else can matter     For our political leadership in Washington  in the White House and here on Capitol Hill  this is a test of wills  a test of leadership  a test of vision and compassion     It will require singular focus and an unyielding commitment    The most immediate task is still to save lives  Over 1 5 million have been evacuated from the devastated area    but many still remain  particularly in outlying rural areas cut off the most from the outside world    Local authorities  the National Guard  and the Coast Guard are still trying to reach and rescue men  women  and children from the ravaged areas  It s a race against time before water borne disease  dehydration  and neglect take their toll  They are working around the clock  and they deserve all the resources they need    For the hundreds of thousands of Americans thrust into homeless shelters as a result of the tragedy  we need to make sure they are getting the care  nutrition  and counseling they so desperately need    But the urgency is not limited to these immediate and enormous humanitarian tasks  It extends to the rebuilding efforts too  because more rapidly we can revitalize the great city of New Orleans  and so many other communities  the sooner we can help people rebuild their lives    These cities and towns are not just bricks and mortar  They are communities and economies of countless families  neighbors  and business owners  desperate for a return to normalcy    It s said that nearly 80 000 jobs in New Orleans alone are provided by the tourism industry  How many more of those jobs can we save    how many more families can have stability again    if we get the city back on its feet in six months as opposed to one year  Two years  Three years  How much human misery and suffering can we still prevent     I m impressed with the way the Army Corps of Engineers is working to rebuild the levees and begin to drain away the water  It s such a critical step in locating the missing and beginning the process of recovery     The Army Corps now estimates that perhaps within 30 days  New Orleans and the surrounding areas will finally be dry      The question for Congress and the Administration is will we be ready on Day 31  Will we be ready to start cleaning the streets and homes and removing the ghastly evidence of this most unbearable tragedy    We owe it to the living to be ready  We owe it to the charitable organizations that are filling in the gaps and helping the displaced to get back on their feet  We owe it to the first responders who are giving so much of themselves to ease the suffering     We owe it to the millions of Americans who  opened their hearts and their checkbooks to their fellow citizens    History is watching us now  and it will judge our actions  We can t undo the failures in planning over many years or the failures in the immediate response over the past ten days    But we can resolve to dedicate all of our energies and resources  and our resolve from this point forward to resources to bring about a complete and total recovery for the entire Gulf Coast area  and the men and women and children who ve endured more than any of us can possibly imagine in this massive tragedy     To the Gulf Coast region  we need to be like Aaron and Hur who held up Moses  tired arms in battle     Today  we need to be just as dedicated to the Gulf Coast region if we are going to lead our fellow Americans out of this time of darkness and into a better and stronger future    The Katrina disaster also shines a bright light on another challenge facing our country    the glaring economic disparities facing our citizens  Those with means were able to escape the disaster  Those without could not      Those with means can slowly and painfully rebuild their lives     Those without means have nothing to let them rebuild    As a nation  we must be sensitive to this inequality    sensitive as we respond to Katrina  and sensitive  too  as we select now Justices for the Supreme Court  That s a critical question for Judge Roberts  Can he unite America for the future   Laura Capps
