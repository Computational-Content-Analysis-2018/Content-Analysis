         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       I note that there is additional funding for armored vehicles in the Supplemental  and I am pleased to see this     Clearly  we need to provide the resources for our troops to do their job and to train a competent Iraqi security force  But America cannot and should not   stay in Iraq forever     Obviously  the Iraqis have to be well trained to take over the security responsibilities  The Bush Administration set a goal to hold the election on a certain date  January 30  and they stuck to it  and it worked out well  Why not set goals   not a hard and fast timetable    for the future of our presence in Iraq     CIA Director Porter Goss declared yesterday what we ve known for a long time  that we ve created a breeding ground for terrorists in Iraq and a cause for extremists for recruitment     We knew how to win the war  but had no idea how to secure the peace  The Iraqis blame us for lack of security in the streets  no running water  no electricity or commerce     American forces    after serving bravely and with great honor    are now seen as occupiers instead of liberators  The war in Iraq has given the insurgents a recruiting tool to spawn new attacks and terrorists worldwide an effective recruiting tool  The war has made it more likely   not less   that we will face them in New York  Chicago  or Boston and not just the streets of Baghdad  After two years of making it up as we go along  we need an effective strategy for success in Iraq     Part of an effective strategy must be to give the Iraqi people a clear sense that America has no long term designs on their country  Secretary Deputy Wolfowitz said  I have talked to some of our commanders in the area  They believe that over the course of the next six months you will see whole areas of Iraq successfully handed over to the Iraqi army and Iraqi police     Before the election  the Administration repeatedly stated that 14 of the 18 provinces in Iraq are safe  We heard a similar sentiment yesterday from Ambassador Negroponte     In today s Washington Post  Colonel Ben Hodges  the senior operations officer for the 18th Airborne Corps  said we will have personally failed if by the end of the year we have not made enough progress to decrease the total number of brigades required from this year s baseline of 17  or about 135 000 troops  How many of these areas can be turned over to the Iraqis in the next six months  as Secretary Wolfowitz indicated     Most importantly  how many American soldiers will be able to come home as a  result    The American people do not want an open ended commitment    As CIA  Director Goss said yesterday  the war in Iraq is increasing support for  extremists  and we don t want to increase the likelihood that we ll have to  fight the terrorists on the streets of Boston and New York too     If entire areas are being turned over to the Iraqis  then we should be able to bring many American troops home  and take the American face off the occupation  We can send a strong signal to the Iraqi people that America has no long term designs on their country     We all understand the importance of stability in Iraq and training capable  Iraqi Security Services  but the American people want to know what our long term commitment and strategy are for Iraq     The President has said we will stay in Iraq as long as it takes and not a  day longer     Yesterday  about our troops in Iraq  Secretary Rumsfeld said that we have  no intention of keeping them there permanently     But when asked about permanent military bases  Secretary Rumsfeld also said   It s not for me to rule them out     The fact that the Supplemental requests  560 million for military construction in Iraq  including permanent construction for barracks  operations centers  and medical facilities   suggests that we are preparing to maintain a military presence in Iraq for a long time  If that s the case  I think the Administration should level with the American people   and the Iraqi people   and say that we are in Iraq for the long term     The Iraqi people need a clear signal that America does not have long term designs on their country  The perception that we will never leave and are in Iraq for our own interests is fueling the insurgency  We can t have it both ways  and actions speak louder than words      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
