         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       LETTERS OF OPPOSITION FROM KEY CIVIL RIGHTS AND BUSINESS GROUPS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST       AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY    The diversity program is a small but vital part of our immigration system  and I urge my colleagues to preserve the program by voting against the Gregg Amendment  This amendment would all but destroy the diversity visa program  which has served our country well and continues to do so  and would have no noticeable effect on skills based immigration  which is already favored by our immigration laws and already being addressed elsewhere in this bill  That s why civil rights and ethnic groups are united with business groups in opposition to this amendment     I understand the thinking behind the Gregg Amendment  and there are few people in this chamber who have been more consistent supporters of high skilled immigration than have I continue to support high skilled migration  and the original McCain Kennedy bill doubled the numerical limits on high skilled employment based migration  I also supported additional changes in the Judiciary Committee to increase H 1B visa limits and to make it easier for H 1B immigrants to adjust to permanent status     But the Diversity Visa Program serves a wholly different purpose  The purpose of the Diversity is not just to advance narrow economic interests  but rather to preserve our very heritage as a nation of immigrants and a true melting pot  Unlike other visa categories  the diversity visa is not about who you know  or to whom you are related  It is a totally unique program because anyone with a high school degree or two years of meaningful work experience can apply  Without the Diversity Visa Program  our family  and employment based immigration system would ensure that virtually all immigrants to the United States would come from just a small handful of states  The Diversity program ensures that America continues to be a beacon to the entire world  and not just to a dozen or so countries with high numbers of immigrants already living here    As you can see  the Diversity Visa Program is especially important when it comes to African immigration  Fewer than 4 percent of family  and employment based immigrants come from Africa  but almost 40  of Diversity Visas are issued to Africans  And even though only one in 20 Green Cards is a diversity visa  1 in 3 Green Cards issued to an African is authorized through this program  One sure effect of the Gregg Amendment is that it would substantially reduce African migration to this country there s just no other visa out there that would replace these flows  That s why the following groups are all opposed to the Gregg Amendment  o NAACP o NAACP Legal Defense Fund o Coalition for Human Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles o Ethiopian Community Development Council  o The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops  o The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights  o The Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform  Irish Immigration Center  o The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights  o The New York Immigration Coalition o Massachusetts Immigrant  Refugee Advocacy Coalition    Mr  President  what does the Gregg amendment hope to accomplish in exchange for giving up this program  While the Diversity Visa Program has unchecked symbolic importance and is an important mechanism to protect balance and equality in migration inflows  it is tiny in comparison to existing high skilled programs because the rules already favor skilled immigrants  Three different classes of employment based visas are reserved for skilled immigrants and five different temporary worker programs H 1B  L  P  O  and TN visas are already set aside for skilled workers  All but one of these other programs already admits more immigrants than Senator Gregg would generate through his change    That s why business groups also oppose the Gregg amendment  I have letters here from The US Chamber of Commerce  the American Council on International Personal  the National Association of Manufacturers   the Business Roundtable  and Compete America all major business associations which support high skilled immigration    So here s what the Gregg amendment would do  It would change the Diversity Visa Program from a tiny slice of the pie to a miniscule slice  Diversity visa flows are already one twentieth just one twentieth of high skilled flows  and under the Gregg amendment they d be cut to less than 2 percent  And these charts actually understate what s going by a wide margin because the underlying bill already roughly triples numerical limits on high skilled immigrants  Is the benefit to high skilled employers of an extra 37 000 visas really worth the price of eviscerating this successful program  Are we willing to give up so much to gain so little    Another reason to oppose the Gregg Amendment is that for millions of people around the world  the Diversity Visa has come to symbolize the American Dream  A recent New Yorker article put it nicely  the Diversity Visa is a splendid overseas marketing campaign for the American Dream    An advanced degree is an income test in most of the world  The Diversity Visa Program symbolizes what makes America great because with a little luck and hard work anyone can succeed here we are the only country that can say that  By limiting most diversity visas to the world s privileged elite the Gregg amendment would dash the dreams of all those who dream of a better life  The Gregg amendment would also shift visas away from Africa and the developing world and toward wealthier European and Asian states  This would overturn the whole point of the program    Accepting the Gregg amendment would send a terrible message about what America is all about  not a land of opportunity  but rather an exclusive club  I believe America has our diversity is one of our greatest sources of strength and one of the truly unique things about this country  In an earlier time  our laws discriminated against those coming from major areas of the world  In 1965  we reformed our immigration laws to get rid of those discriminatory quotas  And in 1990  we acted again to ensure greater equality of immigration by creating the diversity visa program  The Gregg amendment would be a major step backward  and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against it    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
