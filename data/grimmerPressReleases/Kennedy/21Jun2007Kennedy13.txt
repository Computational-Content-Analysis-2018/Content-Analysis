         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  KENNEDY  IMMIGRATION PLAN IS TOUGH  FAIR  AND PRACTICAL GROUNDBREAKING NEW POLL OF THE UNDOCUMENTED SHOWS THAT IMMIGRATION BILL WILL WORK83   of UNDOCUMENTED LATIN AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS IN THE U S  WOULD COMPLY WITH NEW LAWSWASHINGTON  D C Today  U S  Senators Edward Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein were joined by New America Medias Odette Keeley and pollster Sergio Bendixen at a news conference to unveil historic polling results of the undocumented population  The research finds that an overwhelming majority undocumented immigrants would comply with the proposed legislation to legalize their status  including paying tough fines and fees and undergoing criminal background checks  Eighty three percent say they would apply for the new Z visa  And  if they are guaranteed reentry  they will travel back to their home countries  apply for a visa  and put themselves on the right track to legalization  This poll today demonstrates that this bipartisan reform bill would work  It would work because the 12 million undocumented immigrants who are here today will pay the high price to become an American citizen  They want to come out of the shadows and help strengthen this country  And  they have something to contribute  They are men and women of dignity  They work hard every day  They care for their families  They revitalize decaying neighborhoods  They sit in our pews on Sundays  Senator Kennedy said  This countrys toughest problems never have an easy answer  But  the American people expect us to find one  The Senate bill provides that solution  Its tough  its fair and its practical  The Senators were also joined by dozens of farm workers who were in the Capitol lobbying for the bill  including Arturo Rodriguez  President  United Farm Workers  Baldemar Velasquez of the Farm Labor Organization Committee  and Mirna Vasquez a farm worker from California  The AgJobs provisions in this bill reflect a far reaching agreement between the United Farm Workers and the agricultural industry to remedy one of the most difficult immigration challenges our nation faces  Much of the nations economy today depends on the hard work and the many contributions of immigrants  The agricultural industry would grind to a halt without immigrant farm workers  Yet  the overwhelming majority of these workers today are not legal immigrants  The AG Jobs provision provides a fair and reasonable means for illegal agricultural workers to earn legal status   Below is an executive summary of the new poll New American MediaTHE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF UNDOCUMENTED LATIN AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES WOULD COMPLY WITH THE NEW IMMIGRATION LAWSEXECUTIVE SUMMARY REPORTJune  2007METHODOLOGYThe results and findings in this executive summary report are based on a national public opinion survey of 1 600 undocumented immigrants from Latin America that arrived in the United States before January 1st  2007  The sample was designed to be representative of the approximately 10 million undocumented immigrant from Latin America  70 percent are from Mexico and the other 30 percent are from Central America  South America and the Dominican Republic  The telephone survey was conducted in Spanish between June 9th and June 19th of 2007 by professional interviewers  The margin of error for the full sample is approximately 2 percentage points  The study was designed and conducted by Bendixen  Associates  a public opinion research firm in Coral Gables  Florida  It was sponsored by New America Media  MAJOR FINDINGUndocumented immigrants by an overwhelming majority are following the debate over immigration reform with close attention and would comply with proposed legislation to legalize their status  including paying stiff fines and fees and undergoing criminal background checks  Eighty three percent say they would apply for the new Z work visa  Their greatest anxiety is over any requirement to return to their country of origin without a guaranteed right to return  The vast majority report that anti immigrant sentiment has negatively impacted their families The Z Visa1  If new immigration legislation is approved by the Congress of the United States  the overwhelming majority of Latin American undocumented immigrants  83 percent  would apply for the new Z visa that would allow them to live and work in the United States legally  The undocumented immigrants interviewed were given the following information about the new Z visa  The proposed law would offer a new visa to undocumented immigrants living in the United States  To qualify for this new visa  undocumented immigrants would have to register at a government office and admit that they were in the United States illegally  The head of the family would have to pay  3 000 in fines and fees and each undocumented member of the family would have to pay an additional  2 000  Undocumented immigrants would also have to show that they have a work record in the United States and pass a criminal background check  Those who qualify could then live and work in the United States legally  They would be able to travel between the United States and their home country without problems  The new visa could be renewed every four years by paying  1 500 in fines and fees  A small percentage of the undocumented  14 percent  said that they would not apply for the new visa  They felt that it would be easier to remain undocumented  2  Substantial majorities of Latin American undocumented immigrants reported that they would be able to comply with all of the requirements of the new Z visa  Ninety four percent were willing to be fingerprinted and to undergo a criminal background check  89 percent felt that they would be able to show that they had a work record in the United States  83 percent were willing to pay the  3 000 in fines and fees for the head of the family and the additional  2 000 for each undocumented member of the family  and 85 percent were willing to register at a government office and admit that they were in the United States illegally 3  More than one quarter  27 percent  of the undocumented immigrants from Latin America who would otherwise apply for the Z visa would not do so if they had to return to their home country to pick up their new work visa  Another 10 percent told our interviewers that they were not sure that they would still apply for a Z visa if one of the requirements was to return to their home country The Green Card and Citizenship 4  The study indicates that approximately three quarters of the undocumented immigrants who are willing to apply for the new Z work visa would also be very interested or somewhat interested in applying for a green card and eventually becoming a citizen of the United States  The undocumented immigrants interviewed were given the following information about the requirements necessary to apply for a green card and eventually to become a citizen of the United States  The new law would require undocumented immigrants to wait 9 to 13 years to receive a green card and another 5 years to become citizens  They would have to pay a  4 000 fine and pass an English proficiency test  Undocumented immigrants would also have to return to their home country to complete the application for a green card at the United States consulate  5  The willingness of undocumented immigrants to return to their home country to complete the application for a green card depends on whether they are guaranteed re entry into the United States  Eighty five percent of the undocumented were willing to apply for their green card at the United States consulate in their home country if they were guaranteed that they could return to the United States without a problem  But only 35 percent were willing to travel back to their home country for that purpose if there were no such guarantee  6  The other requirements for a green card and citizenship were less controversial  Ninety two percent were prepared to pay the  4 000 fine  90 percent were willing to take an English proficiency test  and 71 percent were prepared to wait 9 to 13 years for their green card and another 5 years to become a citizen Quality of Life Issues7  A substantial majority of undocumented immigrants from Latin America  78 percent  agree with the statement that the anti immigrant sentiment is growing in the United States and 64 percent of them report that it is having a negative effect on their families  And they are following the debate about immigration policy in the United States Congress with a great deal of interest  Eighty percent report that they are following it very closely or somewhat closely  Nevertheless  these immigrants have a very optimistic point of view about their quality of life in the United States  Eighty percent rate it as excellent or good  And even though the annual income of the majority is less than  20 000  three quarters of undocumented immigrants consider their economic situation to be positive  8  Less than one quarter   23 percent   of the undocumented immigrants in the United States have health insurance  When someone in their family gets sick  one third of them told our interviewers that they visit a doctor s office or a community clinic  one sixth go to the emergency room at the nearest hospital while another sixth report that they try to take care of the problem at home without medical assistance  The other ten percent either return to their home country for treatment or find other ways of dealing with their health problems      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
