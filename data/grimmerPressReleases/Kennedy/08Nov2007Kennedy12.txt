         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I thank Chairman Miller for scheduling todays meeting of conferees on the Head Start reauthorization  Im grateful to Senator Enzi and all the Members of our Senate Committee for the bipartisan effort weve made over the past two Congresses to strengthen and improve the current program  Im pleased that weve finally reached a point in both Chambers of Congress  where we can provide a better lifeline of support for the neediest families and children across the nation      For more than 40 years  Head Start has given disadvantaged children the assistance they need to arrive at school ready to learn  and the building blocks they need to succeed in school and later in life  Head Start teachers give young children the help they need to develop both their learning skills and their social skills  They also receive other services  such as doctor and dentist visits  immunizations against childhood diseases  and behavioral and mental health care    As we all know  Head Start has long been a model for community development and advancement  It empowers parents with the skills and resources needed to be full partners in the education of their children     In this reauthorization  we build on many years of lessons learned to set an even better course for the program  This Conference Report maintains Head Starts quality services  promotes school readiness  and ensures greater accountability in programs  It provides better access to programs and services for children  communities  and families in need  It provides a blueprint for improving the Head Start workforce  It builds on the highly successful Early Head Start program  and it enables Head Start to better work with other child and family agencies in order to serve children and families more effectively     Just as in elementary and secondary education  reform in early education requires resources  too  The bill increases the authorizations for Head Start to  7 3 billion in fiscal year 2008   7 6 billion in fiscal year 2009  and  7 9 billion in fiscal year 2010  The conferees have also emphasized the importance of providing needed funds to equip Head Start programs to respond to the evolving and changing needs in their local communities      The Conference Report ensures accountability and quality services for Head Start children and their families by dedicating nearly  2 million this year to Head Start agencies for local training and improving efforts     Weve also granted additional flexibility to Head Start programs to serve thousands of additional low income children in need  by shifting eligibility to families just above the federal poverty level  Its essential that Head Start centers prioritize services to the neediest families in their communities  The new flexibility provides assistance to poor families who are neighbors of those currently enrolled in Head Start  as they transition to work and struggle to keep up with the higher cost of living in this new economy  A family of four in New England earning  26 000 a year can surely benefit from Head Start  and I appreciate my colleagues work to include this essential provision      The Conference Report also makes a long overdue commitment to expanding Head Start programs for Native Americans  as well as for migrant and seasonal farmworkers  By reserving up to  20 million annually to expand these services  we can hopefully reach an additional 5 500 children of farmworkers and an additional 5 100 Native American children living in poverty  New provisions are also included for homeless children  children who are English language learners  and children with disabilities  so that these young populations can receive the care and attention they need and deserve      Head Start teachers and staff are the heart and future of the program  They help children learn to identify letters and arrange the pieces of puzzles  They teach them to brush their teeth  wash their hands  make friends  and follow rules      This reauthorization establishes goals to help Head Start staff improve their knowledge and skills  Weve committed to a goal that all Head Start teachers have their A A  degree  and 50 percent earn their B A   over the course of this authorization  Weve worked to give Head Start agencies a dedicated stream of funds for needed training for teachers  Weve committed to confronting the persistent challenge of compensating Head Start teachers as the professionals they are      Head Start teachers currently earn only half of the salary of kindergarten teachers  and turnover is about 11 percent a year  The conference report commits 40 percent of new funds in Head Start to improving program quality and increasing teacher salaries  so that we can attract and retain more of these caring and committed leaders     The Conference Report provides needed upgrades to the educational aspects of Head Start  to align the programs curricula and standards with what children need to know and be able to do when they enter kindergarten      We encourage stronger partnerships between Head Start and local schools  although Head Start services will continue to be guided by the highly effective Head Start Child Outcomes Framework  We also do more to see that Head Start programs are a bridge for children to their local schools  to ease their transition from preschool to kindergarten     Accountability is a cornerstone of excellence and should start early  Head Start should be accountable for its commitment to provide safe and healthy learning environments  to support each childs individual pattern of development and learning  to cement community partnerships in services to children  and to involve parents in their childs growth     For years  Head Start had had one of the most comprehensive monitoring systems in early childhood education  The Conference Report continues this effective monitoring  and establishes a new system for the designation of Head Start grants  to be phased in over the next several years  We know that the vast majority of Head Start programs provide outstanding services  But we must also take steps to address the small number of programs with serious deficiencies  so that substantial problems do not languish at the expense of children    If a local program is unable to meet Head Starts stellar standards of quality  others should step in  This new system will facilitate those difficult decisions  and do so in a manner that is transparent  fair  and responsive to the local needs of families and children      The Conference Report also expands Early Head Start  Since 1994 when it began  results have proven it one of the most effective programs operated by the Department of Health and Human Services  In this legislation  we improve the training and assistance network in Early Head Start  and guarantee a dedicated expert in each state to work with others to meet the needs of infants and toddlers      We also expand the screening available to infants exposed to trauma  violence  or other circumstances detrimental to their development  And we commit to expanding Early Head Start to serve an additional 8 000 low income infants and toddlers over the five year course of the authorization      Research shows that the first five years of life make an immense difference for a child  Those who attend high quality early education programs are more likely to do well when they reach elementary school  are less likely to be held back a grade and more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college      Quality early education pays off  we all are familiar with the studies that show that for every dollar invested in a high quality early learning program  there is a 16 dollar return later in life      The scope of services available to our youngest children is certainly evolving  Today  the majority of young children are enrolled in early education  69 percent of all 4 year olds in the states participate in child care  preschool  or Head Start  Over 60 percent of all young children are cared for by someone other than their parents     Every child  regardless of background  deserves to learn and develop in a high quality setting  We need to strengthen early childhood education to improve the quality of learning opportunities for young children  and help them learn and succeed      A comprehensive curriculum and a stable and well qualified workforce are the cornerstones of good early education  Im especially pleased that the Conference Report includes the blueprint needed to strengthen the array of early childhood programs and services for young children     It establishes an Early Childhood Education Advisory Council to examine needs across early childhood programs  develop a plan to improve professional development  upgrade standards  enhance collaboration among programs  and improve data collection  States ready to take on the challenge of implementing needed improvements will qualify for incentive grants  as funds permit  to get that work underway     One of our highest priorities in Congress is to expand educational opportunities for every American  In this age of globalization  every citizen deserves a chance to acquire the skills to compete in the modern economy  Learning begins at birth and is accelerated in the early years  long before a child even begins kindergarten     The Conference Report will help us achieve this essential goal  It keeps Head Start on its successful path  and enables it to continue to thrive and improve  I thank all of the conferees for their excellent work on this legislation  I look forward to its passage next week and its enactment into law  Im very pleased with our work  The efforts of recent years have paid off  Well done to you all        HEAD START CONFERENCE REPORT  Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act    Key Policy Highlights  Senator Edward M  Kennedy    Ensures Accountability and Quality
