         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent the below letter to the Government Accountability Office  GAO  seeking clarification on the costs associated with implementing don t ask  don t tell  The policy  created in 1993  bans overt homosexuality in the military     In February 2005  the GAO estimated that the cost of replacing service members fired for homosexuality at  190 5 million  A report released today  however  by the University of California at Santa Barbara estimates the costs at over  363 8 million  Understanding what the true costs of replacing service members is critically important  especially during a time of war when manpower is critical     Senator Kennedy said  Today s report demonstrates that there is a significant cost to the tax payer for this discriminatory policy  We need to understand why the GAO departed from previous estimates of training when putting together this report  The strain on the military is intense  and many have been involuntarily called to duty  Prejudice should not prevent those who wish to serve from doing so    The text of the letter is included below  A signed  PDF version is available upon request     30    February 14  2006   The Honorable David M  Walker Comptroller General General Accountability Office 441 G Street  NW Washington  DC 20548   Dear Mr  Walker    In 1993  Congress passed a law codifying a long standing Pentagon policy  informally known as  don t ask  don t tell  banning overt homosexual activity in the military  Many members of Congress objected to that law  and still believe that it discriminates unfairly against a group of people who want to serve their country    In February 2005  the Government Accountability Office released a report  Financial Costs and Loss of Critical Skills Due to DOD s Homosexual Conduct Policy Cannot Be Completely Estimated  The GAO study estimated the cost of discharging and replacing service members fired for homosexuality as at least  190 5 million for Fiscal Years 1994 through 2003  By contrast  today a report by the Blue Ribbon Commission of the University of California at Santa Barbara estimates those costs over the same time period were at least  363 8 million  or nearly twice as high as the GAO estimate  The report emphasized that even this figure was a conservative estimate  I m enclosing the University of California report  which analyzed areas in which GAO may have over estimated some costs and underestimated some others    Over 90 percent of that difference results from the costs of training replacement enlisted personnel  The report estimated that cost at  252 4 million compared to GAO s estimate of only  93 1 million  In developing its 2005 estimate  GAO relied on basic and skill training costs provided by the services  The Navy estimated that it cost  18 000 to train an enlisted person  the Air Force  7 400  and the Army  6 400  Yet in 1998  a GAO study estimated an average training cost of  28 000 per enlisted recruit  It is difficult to reconcile the decrease in cost of training between the 2005 report and the 1998 report    Congress relies heavily on the accuracy and integrity of GAO s reports and it s essential for us to have a reliable estimate of the costs of implementing the don t ask  don t tell policy  I urge GAO to explain the difference between its 2005 cost estimate  its 1998 estimate  and the estimate just provided by the University of California report    With respect and appreciation    Sincerely    Edward M  Kennedy  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
