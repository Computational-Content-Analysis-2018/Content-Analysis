         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today 1600 Irish Americans    including 900 from Massachusetts   descended on the Capitol in support of the McCain Kennedy plan for comprehensive immigration reform  Kennedy addressed the group to thank them for their dedication and give them an update as to where the negotiations stand in the Senate Judiciary Committee  The mark up of Chairman Specter s immigration proposal began on March 2 and continued today  Kennedy and bipartisan co sponsors of McCain Kennedy are seeking to improve Specter s proposal believing that its enforcement provisions and failure to offer a pathway to citizenship would further drive immigrants into the shadows  The Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform represents Irish American groups across the country and is working hard to galvanize support behind McCain Kennedy by holding events across the country over the next few weeks  The government in the Republic of Ireland took a rare action in November by giving the McCain Kennedy bill its unanimous stamp of approval  Millions and millions of immigrants have made it to our shores  All eight of my great grandparents came here to escape poverty and famine in Ireland  and seek a new life for themselves and their children  said Senator Kennedy  Immigrants have built this country and helped make it great  They have provided the labor and the services that are the bedrock of our economy  To our opponents who say so casually  Turn them into criminals  we reply  Turn them into Americans  and make America a stronger and better land  Attached is a description of the McCain Kennedy plan  and a side by side comparison of it with Sen  Specter s proposal  Also included are Senator Kennedy s remarks as prepared for delivery  McCain    Kennedy

doing to bring immigrants out of the shadows of exploitation and fear  and into the mainstream of American life and the American dream Some in Congress want to build walls and dig trenches to keep America secure  But keeping America safe does not mean turning our backs on America s heritage and history  Millions and millions of immigrants have made it to our shores  All eight of my great grandparents came here to escape poverty and famine in Ireland  and seek a new life for themselves and their children Immigrants have built this country and helped make it great  They have provided the labor and the services that are the bedrock of our economy  They too suffered from exploitation and abuse  and they responded by leading the way to organize their fellow workers and create an extraordinary labor movement to oppose the unjust practices of unscrupulous employers  I m proud to see so many of you here following in that great tradition of public service  It s time  long past time  that our laws reflected and honored these contributions and fairly rewarded the hard work you do for your families  your employers  and our country So let s all work together to stop the exploitation of undocumented workers  and build the road to citizenship for hard working  tax paying immigrants struggling to feed their families and make a home for their children in the land of
