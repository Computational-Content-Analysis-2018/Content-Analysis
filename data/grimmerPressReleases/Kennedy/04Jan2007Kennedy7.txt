to securing additional funding for the law  one of our priorities for this reauthorization must be to ensure that the standards and assessments used to measure progress are fair and reliable measures  Some states are making progress in better aligning their standards with the skills needed for students to enter college and the workplace  but significant gaps from state to state in student performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress indicate that we have work to do  The SUCCESS Act will assist states efforts to close these gaps and ensure students are prepared to succeed in school and compete in todays global economy Summary of the SUCCESS Act  States Using Collaboration and Coordination to Enhance Standards for Students Act  Senator Edward M  Kennedy Todays economy is re shaping jobs for the 21st Century and re defining the knowledge and skills needed to compete in the global marketplace  Students must prepare to compete with students from other states and other nations  Some states are making progress to ensure that their standards are aligned with the skills needed for students to enter college and the workplace  but significant gaps from state to state in student performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress  NAEP  indicate that we have work to do  Now  more than ever  it is crucial to address these disparities and ensure our public schools challenge all students to learn to high standards and provide help to those with the greatest needs to ensure their academic success Ensuring our students success is not only critical to their individual prosperity  but its critical to the nation as well  According to a study released this past summer  the U S  loses  3 7 billion a year to the cost of remedial education and in individuals  reduced earning potential because students are not learning the basic skills they need to succeed after high school  To help all students prepare for the demands of the 21st century  The SUCCESS Act would   Update the Nations Report Card  NAEP  to ensure it sets a national benchmark that is internationally competitive and aligned with the demands of the 21st century by incorporating measures of student preparedness into existing 12th grade national assessments and improving our ability to reliably monitor trends in science achievement in the 4th  8th and 12th grades  Examine gaps in student performance on State level assessments and NAEP assessments and assist states that want to analyze how their standards and assessments compare to benchmarks reflected in NAEP   Establish P 16 Preparedness Councils to link student knowledge and skills with the expectations of colleges  employers  and the Armed Forces  The Councils would engage members of the P 16 education community  the business and military communities  and other stakeholders to ensure that standards align with what is needed for success in college and the workforce  Councils would be charged with ensuring state standards and assessments meet international benchmarks to improve instruction and student achievement and prepare students to contribute in the global economy  Encourage collaboration among states in raising the bar for student achievement by providing grants to state consortia that develop common standards and assessments that are highly rigorous  internationally competitive and aligned with the demands of higher education  the 21st century workforce  and the Armed Forces  Senator Edward M  KennedyFloor Speech on Introduction of the SUCCESS Act  as Prepared for Delivery January 4  2007 Few things are more indispensable to the United States than good schools  Today more than ever  a quality education is the gateway to achieving the American dream and the best guarantee of equal opportunity for all our people  good citizenship  and an economy capable of mastering modern global challenges In 1965  as part of the War on Poverty  President Johnson signed into law the landmark Elementary and Secondary Education to strengthen America by allocating substantial federal resources to public schools for the first time  In the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act of 2002  we reauthorized this landmark legislation  and for the first time made a commitment that every child  black or white  Latino or Asian  native born or an English language learner  disabled or non disabled    would be part of an accountability plan that holds schools responsible for the progress of all students  It required every state to implement content and performance standards specifying what children should know and be able to do  and urged states to create high quality assessments so that students progress toward meeting those standards could be accurately measured  It expanded support for early reading and literacy skills and offered extra tutoring to students in struggling schools  It sought to improve the quality of instruction by requiring all schools to provide a highly qualified teacher for every child  We know these reforms can work  But good results are not possible without adequate investments  The No Child Left Behind Act recognized that to move forward with these dramatic changes  schools would need a continued infusion of federal resources  because the cost was obviously too great for states and local governments to bear alone  Today  because of budget cuts and poor implementation  we still have much to do to ensure that no child is left behind  President Bush has short changed the promise made in the law by nearly  56 billion  leaving millions of children without the resources needed to reduce class sizes  improve teaching  and set higher standards for our schools  Now  more than ever  its important to deliver the resources our schools deserve  Thousands of schools are on watchlists in their states and need federal support and extra assistance to bridge the learning gaps of their students The No Child Left Behind Act is again scheduled for reauthorization this year  and we must work to ensure that its promise is fulfilled  Aside from additional funding  one of our priorities must be to ensure that the standards and assessments used to measure progress are fair and reliable  Accountability is only as good as the tests to measure progress  and many states use tests that need substantial improvement  Some use exams that are not aligned to the standards that students must meet  Others have manufactured artificially high test score gains by lowering standards and adjusting test scores in order to avoid unfavorable consequences under the law s accountability framework We need to shift our understanding of the Act away from the idea that it labels and penalizes schools  and toward a more productive framework that helps schools and states reach higher  not lower  We should use the well regarded National Assessment of Educational Progress  the nations report card  as a benchmark for the rigor of state exams  States should also align their elementary and secondary school standards with their standards for college entrance and success  creating seamless systems that guide students from the beginning of their education to the achievement of a college degree The SUCCESS Act I am introducing today would assist states in these efforts  As the name suggests  it would provide federal support for States Using Collaboration and Cooperation to Enhance Standards for Students  It would help ensure that public schools challenge all students to learn to high standards and provide needed help to schools with the greatest needs The legislation updates the nations report card  the National Assessment of Educational Progress  to ensure that it sets a national benchmark which is internationally competitive and is aligned with the demands of the 21st century global economy  It expands our ability to monitor science achievement  It requires the NAEP to measure student preparedness to enter college  the 21st century workforce  or the Armed Services  It also requires the Secretary of Education to examine the gaps in student performance on state level assessments and NAEP assessments  and to assist states that wish to analyze how their standards and assessments compare to the benchmark The SUCCESS Act provides critical resources to states to create P 16 Preparedness Councils that will engage members of the early childhood  K 12 and higher education communities  along with the business and military communities  and other stakeholders to align the standards with what is needed for success in college and the workforce  The councils would be charged with ensuring that state standards and assessments meet international benchmarks to improve instruction and student achievement and prepare students to contribute in the global economy  It also provides funds to encourage collaboration among states in raising the bar for student achievement by providing grants to states working together to establish common standards and assessments that are rigorous  internationally competitive  and aligned with postsecondary demands I look forward to working with my colleagues on this and other important proposals as we move toward the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act  In the coming weeks  our Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions will hold a series of hearings and roundtable discussions to hear from experts and those dealing with the challenges of the current law on a daily basis  Our goal is to work on a bipartisan basis with all our colleagues in the Senate and in the House and with the Administration to develop a strong bipartisan bill that builds on the positive aspects of the law  addresses the concerns about its implementation  and encourages reforms that we know will work to help students succeed  Teachers deserve the resources they need to help students achieve at higher levels  In many schools  the most valuable resource that teachers require is time  Yet the U S  ranks 11th among industrialized nations in the number of days children attend school  Innovative approaches are needed to extend the school day and year in high need schools  We should recruit Americorps volunteers to coordinate academically oriented extended day programs for students and assist teachers during the school day  We must also ensure that students in high poverty schools have access to good teachers  We should create incentives to attract the best teachers to the neediest schools  including increased salaries for teachers and principals with strong track records of success who work in hard to staff schools  and by creating career advancement systems in which highly effective teachers serve as instructional leaders for new or less successful teachers  To help teachers improve their teaching  we should invest more in training them to use the best data to improve instruction  We should also help parents by replicating Bostons successful initiative to place parent family outreach coordinators in every high poverty school  and offer grants to school districts to support community programs that address childrens social  emotional and other non academic needs  We must invest in these and other reforms to give schools the resources they need to close the achievement gap and ensure that all students can stay on track to graduate and succeed  Experience shows that each year yields greater success when policymakers and educators commit in the long term to higher standards  better teacher training  stronger accountability  and extra help for students in need  The initial implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act has been flawed  but we cant abandon its vision of an America in which every child is important and deserves to be educated and enjoy the full benefits of our society  That vision is as enduring as America itself  As John Adams wrote in the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780  the education of the people is necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberty  More than two hundred years later  we need to recapture that spirit  and make No Child Left Behind a reality  not merely a slogan   Laura Capps Melissa
