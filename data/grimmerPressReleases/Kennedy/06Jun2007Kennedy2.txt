         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  Sen  Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   and Sen  Orrin G  Hatch  R Utah  today agreed on goals for reauthorizing the State Children Health Insurance Program  CHIP   The two principal authors of the original 1997 CHIP bill  P L  105 33   Kennedy and Hatch are committed to the goal of helping states provide insurance coverage for the children of the working poor  those whose parents cant afford private insurance but make too much to qualify for Medicaid  No child should have to go without healthcare  thats why Senator Kennedy and I worked to create CHIP 10 years ago  Hatch said  The health care children receive when they are young will largely determine their quality of life for their entire adulthood  Last year  more than 6 6 million children enrolled in CHIP  but estimates put between 2 and 2 8 million children as eligible but not currently covered by CHIP  We must reauthorize CHIP and providing coverage for those children should be our number one priority  The Childrens Health Insurance Program provides effective health care for children in every state across the country and has had dramatic impact on their young lives  Kennedy said  Senator Hatch and I have worked together for over a decade to help CHIP make a difference in the lives of Americas children  and today we take up the challenge once more  There are still too many children that need health care  and too many children who suffer from preventable illness  The principles that Senator Hatch and I have developed can guide effective legislation to renew CHIP  and see that it fulfills its promise of providing quality  affordable health care for all children that need care Hatch and Kennedy support funding the CHIP reauthorization with an increase in the tobacco tax  The Senators shared their principles with leaders responsible for such tax policy  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus  D Mont    Ranking Member Chuck Grassley  R Iowa   and Finance Subcommittee on Health Chairman John Rockefeller  D W Va    Hatch is ranking member of the Health subcommittee and Kennedy is chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee  Congress created CHIP as part of The Balanced Budget Act of 1997  CHIP provides states with federal matching funds to cover uninsured children of families with incomes that are above Medicaid eligibility levels  States receive an enhanced federal match for the CHIP program  this federal match is significantly higher than the federal match that states receive through the Medicaid program  All 50 states and the District of Columbia have CHIP programs Kennedy and Hatchs shared principles are included in full below  Kennedy Hatch CHIP Principles Children must be the primary focus of the CHIP program  Six million of the nine million American children who are currently uninsured are eligible but not enrolled in public coverage through Medicaid or CHIP  We propose providing the resources needed to states  local communities  schools  faith based organizations  Indian tribes and safety net providers for outreach to eligible children and populations  and enrolling them in Medicaid and CHIP  We propose innovative outreach and enrollment efforts  especially those focused on hard to reach populations  including minority and underserved children  and those in rural areas and inner cities  Incentive grants would be given to states which lower the number of uninsured children who are eligible for CHIP We propose the simplification of the enrollment and renewal process which often serves as a barrier for families seeking to enroll their children in CHIP We propose adopting national pediatric quality standards to measure the quality of care that children receive through the CHIP program  We believe that a good starting point would be S  1226  the Children s Health Care Quality Act We support states in their efforts to prevent childhood obesity  to provide access to mental health services  and to promote oral health  good nutrition and physical activity among children  Incentive grants may be used to cover these benefits at the option of the states We propose eliminating existing barriers that make it difficult for states to provide premium support through CHIP for children in families with qualifying incomes that have access to employer sponsored coverage  We propose evaluating the current five year exclusion of lawful immigrant children and giving states the option of covering these children We propose giving each state the flexibility to determine the federal poverty level of the children who would be covered under its state CHIP program The current system of allocating CHIP funds should be better targeted  We now have a decade of experience with the program  and with the knowledge of state spending gained  we propose allocating funds based on the individual needs of each state  No state should be allowed to retain federal CHIP dollars while doing little to actually cover eligible children  In addition  no state should be faced with closing enrollment or dropping children from the program because of a shortfall of available federal funds We propose authorizing and appropriating sufficient funding for CHIP in order to maintain current CHIP enrollment and to enroll those children who are currently eligible but not enrolled in the program  Funding should be increased to account for increases in health costs and increases in enrollment and eligible children We propose funding the CHIP program through tobacco taxes
