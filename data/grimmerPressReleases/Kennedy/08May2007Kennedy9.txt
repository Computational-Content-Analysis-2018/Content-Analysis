         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC Today  on National Childrens Mental Health Day  Senators Edward Kennedy  Pete Domenici  and Chris Dodd introduced bipartisan legislation to provide more and better opportunities for our nations public school children to get the mental health services they may need  One in five children have a diagnosable mental disorder yet 75  of children in need of mental health services do not receive them  The Mental Health In Schools Act of 2007 gives competitive grants to local education agencies in order to assist them in providing comprehensive school based mental health programs for students in K  12  The need for these services has never been greater  The tragic events at Columbine  Nickel Mines  and Virginia Tech underscore the fact that when left untreated  childhood mental disorders can lead to academic failure  family conflicts  substance abuse  violence  and suicide  Senator Kennedy said  Comprehensive school mental health program should be designed for all students  They should obviously include both identification and referral of specific individuals for treatment  but they should also include programs and services that promote positive mental health and prevent mental health problems for a broader population of students  We have seen over and over again that failing to offer effective mental health care has many ramifications  not the least of which is violence  substance abuse and poor academic performance  Senator Domenici said  We must recognize that children do not have to remain neglected when it comes to their mental health  Investing in effective mental health treatment can mean the difference between a childs success and failure in school and in society  Our bill will give the federal government a more active role in providing this needed care Mental health disorders continue to carry an unfortunate stigma  which often prevents people  particularly children and adolescents  from receiving the help they need  said Dodd  We  as a society  bear an obligation to work to remove this stigma and help young people suffering from mental health disorders find treatment  like we would for those with physical ailments  A coordinated effort is needed to increase access to mental health resources  and the federal government is a significant part of that equation  By working to address this problem in our schools  I am hopeful that this legislation will provide the help needed to address these disorders and help our young people achieve their full potential Below is the Summary of the Bill  SummaryMental Health in Schools Act of 2007Purpose    The Mental Health in Schools Act of 2007 gives competitive grants to local education agencies in order to assist them in providing comprehensive school based mental health programs for students  K 12  in communities across America  It provides increased opportunities for our nations 95 000 public schools grades K 12 to provide better access to mental health services for the approximately 53 million school children in our country  Background Strong mental health  similar to strong physical health  makes it possible for children to develop socially  emotionally  and intellectually  Mental illnesses often appear for the first time during childhood and adolescence  with one in five children have a diagnosable mental disorder  75  of children and youth in need of mental health services do not receive them  With proper care and treatment  approximately 80  of people with mental illnesses experience a significant reduction of symptoms and a better quality of life  Schools are important settings for recognizing and addressing childrens mental disorders because schools often function as the de facto mental health system for children and adolescents  Especially in rural areas  schools provide the only mental health services for children  Effective school mental health programs reflect the collaboration and commitment of families  students  educators  and other community partners  However  of the 95 000 public schools in the United States  only half of them report having formal partnerships with community mental health providers to deliver mental health services  Services and supports provided through these partnerships need to be family  and community centered and culturally and linguistically appropriate  This legislation aims to assist local communities in developing comprehensive school mental health programs that provide a continuum of services for students  within which schools play an integral part   How are we going to do this     By broadening the scope of the Safe Schools Healthy Students program  which currently focuses on helping children deal with violence to include services and supports to  1  students in need of immediate mental health supports   2  students at risk of behavioral mental health disorders  and  3  all students to promote positive mental health   What this legislation does    Provides schools with the flexible use of funds to expand their current mental health programs    Increases collaboration between schools  families  and their communities resources through partnerships to provide and sustain more comprehensive mental health programs in schools    Requires schools to apply a public health approach that incorporates positive behavioral interventions and supports to mental health programs in schools  which emphasizes promotion and prevention in addition to treatment    Require schools to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate in service training to all school personnel  including ancillary staff and volunteers  in the techniques and supports in  1  early identification of children with  or at risk of  mental illness  2  the use of effective referral mechanisms to ensure treatment intervention services for such children  and 3  strategies that promote a school wide positive environment   Require schools to demonstrate the measures they are taking to sustain the program once the grant funding is finished    Require the program to be culturally and linguistically appropriate in order to ensure that the program will meet the needs of its students    Require schools to base their program on evidenced based practices  What should a comprehensive program address under this Act     Promote the social  emotional and behavioral health of all students    Reduce the likelihood of at risk students developing social  emotional  or behavioral health problems    Treat or refer for treatment students with existing social  emotional  or behavioral health problems    Identify early on students with social  emotional  or behavioral health problems and provide early intervention services    Develop and implement programs to assist students in dealing with violence   How much will this legislation cost    200 000 000 for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to support 200 grants to local educational agencies nationwide      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
