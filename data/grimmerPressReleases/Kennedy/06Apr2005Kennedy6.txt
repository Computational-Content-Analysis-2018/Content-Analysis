         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C  Senator Edward M  Kennedy welcomed 67 Massachusetts Fire Chiefs to Washington today to discuss funding for their life saving public safety programs  This is the third yearly meeting by Kennedy and fire chiefs across the Commonwealth to learn about the challenges they face in implementing these essential safety measures     The chiefs deserve strong federal support for the men and women who put their lives on the line each and every day for the people of our communities  Kennedy said  The federal budget should reflect the respect and admiration we have for the sacrifices that firefighters across the country make to protect the public    In today s meeting  Kennedy and the chiefs discussed several specific federal aid programs including the FIRE Act  which provides funds for modern equipment and vehicles  Congress authorized the expenditure of  1 billion a year in program grants when it was enacted in 2000  but only  650 million was actually appropriated for the current year  and President Bush has managed to reduce its funding next year to 500 million     Kennedy called the reductions in the program unacceptable  noting the additional pressure on first responders because of the war in Iraq  Many of them are members of the Reserve and National Guard and have been called up for service in the war  leaving serious gaps in fire departments and also in police forces and emergency rescue teams  The SAFER Act  passed by Congress in 2003  addresses this problem by establishing a recruitment program that seeks to maintain safe numbers of fire fighters in each community  Kennedy sharply criticized the failure of the Bush Administration budget to support any funds for the program in the coming year  and pledged to the chiefs to do all he could in Congress to restore urgently needed funds for both of these important programs    The Fire Chiefs  Association of Massachusetts will attend the Congressional Fire Service Caucus dinner this evening in Washington  D C    Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
