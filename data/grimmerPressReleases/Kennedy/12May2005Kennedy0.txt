         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   Senators McCain and Kennedy  and Representatives Kolbe  Flake and Gutierrez  joined by Senators Brownback and Lieberman today introduced The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act of 2005  The legislation follows months of thoughtful debate and negotiation  which has resulted in bipartisan  bicameral  comprehensive border security and immigration reform     The status quo is unacceptable  and we need to modernize our broken immigration system to meet the challenges of the 21st Century  And we need policies that continue to reflect our best values as a nation    of fairness  equal opportunity  and respect for the law  One of the mistakes of the past is to assume we can control illegal immigration on our own  A realistic immigration policy must be a two way street  Under our plan  America will do its part  but we expect Mexico and other nations to do their part  too  to replace an illegal immigration flow with regulated  legal immigration  said Kennedy     McCain said  Homeland security is our nation s number one priority  this legislation includes a number of provisions that together will make our nation more secure  For far too long  our nation s broken immigration laws have gone unreformed    leaving Americans vulnerable  We can no longer afford to delay reform  I am proud to join my colleagues today as an original Sponsor of this legislation    This is a comprehensive bill that doesn t try to solve the hemorrhaging immigration problem with a ban aid    this bill is major surgery  The majority of the illegal immigration is happening in Arizona  and I will not stand by and let southern Arizona be the doormat for this country s failed immigration policy  said Rep  Kolbe  They are illegal immigrants    they have broken the law and must be punished  That is why this legislation includes strict fines and penalties for those already in this country illegally and tough punishments for employers who hire illegal immigrants  More importantly  it provides the secure identification document so an employer can know the person seeking work is here legally  We must recognize reality and implement a tightly structured guest worker program to securely  and legally  fill jobs that no American is available or wants to do  Over the past several years  border security has been a necessity for all members of Congress  but it has been a top priority for only a few  Today  I am proud to continue my work as one of those few  I will work hard with Senator McCain  Senator Kennedy  Rep  Flake and Rep  Gutierrez to educate Congress and the public about the need for practical reform  We are at an important threshold    we can either work hard to secure our borders through commonsense reform of our immigration system  or hang on to unrealistic ideals that will never improve the safety of our country    We need a plan that fairly balances national security  economic reality  and worker protections  and I think our bill comes pretty darn close  said Flake  I believe that this bill is very consistent with President Bush s principles of immigration reform and  given that the President has made immigration reform a priority of his second term  I hope that our colleagues in Congress will give this bill the consideration that it deserves    This bill represents a vital step toward an immigration policy that makes sense  Gutierrez said  It reflects the enormous contributions immigrants make every day  it respects our nation s proud history of welcoming men and women to seek a better life and it better protects our homeland by creating a system of improved accountability and security     If enacted  this legislation will help America meet 21st century challenges by replacing current outdated immigration laws with reforms that will improve our border security and make immigration policies more realistic and enforceable  The bill will help get control of our borders  strengthen our national security  create an even playing field for employers and ensure full labor rights for all our workers      30    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  May 12  2005                  202  224 2633   PRESS CONFERENCE STATEMENT OF EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM   It is an honor to join Senator McCain and Congressmen Luis Gutierrez  Jim Kolbe  and Jeff Flake in introducing our bipartisan legislation to reform the nation s immigration laws  The status quo is unacceptable  and we need to modernize our broken immigration system to meet the challenges of the 21st Century  And we need policies that continue to reflect our best values as a nation    of fairness  equal opportunity  and respect for the law    One of the mistakes of the past is to assume we can control illegal immigration on our own  A realistic immigration policy must be a two way street  Under our plan  America will do its part  but we expect Mexico and other nations to do their part  too  to replace an illegal immigration flow with regulated  legal immigration    That s better for American workers  better for American families  and better for American businesses    We all recognize the need for strong border protection and enforcement as part of immigration reform  It directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and implement a National Strategy for Border Security to coordinate the efforts of federal  state  local  and tribal authorities on border management and security  The Strategy will identify the areas most in need of enforcement and propose cost effective ways to defend the border  including better ways of technology  improved intelligence sharing and coordination  It also includes plans to combat human smuggling     Our bill contains an earned legalization program for immigrants  a way to reduce the enormous backlog of petitions to unify families  and a revised temporary worker program  The bill also contains strict border security and enforcement provisions  coupled with measures requiring other countries to help control the flow of their citizens to jobs in the United States    Despite our compromises and bipartisan solutions  there are some who oppose these reforms  They misleadingly categorize our efforts as an amnesty  But  legal status must be earned by proving past work contributions  making a substantial future work commitment  and paying monetary penalties  It is not a guarantee of citizenship  but an opportunity to continue working hard  start playing by the rules  and earn permanent residency     We offer a fair deal  if they are willing to work hard for us openly  then we re willing to do something fair for them  It s long past time to put the underground economy  above ground  and recognize the reality of immigrants in our workforce     And by bringing immigrants out of the shadows so they can earn a fair day s pay for a fair day s work  we are protecting American workers  rights and wages  too    We know that these reforms are long overdue  Americans want and deserve realistic solutions  They don t want open borders  and they don t want closed borders  They want smart borders    We are a nation of immigrants  and we always will be  and our laws must be true to that proud heritage  Our bipartisan bill attempts to do that  and I look forward to working with the Administration and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact it into law    McCain Kennedy Kolbe Flake Gutierrez Bill at a Glance 5 12 2005   Title I  Border
