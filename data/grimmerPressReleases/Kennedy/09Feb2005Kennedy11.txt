         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Washington  D C  Today Senator Kennedy issued the following statement in reaction to the Administrations new estimates on the cost of its Medicare drug program    The Administration s new estimate of the cost of its Medicare drug program makes action on drug importation even more urgent  The problem is not caused by its being too generous toward seniors  In fact  it is not generous enough  Too much of the cost of the program goes to increase the drug industry s already inflated profits     The soaring new cost is more than a fresh blow to the Administration s credibility  it is an indictment of their policy of putting drug industry profits ahead of senior citizens  needs   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
