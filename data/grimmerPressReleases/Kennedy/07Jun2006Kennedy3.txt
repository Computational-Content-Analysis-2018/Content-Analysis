         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                 Washington  DC  The  Earlier this month  a bipartisan majority of Senators approved Senator Kennedys amendment to include  289 million in H R  4939  the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act  to compensate persons injured by a pandemic influenza vaccine  If a flu pandemic begins  the nation will have to call on its first responders   health workers  police officers  firefighters  and others   to take an experimental vaccine so that they can perform their vital work of halting the spread of the disease  Sadly  House Republicans have inexplicably stripped out the funding in conference   Senator Kennedy said  If pandemic flu reaches our shores  American will have to rely on nurses  paramedics  emergency technicians  and other first responders and hope that they will risk taking an experimental vaccine so that they can stay on the job and protect us all  The least that these brave first respondents deserve is fair compensation if they are harmed by the vaccine  We know from past experience that without a compensation program  first respondents will be reluctant to take experimental vaccines  Last month the Senate did the right thing  and funded a compensation program  but Republican leaders have inexplicably rejected the funds in the House  The message now being sent to first respondents is  Youre on your own  and a pandemic will be even more disastrous if it hits   The funding was to undo the damaging impact of action taken last December when a provision was inserted into the DOD appropriations bill to provide sweeping immunity from liability for manufacturers of experimental flu vaccines and related products   This provision purported to provide compensation for first responders and others who might be injured by the vaccine  but it was an empty promise  the compensation program was unfunded  Public Citizen called this action willful misconduct   Kennedys flu liability amendment is supported by a broad coalition of health groups  and unions who represent fire fighters  nurses and police because they understand that without compensation those on the front line will be reluctant to take the vaccines needed minimize the danger of the pandemic           Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633
