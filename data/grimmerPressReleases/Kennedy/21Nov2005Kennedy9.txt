         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     BOSTON  MASSACHUSETTS  Senator Edward M  Kennedy today spoke about the future direction of the health care movement while commemorating the 40th anniversary of the first community health center in the United States at Columbia Point  Addressing community activists  doctors  nurses and medical professionals at the John F  Kennedy Library  Senator Kennedy discussed the importance of setting national standards for quality in health care  harnessing the skyrocketing costs in the industry and ensuring that all people  regardless of race  income or geography  receive the care that they need and deserve  He also outlined the benefits and promise of health information technology and his bill that just passed in the Senate on Friday     We have a responsibility to make the miracles of modern medicine available to every American  As we all know  care declines in quality when physicians do not have access to timely information about the patients they serve  We need to give all health care providers the assistance that they need to invest in lifesaving health information technology  said Senator Kennedy     The Community Health Center movement has roots in the civil rights movement and started with the vision that improved health of our nation s poor and underserved is dependent on social change  Assuring that Americans have access to affordable housing  nutritional food  education and decent paying jobs is the pathway to good health    Still a cornerstone community health is the guarantee that local people have a voice in how their care is provided  Health centers have grown from a two site demonstration project to a national network of over 1 000 community  migrant  and homeless health centers that deliver care to over 15 million people     Last Friday  the United States Senate passed the Wired for Health Care Quality Act of 2005 by unanimous consent  This bipartisan legislation  introduced by Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi  R WY   sets forth the goal posts for improving health care through technology  reducing administrative costs and diminishing fatal errors caused by lack of information  Senator Kennedy has been speaking out on the benefits and need for health information technology since 1977    IT systems are linked securely and with strong privacy protections to a patient s medical records and can improve care by warning a doctor or nurse if an order or prescription may harm a patient  These systems can issue reminders for screening tests  so that needed preventive care is not overlooked  Computerized records also allow doctors to look at a patient s entire medical record at once  improving care coordination in our fragmented health care system  Additionally  the savings from better IT use are enormous  The Federal government s estimate is that the nation would save  140 billion each year from proper IT use     Setting standards and incentives for quality in health care at the federal level is essential so that the benefits can be realized by all our citizens  Since 1965  the community health care movement has in linking people to affordable  quality health care  The community health care movement began with the founding of the Historic Columbia Point Health Center in December of 1965  The community health care movement  once a small project  has developed into the largest unified primary network in the United States  Despite daunting challenges  it is through the work of people at the local level that advancements in modern medicine can spread to all those who deserve care    Even since my first visit to Columbia Point Health Center in the 1960 s  I ve been inspired by the work that you do and the indispensable services you provide  said Senator Kennedy  Day in and day out  you re on the front lines  offering hope to millions of Americans who have no place else to go for good medical care    Kennedy  along with Jack Geiger  Tom Van Coverden and Dan Driscoll  were honored with the Founder s Award for their continued dedication to ensuring access to health care for all            Facts About Health Care and Health Information Technology   Health Care Quality Has Significant Problems     Between 44 000 and 98 000 Americans die each year from inpatient medical errors a The Institute of Medicine        Overall  adult Americans receive recommended care only 55  of the time        Nearly 30  of health care spending  or up to  300 billion each year  is for treatments that may not improve health status  may be redundant  or may be inappropriate for the patient s condition    Health Care is Expensive     National health care spending now exceeds  1 7 trillion per year        Health care spending and health insurance premiums continue to rise at rates much higher than the rate of general inflation    Health Information Technology Improves Quality and Saves Money     Computerized entry of physician orders such as prescriptions can reduce adverse drug reactions by 75         Automated computerized reminders can increased physicians use of recommended medical interventions by up to 46       Savings in the range of  140 billion per year  close to 10 percent of total U S  health spending  could be achieved through widespread adoption of health IT        System wide savings would result in a reduction of  700 in family in medical insurance premiums per year      Health Information Technology is Underutilized     Only 10  of hospitals have operational computerized prescribing systems  with another 20  currently installing them  This means 70  do not use these systems        The United States ranks just 12th in adoption of health information technology when compared to 15 European Countries    The Wired for Health Care Quality Act  S  1418    Background   The need to invest in modernizing health care cannot be ignored any longer  Patient care declines in quality when physicians do not have access to timely information about the patients they serve  Health care costs skyrocket when tests or procedures are duplicated because critical records are missing or inaccessible  Wasting scarce health care dollars on needless administrative costs drives up insurance premiums  and means that care is less affordable and less available    IT systems linked securely and with strong privacy protections to a patient s medical records can improve care by warning a doctor or nurse if an order or prescription may harm a patient  These systems can issue reminders for screening tests  so that needed preventive care is not overlooked  Computerized records also allow doctors to look at a patient s entire medical record at once  improving care coordination in our fragmented health care system    The savings from better IT use are enormous  The Federal government s estimate is that the nation would save  140 billion each year from proper IT use  These savings from health IT could cut the cost of a family s insurance policy by over  700  Despite the benefits of investment in health IT  utilization is low  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act will give health care providers the assistance they need to invest in lifesaving health IT    The legislation helps develop standards for IT and improves Federal use of health IT by     Requiring the developments of standards on interoperability and other technical measures for health IT system  and establishing a public private consultation to develop those standards      Authorizing in statute the National Coordinator for Health IT     Requiring all Federal IT purchases to conform to these standards    The legislation assures strong privacy protections for patient data kept in electronic form by     Forbidding funding under the bill to any IT system that lacks strong privacy and security protections     Requiring recipients of funding to notify patients if their medical information is wrongfully disclosed     Requiring that the national strategy on health IT includes strong privacy protections  including methods to notify patients if their medical information is wrongfully disclosed    The legislation provides financial assistance to cash strapped providers to enhance their use of IT systems that meet these technical standards by     Giving grants to financially needy providers to enhance their use of health IT     Providing financial assistance to establish regional health IT networks     Creating an innovative Federal State public private partnership to modernize the health care system by allowing States to fund low interest loans to help health care professionals in financial need acquire the health care IT systems that will improve the quality and efficiency of health care    The legislation will help providers improve use of IT to improve quality by     Establishing a Best Practices Center where IT users can learn from the previous experience of others who have established regional health IT networks     Setting up a Help line at HHS to assist providers with technical questions on implementing IT systems and complying with technical requirements     Funding novel training programs to help train health professionals at the start of their careers in better use of IT     Establishing a certification program so that providers can quickly determine whether particular IT systems meet the applicable technical standards     Developing risk adjusted measures of health care quality through extensive consultation with health professionals  and providing for reporting of the degree to which health care providers receiving funds achieve those measures     Studying licensure requirements of physicians to see if these impose barriers to better use of health IT and telemedicine    Trials and Tribulations of the 40 year Health Center Movement Milestones   1965   The Columbia Point Health Center  opens its doors in Dorchester  MA  with the help of Dr  Jack Geiger and Dr  Count Gibson  Jr   whose efforts also lead to the founding of the Mound Bayou Health Center in the Mississippi Delta in 1966    1966   Senator Kennedy succeeds in earmarking  51 million in the Office of Economic Opportunity legislation to fund the development of 33 more Community Health Centers  CHC     1967 1971   Funding for CHC continues to spread across the country  reaching 150 centers serving 1 7 million people nationwide and 17 CHC in Massachusetts alone    1972   The Massachusetts League of CHC  also known as The League  is established as a private non profit organization to help coordinate the rapid expansion of community health centers in the Boston area  The National Association of Community Health Centers  NACHC  is also established as an advocacy and technical assistance group for the centers  further strengthening the growth of CHC    1975    After a two year battle against federal efforts to eliminate support for the health centers  Congress overrides former President Richard Nixon s veto and approves the authorization of Community Health Centers in Public Law 94 63  sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy  Among other provisions  the law defines the term community health center  establishes standards of health care quality for CHC and the importance of migrant and community mental health centers  and credits the community as being an agent of change by requiring  for the first time in legislation  that the majority of CHC board members represent the community in which the health center is based    1981   CHC begin their battle against attempts by former President Ronald Reagan s administration to block grant community health center fundingwhich they finally win in 1986 with the repeal of the Primary Care Block Grant     1989    Congress establishes the Medicaid Federally Qualified Health Center Program in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989  followed by the Medicare FQHC Program in 1990    1995   Nine hundred Federally Qualified Health Centers are serving 9 3 million patients in the United States    1998   CHC join the fight against racial and ethnic health disparities by forming a Health Disparities Collaborative targeting chronic diseases     2001 2005   In both Congress and the Administration  bi partisan support for the expansion of health centers continues  Today  according to the NACHC  more than 1 000 Community Health Centers now exist nationwide serving over 15 million patients  60 percent of whom are people of color    Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy    As prepared for delivery    Trials and Tribulations of the 40 Year Health Center Movement   Monday  November 21  2005   Thank you  Jim Hunt  for that generous introduction and for your own leadership on health centers over the years  and thank you  Tom Van Coverden  for all you ve done for health centers as well     I also commend the pioneering work of other renowned leaders of the community health center movement  especially Jack Geiger and Count Gibson who founded the first two community health centers in the nation  Dan Driscoll for all he s done to strengthening health centers in our Commonwealth  Dan Hawkins and many other activist and heroes in community health     I m especially grateful to our many supporters in Congress on both sides of the aisle on behalf who fought off the threats and successfully expanded the role community health centers in proving better health care to the nation s poor and underserved    Today  community health centers are more vital than ever as a safety net for over 15 million people  As I said forty years ago on the first anniversary of the health center at Columbia Point  You have not only assured the best in health care for your families and neighbors  but you have also begun a minor revolution in American medicine     Constantly fighting the fight on behalf of fellow citizens  the health center movement has grown from a two site demonstration project in 1965 to a thousand centers in 2005  With roots in the civil rights movement and the goal of lasting social change  the Columbia Point and Mound Bayou clinics not only provided health care  but also taught people to organize themselves  Center staff worked with community leaders to create needed programs such as farm cooperatives  nutritional counseling  legal aid  affordable housing  early Head Start  and better continuing education for health professionals  For the first time  low income and people of color had a real voice in how their health care is designed and delivered    State and national coordination of health center expansions was solidified by the establishment of the Mass League in 1970 and the National Association of Community Health Centers in 1971     The growth has not been easy  Movements to eliminate such centers began in the Nixon administration in the early 1970s  We prevailed and local power was guaranteed by enactment of the 51  consumer governing requirements  which tie each health center closely to the people it serves    The next assault on health centers came in 1981  with President Reagan s efforts to block grant their funding  We won that to  and in 1989 and 1990  we strengthened the finances of health centers by including them in Medicaid and Medicare    Despite other challenges such as managed care  the movement continues strong  Today  the centers serve over 15 million of our neediest citizens in communities across American  They ve joined the battle against pervasive health disparities by targeting chronic diseases plaguing our nation s racial and ethnic minorities  Today  health centers have bipartisan support in Congress and the support of the White House     It s easy to imagine what health care in the United States would look like today without each of you and the impressive work you do  We d have higher rates of AIDS  greater more infant mortality  and far more drug abuse  Emergency rooms would be much more crowded with patients needing care  One out of every ten persons in Massachusetts and millions of other Americans every day would have no chance for the kind of quality  compassionate care you deliver  Thanks to Community Health Centers none of that is true    The burden is especially great because the nation still has no satisfactory solution to the health care crisis facing America today  Sadly  the Administration is pushing an agenda that would undermine the health care that millions of families count on every day  They want to cut Medicaid by  10 billion and use greater cost sharing to shift most of the burden of financing health care to the poor and vulnerable  Funding for next year falls short  endangering many existing health centers and bringing the creation of new centers and the expansion of existing centers to a halt    Since the Administration took office  five million Americans have lost their health coverage  The number of uninsured has climbed to 46 million  with no end in sight  The number of Americans living in poverty is also soaring  Without what you provide each and every day  many of them would have no health care at all    Even those who have insurance are often just a paycheck away from losing it  Millions of workers watch in frustration as annual premiums keep rising  Health insurance for a typical family costs more than  10 000 a year  Too many Americans can t buy health insurance at any cost  because their employer doesn t offer coverage or because they have serious health problems that make them ineligible    The administration consistently puts the profits of the insurance industry and pharmaceutical companies above needs of the elderly  poor and sick  Million of senior citizens and disabled Americans on Medicare were reminded of this last week when the new prescription drug coverage began  There s still too much confusion and too few answers for seniors as they struggle to make critical decisions about their financial and medical future  Massachusetts has more than 50 different variations of plans for seniors to choose from    The images from New Orleans after Katrina were a shocking reminder that the American dream remains out of reach for millions of working Americans  The incompetence and callous indifference in handling the disaster has become a vivid reminder of the huge problems we face     The issues you and I care about deserve higher priority in Congress  Ever since my first visit to Columbia Point Health Center in Massachusetts in the 1960s  I ve been inspired by the work you do and the indispensable services you provide  Day in and day out  you re on the front lines  offering hope to millions of Americans who have no place else to go for good medical care     Health center authorization will be a priority in Congress next year  Funds for new health centers are important  and we also need to make sure that existing centers are not forced to shut down for lack of funds  We should continue to build new centers  But we also have an obligation to support the centers we already have  which struggle each day just to keep their doors open and meet the growing needs of their communities     Americans deserve affordable health coverage  Health centers should not have to bear the even heavier burden that will result if employers abandon the long standing principles of providing insurance on the job  We also need to make sure that Medicaid continues strong in providing coverage for so many of your patients    We need to protect the role of the community in health center governance as well  to guarantee that your patients have a role in how their care is provided    Solutions depend partly on innovations at the local and state level and once again  Massachusetts is leading the way in improving the quality  accessibility and affordability of health care  Now that the House and Senate have each passed health reform bills  I m optimistic that affordable health care will soon be a reality for all our people    Congress can also lead with innovative solutions  We have a responsibility to make the miracles of modern medicine available to every American  Last week the Wired for Health Care Quality Act of 2005 passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent  This bill will improve the care that patients receive  as we know that care declines in quality when physicians do not have access to timely information about the patients they serve  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act of 2005 will give health care providers the assistance they need to invest in lifesaving health IT    As you know well  the battle for better health reform has never been easy  Each year  I continue to be inspired by all of you who dedicate your lives to caring for our fellow citizens who have no other place to turn for good care     We ve taken many steps together  and I look forward to taking many more with you  We ll never acquiesce in a health care system that s the best in the world for the fortunate few  but second or third rate for countless millions of our fellow citizens  All Americans deserve the right to decent care  Other nations respect that right  and it s way past time for Uncle Sam to respect it too      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
