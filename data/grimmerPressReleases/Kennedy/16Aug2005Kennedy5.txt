         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent a letter to the U S  Department of Justice calling for an immediate investigation into the missing Affirmative Action documents referred to in the August 15 cover letter accompanying John Roberts  documents from the National Archives and Records Administration  NARA      The missing files  titled Affirmative Action Correspondence  had been in possession of unnamed Administration officials in mid July  presumably before John Roberts was nominated to the Supreme Court     With only a few weeks left to review these important documents  Senator Kennedy sent the following letter to the DOJ requesting a speedy investigation into this matter  The text of the letter is provided below    August 16  2005   Glenn A  Fine  U  S  Department of Justice  Office of the Inspector General  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Suite 4706  Washington  DC 20530   H  Marshall Jarrett U S  Department of Justice  Office of Professional Responsibility  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Suite 3529 Washington  D C  20530    Dear Mr  Fine and Mr  Jarrett    The cover letter which accompanied the August 15  2005  release by the National Archives and Records Administration of John Roberts  documents from the Reagan Presidential Library stated that NARA was unable to locate a folder entitled Affirmative Action Correspondence which had been in the possession of unnamed administration officials during the review process  We understand that in addition to White House personnel  those officials may have included Department of Justice personnel     Although NARA believes that it has located other copies in its files of some or all of the missing documents  there remains the question of what happened to the original documents  Given the importance of the documents  and their disappearance in the context of a highly controversial Supreme Court nomination  where the nominee s opposition to accepted remedies for discrimination may well be a key issue  I request that you conduct an immediate and expedited investigation into their disappearance     Given the short timeline for consideration of the nomination  I ask that you confirm promptly that one or both of your offices will speedily investigate the matter     As always  thank you for your assistance      Respectfully     Edward M  Kennedy    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
