         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Today marks an anniversary none of us wanted to see  It has been five long years since the Bush Administration denied hope to millions of Americans by imposing arbitrary restrictions on lifesaving stem cell research  For five years  those restrictions have blocked progress on new cures   Last month  the President was given a chance to reconsider    a chance to promote life and healing that stem cells can offer   But on stem cell research  as in so many other areas  the Bush Administration refused to seek a second opinion  Instead of changing an obviously flawed policy  the President vetoed a bill that offered new hope for the child with diabetes struggling with daily insulin injections  new hope for the patient afflicted with the tremors of Parkinson s Disease  and new hope for families across America praying for a better life and a brighter tomorrow for loved ones affected by disease   Sadly  Republicans in the House of Representatives sided with the President and upheld his veto of hope  Congress may be away for the summer  but this issue won t go away  We ll try again and again and again to change the President s policy  The fact that the Republican Congress won t override their President    even when he is so clearly wrong  is another undeniable sign that America needs a new direction       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
