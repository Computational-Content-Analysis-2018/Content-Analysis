         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today  the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for juvenile persons    17 years old or younger  I commend the Court for its wise and courageous decision  Three years ago  the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the execution of the mentally retarded  In reaching that decision  the Court emphasized the large number of states that had enacted laws prohibiting executions of the retarded after 1989  when the Court had earlier declined to hold them unconstitutional  As the Court observed in reaching its decision three years ago to ban them  It is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against such executions   The Court cited several factors showing why executing the mentally retarded is unconstitutional      Mentally retarded persons lack the capacity to fully appreciate the consequences of their actions      They are less able to control their impulses and learn from experience  and are therefore less likely to be deterred by the death penalty      They are more likely to give false confessions  and less able to give meaningful assistance to their lawyers   Today  the Supreme Court recognized that this logic also applies to the execution of juveniles  The Court cited a number of factors    including the rejection of the juvenile death penalty in the majority of States  the infrequency of its use even where it remains legal  and the consistency of the trend toward abolition of the practice  It concluded that these factors provide sufficient evidence that today our society views juveniles  in the words used respecting the mentally retarded  as  categorically less culpable than the average criminal    Today s ruling is a welcome victory for justice and human rights  Since the death penalty was reinstated in the United States in 1976  there have been 21 executions of juvenile offenders  In the last five years  only the United States  Iran  the Democratic Republic of Congo  and China have executed a juvenile offender  It is long past time that we wipe this stain from our nation s human rights record   Other steps need to be taken as well to reform our system of capital punishment   For too long  our courts have tolerated a shamefully low standard for legal representation in death penalty cases  Some judges have even refused to order relief in cases where the defense lawyer slept through substantial portions of the trial   I m hopeful that the legislation proposed by our colleagues Patrick Leahy and Gordon Smith in the Senate  and Bill Delahunt and Ray LaHood in the House  and signed into law by the President last year  will serve to improve the quality of counsel in capital cases   I m heartened by the strong statement in President Bush s State of the Union Address last month in support of that program  I m also encouraged by the President s pledge to dramatically expand the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful convictions   As we work together to remedy the most flagrant defects in the application of the death penalty  however  we must never lose sight of its basic injustice  Experience shows that continued imposition of the death penalty will inevitably lead to wrongful executions  Many of us are concerned about the racial disparities in the imposition of capital punishment and the wide disparities in the states in its application  The unequal  unfair  arbitrary and discriminatory use of the death penalty is completely contrary to our nation s commitment to fairness and equal justice for all  and we need to do all we can to correct these fundamental flaws
