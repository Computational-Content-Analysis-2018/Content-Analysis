         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   As Prepared for Delivery   I thank the Chairman for holding this very important  hearing and I thank our witnesses for testifying today  I know that it cannot  be easy to come before this Committee under these circumstances United  States attorneys have an indispensable role in the enforcement of federal law   They protect us from violent crime  terrorism  organized crime  public  corruption  and violations of basic civil rights  Traditionally  they have  practiced law in the district in which they serve  Most often  they are leading  members of the local bar who have distinguished themselves in public service or  private practice  They bring to their positions an understanding of their local  legal system that is indispensable to their effectiveness United States  Attorneys must be above partisan or ethical reproach  Many bring to the office  some background in political activity  but it is essential for the public to  have full confidence in their experience in the law and their ability and  commitment to enforce the law effectively  Above all  its the responsibility  of a United States Attorney to see that justice is done and to preserve the  confidence of the American people in our system of justice  Recently   the Bush Administration fired eight U S  Attorneys  seven on the same day  In  the weeks that followed  the Administration has offered a series of shifting  explanations for the dismissals  First  the Attorney General denied before the  Judiciary Committee that he would ever fire a U S  Attorney for political  reasons or to curtail an investigation  Soon after that  Deputy Attorney  General Paul McNulty testified before the Committee that all but one of the  prosecutors were dismissed based on inadequacies in their performance  He  acknowledged that Bud Cummins had been dismissed in Arkansas solely so that Karl  Roves deputy  who previously served as the director of opposition research for  the Republican National Committee  could have the job  Whether this replacement  was simply an unseemly effort to give a young GOP operative a credential or  whether there was something more at play we do not yet know We  subsequently learned that nearly all of the dismissed U S  Attorneys had  received glowing evaluations in the regular performance evaluation process of  the Department of Justice  The Department acknowledged that the fired  prosecutors had positive performance assessments  but contended that most had  failed in some way to carry out Department of Justice priorities  We have now  begun to hear  and I expect we will hear a lot more today  from the dismissed  U S  Attorneys that they did not receive any indication from the Department that  their performances were inadequate From the start  there has been  considerable concern that several of the dismissed U S  Attorneys were involved  in significant public corruption investigations  Carol Lam in San Diego had  prosecuted Randy Duke Cunningham  and was close to indicting others at the time  she was told of her dismissal  It has been reported that two Republican members  of the New Mexico congressional delegation called U S  Attorney Iglesias to ask  about the progress of public corruption indictments in October  shortly before  the election  He has suggested that his rejection of those overtures may have  led to his firing  The succession of shifting explanations offered by  the Department only deepens concern that we do not yet know the true reason for  some of these dismissals  It may be that the real reasons lie in performance  deficiencies  failure to meet Department priorities  failure to pursue  corruption or other investigations aggressively enough  or the desire to open  positions for others  Unfortunately  because these explanations have been  offered one after another  they have generated deep suspicion that there is more  to this story and that we do not know the whole truth  These  dismissals are deeply disturbing in and of themselves  but they are even more  troubling because of the pattern of partisan and ideological hiring that has  been the hallmark of the Department of Justice in this Administration  Attorney  General Ashcroft abolished the honors hiring procedure for attorneys instituted  by the Eisenhower Administration half a century ago to guarantee merit hiring  and prevent partisanship and cronyism  Since then  an alarming pattern  of partisan and ideological hiring in the Civil Rights Division  for example   has allowed partisanship to influence enforcement of the Voting Rights Act  We  cant afford to let the same corrupt practices undermine confidence in the fair  enforcement of the federal criminal and civil laws by our U S   Attorneys We cannot allow the Administration to play politics with the  administration of justice or to use the Department of Justice as an employment  bureau that can be exploited for political gain  We can not allow the  Administration to sacrifice the fair  impartial and effective enforcement of our  laws so that young political operatives can gain a credential We still  have much to learn about these dismissals  I am confident that todays hearing  will be an important step in uncovering the  truth      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202 224 2633
