         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC  Last night  the Senate unanimously approved a measure by Senators Richard Lugar and Edward Kennedy that would increase the number of visas allotted to Iraqi and Afghan translators  Because of their service to the United States  translators are in mortal danger every day in Iraq and Afghanistan  Under the current program  only 50 translators for the U S  Mlitary a year from Iraq and Afghanistan are eligible for admission to the United States  and currently there is a nine year backlog  The amendment authorizes 500 visas a year for the current fiscal year 2007 and for the next two years  It also authorizes the State Department to recommend translators for admission to the U S  The passage of this legislation comes just days before the UNHCR is holding an international conference on Iraqi Refugees in Geneva to begin to formulate an international response to the massive crisis  Senator Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration  Border Security  and Refugees  held the first Congressional hearing on Iraqi refugees in January and has lead the charge for the U S  to help solve this emerging crisis  America has a strong obligation to keep faith with the Iraqis and Afghans who have worked so bravely with us  and have often paid a terrible price for it  Translators have been the eyes and ears of our military  and they have saved American lives  Senator Kennedy said  They now have a target on their back because of their service to our country  and we need to protect them by granting them safe refuge in the United States  Sen  Dick Lugar became interested in the issue after receiving emails from Indiana National Guard Lieutenant Aaron Inkenbrandt  who had recently returned from a tour in Iraq  and from a sergeant in the Army who was at the time serving in a Combat Support Hospital  also in Iraq  Foreign nationals who are willing to risk their lives and those of their family members by supporting our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve recognition  Lugar said  The life threatening conditions our Foreign Service Nationals face prompted me to write to the Secretary of State last July about the issue  I encouraged her to develop a policy to address these various situations and suggest legislative language  The United States has an experience and tradition in this respect from past wars that provides precedent and guidance  The bill is not intended to address the much broader massive refugee crisis unfolding in Iraq  Already more than 2 million Iraqis have fled the country  and nearly 2 million more have been displaced internally  Senator Kennedy believes that while the U S  cannot take all of these refugees  we have an obligation to lead an international effort to solve this crisis The bill was co sponsored by Kit Bond  R MO   Pat Leahy  D VT   Norm Coleman  R MN   Joe Lieberman  D CT   Johnny Isakson  R GA   Gordon Smith  R OR   Carl Levin  D MI   John Sununu  R NH   John Cornyn  R TX  and Chuck Hagel  R NE       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
