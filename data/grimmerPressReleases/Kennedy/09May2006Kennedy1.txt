         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    224 NATIONAL GROUPS  41 ATTORNEY GENERALS and 8 INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS OPPOSE THE BILL   Washington  DC  Today  as the Republican health bill reaches the Senate floor  Senator Kennedy led the fight to oppose it because it would raise the premiums and lower the benefits for millions of Americans who already have health coverage today  Although the bill has been presented as legislation for small businesses  the effects of this bill go far beyond the small business plans and would sweep away important protections for patients in every state regulated insurance market  Senator Kennedy opposes the plan and his colleagues have offered an alternative bill to give small business real help and assistance to provide meaningful health coverage  The bill the Senate considers today undermines our progress on healthcare  Senator Kennedy said  Its supporters say that the legislation is about helping small business  But the legislation the Senate considers today isn t an advance    it s a retreat  It s a retreat from our commitment to cancer  It s a retreat from our commitment to diabetes  It s a retreat from our commitment to mental health parity  We re here today to say that quality  affordable health care should be the right of each and every American  Kennedy joined a rally of leading health advocacy groups who are working to defeat the bill because it is a major step backwards in the effort to provide better healthcare in this country  In addition to the advocates  forty one attorney generals and eighteen Insurance Commissioners oppose the bill  Democrats have offered a comprehensive alternative S 1955  The Small Employers Health Benefits Plan  S 2510  would allow small businesses with up to 100 employees to band together for lower health care prices by pooling their purchasing power and spreading their risk over a large number of participants  Attached is Senator Kennedy s remarks from the press conference  a letter of opposition signed by 224 advocacy groups  and a summary of the bill     REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY RALLY ON ENZI NELSON BILL   As Prepared for Delivery     We re here today to say that quality  affordable health care should be the birthright of each and every American    And we re going to fight for that right this week in the United States Senate    It s high time for the big insurance companies and drug companies and the special interests to get out of the way  It s time at long last for every American to have access to the best care  best treatment  and best cures that medicine has to offer    Isn t that what we re for    Isn t that what we re all about    But the bill the Senate considers today undermines our progress    Its supporters say that the legislation is about helping small business  But the legislation the Senate considers today isn t an advance    it s a retreat    It s a retreat from our commitment to cancer    It s a retreat from our commitment to diabetes    It s a retreat from our commitment to mental health parity    Let me ask you this  Are you going to let the Senate retreat from quality health care

sleeves for progress this week    for your health care  for your family s health care  for the nation s health care             May 8  2006   Dear Senator    The undersigned organizations are writing in opposition to the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act  S  1955  This controversial legislation would preempt state insurance laws  not just in the small group market  as is done by Association Health Plan legislation   but also in the individual and large group markets  S  1955 would eliminate all the progress states have made to ensure that consumers have adequate health coverage     S  1955 would take away the states  power to regulate health insurance  The bill preempts benefit  service and provider laws that states have enacted to ensure that consumers have adequate health coverage  Coverage for cancer screenings and treatment  diabetes supplies and education  mental health  preventive care  rehabilitation  well child care and immunizations  maternity care  and other important health care needs would be lost  S  1955 also exempts Small Business Health Plans  SBHPs  also known as AHPs  from state benefit  service and provider access laws     Insurance companies  instead of state elected legislators  would now decide the benefits that consumers should have when they purchase health care  States would have no recourse to protect their own residents and they would lose any incentive to enact protective health insurance laws in the future and be laboratories for healthcare innovation    An insurer would only need to meet one requirement in order to bypass a state s protections  offer a second plan that resembles a plan offered to state employees in one of the five most populous states  There are no limits on the cost sharing an insurer can charge  nor is there a requirement that the plan be comprehensive  In fact  an insurer could choose a high deductible HSA plan  an option now available to employees in at least one of the five most populous states  Again  a state has no recourse if this so called enhanced option does not meet the needs of its residents     S  1955 also would preempt stronger state laws that limit the ability of insurers to vary premiums based on health status  age  gender and geography  For many older  sicker Americans and those with complex health needs and disabilities  this would price them out of the health insurance market  undermining the stated purpose of the legislation  The bill imposes on all the states an outdated model law created by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  NAIC   rather than using the NAIC s current model standard that is more protective    While the sponsors of S  1955 have attempted to address the shortcomings of the AHP legislation  their solution makes things worse by endangering the quality of health care for the 68 million Americans in state regulated group health plans and 16 5 million Americans with individual coverage  A bill that preempts over 1 000 state laws  raises premiums for those who need coverage the most  and leaves people uninsured for certain diseases  basic preventive care and events such as pregnancy  should be rejected     We urge your opposition to this legislation    Sincerely    National Partnership for Women  Families 9 to 5 Association for Working Women Action Alliance of Senior Citizens of

Press Contact  Barry Piatt  4 2551     Released May 5  2006   Senate Democrats have a longstanding commitment to making health care affordable for all and are committed to addressing the unique and serious challenges small businesses face trying to find affordable health insurance  But while there is bipartisan support for addressing this problem  the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act  HIMMA   S  1955  takes the wrong approach and could make a bad situation worse for many small businesses and for millions of other Americans who could lose health benefits on which they rely  Instead of making health coverage more affordable for all small business employees  S  1955 would reduce access to important health benefits and substantially increase premiums for people who need health coverage the most  S  1955 goes far beyond small business coverage  gutting state regulation of health insurance in all markets  thereby undermining critical benefits and protections for consumers    Under HIMMA  carefully constructed insurance rules that states have adopted  and continue to support  would be preempted by new federal rules  The authority to set standards for adequate health benefits and fair premium rates would be taken out of the hands of state governors and legislatures and replaced with greater latitude for insurers  Specifically  S  1955       Preempts existing state benefit requirements that assure consumers that their health insurance will provide sufficient protection against the cost of illness and cover preventive services that help identify medical problems at earlier  more treatable stages       Preempts requirements in many states that ensure fair and stable insurance premiums by limiting the factors such as age  health status  and gender that insurers can use in setting premiums and limiting the variation that insurers can charge different groups       Creates a process  in which the interests of insurers would be represented but the concerns of consumers would be given little voice  that would establish federal standards for other consumer protections typically regulated by states such as  form and rate filing requirements  which help states prevent insurers from selling products that do not comply with state rules   market conduct reviews  prompt payment of claims  and internal reviews       Envisions that states would enact the federal standards in the bill or  if they do not  allows insurers to operate according to the federal standards  regardless of state requirements     While the proposed changes may reduce premiums for some groups  they would increase premiums and out of pocket costs for others  especially those who need health coverage the most  Preempting these state laws would reduce much of the risk sharing that many states now require  which would force older and sicker groups to cover a greater share of health care costs    Reduces access to critical benefits  HIMMA replaces state benefit requirements with a new standard that would allow insurers and small business health plans to offer basic benefit plans  that would not have to include state required benefits  as long as they also make available an enhanced benefit plan  which would be equivalent to one of the benefit plans available to state employees in one of the five most populous states   While preempting state benefit requirements may provide some benefit to healthy groups who do not need those benefits at this time  premium savings would likely be modest since required benefits typically do not add much to the overall cost of health insurance  In addition  it undermines the reason most people want health insurance in the first place    to help cover their costs if they become sick  Moreover  preempting state benefit requirements would substantially increase health costs for people who require those benefits  The bill would create adverse selection problems  trigger a race to the bottom  and would likely hinder access to critical health care services      States have taken steps to ensure that health insurance sold in their states provides adequate protection for those who need it  States have required insurers to cover certain benefits  services  and health care providers  such as cancer screenings  maternity care  mental health services  well child care  costs related to clinical trials  and diabetes supplies and education  By requiring all health plans to cover these benefits  the cost is spread across all insured groups and  therefore  these benefits are more affordable for people who need them       The new standard in S  1955 would create a serious adverse selection problem  healthy groups would join bare bones plans  and older and sicker groups would join enhanced benefit plans  although there is no guarantee that these enhanced plans will actually offer comprehensive coverage   Insurers already will have an incentive and the freedom to price enhanced benefit plans at unaffordable rates and  as healthy groups shift to bare bones plans  premiums would spiral upward for enhanced benefit plans because healthy groups would no longer be helping to cover their cost  Older and sicker groups would have to pay substantially more than they do today for comprehensive coverage and may find themselves unable to afford premiums for the health plans that cover their health care needs       By no longer requiring that all insurance policies provide adequate health benefits  S  1955 would trigger a race to the bottom  Competitive pressures and a need to avoid adverse selection will provide a strong incentive for insurers to offer health plans with minimal coverage  No insurer will want to offer a health plan that older and sicker groups would be attracted to  With the proliferation of bare bones plans  more people will have health coverage that will not protect them when they need it  Inadequate coverage could prevent patients from obtaining needed medical care or expose them to unmanageable out of pocket costs       While supporters of HIMMA note that insurers will also have to offer an enhanced benefit plan  this requirement provides no protection for patients who are likely to need state required benefits  The bill provides no assurance that enhanced plans will be affordable and  as noted above  the adverse selection problem almost ensures that they will be unaffordable  There is nothing in the bill  for example  that would prevent an insurer from offering an enhanced plan with a deductible of thousands of dollars  Also  the standard for an enhanced benefit plan is a tenuous one  If one of the five most populous states decides to offer its state workers an option of a slimmed down benefit plan that excludes important benefits  then the enhanced benefit standard in all states would be similarly reduced  Decisions taken in one state would effectively set health care coverage standards for all other states     Increases premiums to older and less healthy groups  The bill preempts state premium setting rules and replaces them with an outdated guideline that would undercut efforts by many states to make premiums more affordable and stable for those who need health coverage the most  S  1955 would give insurers in many states greater latitude to charge higher rates to less healthy people  older groups  women  small businesses with fewer workers  and higher risk industries      States have taken different approaches to setting rules for establishing premium rates  Some states permit insurers to charge older and sicker groups much higher premiums than healthy groups  while other states place stricter limits on the premiums that insurers can charge different groups  Each state s decision reflects its determination about what constitutes a fair premium and to what extent healthy groups should help cover the cost of more expensive groups       S  1955 preempts state rating rules for small groups and replaces them with an outdated model act developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  NAIC  in 1993  S  1955 would permit insurers and small business health plans to charge premiums that are much higher for older and sicker groups than healthy groups  The bill permits premiums to vary     25 percent within a class of business  for groups with similar characteristics  and     20 percent between classes  Insurers could increase rates further on the basis of age  gender  geographic area  and group size  According to some estimates  the rating rules in HIMMA would allow insurers and small business health plans to charge some groups as much as 25 times more than others   Memo from the Deputy Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Insurance to the NAIC  March 13  2006       NAIC itself has rejected the rating model that HIMMA would impose nationwide  Instead of recommending rating bands  as it did in 1993  it now recommends adjusted community rating  which does not allow rating to be based on health status  The new NAIC model sets stricter limits on how much insurers can vary premiums than the original 1993 model  yet S  1955 allows insurers to follow the outdated NAIC standard  Furthermore  only four states currently follow the health and industry ratings requirements in the 1993 NAIC model  Many other states modified the 1993 NAIC model before enacting these rating rules in their state  setting additional limits on how much insurers can charge certain groups   Kofman and Pollitz  April 2006       The lenient rating rules in S  1955 means older and less healthy groups in states that have enacted more protective rating rules  e g   adjusted and pure community rating or tighter rating bands  would be charged dramatically higher premiums than they would be under current rules  Ten states currently have adjusted or pure community rating for all insurers in the small group market while two additional states require adjusted community rating for certain insurers  Many other states have rating bands that place more limits on insurers  ability to charge higher premiums based on medical needs  industry  employer size  age  gender and other factors than the 1993 NAIC model used by S  1955   Kofman and Pollitz  Georgetown University  April 2006       New Hampshire s experience provides a cautionary tale about possible consequences of shifting from adjusted community rating to rating bands similar to those proposed under S  1955  When New Hampshire shifted from adjusted community rating to rating bands in 2003  premiums increased dramatically for many small businesses with older and less healthy workers  New Hampshire lawmakers responded by repealing the rate bands in 2005 and restoring adjusted community rating rules  Now S  1955 would force New Hampshire to adopt again the rating bands that the state just rejected   Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  April 26  2006       S  1955 would also leave in place some of the obstacles that self employed people face when trying to find affordable and accessible health coverage  While the self employed could join SBHPs  these plans would have to abide by state rating and underwriting rules  Self employed individuals in states that do not guarantee issue could find that an insurer excludes them from coverage or that the premium charged by an insurer is unaffordable because of the lenient rating rules in the state s individual market     Opens the door for fraud and abuse  Small employers can be prime targets for health coverage scams  States play a leading role in identifying and shutting down unlicensed health insurers    which can promise affordable coverage but leave policyholders with large unpaid medical bills    as well as ensuring that licensed health plans adhere to state insurance requirements  The inadequate oversight and enforcement mechanisms in S  1955 could create opportunities for bad actors to take advantage of small businesses seeking affordable health coverage       Attorneys General in 41 states have expressed their strong opposition to S  1955  which they said will erode state oversight of health insurance plans and eliminate consumer protections in the areas of mandated benefits and internal grievance procedures  They noted that after Congress exempted Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements  MEWAs  from state law in the 1970s  at least 398 000 consumers were left with more than  123 million in unpaid claims   National Association of Attorneys General letter  April 27  2006       HIMMA would establish federal standards but not provide federal authority or resources to enforce those standards  Instead  the bill s supporters envision that state officials will monitor and enforce federal standards that they did not create and may not agree with  With no provisions for a back up enforcement role for the federal government  the bill creates the possibility of a regulatory vacuum with little or no oversight of insurers       The bill contains a strong disincentive for states to conduct rigorous oversight and enforcement  Insurers would be given the right to sue states in federal court when they disagree with the interpretations or actions of state regulators  However  consumers would be denied this same access to federal court  The bill includes no federal cause of action for consumers to go to federal court to ensure that insurers adhere to the federal standards       The bill would deem a small business health plan  SBHP  to be federally certified if the Department of Labor does not act on its application within 90 days  Given the short timeframe and limited resources  it is unclear how thoroughly the Department of Labor could review a SBHP s application     Would be less effective at lowering costs and expanding coverage than alternative proposals  By focusing solely on providing health coverage through multiple association plans and lacking any financial assistance for small businesses  S  1955 will be less successful than alternatives like legislation sponsored by Senators Durbin and Lincoln  S  2510  at giving small businesses some of the same advantages that large businesses have      Small businesses have an especially difficult time affording health insurance and are typically charged higher premiums than large groups  Because of their smaller size  they are less able to achieve administrative economies of scale  spread risk  and negotiate better rates       S  1955 is likely to be less effective in addressing key obstacles small businesses face    higher administrative costs and lack of bargaining power    than the Durbin Lincoln bill  S  1955 envisions administrative savings and bargaining power coming from the formation of multiple association based small business plans  But the Durbin Lincoln bill would create a much larger insurance pool  available to all small businesses with fewer than 100 workers  that would be better able to lower administrative costs through economies of scale and to negotiate lower rates through enhanced bargaining power   Nichols  April 6  2006       S  1955 would  as noted earlier  not address some of the obstacles that self employed people face when trying to find affordable and accessible health coverage  While the self employed could join SBHPs  these plans would have to abide by state rating and underwriting rules  which could make coverage unaffordable or inaccessible  especially for the self employed who are older or in less than perfect health  In contrast  the Durbin Lincoln bill would allow the self employed to participate in its large small employer pool and benefit from guarantee issue and adjusted community rating       S  1955 also does not provide a health insurance tax credit to small businesses whereas the Durbin Lincoln bill would provide a tax credit to employers on behalf of low wage workers that would be equal to 25 percent of the cost of self only policies  30 percent of premiums for employees who are either married or are single with a child  and 35 percent for family policies  To be eligible  employers would have to agree to pay at least 60 percent of each employee s health insurance premium  The Durbin Lincoln bill also includes a temporary reinsurance pool that would cover much of the cost of high cost claims    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
