         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Washington  DC  Senator Edward M  Kennedy has introduced legislation to protect Massachusetts  nurses from being forced to work mandatory overtime and will protect patients from the dangers caused by overworked nurses  The Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act will improve the lives of nurses and their families and enhance the quality of patient care in communities across the nation     Kennedy s legislation will help the over 100 000 nurses in Massachusetts who are forced to choose between their jobs and providing quality care to their patients  Massachusetts leads in medical research and care and would be greatly affected by this bill  Kennedy said   Many of our nurses work in acute care facilities and are likely to face mandatory overtime problems  Patients deserve a well rested nurse to provide the best possible care and we must help Massachusetts maintain its promise of leading the country in the medical field     The Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act would strictly limit the use of mandatory overtime for nurses to situations in which an official state of emergency is declared by federal  state or a local government  It would  however  allow nurses to voluntarily work overtime when they feel they can continue to provide safe  quality care  The legislation would also protect nurses from discrimination by employers who continue to force them into working hours beyond what they believe safe for quality care     Karen Higgins  President of the Massachusetts Nurses Association supports Senator Kennedy s efforts to protect nurses in Massachusetts  Front line registered nurses applaud Senator Kennedy s important patient safety measure to ban the use of mandatory overtime  Senator Kennedy s measure  combined with efforts here in Massachusetts to set minimum  safe nurse staffing levels will protect patient safety and preserve quality care  As evidence of the severity of the problem that Kennedy s bill addresses  Higgins points to a recent Institute of Medicine study which found that long hours worked by nurses is harming patients     Kennedy issued the following statement below upon the introduction of this important legislation last week     Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy on The Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act February 11  2005    The Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act  introduced earlier this week  will improve the lives of nurses and their families and enhance the quality of patient care in communities across the nation     Over the past decade  more and more hospitals  faced with high costs  growing demand for services  and few personnel  have resorted to mandatory overtime as a routine way to meet needs of their patients  Instead of hiring more nurses  understaffed hospitals typically often order nurses to work back to back eight hour shifts or four extra hours on top of a 12 hour shift  even though it is dangerous for patients and nurses     Nurses forced to work these additional hours are frequently exhausted  prone to make mistakes  and are often providing care in unacceptable circumstances  According to a recent study by the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing  nurses who work shifts of twelve and a half hours or more are three times more likely to make an error than nurses who work a standard shift of eight and a half hours or less  Restrictions on mandatory overtime are needed to avoid life threatening mistakes and ensure that nurses are able to provide the highest quality care to their patients     Women and men who go into the nursing profession do so for the most altruistic of reasons  They want to give of themselves  and are willing to sacrifice their time and energy to help others  They should not be forced to go beyond what they know is safe  Hospitals and other health care providers must put their patients and patient safety first  and hire enough personnel so that none are forced to work additional hours when they know it isn t safe     The result is a lethal downward spiral      To protect public safety  current federal standards limit working hours for pilots  flight attendants  truck drivers  railroad engineers  and other professionals  but no similar limitation currently exists for nurses  who care for vast numbers of the nation s most vulnerable citizens     The constant  excessive strain is driving nurse out of the profession  and fewer new recruits are available to fill the gap  It hard to raise a family when they never know when they ll be told to work an extra shift  For a single mother  the burden can be impossible  A friend or relative can spend the night with her young child while she works the shift  but she has to be able to come home in the morning  so that the friend or relative can go to their own job  She shouldn t be told by the hospital that she has to remain on duty for an extra shift  except in a real emergency     Some hospitals have already taken action to deal with this serious problem  Nurses at some hospitals have succeeded in negotiating agreements to restrict mandatory overtime  but sometimes they have had to go on strike to reach a fair agreement that protects patients and improves working conditions for the nurses  Obviously  responsible agreements like that will also help in the recruitment and retention of nurses in the future     We need to act nationwide before the current problem becomes even worse  Job dissatisfaction and harsh overtime hours are major factors in the current shortage of nurses  Nationally  hospitals are short 126 000 nurses today  and by the year 2020  it is expected that there will be 400 000 to 500 000 fewer nurses than are needed  A major goal of the Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act is to improve the quality of life for nurses  so that more persons will enter the profession and make it their career      The Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act is a significant step to support better quality care for all Americans  and improve working conditions for the nation s nurses  It contains the following key provisions     o It sets strict limits on the ability of health facilities to require mandatory overtime from nurses  Nurses would be allowed to continue voluntary overtime at their discretion  but mandatory overtime would be allowed only when an official state of emergency has been declared by the federal  state or local government     o To assure compliance  the bill provides the Department of Health and Human Services with the authority to investigate complaints from nurses about violations  It also grants the Department the power to assess civil monetary penalties of up to  10 000 for violations of the Act  and to increase those fines for patterns of violations    o Providers would be required to post notices explaining these new rights and to post nurse schedules in prominent workplace locations  Nurses would also receive anti discrimination protections against employers who continue to require work hours for nurses beyond what a nurse believes is safe for quality care     o This legislation also requires the Agency on Healthcare Research and Quality to report to Congress with recommendations for overall standards to protect patient safety in nursing care      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
