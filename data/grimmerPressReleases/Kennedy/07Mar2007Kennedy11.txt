         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC    Today s results from the Inspector General confirms that those  responsible for providing assistance to states and schools districts were not  appropriately screened for conflicts of interest  Students and teachers  depended on the Department of Education for meaningful assistance and support in  helping children learn to read  Instead  they were pressured into programs that  reflected the Administration s political agenda instead of sound  science Our students and teachers deserve better  The Reading First  program was created to support and enhance the teaching and learning of reading  so that all students can become proficient readers  That should continue to be  the goal at the heart of this important program  and I m committed to changing  the law to safeguard Reading First from political manipulation and abuse   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
