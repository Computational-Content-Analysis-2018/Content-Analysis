         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     This is not about partisan politics  The First Amendment is one of the great pillars of our freedom  As we wage the war on terrorism to protect the nation for the future  it is also our responsibility to protect the ideals that America stands for here at home and around the world  This is no the time to restrict fundamental constitutional rights     As Thomas Jefferson famously said in 1787  when the Constitution was being drafted  Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without a newspaper or newspapers without a government  I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the latter    Freedom of the press is essential to the public s access to information  A free press is an important part of checks and balances on government and an important remedy for excess secrecy in government  and journalists have an indispensable role in fulfilling the public s right to know    I remember a speech by Justice Bill Douglas when I was in law school  A student asked him what the most important export of the United States is  He said  without hesitation  The First Amendment     The reason why is obvious  It gives life to the very concept of our democracy  It protects the freedoms of all Americans  including the right to criticize their government     The long standing privilege that protects journalists and their sources is solidly grounded in the First Amendment and the public s right to know  Like the privileges that protect the relationship between husband and wife  lawyer and client  doctor and patient  and priest and penitent  and like the First Amendment itself  the privilege is not absolute but exceptions are extremely rare  and Congress should be vigilant in protecting it against abuse     Clearly a score was being settled when Valerie Plame s name was leaked to the press  Notwithstanding the Bush Administration s dissembling  it now appears that Karl Rove has been a subject of this investigation  at least as far back as his grand jury testimony last October  a month before the election  If that is the case  then the White House has been misleading the American people about its involvement in this investigation  That s wrong and it s an abuse of power  But we need to be extremely cautious in dealing with journalistic privilege under the First Amendment as part of the investigation  and it may well be that federal legislation is needed to protect that basic privilege  just as many states have done  I care deeply about our First Amendment freedoms  and I look forward to the testimony of the witnesses on these important issues    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
