         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senates Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  took the gavel in the Committees first hearing of the 110th Congress and heard from health care policy experts on the challenges and opportunities of expanding health care coverage to all citizens  Senator Kennedy has been a tireless advocate for expanding health care as a right for all and closing the disparities in care among racial groups  The Committee heard from witnesses from around the country with health care expertise in business  non profit and government sectors  including Peter Meade  Executive Vice President of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and John McDonough  Executive Director of Health Care for all  who played critical roles in Massachusetts recent passage and implementation of its universal health care plan Below is Senator Kennedys hearing statement as prepared for delivery KENNEDY STATEMENT ON HEALTH CARE FOR ALL BY 2010 AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY It is an honor to welcome the members of our committee and our distinguished witnesses to this initial session on the fundamental issue of how to help the nations families afford quality health care   Following several productive roundtables convened by Senator Enzi last Congress  we are using this format today so we can allow for more discussion and to hear from a greater array of perspectives  We request that participants make very brief opening comments of no more than three minutes   We have not required formal written statements  but participants are welcome to submit them if they wish to do so  The hearing record will be held open for 10 days  We will have an open discussion  while making sure that any Senator who wishes to speak will have ample opportunity to do so  In order to keep the dialogue moving  we request that all participants limit their responses to any question to one minute  If the need arises  we may vary the format a little to fit the discussion Im grateful to Senator Enzi for his help and the help of his staff in putting this roundtable together  We look forward to continuing the bipartisan partnership that he established as Committee Chair  The Senate has not yet acted to make our Committee assignments official  but both Caucuses have made their selections  Many are returning to the Committee and we welcome their continued commitment to health care  We are delighted to be joined by several new Members  including Senators Obama  Sanders  Brown  Coburn  Murkowski and Allard  Today s session is the first inquiry into this issue in the new Congress B but it will not be the last  In partnership with Senator Enzi  and with all our colleagues  well do our best to develop proposals on how best to see that the promise of this new century of the life sciences reaches all Americans   Members of the House and Senate have a guaranteed health plan for ourselves and our families  Its time to provide the same guarantee for every man  woman and child in the nation The stakes couldnt be higher  Too many trends in health care are going in the wrong direction  Insurance coverage is down  Costs are up  And America is heading to the bottom of the league of major nations in important measures of the quality of care Ask people what keeps them awake most at night and many will tell you its how to afford health care for their families  Ask companies whats high on their list of problems in trying to compete in the global economy and theyll say its the cost of health care  Even ask our military leaders how our troubled health care system affects recruitment and therefore our national security  Theyll tell you that nearly 1 in 5 men and 2 out of 5 women of recruiting age are ineligible for military service because they re obese  In family after family  community after community  business after business  citizens see our health care system struggling  They know that good  affordable care is less and less available Nearly 47 million Americans lack even basic coverage  and for tens of millions more  their coverage provides little help if major illness strikes  They often learn that truth too late  when bankruptcy results from massive bills their insurance doesnt cover  Parents struggling to save a critically ill child find themselves mortgaging their homes  maxing out their credit cards  borrowing every dime they can  Even with health insurance  they still stand to lose everything theyve worked for  Costs are obviously heading in the wrong direction  National health spending has grown from 1 35 trillion dollars in 2000 to an estimated 2 3 trillion dollars this year B a trillion dollars more in less than a decade  Those arent just numbers  they re massive burdens for working families Health costs are threatening the livelihoods of millions of families because insurance premiums are rising four and half times faster than wages  Parents have to work longer hours and spend less time with their children  trying to keep pace with these rising costs  Something is fundamentally wrong when our health system puts more stress on working families  not less  We need to find a solution in this Congress  so that every American has guaranteed access to quality care by the end of the decade Many of us have views on how best to address the crisis  I believe the right way is to extend the guarantee of Medicare to all Americans  Senator Enzi and others have advanced proposals to aid small businesses with the high cost of health care  Others on our committee have good ideas as well  We should discuss all these ideas B and we should pay close attention to the innovative solutions being tried in states across the country  Last year  in Massachusetts  something remarkable happened  Patients and health professionals  business leaders and community advocates  members of the Democratic State legislature and Republican Governor Romney all rolled up their sleeves and worked together to enact a state health plan that put aside ideology and partisan divisions for the greater common good B affordable  accessible health care coverage for all the citizens of our Commonwealth  It was fitting that the agreement reached was signed in Faneuil Hall  one of the great birthplaces of the American Revolution  In health reform  the Massachusetts plan is the shot heard round the country The same spirit of cooperation that led to our success at Faneuil Hall exists in Vermont  Illinois  Connecticut  California  and many other states across the nation where all parts of the community are beginning to come together to find solutions to the crisis  Yesterday Governor Schwarzenegger set the admirable goal of universal coverage for the citizens of California  We must learn that lesson here in Washington  The need for action has never been more urgent  and the consequences of failure have never been more dire  I look forward to working with the committee and with our witnesses here today to achieve the success that s become so long overdue  MEDICARE FOR ALL BY 2010QUALITY  AFFORDABLE  HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANSAmerica faces a health care crisis  Too many Americans are uninsured  and the number of the uninsured is increasing at an accelerating rate  No American family is more than one pink slip or one employer decision to drop coverage away from being uninsured  Health care costs are too high and are rising at double digit rates  Our dysfunctional health care financing system makes it harder for American businesses to compete in the global economy  creates incentives to outsource jobs abroad  has slowed job growth even as the economy recovers  and has been an especially heavy burden on manufacturing  Americas failure to assure the basic human right to health care to all its citizens was one of the great public policy failures of the 20th century  Recent data emphasizes the urgency of redressing this failure  Forty six million Americans are uninsured  and the most recent Census Bureau figures show that the number of uninsured increased by nearly one million Americans in 2005 alone  Even these figures understate the problem  Over a two year period  82 million Americansone out of every three non elderly Americans  will be uninsured for a significant period of time  After a brief period of stability in the mid 90s  health care costs are rising at unacceptable rates far in excess of inflation  Health insurance premiums have risen at double digit rates since 2000  and have increased a whopping 73  in the last five years  Health care spending reached 16  of GDP  the highest level in our nations history  The high level of American health care costs combined with a financing system that places the burden of paying for coverage on employers who voluntarily choose to offer health insurance puts American firms at a competitive disadvantage  As a proportion of GDP spent on health care  America is first in the world by a large margin  By that standard  we spend 49  more than the Swiss  the next highest spending country  88  more than the Germans  150  more than the British  and 160  more than the Japanese  according to the latest data from the OECD  Our extraordinary level of health spending  however  is not reflected in better health outcomes  Among the worlds leading industrialized countries  the United States ranks 22nd in average life expectancy and 25th in infant mortality  Not only are our health care costs much higher than our trading competitors  but our system forces employers to finance a much higher proportion of costs than firms abroad  because foreign systems rely much more on broad based public financing  The heavy burden the health care financing system adds to labor costs in the United States also acts as a drain on hiring and provides an additional incentive for outsourcing jobs abroad  The Burden of Being Uninsured  In any given year  1 3 of the uninsured go without needed medical care    Eight million uninsured Americans fail to take medication their doctors prescribe  because they cannot afford to fill the prescription   Two hundred and seventy thousand children suffering from asthma never see a doctor  Three hundred and fifty thousand children with recurrent earaches never see a doctor  More than three hundred and fifty thousand children with severe sore throats never see a doctor   27 000 uninsured women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year  They are twice as likely as insured women not to receive medical treatment until their cancer has already spread in their bodies  As a result  they are 50  more likely to die of the disease   32 000 Americans with heart disease go without life saving and life enhancing bypass surgery or angioplasty  because they are uninsured   Whether the disease is AIDS or mental illness or cancer or heart disease or diabetes  the uninsured are left out and left behind  In hospital and out  young or old  black or white  they receive less care  suffer more  and are 25  more likely to die than those who are insured   Medical costs account for about half of all bankruptcies  affecting over 2 million people annually  More than 9 million families spend more than 1 5 of their total income on medical costs  Characteristics of the Uninsured  81  of those without insurance are employees or family members of employees  Of these uninsured workers  most are members of families with at least one person working full time   The uninsured are predominantly low and moderate income persons who cannot afford to buy coverage in the individual market  Approximately two thirds have incomes below 200  of poverty   8 3 million children are uninsured  one fifth of the total without coverage   Large numbers of people in all racial ethnic groups are uninsured  but minorities suffer the most  One in ten non Hispanic whites are uninsured  one in five African Americans are uninsured  and one in three Hispanics are uninsured  Health Care Costs Excessive inflation in health care costs not only burdens the economy but is a major factor in increasing the number of the uninsured  After several years of low growth  health care costs are now rising very rapidly  Health insurance premiums increased 10 9 percent in 2001  12 9  in 2002  13 9  in 2003  11 2  in 2004  and 9 2  in 2005  The cumulative increase over the five years was 73   while the cumulative increase in the CPI was only 13 6   National health expenditures are projected to reach  3 6 trillion in 2014  growing at an average annual rate of 7 1 percent from 2003 2014  As a share of GDP  health spending is projected to reach 18 7 percent by 2014   Claims processing and other administrative functions cost the health care system  600 billion per year  money that could be better spent on patient care  Americas fragmented health financing system is a major driver of these high administrative costs  In Canada  where health insurance is publicly financed and providers bill the government for all services rather than having to deal with a multiplicity of insurance companies with different rules and payment formulas  administrative costs are only about half as high as in the United States  16 7  of total health costs in Canada vs  31  in the United States    The administrative expense needed by the government to run the Medicare program accounts for only 3  of Medicare spending  By contrast  the amount of every premium dollar retained by private insurance companies for marketing  administration and profit is 14    Healthcare is one of the least efficient industries in America  Settling a single transaction in health care can cost as much as  12 to  25  whereas banks have cut their costs to less than a penny per transaction by using modern information technology   According to a study conducted by the RAND Corporation  by utilizing advanced information technology and adopting electronic medical records for every patient  America could save over  160 billion a year by reducing duplicative care  lowering health care administrative costs  and improving quality  Burden on U S Competitiveness and Job Growth Government data  industry surveys  and interviews with employers indicate that many businesses remain reluctant to hire full time employees because health insurance has become one of the fastest growing costs for companies   A recent study found that employers have reduced hiring in response to rising health insurance premiums  and that industries with higher health care costs have had slower job growth  This has been especially true for the manufacturing sector   U S  employee benefit costsof which health care is the largest component  for manufacturing firms are higher than most of its major competitors and the private share of overall health expenditures is much higher in the U S  than it is for its major competitors   Ten percent of the total cost of a ton of steel manufactured in the United States is consumed by retiree health benefits alone  Starbucks now spends more on health care than it does on coffee  The difference between the way health care is financed in Canada and the U S  saves the Canadian auto industry  4 00 an hour in worker compensation compared to the U S  The Canadian branches of the big three automakers have released a joint letter with Canadian Auto Workers Union stating that the Canadian health care system is a strategic advantage for Canada and has been an important ingredient in the success of Canadas most important export industry  The Medicare for All proposalThe Medicare for All plan will make health care coverage available to every American by expanding the Medicare program to the under 65 population  To promote competition and choice  enrollees will also have the option of choosing any of the plans offered to members of Congress  the President  and Federal employees  Costs will be reduced by administrative savings from moving to a Medicare style financing system  by bringing modern information technology to health care  by improving quality of care  and by rewarding health care providers based on performance  not just on the number of procedures performed  International competitiveness and job creation will be enhanced by reduced costs and by shifting some of the burden of financing from business contributions to general revenues  as well as the healthier and more productive work force that will result from universal health insurance coverage  To ease the transition to the new system  coverage will be implemented in phases  In the first  coverage will be extended to individuals 55 65 and to children under 20 years old  In later phases  coverage will be extended to all other Americans not already covered under Medicare Benefits Benefits available to the under 65 population under the expanded Medicare program will be the same as those provided under Medicare  with additional benefits appropriate to the wider age range served by the new program  These will include early and periodic screening  diagnosis and treatment  enhanced preventive care  home and community based care and other services deemed appropriate to meet the nations health needs  This plan provides comprehensive medical benefits  including prescription drug coverage  without the damaging gaps in coverage and chaotic administrative features of the Republican Medicare drug law   Enrollees may also choose any private insurance plan available to members of Congress under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program  These plans all have comprehensive benefit packages  but differ in specifics like dental coverage  vision coverage  and co payments  HMO and PPO options are available under FEHBP Freedom of choice Every enrollee in the expanded Medicare program is guaranteed the right to go to the doctor  hospital  or other health care provider of their choice  just as they are under the current Medicare program  This is a significant improvement over the current health financing system  under which insurers generally limit enrollees to providers chosen by the insurer or require them to pay high additional cost sharing if they want to go to an out of network provider  In addition  all enrollees have the right to choose one of the private health plans available to members of Congress  if that is their preference Private health care delivery system While the new program will be largely publicly financed  the health system itself will remain private  Just as under the current Medicare program  doctors  hospitals and other providers will continue to operate as independent  private entities  As under Medicare  the program will be largely be administered by private carriers and intermediaries Eligibility and enrollment  Any individual with a social security number is eligible to participate in the plan and will be automatically enrolled in the extended Medicare plan unless they choose one of the private options  There will be the opportunity to switch plans annually  just as there is under the FEHBP program Cost reduction through improved quality of care Information technology can make a real difference in patient care  Computerized medical records  coupled with decision support software  can help avoid dangerous medical errors  assist in coordinating care for patients receiving services from multiple providers  help patients take responsibility for their own health  and improve the quality of care  Under Medicare for All  health care providers will be rewarded for improving the quality of care they give to patients  One measure of health care quality will be appropriate use of information technology systems that improve care quality and reduce costs Role of Medicaid Medicaid will continue to provide supplemental services and cost sharing assistance to very low income and disabled individuals Medicare The current Medicare system will continue to provide insurance for the over 65 population and for eligible disabled individuals Cost of plan The plan will create large savings   380 billion a year  at the same time it provides quality  affordable care for all Americans  The Institute of Medicine has estimated that  with no other changes  there would be a savings of  130 billion from extending coverage to all  Increased utilization of health care services by the currently uninsured will be offset by reductions in cost as the result of better prevention and earlier treatment of illness and by the economic benefits of a healthier population   In addition  the plan will save over  160 billion a year as the result of universal adoption of an electronic medical record and advanced information technology   70 billion a year in reduced insurance overhead costs  and  50 billion a year from reduced administrative costs to providers from dealing with a simpler  more uniform billing system  While the plan will create large savings overall  there will be a significant cost shift from individuals and businesses who now pay for the cost of health insurance to public financing sources  Preliminary estimates of the increase in federal spending are  600 billion a year  more than offset by reductions in costs to individuals and firms  The cost increase to the government will be fully covered by payroll taxes and general revenues  and will not add to the deficit Financing The plan will be financed by a combination of payroll taxes and general revenues  Eighty five percent of the financing will come from payroll taxes and 15  from general revenues  A preliminary estimate of the payroll tax financing necessary will be a payment of 7  of payroll by businesses and 1 7  by workers  By comparison  businesses providing coverage today spend an average of 13  of payroll to cover their workers    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
