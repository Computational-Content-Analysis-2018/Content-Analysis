         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Mr  President  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment to exclude civil rights and wage and hour cases from the bill s provisions on removal of cases to federal court  Working Americans and victims of discrimination seeking justice under state laws don t deserve to have the doors of justice slammed on such claims  but that s exactly what this bill will do     All of us know that families across the country are struggling to make ends meet  We can t ignore that they are too often hurt by the denial of a fair wage  or by unfair discrimination  We can t tell the victims of these practices that Congress doesn t care about this enormous problem      This amendment is needed  because the harm suffered by plaintiffs in state civil rights and labor cases is real  devastating  and personal   not the sort of harm that results in a few dollars of damages or a coupon settlement      We ve been told that this bill was designed to correct the problem of class actions in which plaintiffs get only a few dollars for minor claims  while elite attorneys earn million dollar fees  We have yet to hear one example of that happening in a civil rights case or a labor case  We certainly haven t heard anything to suggest there s a major problem in those areas      Some have said it s too late to raise these concerns about civil rights and workers  rights  We ve been told that too much work has gone into this legislation to consider these issues now  But it s always the right time to stand up for principle      In its current form  this bill is just another example of the Administration s mis guided priorities   putting the interests of big companies ahead of America s working families  Why should Congress protect companies that violate state laws by engaging in discrimination or exploiting low wage workers  while making it harder for victims of those practices to get relief in court  Those are the wrong priorities  and we can t ignore that problem    We can t turn our backs on victims of discrimination like Kathleen Rudolph  She and other working women in Florida brought a class action alleging sexual harassment suit by the State Department of Corrections  These women provided health care and other services to inmates in state prisons  They told the court they had suffered almost daily sexual harassment from male inmates  and prison officials failed to stop it  What sense does it make to force a case like that a federal district court    The same principle applies to wage and hour laws  A fair day s work deserves a fair day s wage  State wage and hour laws provide basic protections to workers  particularly now  as companies continue to improve their bottom lines by pressuring workers to work off the clock  A recent New York Times article described the growing phenomenon of low wage workers in many fields  including hairstylists  supermarket cashiers  and call center workers  being forced to work without recording their full hours     These workers are denied overtime pay  and in many cases  working extra hours means they don t even earn the minimum wage  Many of these workers refuse to under report their hours are punished  and are punished for not doing so  One manager interviewed by the New York Times admitted  Working off the clock was a condition of a call service representative s employment  Hourly workers who complained were weeded out and terminated     Professor Eileen Applebaum of Rutgers University emphasized that workers have little choice but to go along  She said  One big reason for off the clock work is that people are really worried about their jobs  Congress should not take away the right of these workers to recover the wages they re owed  Locking the courthouse door against them will hurt people like Nancy Braun and Debbie Simonson  who worked at a national discount chain in Minnesota  They were constantly forced to work through their meal breaks and work off the clock  They and workers like them would not be able to recover their wages without a class action  We should not put more barriers in the way of their pursuit of justice      The new federal overtime rule that takes away overtime from so many federal workers means that state law overtime protections are more important than ever  This is particularly true in states like Illinois  which have wage and hour laws similar to federal law  and have explicitly rejected the new federal regulations     With 8 million Americans out of work  and so many other families struggling to make ends meet  cutbacks in overtime are an unfair burden that America s workers should not have to bear  Overtime pay accounts for about 25 percent of the income of those who work overtime  and workers denied that protection routinely end up working longer hours for less pay    Employers are all too ready to classify workers as not eligible for overtime  Warren Dubrow and Sam O Lear discovered that problem where they worked in Orange County  California  as service managers at an automotive chain  They often had to work more than 50 hours a week  Yet they were denied overtime pay  because their employer called them managers  Never mind that they spent most of their time on non supervisory tasks like greeting customers  filling out order forms  and even changing tires  In state court  they and thousands of their fellow service managers won the right to overtime pay under state laws providing that workers who spend more than half their time on non managerial tasks are entitled to overtime  Why should a federal court be required to hear a case like that      This isn t just a matter of moving civil rights cases and labor cases to a different forum  The real effect is much more harmful  Too often  moving these cases to federal courts will mean they are never heard at all  because strict federal rules for class certification will prevent the plaintiffs from being approved as a class  If a federal court decides not to certify the class  that s probably the end of the case  because many members of class action lawsuits can t afford to pursue their case individually  Extended litigation in federal court is too expensive for low wage workers and victims of discrimination  many of whom live paycheck to paycheck  Defendant companies are eager to throw sand in the gears of the law  and Congress shouldn t be encouraging them      There has been some confusion during this debate about whether the class action bill would really move cases involving local events into federal courts  Yesterday  the distinguished Senator from Utah questioned whether cases based on truly local events would really be affected by the class action bill  Let there be no doubt   it will happen if the current bill isn t modified      If 100 Alabama workers bring a class action case under Alabama law for job discrimination that took place in Alabama  the employer can use this bill to drag the case into federal court if the employer company is incorporated outside the state  The same is true if low wage workers are denied fair pay in their home state  As long as an employer is incorporated out of state  that employer can move the case into federal court    Section 4 of the bill allows a case to stay in state court only if the defendant is a citizen of the same state as the plaintiffs who brought the case  Companies are citizens of the state where they are incorporated  regardless of where they do business  As a result  plaintiffs who file a case in state court against a company with offices in their home state  could quickly find their case in federal court if the company is incorporated somewhere else     That will affect a huge number of state law cases  To show the scale of this problem  let s look at the figures more than 308 000 companies are incorporated in Delaware  including 60 percent of Fortune 500 firms and 50 percent of corporations listed on the New York Stock Exchange  Most of these companies also do business in many other states  But plaintiffs in those other states will not be able to file cases against these companies without being dragged into federal court  That result violates basic fairness and common sense    The Senator from Utah also suggested that this amendment isn t necessary to protect victims of discrimination  because federal courts have traditionally been defenders of civil rights    Federal courts do perform the important job of protecting civil rights under federal law and the U S  Constitution  No one is questioning that  This amendment wouldn t change the fact that federal civil rights claims can be decided by federal courts  Nor would it exempt federal civil rights or federal wage and hour cases from the other requirements of this bill   such as the requirement that appropriate government officials be notified of class action settlements     This amendment does only one thing   it leaves in place the current rules governing removal of civil rights and labor cases filed under state or local laws  When states are ahead of the federal government in giving their citizens greater protection than federal law    as several states have done in the area of genetic discrimination and discrimination based on marital status   state courts  not federal courts  should interpret those laws     The Senator from Utah suggested that this amendment isn t necessary  because civil rights cases are filed under federal laws  That s not accurate  There are many federal class actions  but there are also many emerging areas in which victims of discrimination are seeking relief through state law class actions     Sexual harassment cases are often brought in state courts under state law  like Kathleen Rudolph s case against the Florida Department of Correction  which I mentioned to earlier     Many civil rights class actions can only be brought under state law  because there is no federal law on the particular issue involved  That s true for genetic discrimination  It s true for discrimination based on marital status  parental status  and citizenship status  Those types of discrimination are prohibited under many state laws  but not yet under federal law     If we don t let state courts develop these emerging protections under state laws  we re stacking the deck against workers and victims of discrimination  That s because federal courts have said  time and again  that they will interpret state laws narrowly     The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit  faced with opposing interpretations of state law  has ruled that it will choose the narrower interpretation that restricts liability   Birchler v  Gehl  88 F 3d 518  7th Cir  1996   The First and Third Circuits have made similar rulings  So there s no question that  compared to state courts  federal courts are more likely than state courts to rule against plaintiffs in interpreting state law  Federal judges have said so themselves  Moving these cases into federal courts will put a federal thumb on the scale in favor of companies that violate the law      We can t let that happen  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  and on both sides of the class action debate  to support this amendment  This legislation is supposed to reduce class action abuses  not add new abuses      Laura Capps
