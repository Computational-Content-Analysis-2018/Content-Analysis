         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today Senator Kennedy expressed his disappointment with the report on progress in training Iraqi security forces  The report was required by a provision that Senators Kennedy and Durbin attached to the Iraq supplemental in order to hold Administration accountable for making sure that the American people  and our soldiers    know the real progress we are making in training Iraqis and our ability to transfer responsibility for security over to Iraqis  Also required in the report is an estimate of the level of US troops that will be necessary in Iraq in the future     The law required an initial report on July 11  yet the Administration just submitted it today  On July 13  an amendment offered by Senators Reid and Kennedy demanding that Secretary Rumsfeld submit the overdue report was passed unanimously in the Senate     Below is Senator Kennedy s statement in response to the report  It s been two and a half years since the fall of Baghdad  and a reliable assessment of the progress we re making in the training of Iraqi security forces is long over due     It s been obvious for many months that the training program is in trouble  As General Pace  Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month  Only a small number of Iraqi security forces are taking on the insurgents and terrorists by themselves    In legislation signed by President Bush on May 11  the Administration was required to provide a specific report on this all important issue    The report has just arrived in the Armed Services Committee  The key questions that the American people want to know    how many Iraqi security forces are capable of fighting on their own and what our military requirements will be the months ahead    remain classified  so the Administration still isn t willing to come clean  The silence is deafening  and General Pace s statement clearly suggests that the level of training reached so far isn t getting the job done     No foreign policy is sustainable without the support of the American people  and it s clear that support is waning  The American people deserve to know the facts about our policy  They want to know how long it will take to fully train the Iraqis and when our military mission will be completed     The Administration needs to find a way to answer these questions in good faith for the American people   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
