         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to the Senate vote of no  confidence on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales   When Alberto Gonzales came before the Senate as the Presidents nominee for Attorney General  many of us were concerned that he would not be able to distinguish between his past role as White House Counsel and his new role as Attorney General  During his service as Counsel to the President  he had assisted the President in promulgating a series of disastrous policies that ran roughshod over the rule of law and damaged the United States in the eyes of the world  He refused to give detainees the protections of the Geneva Conventions  calling them quaint  He facilitated the establishment of Guantanamo and denied other basic legal protections to detainees  He approved an interpretation of the law that was inconsistent with international agreements  He authorized the use of torture  a step that led to the horrors of Abu Ghraib  At every turn  he promoted an extreme view of the Presidents authority  Yet  when he came before the committee seeking confirmation  he assured us  With the consent of the Senate  I will no longer represent only the White House  I will represent the United States of America and its people  I understand the differences between the two roles That assurance has proven hollow  On issue after issue  Mr  Gonzales has single mindedly served the Presidents agenda  without any respect for the broader responsibilities of the Attorney General  He has continued to promote an extreme view of the Presidents power as Commander in Chief to authorize warrantless eavesdropping in violation of the law  secret detentions  abuse of detainees  and violations of the Geneva Conventions  He believes that the President can issue signing statements that nullify duly enacted statutes whenever they might limit the Presidents discretion  As Attorney General  he has used the enormous power of his office to promote the agenda of the White House  The current U S  Attorney scandal has revealed the devastating legacy of Mr  Gonzaless tenure as Attorney General  We now have a Department of Justice that is wide open to partisan influence  and has abandoned many of the basic principles that kept the Department independent and assured the American people that its decisions were based on the rule of law  As a result  the Department of Justice is now embroiled in a scandal involving the firing of U S  Attorneys  under a process controlled by inexperienced  partisan staffers in consultation with the White House  U S  Attorneys were targeted for firing because they failed to serve the White House agenda  Karl Rove and the President passed along to the Attorney General complaints that U S  Attorneys failed to pursue voter fraud  Over the past five years  the Department of Justice has actually pushed hard to prosecute voter fraud  but among the hundreds of millions of votes cast in that period  it has managed to convict only 86 people nationwide  The pursuit of virtually non existent voter fraud at the ballot box is part of a Republican effort to suppress the legitimate votes of minority  elderly and disabled voters  Other measures taken in this cynical scheme include photo ID laws and purges of voter rolls The conclusion is inescapable that the firings of U S  Attorneys were part of an effort to put partisans in charge of U S  Attorney offices in key states  New Mexico  Washington  Arkansas and Nevada are all closely contested states  Add those states to which the Attorney General sent interim appointees from Washington in the past 2 years  Florida  Missouri  Iowa and Minnesota  and the pattern is clear  Attorney General Gonzales  more than any other Attorney General in memory  has tried to turn the Department of Justice into an arm of a political party  In addition  under his leadership  the Departments hiring procedures have been corrupted by partisan officials who rejected longstanding merit based hiring procedures and placed political party loyalty ahead of legal merit in hiring career attorneys  His Department of Justice has tried to obliterate the distinction between political appointees and career civil servants  In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee  Mr  Gonzales has repeatedly made false statements  He told us the warrantless eavesdropping program could not be conducted within the limits of The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  Then  on the eve of an appearance before the Committee  he told us that the program now fits within FISA  He told us that there had not been significant disagreement over that program  but we now know that as many as 30 members of the Justice Department were prepared to resign if an earlier version of the program proceeded unchanged  He stated that he had not seen memoranda or been involved in discussions about the U S  Attorney firings  but it was later revealed that he did both  He told us that only eight U S  Attorneys had been targeted for firing  but it turns out the list was longer  He has said scores of times that he does not recall key meetings and events  With each misstatement and memory lapse  the Attorney Generals credibility has faded until there is nothing left  In the years I have served in this body  I have had the privilege to work with many Attorneys General  The defining quality of the outstanding occupants of that office  both Democrats and Republicans    has been an understanding that the law and the evidence trump loyalty to a political party or a president  Respect for the rule of law lies at the heart of our democracy  If our machinery of justice becomes just another means to preserve and promote the power of the party in office  we have corrupted our democracy  If the American people believe that partisanship is driving law enforcement  our system of justice cannot survive  We need a strong and credible attorney general who believes deeply in our system of justice as we undertake the difficult and essential job of restoring the credibility of the Department of Justice  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution of no  confidence as a first step in rebuilding the faith of the American people in the Department of Justice       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224
