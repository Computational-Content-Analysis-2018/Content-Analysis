         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D  C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA   Ranking Member of the Senates Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee  commended President Bush for signing into law a sweeping overhaul of the nations pension and retirement system     Senator Kennedy said  The Pension Protection Act reflects a bipartisan commitment to strengthening the pension system and improving the way workers and their families prepare for their retirement  I commend President Bush for signing it into law and thank my colleagues in the Senate and House who worked so hard to make this possible    This new law means greater peace of mind for more than 100 million Americans by safeguarding their retirement  and it will help millions more in the future  No longer can executives just look out for themselves while their companies pensions go bust  Under this bill  their workers must come first  From flight attendants to construction workers to factory workers  this bill means a more secure retirement for hardworking Americans across the land    In far too many instances in recent years  Republicans have refused to work with Democrats for the common good  and average Americans have paid the price  In this case  Democrats and Republicans worked together  and Americas workers and retirees came out the winners    Background on the Bill    In the past 5 years alone  employees have lost  8 billion in retirement savings as over 700 pension plans have collapsed  Americans arent saving enough and 401 k s are under funded and under utilized  The bill  the Pension Protection Act of 2006  H R  4  approved with a 93 4 vote by the Senate on August 3  will strengthen guaranteed pensions and increase workers ability to build a secure retirement  The House passed the bill on July 28 by a vote of 279 131    The bill establishes new rules to help troubled pension plans to recover  Middle class workers will be automatically enrolled in their companys retirement plans  savings will be increased and sound investment advice will be offered to help them manage their savings  Workers who were promised defined benefit pensions for their years of hard work will find their benefits protected when companies switch to new types of pension plans  Women will also benefit from this law  as widows and divorced women will receive more generous survivor benefits and a greater share of a former spouses pension  These improvements allow retirement plans to be far more responsive to the realities of womens lives and careers    Americans are increasingly concerned about their retirement security    The personal savings rate has now fallen below zero   Social Security is under attack    Private pensions are in trouble too  In the past five years  over 700 pension plans have failed  with workers losing approximately  8 billion in pensions they had worked so hard to earn    Many workers today have only a 401 k   But many workers have nothing in their account  and even those who do arent saving enough  Half of workers close to retirement have less than  61 000 in their accounts    Single employer pensions  These defined benefit pensions provide a secure pensions for nearly 34 million workers and retirees  They grant a known monthly retirement benefit for life  and are insured by the federal government  The legislation requires companies to put more funds into their pensions and to do so in a fair and predictable way    Disclosure  It ensures that workers and retirees receive up to date information each year about the status of their pensions  By opening up the books of pension funds  they will be able to monitor the true health of their retirement    Executive compensation  It provides incentives to keep pensions financially healthy by tying executive compensation to pension health  Executives should not be able to feather their own retirement nests  while workers lose their nest eggs  The bill penalizes executives who put company funds into their own retirement trusts  when the pensions of rank and file workers are underfunded    401 k  plans  We also need to recognize the growing role of defined contribution pension plans  Over 40  of workers participate in such plans today  and for many its their only pension plan   Automatic enrollment  Our legislation encourages workers to save more by automatically enrolling them in pensions and automatically increasing the amount they can save  This would immediately help up to 5 9 million American workers begin building a pension   Savers Credit  The Savers Credit provides critical incentives to help hard working Americans contribute to their retirement plans and helps over 5 million workers each year  This legislation makes that credit permanent and indexes it so this incentive will continue to be meaningful for workers into the future    Investment Advice  As employees assume greater responsibility for pension investment choices  they need the best information possible about their choices  The Pension Protection Act encourages companies to provide non biased investment advice to their employees so they can maximize their retirement savings   Multiemployer Pensions  This bill addresses the needs of nearly 10 million Americans in multiemployer pensions  who clean our office buildings and hotel rooms  sell us our groceries  build our homes and schools and highways  and deliver goods across the country  Many of them would not be able to earn any pension at all without a multiemployer plan  since their employers  particularly small businesses  could not afford to offer a pension on their own     Under this legislation  employers and employees must work together and agree on a plan to restore these pensions to financial health  Employers would be protected from unforeseen payment increases and new excise taxes  which could cost many workers their jobs    Armed Forces First Responders  The bill also addresses the special needs of our first responders and our military  We improve retirement security for public safety workers by expanding options to pay for retiree health care and long term care  We also allow reserve and national guard members to draw on their retirement savings without penalty when called to active duty  and we give them an opportunity to replace these savings when they return to civilian life    Airlines  The pension crisis in the airline industry also deserves our immediate attention  Our airlines have faced challenges with the 9 11 attacks  natural disasters  and record high fuel prices  These costs are driving companies into bankruptcy  putting the retirement of hundreds of thousands of workers and retirees at risk  The bill provides a way for these airlines to keep their pensions  by offering companies a specialized payment program and a transition period to adjust to the new rules    Hybrid Cash Balance  Our legislation also addresses new types of pensions  like hybrid pensions  which play a growing role in our retirement system  This legislation gives companies clear guidance about the future legal status of these plans  but allows workers who have been harmed in the past to continue to pursue their rights  And it contains clear protections against such wearaway or erosion of older workers benefits  The bill also makes these pensions more portable  so that they better serve a mobile workforce    Enron  As we learned from the Enron  WorldCom and other corporate scandals  employees forced to invest in company stock are at huge risk  The bill protects them by preventing employers from overloading 401 k  plans with company stock    Womens Pensions  The legislation also includes important provisions from the Womens Pension Protection Act that Senators Kennedy and Snowe introduced  Women live longer than men  but they earn far less in wages over their lifetimes and are much less likely to earn a pension    Our legislation gives them greater retirement security  Widows will receive more generous survivor benefits and divorced women will have greater ability to receive a share of their former husbands pension after a divorce  These are long overdue improvements in the private pension system  so that retirement savings programs will be more responsive to the realities of womens lives and careers      Laura Capps  Melissa
