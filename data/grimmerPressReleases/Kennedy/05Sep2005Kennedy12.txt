         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner                202  224 2633    Over the last several weeks  we ve begun to review John Roberts record and overall fitness to sit on the nation s highest court in preparation for our hearings on his nomination to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court  Today  those stakes became greater when the President announced he would make a new nomination of John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States  an even higher position  Only 17 Americans have held this position since the birth of our country  The Chief Justice is the most important judge in the country  with even more responsibility for the protection of the rights and freedoms of all Americans  Thus John Roberts bears a heavier burden when he comes before the Senate  The Chief Justice must be committed to moving America forward toward equality  opportunity and fairness for all Americans    Our review of even the limited available parts of his record has raised serious concerns about his role in the early 1980 s in seeking to weaken voting rights  roll back women s rights  and impede our progress toward a more equal nation  The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings  which were due to begin this week  were the opportunity for the Senate and the American people to hear from John Roberts about those extreme views and explain his position on these and many other vital issues facing the country    Before the Senate acts on John Roberts s new nomination  we should know even more about his record  and we should know whom the President intends to nominate as a replacement for Sandra Day O Connor  The American people care deeply about the overall balance of their highest court  and its dedication as an institution to the protection of their rights    In the midst of a national disaster of biblical proportions  it is difficult for the American people to participate fully in the selection of the next Chief Justice  one of the most important positions in our government and the chief protector of our constitution  Right now  as they should be  the hearts and minds of the American people are focused on helping the victims of the hurricane  Our response and focus to Hurricane Katrina is a defining moment in our nation s history and a test of our decency and humanity as a people  The White House  Congress  and the American people must all focus together to address the unprecedented human suffering and long term impact on our nation    The President should take this time to unite and heal the country    by remaining focused on helping the hurricane victims recover  honoring Chief Justice Rehnquist s memory by allowing the nation to mourn  and taking time to ensure our next steps on the Supreme Court point the country in the direction of progress   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
