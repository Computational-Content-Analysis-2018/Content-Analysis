         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner      202  224 2633    STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON BRAC COMMISSION S DECISION REGARDING HANSCOM AIR FORCE BASE    We won this battle on May 13  when the Pentagon decided not to close Hanscom  saving 30 000 jobs in Massachusetts  and instead saw the immense potential for growth  The Pentagon s proposal was a confirmation of the value of our technology intellectual capital  It s unfortunate that the Pentagon misclassified the jobs in their recommendation  making it difficult for the commissioners to endorse additional new jobs at Hanscom  Even though the commission did not approve the additional new jobs at Hanscom  they did recognize that it would be appropriate to send additional research and development jobs to Hanscom  and would allow the Defense Department to do so outside of the BRAC process    Before the Pentagon s recommendations were announced  many believed that Hanscom and Natick were on the chopping block  But we knew that they are strong assets to our nation s defense  Hanscom s technology has greatly improved our military s response time  reducing the time it takes to identify and strike a target from 72 hours to 20 minutes     Natick Soldier Center is also crucial to our national security and a contributor to this defense cluster  Natick produces the tools that the soldier will need in the future  including smaller and lighter gear and better communications  Massachusetts has expertise in the areas that are necessary to make these improvements  like nanotechnology  sensors  medical research  wireless networking  and next generation textiles    We made the case that this kind of intellectual expertise is no accident  It comes from Hanscom and Natick s unique location in the heart of the nation s pre eminent defense technology cluster  It s the interaction between the best of the nation s academia and industry that produces these results  The commission recognizes the value of preserving intellectual capital  and the strength that we have in Massachusetts    Throughout our BRAC efforts  the Pentagon was very supportive of the work at Hanscom  It remains the nation s pre eminent C4ISR center  and nothing in the Commission s recommendations change that  This area will only continue to grow  and Hanscom is a critical part of that growth  We re committed to working with Pentagon to support new mission at Hanscom in the years to come    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
