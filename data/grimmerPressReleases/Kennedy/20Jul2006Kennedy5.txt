         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Mr  President  this is an historic day  The quietness of the moment here on the floor of the United States Senate talking about a major piece of legislation which is basic to the fabric of what America s really all about  but the quietness doesn t belie the fact that this is a momentous piece of legislation which marks the continuation of this nation being a true democracy  and I want to at the outset commend my friends and leaders on the Judiciary Committee  Senator Specter and Senator Leahy    I remember talking with both of them early on about the  putting this on the Senate Agenda  putting it on the Judiciary Committee Agenda  There are not two members of this body who are more committed to this legislation than our Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy  and we re here today because of their leadership and their strong commitment to the concept of making sure that America is really going to be America by insisting on the extension of this voting rights legislation  They both have been tireless during the course of the series of hearings that we have had  They have been meticulous in terms of determining the witnesses that we would have  making the record  which is so important and such great consequence in terms of maintaining the constitutionality of this legislation  which is of course so important  So I want to thank both of them for their leadership and their generous references earlier during the course of their    during their statements    Mr  President  the constitution of the United States is an extraordinary document  the greatest charter that has ever been written in terms of preserving rights and liberties of a people  But enshrined in the constitution was slavery  and this country has had a challenging time freeing itself from the stains of slavery  We had a difficult time  obviously  in the time we fought the great Civil War  and we ve had a challenging time freeing ourselves from discrimination  all forms of discrimination  but particularly in terms of race discrimination  And we ve had a difficult time  particularly in the early 1960 s in passing legislation  Legislation can be enormously valuable in freeing a country from the stains of discrimination  but it takes much more than just legislation to achieve that    In 1964 I was fortunate enough to be here at the time that we passed the 1964 Civil Rights Bill that dealt with what we call public accommodations  Difficult to believe that people were denied public accommodations  the ability to go to hotels  restaurants  other areas because of the color of their skin in the United States of America  Ten months    ten months    not just one day as we all have today on voting rights    ten months the Senate was in session as we faced a filibuster on that legislation  And then finally Senator Everett Dirksen responded to the very eloquent pleas of President Johnson at that time  indicated that he was prepared to move the legislation forward and make some adjustments in the legislation  We were able to achieve it and that went into effect    In 1965 we had hours and hours and hours and hours during the course of the markup of the Voting Rights Act  Hours and hours and hours here on the floor of the United States Senate to pass that legislation  Amendment after amendment after amendment  And then we were ultimately successful  And just off the Senate Chamber in what we know as the President s room just a few yards from where I m standing today  President Johnson signed that legislation  and now we continue the process  It hasn t always been easy  It hasn t always been easy during the continuation and the reauthorization  Rarely has it been    have we been as fortunate as we are today with the time agreement and an understanding that we will consider this bill and finalize it this evening and in a way that will avoid a contentious conference with the House of Representatives that could have at another time gone on for weeks and even months as we have seen in the past  and pass legislation that will go to the President s desk and that he will sign    There is no subject matter that brings out emotions like the issue of civil rights  and that s perhaps understandable  But it s still very  very true  No issue that we debate    health care  education  increasing the minimum wage  you name it  age discrimination  environment questions    whatever those matters are  nothing brings out the emotions as civil rights legislation  But here we he a very  very important piece of civil rights legislation that is going to be favorably considered  And I ll speak about that in just a few moments    You have to understand as important as this legislation is  it really isn t worth the paper it s on unless it is going to be enforced  Thats enormously important  As we pass this legislation  we talk about its importance and the various provisions in the legislation  we have to make sure we have an administration and a Justice Department that s going to enforce the legislation  That hasn t always been the case  and secondly  it s enormously important we have judges that interpret the legislation the way that we intended it to be interpreted    We have in this situation a bipartisan interpretation  We have a bicameral interpretation  There should be no reason that any court in this country  particularly a Supreme Court that s looking over the provisions  not understand very clearly what we intended and the constitutional basis for it  or any circuit court or any district court  We need judges who are going to interpret this  That has not always been the case  and I ll reference that in terms of my comment  And then after that  we have to make sure that we have a process and system so that even if we have the legislation and even if we have a Justice Department interpret it and even though we have judges interpret it  we have to make sure that there wont be other interference in terms of individuals  ability to vote  And that s another subject for another time  but enormously important    So  Mr  President  we need all of those factors at least to make sure that this basic and fundamental right which is so important and which we are addressing today is actually going to be achieved and accomplished for our fellow citizens  Mr  President  we are  as I mentioned  poised to take another historic step in America s journey towards becoming the land of its ideals  As we all know  the battle for racial equality in America is far from over  Landmark civil rights laws that we have passed in the past four decades have provided a legal foundation but the full promise of these laws has yet to be fulfilled    Literacy tests may no longer block access to the ballot box  but we cannot ignore the fact that discrimination is sometimes as plain as ever  and that more subtle forms of discrimination are plotted in back rooms and imposed by manipulating redistricting boundaries to dilute minority voting strength or by systematic strategies on election day to discourage minority voting  The persistence of overt and more subtle discrimination makes it mandatory that we reauthorize the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act   This act is perhaps congress s greatest contribution to the march towards equality in our society  As Martin Luther King Jr  said  voting is civil right number one  It is the right in our democracy that is preservative of all others  So long as the vote is available and freely exercised by our entire citizenry  this nation will remain strong and other rights will be protected  For nearly a century  the 15th amendment guaranteed that the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be abridged  denied    denied or abridged by the United States or any state on the basis of race  color  or previous condition of servitude  But it took the voting Rights Act of 1965 to breathe life into that basic guarantee  and it took the actions of many brave men and women  such as those who gathered at the Edmund Pettis Bridge  I m honored to have fought in the Senate for the Voting Rights Act each time it was before the Congress  from extending the act in 1975 to strengthening it along the way    I recall watching President Lyndon Baines Johnson sign the 1965 act just off the chamber in the President s room  We knew that day that we had changed the country forever and indeed we had  In 1965  there were only three African Americans and three Latino members of Congress  Today there are 41 African American members in the House of Representatives  one African American senator and 22 Latino house members and two Latino senators  These gains would not have been possible without the Voting Rights Act   I recall extending the expiring provisions of the act in 1970  and I remember spending it again in 1975 and adding protection for citizens who needed language assistance  We recognize that those voters warranted assistance because un unequal education resulted in high rates of illiteracy  illiteracy and lower rates of voter participation  And I remember extending the act again in 1982  That time we extend the expiring provisions for 25 years and we strengthened it by overturning the Supreme Court s decision in Mobile vs  Bolden  That decision weakened the act by imposing an intent standard pursuant to section 2 of the act  But despite the opposition  at that time even of President Reagan and his Department of Justice  we were able to restore the act s vitality by replacing it with a results test that provides greater protection for victims of scram discriminatory treatment    Finally in 1982 we extended the ability of those whose English language ability isn t sufficient to allow them to participate in our system  I feel privileged to have the opportunity to support the extension of the act once again for another 25 years  Some have questioned whether there is still a need for the act s expiring provisions  They even argue that discrimination vote something a thing of the past and that we re relying on decades  old discrimination to stigmatize certain areas of the country  I ve heard the evidence presented over the past several months of hearings and I can tell you  they re just plain wrong  Yes  we ve made progress that was almost unimaginable in 1965    The goal of voting the Voting Right Act was to have full and equal access for every American regardless of race  We have not achieved that goal    In considering this bill  the Senate Judiciary Committee held days of hearings  heard from more than 46 witnesses  In addition  we have received numerous written statements  received voluminous reports from a variety of groups that have examined the state of voting rights in our nation  We have explored every aspect of the expiring provisions of the act and there is one inescapable conclusion  we must reauthorize the Voting Rights Act  The evidence demonstrates that far too many Americans still face barriers because of their race  their ethnic background or their language minority status   Section 5 is the centerpiece of the expiring provisions of the Act  It requires that covered jurisdictions preclear voting changes with the Department of Justice or the District Court in the District of Columbia by proving that the changes do not have a retrogressive purpose or effect  The Act would reverse the restrictive Bossier Parish decision and restore the Section 5 standard to its original meaning by making clear that a purpose to discriminate will prevent section 5 preclearance  But  even under the weaker standard that has governed in recent years  the Department of Justice has had to object to egregious discriminatory practices   The number of objections under section 5 has remained large since we last reauthorized the Act in 1982  Astonishingly  Professor Anita Earls of the University of North Carolina Law School testified that between 1982 and 2004  the Department of Justice lodged 682 Section 5 objections in covered jurisdictions compared with only 481 objections prior to 1982  In Mississippi alone  the Department of Justice objected to 120 voting changes since 1982  This number is roughly double the number of objections made before 1982   Behind these statistics are stories of the voters who were able to participate in the political process because the Voting Rights Act protects their fundamental right to do so  For example  in 2001  the town of Kilmichael  Mississippi cancelled its elections just three weeks before election day  The Justice Department objected to the cancellation  finding that the town failed to establish that its actions were not motivated by the discriminatory purpose of preventing African American voters from electing candidates of their choice  The town had recently become majority African American and  for the first time in its history  several African American candidates had a good chance of winning elected office  Section 5 prevented this discriminatory change from being implemented  and as a result three African American candidates were elected to the Board of Aldermen and an African American was elected mayor of Kilmichael for the first time   Consider the Dinwiddie County Board of Supervisors in Virginia  It moved a polling place from a club with a large African American membership to a white church on the other side of town  under the pretext that the church was more centrally located  We saw this tactic when we renewed the Act in 1970  We didnt expect to see it again in on the eve of the 21st century  but we did   Some have argued that there has been a drop in the number of objections in recent years  As the record shows  that decline is explained by a number of reasons  First  of course  is the Supreme Courts restricted interpretation of the purpose standard  which we will correct today  In addition  the numbers do not account for proposed changes that are rejected by the District Court or proposed changes that are withdrawn once the Department of Justice asks for more information or litigation begins in the District Court  And  of course  there are matters that merit objection  but have been precleared by the Bush Department of Justice because the Departments political leadership refused to follow the recommendations of career experts   The Department twice precleared Georgias effort to impose a photo identification requirement for voting  The first time  the district court threw it out as an unconstitutional poll tax  Thats right  A poll tax in 2006  In 1965  we fought the poll tax during the debate of the original Voting Rights Act  After the Supreme Court ultimately held it unconstitutional  we thought this shameful practice had ended  But the court found that the Georgia law was just a 21st Century version of this old evil   Georgia reenacted the law without the poll tax and the court still found that it unlawfully disadvantaged poor and minority voters  who are less likely to have the required identification   Recently  the Supreme Court held that the Texas legislature had violated the Voting Rights Act by shifting 100 000 Latino voters out of a district just as they were about to defeat an incumbent and finally elect a candidate of their choice  Once again  Section 5 would have blocked this practice  but the leadership of the Department of Justice overruled career experts who recommended an objection   The fact that the number of Section 5 objections is a small percentage of the total number of submissions shouldnt be surprising  Jurisdictions take Section 5 into consideration when adopting voting changes and many day to day changes are non controversial  What should surprise and concern us is the fact that there continue to be objections and voting changes like the ones I have described    It has also been argued that the Section 5 coverage formula is both over and under inclusive  The Act addresses that problem by permitting jurisdictions where federal oversight is no longer warranted to bail out from coverage under Section 5  We have a letter from one of the jurisdictions that has taken advantage of the bailout process explaining that it did not find that process to be onerous  So far  every jurisdiction that has sought a bailout has succeeded  For jurisdictions that should be covered but arent  the Act contains a mechanism by which a court may order a non covered jurisdiction found to have violated the 14th or 15th amendments to obtain Section 5 preclearance for its voting changes  As a result  the Acts preclearance requirement applies only to jurisdictions in which there is a need for such oversight    The Act will also reauthorize the provisions of the Act that mandate the provision of election assistance in minority languages  In the course of our consideration of this bill  we heard substantial evidence demonstrating that these provisions are still necessary  The original rationale for enactment of these provisions was two fold  First  there are many native born Americans who speak languages other than English  including Native Americans  Alaska Natives and Puerto Ricans  These people should not be denied the opportunity to be full participants in our democracy because of the languages they speak    Additionally  Congress concluded that many Americans  including Native Americans  Alaska Natives  Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans  suffer from inadequate educational opportunities that deny them the opportunity to master English at a sufficient level to fully understand electoral issues and cast meaningful ballots  The nationwide statistics illustrate the problem  Only 75  of Alaska Natives complete high school  compared to 90  of non Natives and only 52  of all Hispanic Americans have a high school degree  compared to over 80  of all Americans  We heard testimony that while many of these people may speak conversational English  they have been denied the educational instruction  often as a result of intentional discrimination  that would allow them to understand complex electoral issues and technical voting terminology in English alone   Finally  Mr  President  it is crucial that we extend the guarantees of all of the temporary provisions of the Act for 25 years  Twenty five years is not a long time when compared to the centuries of oppression that it is intended to overcome  While we have made enormous progress  it takes time to overcome the deep seated patterns of behavior that have denied minorities full access to the ballot  Indeed  the worst thing we could do would be to allow that progress to slip away because we ended the cure too soon  We know that the Act is having an impact  We know that it is deterring discrimination  And we know that despite the Act racial bloc voting and other forms of discrimination continue to tilt the playing field for minority voters and candidates  We need to ensure that jurisdictions know that the Act will be in force for a sufficiently long period that they cannot simply wait for the expiration of the Act  but must eliminate discrimination root and branch   Mr  President  the time has come to renew the Voting Rights Act  This historic piece of legislation renews our commitment to the fundamental values of America  It ensures that all of our citizens will have the right to play an effective role in our governance  It continues us down the path toward a democracy free of the blight of discrimination based on race  ethnicity and language  As Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  said  The time is always right to do what is right  The right thing to do is to pass this bill and the time to do it is now      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
