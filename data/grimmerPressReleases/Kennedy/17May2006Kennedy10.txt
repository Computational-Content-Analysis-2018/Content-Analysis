         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today s markup focuses in part on one of the greatest public health investments we have made in this country    the care and treatment of individuals with HIV AIDS Almost sixteen years ago  the members of this Committee demonstrated their commitment to the care and treatment of Americans living with AIDS by passing the Ryan White Care Act  It has been a model of bipartisan cooperation and Federal leadership  and I am proud that this reauthorization process has continued that bipartisan commitment Sixteen years ago  Americans were struggling with the devastating effects of the virus  By 1995  more than a million citizens were infected with the AIDS virus  and AIDS itself had become the leading killer of young Americans aged 25 to 44  AIDS was killing brothers and sisters  children and parents  friends and loved ones    all in the prime of their lives Since that time  community based care has become more available  drug treatments have nearly doubled the life expectancy of HIV positive individuals  and public campaigns have increased awareness of the disease While we still seek a cure to AIDS  the Ryan White funds have allowed us to help those infected by the virus to lead long and productive lives  through the miracles of good care  treatment  and the availability of prescription drugs This is evident in my state of Massachusetts  By the end of 2004  a little more than 26 000 residents had been diagnosed and reported with HIV AIDS  Of that number  42  have died     but 58  are living  That was not the case 10 years ago We in America know of the pain and loss that this disease cruelly inflicts  Millions of our fellow citizens    men  women  and children    are infected with HIV AIDS  And far too many have lost their lives  63  of African Americans  for example  say they personally know someone who is living with HIV or has died of AIDS As the challenge of HIV AIDS continues  year after year  it has become more difficult for anyone to claim that AIDS is someone else s problem  The epidemic has cost the nation immeasurable talent and energy in young and promising lives struck down long before their time  We must do a better job to identify  treat  and support those caught in the epidemic s path This markup today is the first step in reaffirming both the structure of the CARE Act    which continues to provide a sound and solid backbone for HIV AIDS care across the nation As we increase our efforts to provide better care  treatment  and drugs in rural areas that have seen an increase in the AIDS epidemic  we must ensure that more state flexibility does not cause the collapse of existing structures of care under Ryan White  In order to achieve the balance  we must continue to resolve the issues of funding that are so important to the success of this legislation The Ryan White CARE Act is about more than just funds and health care services  It s about caring and the American tradition of reaching out to people who are suffering and in need of help  I am grateful to Senator Enzi and his staff  Congressman Barton and his staff  Congressman Dingell and his staff  and the Administration for the successful bipartisan  bicameral process that brought us to this day  The Ryan White CARE Act has made a life changing impact for so many over the last 16 years  I am hopeful this process results in a fair and balanced piece of legislation worthy of its purpose   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
