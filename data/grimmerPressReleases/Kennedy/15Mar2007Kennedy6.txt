         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  These proposals by some Republicans in Congress head us in the wrong direction    We owe it to children  parents and teachers to strengthen our commitment to  progress  not weaken it   When we authorized this law in 2001  Congress rejected  block grants and embraced rigorous standards and accountability to improve our  schools   I m confident that Congress will take the same approach in this  reauthorization  We will make common sense changes to the No Child Left  Behind law to improve the law and reflect the lessons learned over the five  years since it was enacted   I look forward to continuing our bipartisan efforts  to achieve that goal    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
