         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to the National Assessment of Education Progress  NAEP  released by the Department of Education on mapping the standards set by each state for the No Child Left Behind Act   I commend the U S  Department of Education for this important report  The No Child Left Behind Act assigns responsibility to each state for setting their own standards  But this analysis suggests that now  more than ever  we must do more to ensure that state standards are aligned to the knowledge and skills needed for success in the 21st Century  Regardless of the state in which they reside  all students should receive the full support and challenging curriculum needed to learn to their potential  I look forward to working in No Child Left Behind to help encourage states to adopt a more consistent and rigorous definition of what students should know and be able to do  in key subjects such as reading  math  and science      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
