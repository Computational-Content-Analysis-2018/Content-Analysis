the treatment of offenders diagnosed with mental illnesses      Senator Kennedy said  In his last public bill signing in 1963  President Kennedy signed a  3 billion authorization bill to create a national network of community mental health facilities across the country  With the escalation of the Vietnam War  not one penny of the  3 billion was ever appropriated  Now  far too often  mentally ill individuals encounter the criminal justice system when what is really needed is treatment and support  It is unconscionable  and may well be unconstitutional  for these vulnerable individuals to be further marginalized once they are incarcerated and  in too many cases  denied even minimal treatment because of inadequate resources  With this bill  Congress can provide significant support to improve and expand cooperation between law enforcement and mental health experts in order to improve our nations public safety     Many communities are not prepared to meet the needs of individuals with mental illness when they enter the criminal justice system  let alone treat them  The bill we are introducing today will help provide states and counties the resources needed to design and implement collaborative efforts between the criminal justice system and mental health care structures  I ve witnessed the mental health courts in action and they work  We need this bill to build on the success of this grant program  said Domenici      Sixteen percent of people under correctional supervision    or over one million individuals  suffer from a serious mental illness  Most of these individuals have been charged with or convicted of non violent crimes that are a direct consequence of their not having received needed treatment and supportive services for their mental illness  This bill reauthorizes critical programs to move away from troubled systems that often result in the escalating incarceration of individuals with mental illness  The Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act  MIOTCRA  provides federal support for collaboration between criminal justice and mental health systems on jail diversion  correctional treatment  community reentry  and cross training of criminal justice and mental health personnel which can significantly improve efforts to foster recovery  improve treatment outcomes  and decrease recidivism  The grants authorized under this bill are cost effective  improve public safety  and link individuals with the treatment they need to become productive members of their community      Section By Section of The Mentally Ill
