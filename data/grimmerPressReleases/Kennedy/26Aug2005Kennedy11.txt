         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT   Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy  202 224 2633 April Boyd  Kerry  202  224 3558 Julie Teer  Romney  617  725 4025 Steve Schwadron  Delahunt  202 225 3111 Massachusetts s senior elected leaders were baffled by the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission s vote to close Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod  The decision by the independent commission will result in the relocation of the 102nd Fighter Wing to Barnes Municipal Airport Air Guard Station in Western Massachusetts  Senator Kennedy said  We re greatly disappointed that the BRAC commissioners did not take Otis off the list for closure  Given the strength of our case  we ll have to look at the commission s data carefully to figure out how they could have made this decision and determine its effect on Massachusetts and national security  We made a compelling  factual case to keep Otis open and it is very disappointing that the Commission disagrees with us  said Governor Mitt Romney   The vote follows a three month intensive effort to overturn the closure recommendation  led by the political leaders  the Otis Coalition of base area community leaders  and the Massachusetts Air National Guard  The group made a series of strong and detailed arguments to the BRAC Commission demonstrating that the recommendation to close Otis was based on a flawed Air Force analysis which miscalculated the base s military value    the most important single criterion of the decision process    as well as the amount of money that the Federal Government could save by closing Otis  The Commission s decision makes no sense  I will continue to explore congressional and legal options to keep Otis open and keep the A 10s at Barnes  The Fighter Wings at Otis and Barnes are superb units that play a critical role in our defense and homeland security  I m also concerned that the Commission s decision will undermine the ability of the Coast Guard to continue their life saving work out of Otis  said Senator John Kerry  The Pentagon  and now the BRAC commission  got it dead wrong  said Congressman William Delahunt  Closing Otis puts both the Coast Guard mission on the Cape and our nation s homeland defense at serious risk  It is my hope the Governor and Attorney General will continue to pursue all possible legal avenues available to the state  As the BRAC plan moves to the Congress  I will do all I can to defeat it legislatively  The Defense Department used incorrect data to calculate Otis s military value during its internal closure review  The miscalculations led the Air Force to rank Otis 88th among all Air Force facilities for suitability as a fighter base  Among the data errors were a failure to give Otis credit for its proximity to large airspace training ranges where the 102nd s pilots fly their planes  and underestimating the size of the base s hangars and ramp space for storing aircraft  When Air Guard analysts reran the calculations using the correct data  Otis  ranking jumped from 88th to 24th  a rating that clearly justified keeping Otis open  On the cost issue  another miscalculation led the Air Force to predict savings of  336 million over 20 years from closing the base and other related changes in Air National Guard force structure  On further scrutiny  Massachusetts leaders determined that closing Otis would actually cost taxpayers 163 million over the same time period  This represented an overstatement of savings by the Air Force of nearly half a billion dollars  The potential closure of Otis also threatens the continued presence of the Coast Guard s Air Station on Cape Cod  Therefore  the future of the only Coast Guard air unit for search  rescue  and interdiction missions in the Northeast remains in question  When the BRAC Commission completes its final deliberations on Friday  it will have until September 8th to forward to the President its list of recommended base closures and realignments  The President then has until September 23rd to forward the report to Congress or return it to the Commission for further evaluation   If the President returns the list to the Commission  the panel then has until October 20 to resubmit its list to the President with any amendments it may choose to make  The President would then have until November 7 to send the list to Congress  If the President fails to send the list to Congress  the BRAC process terminates without implementation  If the President sends the list to Congress  it has 45 days during which it can reject the full list by enacting a joint resolution  Otherwise  the BRAC list becomes law    Massachusetts s senior elected leaders were baffled by the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission s vote to close Otis
