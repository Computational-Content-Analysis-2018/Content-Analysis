         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The FDA is responsible for assuring the safety of the food we eat  and the medicines we rely on to keep us healthy  An FDA Commissioner must have the vision to lead  the competence to make crucial public health decisions  and the integrity to keep FDA s decisions free from political manipulation I look forward to a careful evaluation of Dr  von Eschenbach s qualifications in these areas  and to a thorough examination of his capacity to see that FDA once again sets the standard for quality  sound science  and integrity  That being said  I expect the Administration will have to address the Plan B issue fair and square before he can be confirmed    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
