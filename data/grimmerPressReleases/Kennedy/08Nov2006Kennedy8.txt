         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washington  DC  Today Senator Edward Kennedy applauded the success of the six states that passed minimum wage increases and reiterated his determination to pass a federal minimum wage increase in the new Congress   Democratic leaders in the House and Senate are ready to put Kennedys plan for an immediate vote and are committed to giving millions of Americans the raise they deserve   The victories in Arizona  Colorado  Missouri  Montana  Nevada and Ohio strongly demonstrate the need for prompt federal action to raise the minimum wage  Senator Kennedy  a lifelong champion of working families  has been fighting for years to pass his bill that would raise the minimum wage from  5 15 to  7 25   While his plan has had bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate  Republican leadership has repeatedly blocked the bill from passage  Today is the first day of a new direction for America    Its also the first day in many years that we can start putting the interests of working men and women ahead of special interests   Washington wouldnt act on raising the minimum wage  so America did  and now the new Congress will  Senator Kennedy said    Millions of Americans spoke out loud and clear that no one who works for a living should have to live in poverty   They stood up for fairness  and renewed the Americas commitment to the common good that fell victim too often over the last several years to the politics of fear and division    When Congress reconvenes under the new Democratic Leadership  working men and women will get a raise  and America will finally move forward again Details of Senator Kennedys plan are below    RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS Senator Kennedys Fair Minimum Wage Act would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps                 5 85 60 days after enactment                6 55 one year later                7 25 one year after that  The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office  37 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children    Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s     An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem   Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year earn  10 700 per year  almost  6 000 below the federal poverty guidelines of  16 600 for a family of three  Since then the minimum wage was last raised in 1997  its real value has eroded by 21 3 percent     Every day the minimum wage is not increased  it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind  Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase   Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  4 00 below what it was in 1968   To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  9 37 an hour today  not  5 15    Nearly fifteen million Americans will benefit from a minimum wage increase to  7 25 an hour  6 6 million directly  and another 8 3 million indirectly   Fifty nine percent of these workers are women  and forty percent are people of color   Eighty percent of those who would benefit are adult workers  not teenagers seeking pocket change  Fifty four percent of workers who will benefit are full time employees  and more than a third of these adults are sole breadwinners for their families      Increasing the minimum wage will help more than 7 3 million children whose parents would receive a raise       Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 400 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families   It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy     o      15 months of grocerieso      19 months of utilitieso      8 months of rento      Over two years of health careo      20 months of child careo      30 months of college tuition at a public  2 year college  This year  the Senate raised its pay by  3 100 and is set to receive an additional  3 300 raise in 2007   It is shameful that Members of Congress received our eighth pay increase in nine years  yet we have not provided a single pay increase to the lowest paid workers    The salaries of lawmakers have gone up by  31 600 since 1997  while minimum wage workers continue to earn just  10 700 a year  History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation   In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades   Nearly 12 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 248 000 per month     In contrast  in the last four years  the minimum wage has held steady  but only 4 9 million jobs have been created  States across this country have raised their own minimum wages without adverse economic consequences   Study after study has shown that raising the minimum wage has not cost jobs in the states  An Economic Policy Institute study of Washington  Oregon  and Alaska showed that increases in the state minimum wage had no impact on the state unemployment rate   Similarly  the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center has found that after the last two minimum wage increases in Massachusetts in 2000 and 2001  employment grew more quickly in sectors with the most minimum wage workers  including leisure  hospitality  and the service sector  A recent Gallup poll found that 86  of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business  and three out of four small businesses said that a 10  increase in the minimum wage would have no effect on their company  Additionally  nearly half of small business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased  and only 16  of owners think the minimum wage should be reduced or eliminated entirely  Britain has the second largest economy in Europe  after Germany    They implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty   They raised their minimum wage to about  9 51 per hour last year  and they are planning to raise this rate to about  9 89 in October of this year  Ireland has an extremely robust economy  with impressive growth over the last decade  and the fourth largest GDP per capita in the world   The minimum wage rate in Ireland is 7 65  hour  about  9 65  and yet their unemployment rate is lower than the U S   LAURA CAPPS   202 224 2633
