         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     This is an important mark up  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is one of our landmark statutes  For nearly 30 years  it has regulated government surveillance in a way that protects both our national security and our civil liberties and prevents the government from abusing its powers  It is because FISA enhances both security and liberty that it has won such broad support over the years from presidents  members of Congress  and the public alike     FISA was able to strike the right balance because of the way it was enacted and implemented  The Administration worked with Congress in a genuine partnership  It was an open  thorough  and collaborative process that took several years to get right     The original FISA legislation was the product of collaboration between the Attorney General and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle  A Democratic Congress worked with a Republican Administration to develop a wiretapping program we could all support  and it has served America well  Thats why its so troubling that the Bush Administration has consistently pursued a different path      Unlike every previous administration  it decided that FISA was an inconvenience  With the help of phone companies  the Bush Administration launched a warrantless surveillance program that secretly spied on Americans for years  without any court orders or oversight  They never told Congress what they were doing  and they never told the FISA court what they were doing  Office of Legal Counsel head Jack Goldsmith testified that it was the biggest legal mess  he  had ever encountered     When the Administration finally reached out to Congress earlier this year  it did so not in the spirit of partnership  but to bully us into obeying its wishes  The Protect America Act was negotiated in secret at the last minute  with the Administration issuing dire threats that failure to enact a bill before the August recess could lead to disaster  Few  if any  knew what the language would actually do  Before and after the Act was passed  the Director of National Intelligence made the outrageous claims that Congress was putting American lives at risk merely by debating how to make FISA more effective  The result of this flawed process was flawed legislation  which virtually everyone now acknowledges must be substantially revised     Since the Protect America Act  the Administration has begun to work with Congress in a more effective manner  But only just started  Until very recently  for example  the Administration refused to turn over any documents on its warrantless eavesdropping program  despite congressional subpoenas  It has now shared documents with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and with this Committee  but it still refuses to share these documents with the House  This kind of selective information sharing raises the obvious suspicion that the White House is willing to work only with lawmakers who agree with its position      This Committee is now called upon to consider the FISA Amendments Act of 2007  reported last month by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  Members of that committee worked hard on this bill  and I commend them for their diligent efforts  Their bill contains notable improvements over the Protect America Act  but it also has a number of defects that trouble me greatly  For example                     Im encouraged that some of these concerns are already addressed in the substitute bill now before us  There is still much more to be done  however  and I expect to offer several amendments  Im hopeful that working together  we can produce a bill that protects both our national security and our civil liberties in the best tradition of the longstanding FISA law          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
