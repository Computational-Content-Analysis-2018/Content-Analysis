         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C     Today the State Department made an announcement that several thousand Iraqi refugee referrals would be processed and funds would be given to the UNHCR  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration  Border Security  and Refugees  held the first Congressional hearing on this issue last month and has lead the charge for the U S  to help solve this emerging crisis  Below is his response  I am pleased that the Administration has decided to provide  18 million to the UNHCR to deal with the crisis of Iraqi refugees and will process 7000 of their refugee referrals  Two million Iraqis have fled the country  1 7 million more have been displaced and thousands more are on the move every day   many of whom have targets on their backs because they have cooperated with the United States and assisted us in the war  The Administration has allowed less than 500 Iraqi refugees in the country since the start of the conflict  and this news is a welcome development  While we cant solve this problem alone  we have a moral responsibility to do all that we can and provide the necessary leadership to prevent this crisis from getting worse  I believe we can do more  by providing at least  30 million    half of what is needed  to the appeal  Also the Department of State should move quickly to get Iraqi refugees into the pipeline and continue to expedite the referral process so that refugees who are at great risk  especially those at risk for their close association with the U S     can arrive here safely  Additionally  I urge the Administration to actively participate in the UNs international conference to help both the refugees themselves and the countries in the region that are bearing the heaviest burden of hosting them  We can no longer ignore the plight of Iraqi refugees Below is a colloquy between Senator Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration  Border Security  and Refugees and Senator Leahy  chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the State Department  It calls for an additional  10 million from the State Department for the UNHCR appeal in the Continuing Resolution  and was included in the Congressional Record today Mr  Kennedy  Mr  President  I commend Senator Leahy  Chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee  for including an additional  20 million for Iraqi refugees in the Continuing Resolution More than 3 million Iraqis have been displaced from their homes  and many of them have fled the country  America has a special obligation to help them and the neighboring countries in meeting their needs The UNHCR has made an international appeal for  60 million to deal with this emerging crisis  and the United States plans to provide  20 million to that appeal  Our invasion of Iraq led to this crisis  and we have a clear responsibility to do more to ease it  We should provide at least half the funding for this  60 million appeal to help this growing refugee population I believe  10 million of the funds in this bill should be for the UNHCR appeal  in an effort to raise the total U S  contribution to  30 million  Is that the chairmans intent Mr  Leahy  Yes  it is  Senator Kennedy  who is the Chairman of the Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on Refugees  makes an important point  I believe that the U S  should contribute half of the funds  and I will work with Senator Kennedy and with the State Department to ensure that those funds are provided  I agree that America should show greater leadership by providing at least half the funds  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
