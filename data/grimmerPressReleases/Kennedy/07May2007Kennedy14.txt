         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  A week ago  my friend  Senator Enzi  and I stood on this same spot and began the debate on our drug safety legislation  During the past week  we have made much progress in addressing the priorities of the American people  The Senate has chosen to add a major proposal on food safety to our legislation  Other amendments will be included later this afternoon  on important issues such as direct to consumer advertising  citizens petitions  and many more  That we have reached agreement on such a broad range of complex and difficult policy questions is a tribute to our colleagues willingness to work with us and with the Senate to come to agreement on matters of great importance  I commend all of our colleagues and their staffs for the long hours and hard work that went into crafting these proposals Safety is at the core of this bill  FDA ought to be the gold standard for safety  but its luster has been tarnished by failures to protect the American people from unsafe drugs  The American public was rightly shocked to know that the arthritis drug Vioxx was allowed to stay on the market for 5 years even though it nearly doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke  Antidepressants used by millions were found to increase the risk of suicide in adolescents  Americans have needlessly been put at risk  and they are demanding action from Congress FDA now lacks clear legal authority to protect public health  When lives are on the line  doctors should be making the crucial decisions  but because FDAs authority is so unclear  they first must call the lawyers for their opinion as to whether they can act  When patients are in danger  FDA shouldnt have to wait to get legal opinions to decide how to protect health  It should be able to act  and our bill gives them that authority Our legislation gives FDA the ability to require post market studies to investigate risks  It allows FDA to require label changes rather than relying on voluntary requests to companies to do the right thing  It allows FDA to require special training for physicians or even to restrict the use of a drug where there is no other way that it can be used safely  We require review of advertising to see that it accurately depicts the risks and effectiveness of drugs  and we devote funds from the user fee program to these public health needs I have fought for these protections not for a week  not for this Congress  but for decades  In 1979  I introduced the Drug Regulation Reform Act  to give FDA the clear authority to protect public health  The Senate approved it  but the House failed to act  and I have worked ever since to see that FDA can take action to protect public health where needed  We have waited long enough for action Our legislation includes other important provisions too  Senator Dodds proposal to encourage development of new medicines and medical devices for children is a strong part of the original legislation  as is Senator Clintons bill to give HHS the authority to require studies of drugs in children when the incentives are ineffective During our committees consideration of the legislation  many members brought forward important recommendations to strengthen the proposal  Senator Mikulski contributed major provisions on improving transparency at the FDA  and strengthening its scientific integrity  As we moved to the Senate floor  other colleagues came forward with their ideas that we were able to include either in the base bill or in the package of amendments we will be adding shortly Senator Durbin contributed his important proposals on improving the safety of the food supply  Senator Stabenow  Senator Brown  Senator Lott  Senator Thune  Senator Hatch and Senator Coburn developed a proposal on citizens petitions that will end the abuse of the system while preserving FDAs ability to review those petitions that have public health merit  Senator Roberts and Senator Harkin worked together successfully to solve the difficult issue of how to see that direct to consumer advertisements provide effective safety information to patients while meeting the stringent test of constitutionality  Senators Brownback and Brown contributed an innovative idea to encourage the development of new therapies for neglected diseases that affect many millions of the poorest citizens of the world  Senator Vitter has contributed a proposal on counterfeit drugs that will be included here today too  All these  and many other proposals besides  will be lost if this bill fails  A bill with such strong and effective reforms to improve the lives of American families should pass by acclamation  but instead  the Republican leadership has held it hostage to a vote on an amendment that will gut the essence of the Dorgan Snowe reimportation amendment But all of this hard work  all of this careful consideration  all of this important progress for American families is threatened by one thing  and one thing alone  the intransigence of a Republican leadership that has ignored all efforts to find a way for the Senate to consider legislation on reimportation  time after time and year after year  Senator Reid  Senator Dorgan  and I have offered again and again to find a way to allow consideration of the reimportation bill to give it the straight up or down vote it deserves  We have made clear that the debate would include consideration of competing proposals and the Cochran amendment  We have been flexible in offering time for debate  in determining when the debate will occur  and on the amendments to be offered  But each offer of flexibility has been met with rigid denial  Each offer to talk has been met with silence  Each offer to make progress for the American people has been met with obstruction from a determined minority bent on finding a way to stop this bill I believe that the American people deserve prescription drugs that not only are safer but that cost less  too  But the White House apparently is listening more to the big drug companies than to the American people  The White House says the President will veto this bill if it cuts the cost of prescription drugs  After all  that means lower profits for the pharmaceutical industry  Never mind that Americans are facing skyrocketing health costs  The Bush Administrations priority is to protect profits  not patients It is my hope that we can move forward to ensure the safety of our food and the safety of our medicines  We owe that to the American people  And if we must fight another day to lower the costs of prescription drugs by allowing Americans to buy cheaper drugs from Canada and other nations  then I stand with my Democratic colleagues to wage that fight  It is a fight that we will win because the American people urgently need relief from rising health care costs So I have concluded that the only answer for me is to support the Cochran amendment now  on this bill  so that we can continue the fight for safer medicines  pure food  and a stronger FDA The long battle for cheaper prescription drugs is not over  And it will not be over until we achieve the victory that the American people demand       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
