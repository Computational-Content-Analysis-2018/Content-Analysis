         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  as of today   2000 American soldiers have been killed in combat in Iraq    Since last January s election in Iraq  we have lost 565 American soldiers  74 of those soldiers have been killed in October    an average of three a day  An additional 15 220 have been wounded  and more than 7 000 of whom were unable to return to combat     The youngest of America s fallen soldiers was just 18  The oldest was 59  Nearly three quarters had not even celebrated their 30th birthday  They came from every state in the nation  This includes 38 soldiers from my own state of Massachusetts    They are the best of America  and we re proud of each one  Although I disagree with the President about Iraq  I honor the service and sacrifice and dedication of each of these brave men and women     Our armed forces are serving ably in Iraq under enormously difficult circumstances and the policy of our government must be worthy of their sacrifice  Unfortunately  it is not  and the American people know it     Our soldiers in Iraq need more than happy talk about progress from the President  They need more than a public relations campaign     They need an effective plan to end the violence  and stabilize Iraq  so they can come home with dignity and honor      Reality is hard medicine to swallow  Facts are stubborn things  As the Valerie Plame case makes increasingly clear  the administration stopped at nothing to cover up its misguided and dishonest decision to go to war  and our servicemen and women  their families  and friends are paying an unacceptable price  They deserve better    much better from their President and so does the nation  It was wrong for the President to rush to war for such a deeply questionable cause  President Bush once said that the war in Iraq was a catastrophic success  He s half right in one sense  The war has been a catastrophefor our soldiers and their families  for the war on terrorism  and for America s standing in the world  It has made the United States more hated in the world than at any other time in our history     Beyond the cost in human lives and to our national security  there has been an enormous financial cost    American taxpayers are spending  195 million each day in Iraq    For the cost of fighting the war in Iraq for one day  we could make significant improvements in homeland security      We could provide 4 million American households with emergency readiness kits  We could close the crisis communications technology gap for 41 small cities  36 mid sized cities  or 6 large cities  so that federal  state and local first responders can talk to one another during an emergency    We could purchase 780 fire trucks for improving local emergency response capabilities  and we could employ 5 000 fire fighters  4 000 police patrol officers  or 7 000 paramedics and emergency medical technicians for one year each     For the cost of fighting the war in Iraq one day  we could double the federal budget for nuclear reactor safety and security inspections to ensure that these potential terrorist targets are adequately protected    We could pay for 1 100 additional border patrol agents to better guard our borders against potential terrorists    We could provide 9 700 port container inspection units to detect hazardous materials being trafficked into the country    Obviously  the  195 million a day we spend in Iraq could be better spent on the all important areas of jobs  education  and health care  which the Senate is debating today  Instead of spending those funds in Iraq  we could spend them on better teachers  better financial aid for college students better health care for families  and countless other priorities whose budgets are being cut back because of Iraq  I ask unanimous consent that a document I ve prepared outlining the various ways  195 million dollars a day could be spent on pressing priorities at home be added to the record     Instead of covering up mistakes in Iraq  it is time for the President to admit them  to adopt an effective strategy to end this war and begin to bring our troops home  and to stop ignoring the very real priorities facing the nation and the many many challenges facing us at home and abroad     The Real Cost of the Iraq War to American Taxpayers  195 million per day    For the cost of fighting the
