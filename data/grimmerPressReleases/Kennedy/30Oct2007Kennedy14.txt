         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      As Prepared for Delivery     I come to the Senate floor today to speak about health insurance  Not the health insurance available to Senators or members of the House or the President and his cabinet  As I was reminded again during my recent experience  we have access to excellent insurance to pay the cost of whatever care we need  Our health coverage is never in question      How  then  can we keep on saying let them eat cake year after year to the millions of our fellow citizens in cities  towns and villages across the country who have no such health insurance coverage because their employers dont provide it and they cant afford it on their own      I speak of those who do not work in marbled halls or beneath vaulted ceilings  of those who work at the local bakery or the repair shop  or make their living stocking shelves or cleaning offices  They are the heart and soul of America  and their children are Americas future  The Childrens Health Insurance Program is for them       This debate is about our commitment to millions of American men and women  who work hard every day  pay taxes  and care for their children  but who stay awake at night worrying because they cant afford the cost of a sudden illness       We have it within our power to make sure that parents for 10 million children no longer have that worry  We have it within our grasp to see that 10 million American children will grow up healthy and become strong  productive citizens who fulfill our greatest hopes for them       That is what this Childrens Health Insurance debate is all about  Healthy lives for children  Peace of mind for parents  Congress acting for the common good      CHIP isnt a Republican idea or a Democratic idea  Its not a state program or a federal initiative  Its not public sector or private sector  Its all of those things  and more  CHIP is an American success story       Over the past decade since it was first enacted  we have seen what it can do to transform young lives  Since then  the percentage of uninsured children has dropped from almost 23 percent in 1997 to 14 percent in 2005      The evidence is clear and irrefutable  When children receive the health care they need  they do better academically  emotionally  physically and socially  CHIP all but eliminates the shameful racial and ethnic health disparities for the minority children who disproportionately depend on it for their coverage     The American people know that the Childrens Health Insurance Program works  and a clear bipartisan majority of us in Congress know it  too  But President Bush  and his diehard Republican supporters are determined to obstruct health care for ten million children      There is an old saying familiar to every first year law student  If the law is against you  pound the facts  If the facts are against you  pound the law  If the law and the facts are against you  pound the table      The President and his supporters in Congress have been pounding the table hard and often on this issue in recent months  The President keeps saying the same thing  but it is no more true today than it was last week or last month  and its time to set the record straight       Theyve pounded the table about all the families making  83 000 a year who are supposedly eligible for CHIP  Let me tell you how many families making  83 000 a year are enrolled in CHIP  None  Not in Massachusetts  Not in New   York  Not in New   Jersey  Not in California  Nowhere  Zero  Not a single child in a family making  83 000 is eligible for CHIP      The new bill approved by the House last Thursday goes even a step further even than current law  and makes it illegal to cover anyone in families making over  62 000 a year  or 300 percent of the poverty level  There it is  in big black letters on page 75 of the bill  Denial of Payments for Children with Effective Family Income that Exceeds 300 Percent of the Poverty Line       The President and his supporters in Congress have pounded the table on the notion that CHIP does not give priority to lower income children  Again  the facts are otherwise  Medicaid covers children in poverty  and has for 40 years       According to the Congressional Research Service  91 percent of children covered by CHIP are in families with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty level  or  41 000 a year for a family of four  and almost all of the nine percent of families above this level pay premiums to defray the cost of coverage for their children  The need for genuine outreach to more of the low income children is a serious problem  but its a foolish solution to address it by denying CHIP to children who also need it      Facts are stubborn things  and all the table pounding in the world cant change them  The basic fact of CHIP is that it began as a principled bipartisan compromise  and it remains so even now      Nevertheless  the White House has called upon supporters of CHIP to compromise and compromise and compromise      And we have      But this much is clear  We will not compromise the future of a generation of American children just because they come from the working poor      Surely  they are more important than multi billion dollar tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals or the largest corporations     They are more important than subsidies for the big oil companies      They are more important than preserving the obscene tax breaks for so called carried interest       These are Americas deserving children  Mr  President  and Democrats in Congress will stand up for them every time       We have been more than willing to work with Republicans in Congress on reasonable and realistic compromises that still meet our obligations to these children       Many of us initially called for a much larger bill to properly serve the needs of all the nations children       But we accepted a less costly bill in order to obtain broad bipartisan support      We also wanted to retain the right of each state to determine how best to serve its children  and  to decide which children needed help the most       Here too  we compromised to address their concerns  This bill sets a hard ceiling of 300 percent of the poverty level on the amount of income a family can earn and still remain eligible for CHIP      Year after year  the Administration has granted waivers to cover adults under CHIP  As of February of this year  the Administration has granted waivers to 14 different states to cover adults through CHIP  In August of 2002 they said yes to covering 40 000 adults in New Mexico  In October 2002 they said yes to over 334 000 in Oregon  In January 2003 they said yes to 12 000 more adults in New Jersey  And in May of this year amidst statements from the President that CHIP should put kids first his administration said yes to 39 000 adults in Wisconsin  But now they want to say no  The White House is now shocked  shocked   to discover that adults are covered under CHIP  It actually cites the consequences of their own decisions as a failing of our proposal      The legislation the Senate approved last month reversed this policy by moving adults out of the program over the next two years  The bill now before us goes one step further  It removes childless adults from the program by the end of next year      The requirement that children produce onerous documentation to prove their citizenship has been shown to be a barrier to care for American children  because they often had great difficulty in meeting the burdensome requirements of the policy      These high barriers were imposed because of a fallacy  the myth that they prevented children in America illegally from using these services  A recent letter from the Congressional Budget Office refutes that claim  saying  Available evidence  based on state reports and other information provided by state officials  suggests that virtually all of those who have been unable to provide the required documentation are U S  citizens  That statement couldnt be clearer  It was American children  eligible for CHIP or Medicaid  who were denied services by these requirements  not the undocumented       The cost of this witch hunt has been high  According to a recent report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  the six states that have examined this issue in detail spent  17 million to administer the requirement  have denied health insurance to tens of thousands of needy children and parents as a result  and have identified a grand total of eight undocumented individuals  The number of low income children insured through Medicaid has dropped 11 000 in Virginia and 14 000 in Kansas due to the new requirements  each state identified one applicant who incorrectly claimed to be a citizen      Weve seen this all before  In other areas  extensive requirements for documents have been used to deny Americans their rights in the name of preventing abuses that turned out to be more myth than reality  In Georgia  Americans have had to provide demeaning proofs of citizenship  imposed to prevent supposed voter fraud at the polls  but designed in reality to suppress turnout among seniors and racial and ethnic minorities      Even here  we accepted a compromise by requiring the Social Security Administration to verify the citizenship of any child seeking coverage under CHIP      Its obvious to everyone that our bipartisan majority for an effective CHIP program has made compromise after compromise  The time has come to stand up and be counted to see who is for childrens health insurance and who is against it       We need to know who is for families like the Vega family in Greenfield  Massachusetts  CHIP helps Flor Vega  a working mother  buy an extra inhaler for her 5 year old daughter  so she could have one at school and the other at home  CHIP also helped her afford a nebulizer  the small  portable device that pumps the asthma medicine into the lungs when an inhaler isn t effective  That means her daughter doesnt face sudden dangerous attacks of asthma that require her to go to the emergency room      We need to know who is for families like the Lewis family in Springfield  Massachusetts  I met Dedra Lewis and her daughter Alexsiana when they came here to talk to me about the difference that CHIP has made in their lives  Alexsiana has a rare eye disease that requires expensive drops every hour of every day  To take care of her daughter  her mother had to cut back her hours at work  and she lost her insurance  Without CHIP  they would be choosing between paying the mortgage for their home or paying for medicine that Alexsiana needs to keep her vision      Family after family from coast to coast could tell similar stories  Thats why families across America are calling on Congress to renew the promise of CHIP       The task has not been easy  but we will not be deterred or deflected       When Medicare was first proposed in the 1960s to allow the nations senior citizens to live their retirement years in dignity  its supporters were attacked with much the same harsh rhetoric as we hear now about CHIP  its Socialized medicine  Its a Government takeover  But Congress rejected that absurd rhetoric  and hundreds of millions of senior citizens have benefited immensely ever since       American families face real challenges  higher mortgages  soaring gas prices  the ever increasing cost of health care  and many other burdens  They deserve real solutions  not empty slogans      Our opponents failed to stop Medicare  and they wont stop CHIP now  Medicare didnt pass on the first attempt  but its supporters came back again and again and again with the force of the American people behind them to ask  to demand  that Congress act  And the 1964 election made it happen      And thats just what well do with CHIP  even if it takes the 2008 election to do it      Well keep at it until the children of America get the health care that they deserve and that the American people are demanding      We know what the Presidents priorities are  He is calling yet again for more money  on top of more money  on top of yet more money to pay for the war in Iraq      The President has made his judgment  Hes decided to pour even more of our national treasure into the sands of Iraq and to burden our economy with the immense costs of the war for years to come       Every day the war goes on  we spend whats needed to cover a quarter million children       We have a military surge to help the people of Iraq  I say we need a health care surge to help the children of America      This Administration is quick to highlight their achievements on health care for the children of Iraq  but won t show the same commitment to the health of our own children       In Iraq  American money has renovated 52 primary care clinics and re equipped 600 others  But in America  children are denied essential medical services in the name of fiscal discipline      In Iraq  our citizens have paid for 30 million doses of childrens vaccine  But in America  were told we cant afford basic preventive care for 10 million children      The web site of the US Agency for International Development proudly notes a remarkable accomplishment  and I commend them for it  They have successfully vaccinated 98 percent of all Iraqi children against measles  mumps and rubella  If only we could do as well for our own children      According to the CDC  only 91 percent of American children had received the same vaccine by the recommended age  The Administration should be as concerned that children growing up in Boston or Birmingham get their recommended vaccines as they are about the children of Baghdad and Basra      That same web site proudly notes that USAID has improved the health of vulnerable populations in Iraq by increasing access to high quality  community based primary healthcare  Thats just what were trying to do for vulnerable populations in America       In Iraq  its an accomplishment  In America  its a veto      A bipartisan majority in Congress has made a judgment  too  Our judgment is that we must make room for decent health care for Americas children  We must stand up to the empty rhetoric and hollow slogans of the White House  and give all children in America get the healthy start in life they deserve     AMTRAK     Mr  President  I strongly support the Passenger Rail Improvement and Investment Act  I commend the bills managers for their leadership on this issue  and Im proud to be an original sponsor of this important legislation     Effective passenger rail service is more essential than ever at this time when gas prices  the nations economy  and our environment are on everyones mind     Americans are being squeezed at the gas pump  with prices now surpassing two dollars and eighty cents a gallon   up more than 25 percent over this time last year  The oil companies are reaping massive profits at the expense of millions of hardworking men and women in all parts of America      Weve just learned that Royal Dutch Shell amassed over  6 9 billion in profits during the third quarter of this year   bringing their year to date total to nearly  23 billion     ConocoPhillips collected over  3 6 billion during the third quarter  bringing their total profit for the first three quarters to over  7 5 billion      Meanwhile Americans earnings arent growing nearly fast enough to meet the demands of Big Oil  Since President Bush took office  productivity has grown by more than 17   but real median household income has seen no change     Clearly  we cant rely on Big Oil to play fair  so its vital that we dont hand them a monopoly over our transportation options      For over three decades  Amtrak has given the nation a safe  reliable and energy efficient alternative      Now  we must make the necessary investments in passenger rail service to preserve this important transportation option      The pending bill gives Amtrak the funds it needs to continue operating and make necessary repairs      It couldnt be timelier  because more and more Americans are choosing passenger rail  Recently Amtrak reported its highest ridership ever   nearly 26 million passengers in 2007     Its particularly gratifying that the bill gives special priority to the over burdened Northeast Corridor  allowing it to return to a state of good repair by 2012      Rail transit has long been an important part of Massachusetts public transportation system  Bostons Green Line   110 years old   is the oldest subway system in North America  The Northeast Corridor is the backbone of Amtrak today  serving 10 million passengers      An excellent example of why this bill is so important is the Downeaster  which operates between Boston and Portland  Maine  The Downeaster launched its service at the end of 2001  and it has already carried over 1 5 million passengers  The line is so popular that it recently added a fifth daily round trip to meet the demand     We need to continue to expand these options for the good of our economy and the environment  Public transportation creates thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue      The number of light rail systems has tripled in the past 35 years  and heavy rail service has nearly doubled  We need to do much more  however  to make public transportation a viable option if were going to end the nations addiction to oil and reduce the harm being done to our environment from greenhouse gas emissions      Of the 20 million barrels of oil America consumes daily  more than 60 percent is consumed by the transportation sector  Public transportation today saves us 1 4 billion gallons of gasoline each year  which translates into 108 million fewer cars filling up     Equally important  these investments relieve the growing congestion on our roads  The Texas Transportation Institutes latest Urban Mobility Report found that congestion is costing the nation  78 billion a year and forcing the average driver to waste 38 hours in traffic  while burning 26 gallons of gasoline  In the greater Boston area  travelers face even longer traffic delays in a year   spending 46 hours stuck in traffic and wasting over 30 gallons of gasoline      These delays help explain why more and more people are choosing Amtrak  Earlier this year  Amtrak reported that its Acela line   which operates between Boston  New York  Philadelphia and Washington   had an on time performance record of nearly 90   and nearly a 25  increase in ridership     Those are strong results  The pending bill will make the system even stronger  and I urge my colleagues to support it      RED SOX WORLD SERIES WIN     Its great to be back in the Senate today  My only regret is that Im missing the Rolling Rally to celebrate the World Series victory of our beloved Boston Red Sox  Its going to be a beautiful day in Boston     Senator Kerry and Ive introduced a resolution to honor the team for its amazing victory  their second world title in just four years  and were grateful the Senate passed it last night      For the millions of members of Red Sox Nation  this year has been a dream come true  Were enormously proud of the team and all theyve accomplished  especially the way they came back after trailing the Cleveland Indians three games to one in the American League Championship Series  and went on to win seven straight games     It was an exciting season  full of brilliant performances  and none more touching that Jon Lesters work pitching five and two thirds shutout innings in Game Four on Sunday night less than one year after being treated for lymphoma      To thousands of families struggling with cancer  his example is an inspiration      I congratulate the Colorado Rockies as well  who showed us all what can be achieved when everyone pulls together  winning an incredible 21 out of 22 games to reach the World Series and making history in the process  I have no doubt their team has a brilliant future     So I congratulate the 2007 Red Sox for a job brilliantly done  Its been a wonderful year for baseball in Boston  Were all enormously grateful to the whole team for such an inspiring and exciting season  and we look forward to another great year in 2008          Melissa
