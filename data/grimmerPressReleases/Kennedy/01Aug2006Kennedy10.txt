         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                       Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent the below letter to Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings to enforce newly enacted restrictions on the student loan program to protect students and parents against unscrupulous bank tactics    In February  Congress enacted a moratorium on a program which allowed schools to act as lenders to their students    The moratorium was enacted as a result of several lenders using the program to provide inappropriate kickbacks to schools in order to entice them to use their services   In addition to prohibiting new schools from entering the program  the law put new restrictions on the schools already in the program  designed to ensure that no one loan program has an unfair competitive advantage which could result in fewer options for students  and to ensure that students benefit directly from any proceeds from the program by requiring that schools use those proceeds for need based student aid   Since enactment of the law  some financial institutions have advised schools that they can evade the new restrictions through use of a financial arrangement known as an eligible lender trustee   In a letter sent today  Senator Kennedy urged Secretary Spellings to enforce the new law and preserve the integrity of the student aid programs by ensuring that no schools or lenders attempt to use loopholes to circumvent the restrictions on the program   Senator Kennedy noted in the letter that the Department of Education has in the past issued a policy that use of such arrangements to evade the law would not be tolerated    The letter is included below  A PDF is available upon request     August 1  2006   The Honorable Margaret Spellings Secretary Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue  SW Washington  D C  20202   Dear Secretary Spellings   As you know  in February  Congress established a moratorium on the entry of new schools into the school as lender program and enacted a number of specific obligations on institutions already in the program   Since the new restrictions were enacted  it has come to my attention that a growing number of schools are being advised by financial institutions that restrictions on the program can be circumvented through the use of an eligible lender trustee   I urge you to ensure that this loophole is not used to circumvent the law        As you know  several lenders have used the school as lender program to provide inappropriate kickbacks to participating schools in order to entice them to use their services   Schools are technically the lender for a short period of time  but a private lender ultimately holds the loan and gives the school a percentage of future profits   The new restrictions in the program were designed to ensure that no one loan program has an unfair competitive advantage  resulting in fewer options for students   These limitations also ensure that students benefit directly from any profits stemming from a schools participation in the lending process by requiring schools to use the proceeds for need based student aid     Prior to the moratorium on the program  schools in states with laws banning them from participating in the lending process were able to participate in the school as lender program through the creation of an eligible lender trust  as long as they abided by the statutory restrictions on the program   Creation of this type of arrangement is no longer relevant  since Congress has banned additional schools from becoming lenders   Nevertheless  members of the lending community are encouraging schools to use an eligible lender trust solely to circumvent the new federal restrictions     The Department of Education recognized the potential for abuse and issued a Dear Colleague Letter in 1995 to clarify that arrangements intended to evade the restrictions on the school as lender program would not be tolerated   I urge you to continue this policy of preventing lenders from using loopholes to violate the law       Millions of students and families across the nation are struggling to afford college  and they put their trust in the federal government to ensure the integrity of the financial aid process   Aggressive enforcement of the restrictions on the school as lender program is critical to protecting their interests   Thank you in advance for your assistance on this very important issue     With respect and appreciation                     Sincerely                      Edward M  Kennedy   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
