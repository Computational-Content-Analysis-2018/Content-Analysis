         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Temporary worker programs of the past  like the Bracero program  represent a shameful chapter in our history  Bracero workers were exploited by unscrupulous employers  who brutally exploited these workers  by paying them very low wages and forcing them to work in dangerous conditions    The temporary worker program included in S 2611 rejects the brutal legacy of exploitation that tarnished past programs  Anything less would be a sham and would subject these workers to abuse and undermine the jobs  wages and working conditions of U S  workers    The H 2C temporary worker program in S 2611 differs in fundamental ways from the failed approaches of the past  We include strong wage guarantees to ensure that temporary workers will not depress the wages and working conditions of American workers  Temporary workers must be paid at prevailing wages  as defined by the Davis Bacon Act  the Service Contract Act  collective bargaining agreements  or Department of Labor surveys  These strict wage guarantees ensure immigrants will receive decent pay and will not depress American wages   Employers will not be able to hire temporary workers to replace US workers  Employers may only hire temporary workers after they spend 60 days attempting to recruit US workers at the prevailing wage being offered    In contrast with previous guest worker programs  S 2611 provides strong protections to make sure that guest workers are not exploited by foreign labor contractors or by hiring themselves out as independent contractors   All of these wage and recruitment provisions are backed by strong complaint procedures and whistle blower protections  and by 2 000 new Department of Labor worksite inspectors   We also believe guest workers must not be tied to a single employer  but must have the right to vote with their feet by changing jobs when employers exploit them  In this way  employers will be forced to offer fair wages and working conditions or risk losing their immigrant labor force    Temporary workers will be able to join unions  and cannot be hired if the company is in the midst of a labor dispute   After four years  temporary workers will be able to adjust to legal permanent status without depending on an employer sponsor  This provision also empowers immigrants to look out for themselves and eliminates a major source of exploitation from previous temporary worker programs   All of these provisions were carefully crafted to protect American workers  and the temporary worker program was included in this bill specifically so that all workersimmigrant and nativewould have the right to work with dignity under the full protection of our labor laws   The Senate bill has created the most labor friendly temporary workers program in our nations history  It is good for American workers  which is why it has the active support of major labor unions such as the Service Employees International Union and UNITE HERE    The Senate bill also incorporates the AgJOBS bill  which corrects long festering problems in the agriculture sector  The AgJOBS provisions reflect far reaching and welcome agreement between the United Farm Workers and the agricultural industry that will give farm workers and their families the dignity and justice they deserve  and give agricultural employed a legal workforce    In addition to providing a fair and reasonable way for undocumented agricultural workers to earn legal status  the AgJOBS provisions also reform the current H 2A temporary visa program  so that employers unable to find American workers can hire needed foreign workers  and these workers will receive the protections they deserve  These changes reach a fair balance  By streamlining the H 2A programs application process  paperwork for employers is reduced and processing times are accelerated  Workers will be able to count on long standing protections  like the three fourths minimum work guarantee  the 50  rule  transportation cost reimbursement  and most important  the adverse effect wage rate  Anything else would undermine the jobs  wages  and working conditions of U S  workers    For too long  we tolerated illegal immigration because it seemed to be a win win exchange  employers and consumers were given access to cheap labor and low cost goods and services  but Congress was not required to make politically difficult decisions about expanding legal low skilled immigration   For too long  we turned a blind eye to the plight of the strangers in our midst  and ignored the large number of immigrant workers seeking to support their families and forced to endure deplorable conditions or risk deportation  We failed to take sensible steps to give temporary workers  which our economy continues to need  the avenues needed to work legally in the United States    Instead of confronting these serious problems  Congress continued bankrupt policies  building more fences  stationing more immigration agents at the U S  Mexican border  and restricting legal avenues of entry into the United States  But these enforcement tools have not quenched employers thirst for immigrant workers  Instead  enforcement only approaches have driven immigrants farther into the desert  dramatically increasing the number of migrant deaths due to expose or violence    Much has now changed since 9 11  The terrorist attacks remind us that undocumented immigration is a serious threat to our national security  The vast majority of those seeking to work in our country are honest and hard working  but our national security requires us to identify and monitor those who are not   Labor and business alike now demand a system in which workers rights are respected and in which workers are no longer vulnerable to deportation  The continuing health of the American economy demands a system in which all of these workers join the formal labor force and pay their taxes   The Senate temporary worker programs are fair and will provide foreign nationals with a legal way to come and work in the United States  They will significantly reduce reliance on smugglers  fraudulent documents  and violence at the border  They will also improve our ability to enforce our immigration laws  safeguard our borders  crack down on criminal activity  and protect our national security    I urge my House colleagues to support these long needed reforms to deal with urgent and dangerous problems for our national security and to improve the lives and working conditions of all workers       Laura
