         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633This legislation  S  22  is not a serious attempt to address a significant problem being faced by physicians in some states  It is the product of a party caucus rather than the bipartisan deliberations of a Senate committee  It was designed to score political points  not to achieve the bipartisan consensus which is needed to enact major legislation  In fact  the legislative language was not even available for review until late last week  For these reasons  it does not deserve to be taken seriously by the Senate We must reject the simplistic and ineffective responses proposed by those who contend that the only way to help doctors is to further hurt seriously injured patients  Unfortunately  as we saw in the Patients  Bill of Rights debate  the Bush Administration and Congressional Republicans are again advocating a policy which will benefit neither doctors nor patients  only insurance companies  Caps on compensatory damages and other extreme tort reforms are not only unfair to the victims of malpractice  they do not result in a reduction of malpractice insurance premiums Not only does this legislation fail to do what it claims  but it would do many things that its authors are attempting to conceal  In reality  this legislation is designed to shield much of the health care industry from basic accountability for the care it provides  While those across the aisle like to talk about doctors  the real beneficiaries will be insurance companies and large health care corporations  This amendment would enrich them at the expense of the most seriously injured patients  men  women and children whose entire lives have been devastated by medical neglect and abuse S 22 would drastically limit the financial responsibility of the health care industry to compensate injured patients for the harm they have suffered  This legislation is extremely broad in its scope  It defines a health care liability claim as any claim based upon the provision of  use of  or payment for  or the failure to provide  use  or pay for  health care services It is attempting to use the sympathetic family doctor as a Trojan horse concealing an enormous array of special legal privileges for every corporation which provides a health care service  or insures the payment of a medical bill  For example  this proposal would shield HMOs and health insurers that refuse to provide needed care  Less accountability will never lead to better health care Every provision of this bill is carefully designed to take existing rights away from those who have been harmed by medical neglect and corporate greed This legislation would deprive seriously injured patients of the right to recover fair compensation for their injuries by placing an arbitrary cap on how much they can receive for non economic loss  that is for the very real pain and suffering these victims experience every day  This cap only serves to hurt those patients who have suffered the most severe  life altering injuries and who have proven their cases in court They are the paralyzed  the brain injured  and the blinded  They are the ones who have lost limbs  organs  reproductive capacity  and in some cases even years of life  These are life altering conditions which deprive a person of the ability to engage in many of the normal activities of day to day living  It would be terribly wrong to take their rights away  The Bush Administration talks about deterring frivolous cases  but caps by their nature apply only to the most serious cases which have been proven in court A person with a severe injury is not made whole merely by receiving reimbursement for medical bills and lost wages  Non economic damages compensate victims for the very real loss in quality of life that results from a serious  permanent injury  It is absurd to suggest that  250 000 is fair compensation for a person paralyzed for life The sponsors of this bill claim that they have increased the cap from  250 000 to  750 000  But  that claim is very misleading  The  250 000 limit would still apply to the overwhelming majority of malpractice victims  no matter how severe their injuries  The  750 000 limit would apply only to the small number of cases in which three different defendants   one doctor and two health care institutions    were all responsible for the victim s injury  It would not even apply in cases where three doctors all committed malpractice  In reality  nothing has changed from prior Republican bills  Nearly all victims would still be prohibited from receiving more than  250 000 for their injuries Caps are totally arbitrary  They do not adjust the amount of the compensation ceiling with either the seriousness of the injury  or with the length of years that the victim must endure the resulting disability  Someone with a less serious injury can be fully compensated without reaching the cap However  a patient with severe  permanent injuries is prevented by the cap from receiving full compensation for their more serious injuries  Is it fair to apply the same limit on compensation to a person who is confined to a wheelchair for life that is applied to someone with a temporary leg injury Caps discriminate against younger victims  A young person with a severe injury such as paralysis must endure it for many more years than an older person with the same injury  Yet  that young person is prohibited from receiving greater compensation for the many more years he will be disabled  Is that fair Caps on non economic damages discriminate against women  children  minorities  and low income workers  These groups do not receive large economic damages attributable to lost earning capacity Women who are homemakers and caregivers for their families sustain no lost wages when they are injured  so they only receive minimal economic damages  Should a woman working in the home receive less compensation for the same injury than a woman working outside the home  Is that just A seriously injured child may be confined to his or her home for years of painful recuperation  but that child has no lost wages  Should he get less compensation than an adult with a similar injury  Is that fair Non economic damages    compensation for lost quality of life    is particularly important to these vulnerable populations ___________In addition to imposing caps  this legislation would place other major restrictions on seriously injured patients seeking to recover fair compensation  At every stage of the judicial process  it would change long established judicial rules to disadvantage patients and shield defendants from the consequences of their actions 1  It would abolish joint and several liability for all damages  This means the most seriously injured people may never receive all of the compensation that the court has awarded to them  They may not even receive full payment for their lost wages and medical bills  Under this provision  health care providers whose misconduct contributed to the patient s injuries will in many cases be able to escape responsibility for paying full compensation to that patient 2  The bias in the legislation could not be clearer  It would preempt state laws that allow fair treatment for injured patients  but would allow state laws to be enacted which contained greater restrictions on patients  rights than the proposed federal law  This one way preemption contained in Section 11  c  shows how result oriented the legislation really is  It is not about fairness or balance  It is about protecting defendants 3  The amendment preempts state statutes of limitation  cutting back the time allowed by many states for a patient to file suit against the health care provider who injured him  Under the legislation  the statute of limitations can expire before the injured patient even knows that it was malpractice which caused his or her injury 4  It places severe limitations on when an injured patient can receive punitive damages  and how much punitive damages the victim can recover  Under the bill  punitive damages can only be awarded if the defendant acted with malicious intent to injure or deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury  This is far more restrictive than current law  It entirely prohibits punitive damages for reckless and wanton misconduct  which the overwhelming majority of states allow  In the very small number of cases where punitive damages would still be allowed  the bill would cap them at twice the amount of economic damages  no matter how egregious the defendant s conduct and no matter how large its assets 5  It imposes unprecedented limits on the amount of the contingent fee which a client and his or her attorney can agree to    limiting it to 15  of most of the recoveries  This will make it more difficult for injured patients to retain the attorney of their choice in cases that involve complex legal issues  It can have the effect of denying them their day in court  Again the provision is one sided  because it places no limit on how much the health care provider can spend defending the case If we were to arbitrarily restrict the rights of seriously injured patients as the sponsors of this legislation propose  what benefits would result  Certainly less accountability for health care providers will never improve the quality of health care  It will not even result in less costly care  The cost of medical malpractice premiums constitutes less than two thirds of 1    0 66   of the nation s health care expenditures each year  For example  in 2004  health care costs totaled  1 88 trillion  while the total cost of all medical malpractice insurance premiums was  11 4 billion  Malpractice premiums are not the cause of the high rate of medical inflation  This bill will not make health care more affordable The White House and other supporters of caps have argued that restricting an injured patient s right to recover fair compensation will reduce malpractice premiums  But  there is scant evidence to support their claim  In fact  there is substantial evidence to refute it Between 2000 and 2003  there were dramatic increases in the cost of medical malpractice insurance in states that already had damage caps and other restrictive tort reforms on the statute books  as well as in states that did not  No substantial increase in the number or size of malpractice judgments suddenly occurred which would have justified the enormous increase in premiums that many doctors were being forced to pay  Now rates have stabilized  again both in states with and states without damage caps Comprehensive national studies show that medical malpractice premiums are not significantly lower on average in states that have enacted damage caps and other restrictions on patient rights than in states without these restrictions  Insurance companies are merely pocketing the dollars which patients no longer receive when tort reform is enacted Let s look at the facts  Slightly more than half of the states have a cap on medical malpractice damages  Many of them have had those statutes for a substantial number of years  The other half of states do not have a cap on malpractice damages  The best evidence of whether such caps affect the cost of malpractice insurance is to compare the rates in those two groups of states  Based on data from the Medical Liability Monitor on all fifty states  the average liability premium in 2005 for doctors practicing in states without caps on malpractice damages   45 719  was actually lower than the average premium for doctors practicing in states with caps   51 405   There are many reasons why insurance rates vary substantially from state to state  This data demonstrates that it is not a state s tort reform laws which determine the rates  Caps do not make a significant difference in the malpractice premiums which doctors pay  This is borne out by a comparison of premium levels for a range of medical specialties  The average liability premium in 2005 for doctors practicing internal medicine was more  18 7  more  for doctors in states with caps on malpractice damages   16 212  than in states without caps on damages   13 658   Internists actually pay more for malpractice insurance in states that have caps  The average liability premium in 2005 for general surgeons was more  19 4  more  for doctors in states with caps   57 662  than states without caps   48 267   Surgeons are paying more for malpractice insurance in the states that have caps  The average liability premium for OB GYN physicians in 2005 in states with caps   80 341  was also more than for doctors in states without caps   75 233   OB GYNs in states with caps paid slightly more  7  more  than in states without caps Clearly  a state s tort laws do not determine that state s medical malpractice insurance rates This evidence demonstrates that capping malpractice damages does not benefit the doctors it purports to help  It only helps the insurance companies earn even bigger profits  As Business Week Magazine concluded after reviewing the data at the height of the malpractice rate crisis the statistical case for caps is flimsy   March 3  2003 issue In 2003  Weiss Ratings  Inc   a nationally recognized financial analyst conducted an in depth examination of the impact of capping damages in medical malpractice cases    Their conclusions sharply contradict the assumptions on which this legislation is based  Weiss found that capping damages does reduce the amount of money that malpractice insurance companies payout to injured patients  However  those savings are not passed on to doctors in lower premiums The Weiss Report  stated Since the insurers in the states with caps reaped the benefit of lower medical malpractice payouts  one would expect that they would reduce the premiums they charged doctors  At the very minimum  they should have been able to slow down the premium increases  Surprisingly  the data show they did precisely the opposite Between 1991 and 2002  the Weiss analysis shows that premiums rose by substantially more in the states with damage caps than in the states without caps  The 12 year increase in the median annual premium was 48 2  in the states that had caps  and only 35 9  in the states that had no caps  In the words of the report  On average  doctors in states with caps actually suffered a significantly larger increase than doctors in states without caps    In short  the results clearly invalidate the expectations of cap proponents Since malpractice premiums are not significantly affected by the imposition of caps on recovery  it stands to reason that the availability of physicians does not differ between states that have caps and states that do not  AMA data shows that there are 283 physicians per 100 000 residents in states that do not have medical malpractice caps and 249 physicians per 100 000 residents in states with caps  Clearly there is no correlation If a federal cap on non economic compensatory damages were to pass  it would sacrifice fair compensation for injured patients in a vain attempt to reduce medical malpractice premiums  Doctors will not get the relief they are seeking  Only the insurance companies  which created the problem  will benefit Insurance industry practices were responsible for the sudden dramatic premium increases which occurred in some states between 2000 and 2003  The explanation for these premium spikes can be found not in legislative halls or in courtrooms  but in the boardrooms of the insurance companies themselves There were substantial increases in a number of insurance lines  not just medical malpractice  during that period  Insurers make much of their money from investment income  Interest earned on premium dollars is particularly important in medical malpractice insurance because there is a much longer period of time between receipt of the premium and payment of the claim than in most lines of casualty insurance  The industry creates a malpractice crisis whenever its investments do poorly  The combination of a sharp decline in the equity markets and record low interest rates several years ago was the reason for the sharp increase in medical malpractice insurance premiums during that period  What we witnessed then was not new  The industry has engaged in this pattern of behavior repeatedly over the last thirty years  When tort reform laws are enacted  the insurance companies pocket the resulting savings to bolster their profits Data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shows that in 2005  the profits for the five largest for profit medical malpractice insurers were more than double those of the Fortune 500 average   17 7  v 8 7  Doctors  especially those in high risk specialties  whose malpractice premiums have increased dramatically do deserve premium relief  That relief will only come as the result of tougher regulation of the insurance industry  When insurance companies lose money on their investments  they should not be able to recover those losses from the doctors they insure  Unfortunately  that is what is happening now Doctors and patients are both victims of the insurance industry  Excess profits from the boom years should be used to keep premiums stable when investment earnings drop  However  the insurance industry will never do that voluntarily  Only by recognizing the real problem can we begin to structure an effective solution that will bring an end to unreasonably high medical malpractice premiums There are specific changes in the law which should be made to address the abusive manner in which medical malpractice insurers operate  The first and most important would be to subject the insurance industry to the nation s anti trust laws  It is the only major industry in America where corporations are free to conspire to fix prices  withhold and restrict coverage  and engage in a myriad of other anti competitive actions  A medical malpractice crisis does not just happen  It is the result of insurance industry schemes to raise premiums and to increase profits by forcing anti patient changes in the tort law  I have introduced  with Senator Leahy  legislation which will at long last require the insurance industry to abide by the same rules of fair competition as other businesses Unlike the harsh and ineffective proposals in S  22  this is a real solution which will help physicians without further harming seriously injured patients  Unfortunately  the Republican leadership continues to protect their allies in the insurance industry and refuses to consider real solutions to the malpractice premium crisis I want to conclude with a quotation from the analysis of medical malpractice premiums by Weiss Ratings  Inc  Weiss Ratings is not speaking from the perspective of a trial lawyer or a patient advocate  but as a hard nosed financial analyst that has studied the facts of malpractice insurance rating  Here is their recommendation to us based on those facts First  legislators must immediately put on hold all proposals involving non economic damage caps until convincing evidence can be produced to demonstrate a true benefit to doctors in the form of reduced med mal costs  Right now  consumers are being asked to sacrifice not only large damage claims  but also critical leverage to help regulate the medical profession   all with the stated goal that it will end the med mal crisis for doctors  However  the data indicate that  similar state legislation has merely produced the worst of both worlds  The sacrifice by consumers plus a continuing   and even worsening   crisis for doctors  Neither party derived any benefit whatsoever from the caps Before yielding the floor  I want to briefly address the second malpractice bill  S  23  that the Republican leadership has brought before the Senate  The only difference between them is that the first bill would take basic rights away from all patients  while the second bill takes those rights away only from women and newborn babies who are the victims of negligent obstetric and gynecological care  That difference does not make the latter bill more acceptable  On the contrary  it adds a new element of unfairness The proponents argue that they are somehow doing these women and their babies a favor by depriving them of the right to fair compensation when they are seriously injured  It is an Alice in Wonderland argument which they are making  Under their proposal  a woman whose gynecologist negligently failed to diagnose her cervical cancer until it had spread and become incurable would be denied the same legal right as a man whose doctor negligently failed to diagnose his prostate cancer until it was too late  Is that fair  By what convoluted logic would that woman be better off  Both the woman and the man were condemned to suffer a painful and premature death as a result of their doctors  malpractice  but her compensation would be severely limited while his is not  She would be denied the right to introduce the same evidence of medical negligence which he could  She would be denied the same freedom to select the lawyer of her choice which he had  She would be denied the right to have her case tried under the same judicial rules which he could  That hardly sounds like equal protection of the law to me  Yet  that is what the advocates of this legislation are proposing Of course  this bill does not only take rights away from women  It takes them away from newborn babies who sustain devastating prenatal injuries as well  These children face a lifetime with severe mental and physical impairments all because of an obstetrician s malpractice  or misconduct by a health care provider or insurer  This legislation would limit the compensation those children can receive for lost quality of life to  250 000 in nearly all cases    just  250 000 for an entire lifetime  What could be more unjust There are babies who suffered serious brain injuries at birth and will never be able to lead normal lives  There are women who lost organs  reproductive capacity  and in some cases even years of life  These are life altering conditions  It would be terribly wrong to take their rights away  The Republicans talk about deterring frivolous cases  but caps by their nature apply only to the most serious cases which have been proven in court  These badly injured patients are the last ones we should be depriving of fair compensation The entire premise of this bill is both false and offensive  Our Republican colleagues claim that women and their babies must sacrifice their fundamental legal rights in order to preserve access to Ob Gyn care  that they must leave their rights at the door  The very idea is outrageous  For those locales   mostly in sparsely populated areas    where the availability of Ob Gyn specialists is a problem  there are far less drastic ways to solve it This bill is based on the false premise that the availability of Ob Gyn physicians depends on the enactment of draconian tort reforms  If that were accurate  states that have already enacted damage caps would have a higher number of Ob Gyns providing care  However  there is in fact no correlation  States without caps actually have 29 1 Ob Gyns per 100 000 women  while states with caps have 25 5 Ob Gyns per 100 000 women  States without caps actually have more Ob Gyns serving their female population This is not a more acceptable bill because it applies only to women and newborn babies injured by obstetrical and gynecological malpractice  That makes it even more arbitrary  even more outrageous  Not one victim should be denied the basic rights that this bill would take away I urge my colleagues to oppose both of these very unfair bills   Laura Capps
