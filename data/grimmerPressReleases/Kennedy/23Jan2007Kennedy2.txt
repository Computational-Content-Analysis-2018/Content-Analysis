         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FACT SHEETS INCLUDED  Washington  DC  Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement in response to President Bushs State of the Union Address Last year  the American people made it clear that they wanted change  and leaders who can work together to put the interest of the country ahead their own  With this new 110th Congress we are more determined than ever to change the course of this country for all Americans  And I have to say  two of the best words I heard tonight were Madam Speaker IraqIraq is the overarching issue of our time  yet tonight we heard very little from the President about it when in fact the burden of responsibility is on him to explain the mission behind his escalation of troops in Iraq  The burden is on him to explain his strategy for success after so many colossal mistakes by this Administration  The burden was on him to prove why de escalation    the one strategy we have not tried     is not the answer  Sadly  he failed to do that  The Iraq war the President spoke of is a very different war than what Americans know to be the reality in Iraq today  Now its a civil war  and Were caught in the middle of it  Theres absolutely no doubt that the war today is not the war that Congress and the American people signed up for four years ago Tonight the President made clearer than ever that he is unilaterally imposing a failing policy on a country that has already rejected it  Congress now has a constitutional duty to stop the President from sending more of our sons and daughters into this civil war  My plan would require him to get the authority he needs before moving forward on an escalation of American forces  Could the message from Congress and the American people be any louder or clearer that an escalation would be an immense mistake  compounding the original misguided decision to invade Iraq Health careI welcome the President s call to make health care a priority for Congress  But to solve the health care crisis  we need not just action   but the right action  The President s proposals are an opportunity missed  They will not improve access to good coverage  and won t help working families afford the spiraling cost of health care  They will do little to improve the quality of health care  Republicans and Democrats alike should come together to build on the lessons from the states to see that all Americans have quality  affordable health care Immigration I welcome the Presidents renewed commitment to comprehensively reform our nations broken immigration system  The President has been a leader on this issue and I am hopeful that he will continue his efforts with members of his party so that we can pass legislation that that will solve the problem once and for all  With the 110th Congress and the House of Representatives as genuine partners  we have an opportunity to pass a tough but fair immigration plan that secures our borders  upholds our values  strengthens our laws  and ensures our prosperity EducationWe need new and creative ideas for helping our schools to improve and our students to succeed  Instead  the President has proposed more of the same  Once again  he proposes siphoning crucial resources from our public schools  already reeling from increased requirements and budget cuts    for a private school voucher program  The No Child Left Behind Act made a commitment to improving public schools  This reauthorization should build on that bipartisan goal and not allow partisan initiatives to get in the way  Im glad the President will recognize the need to preserve the laws focus on closing the achievement gap and the importance of ensuring that all students can graduate ready to succeed in our global economy  But experience has shown that these results are not possible without new investments  Weve urged the President to send a message in this years budget that every child counts and deserves the benefits of our liberty  No child means no child  and we must be willing to make the tough choices and the hard sacrifices to invest in and improve education in America  its the key to future opportunity and success for every one of our children  HEALTH CARE FACT SHEETThe Health Care CrisisHealth care in America is in crisis  Over the last six years  the cost of health insurance premiums has soared 87 percent  while wages have grown only 20 percent  Over the same period  the number of Americans without health insurance has increased by over 6 million  and millions more worry that their existing coverage is inadequate to meet their medical needs Bold action is needed to address the crisis  and states have begun to answer that call  Massachusetts  California  Pennsylvania  and other states have all proposed major health reforms designed to make coverage more affordable and more accessible  Serious reform is needed at the national level to see that every American has quality  affordable health care  just as the President and members of Congress receive now  Presidential leadership is important  but we must make sure that the reforms we undertake are the right course The Presidents ProposalHealth benefits are not currently taxed  President Bushs proposal would tax health benefits for the very first time  At the same time  the President proposes creating a new tax deduction for health benefits  This would be set at  15 000 a year for a family policy  and  7 500 for an individual  This policy would immediately impose a new tax on nearly 7 5 million Americans who now have good employer sponsored coverage  It penalizes workers with good health care  many of whom are middle or lower income    and creates a disincentive for employers to provide comprehensive coverage  particularly those whose employees are older or sicker  The tax deduction that the President has proposed would disproportionally benefit upper income Americans  since its value increases for those in higher tax brackets  It taxes middle class Americans to benefit the wealthiest The Presidents proposal also does nothing to improve access to health coverage for those who cannot obtain it now  either because their employer does not offer it or because they cannot obtain policies on the individual market due to a history of illness  Placing the entire burden of health care on individuals and working families is no solution to the crisis  Real reform involves a shared responsibility among individuals  government and business The Bottom Line  Presidential leadership on health care is crucial to addressing the major problems the American people face in affording quality health care  While the Administrations current proposal is deeply flawed  the attention that the President is devoting to the issue could signal real progress in addressing the health care crisis IMMIGRATION FACT SHEETThe Broken Immigration System  We all agree that Americas immigration system is broken  Millions of families wait for years to be reunited with their loved ones  Undocumented workers risk  tragically too often lose  their lives trying to cross the border in order to provide the labor our economy needs  Our economy suffers when employers are not able to find needed workers  Comprehensive immigration reform has earned the support of Democrats and Republicans  religious leaders  labor and business groups  and millions of Americans from across the political spectrum  The status quo is unacceptable  and legislation is urgently needed to deal with all the inadequacies in our current law  to end the suffering of long separated families imposed by the broken system  and to do so in a way that reflects current realities  We must modernize our broken immigration system to meet the challenges of the 21st century  We need policies that continue to reflect our best values as a nation  fairness  equal opportunity  and respect for the rule of law The Presidents Proposal  The President has laid out a vision of comprehensive immigration reform that includes genuine enforcement of immigration laws  creation of an employment program that would meet the needs of our economy  establishment of a path to citizenship for the millions of immigrants who have roots in our country  and integration of immigrants into American life through civic education and English language training We can agree with the principles the President has put forth and we look forward to working with the Administration and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact a comprehensive bill  Bottom LineOn Election Day  Americans sent a loud and clear message that they want a new direction for this country  including comprehensive immigration reform  With the 110th Congress and the Presidents commitment to reform  we have an opportunity to pass a tough but fair plan that secures our borders  upholds our values  strengthens our laws  and ensures our prosperity  We are more determined than ever to get the job done EDUCATION FACT SHEETNo Child Left BehindThe No Child Left Behind Act has laid the groundwork for major improvements in schools across the country  But we have learned a great deal over the last five years about how the law is working  from parents  students and educators  Congress must consider new ideas that will help strengthen the law and help schools move forward to confront the challenges of closing the achievement gap  Congress must think creatively about improving teacher quality  empowering parents  and ensuring that students are learning to globally competitive standards  while ensuring that schools get the interventions they need to improve  not just a label  when they have missed their academic goals  Our nations middle and high schools need greater attention  to promote innovation and provide students with extra help to keep up with rigorous curriculum  The Presidents NCLB AgendaCongress is ready to address new and creative ideas for helping No Child Left Behind work in our schools  Instead  the President has proposed more of the same  Once again  he proposes siphoning crucial resources from our public schools  already reeling from increased requirements and budget cuts    for a private school voucher program  The No Child Left Behind Act made a commitment to improving public schools  This reauthorization should build on that bipartisan goal and not allow partisan initiatives to get in the way  I appreciate the Presidents desire to preserve the laws focus on closing the achievement gap and ensuring that all students have good teachers  and I look forward to working with the President on these objectives  But experience has shown that these good results are not possible without new investments  Half of all public school districts are facing federal budget cuts  The Presidents Budget should demonstrate that leaving no child left behind is moral commitment  not a political slogan  The Bottom LineMuch work needs to be done on No Child Left Behind  and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the 110th Congress to improve and strengthen the law  NCLB has been severely underfunded  but with a new and long overdue financial commitment  and a close look at whats working and not working  we can help our schools close the achievement gap  recruit and keep the best teachers  and implement effective accountability systems  We need new and creative ideas for helping our schools to improve and our students to succeed  Instead  the President has proposed more of the same  Once again  he proposes siphoning crucial resources from our public schools  already reeling from increased requirements and budget cuts    for a private school voucher program  The No Child Left Behind Act made a commitment to improving public schools
