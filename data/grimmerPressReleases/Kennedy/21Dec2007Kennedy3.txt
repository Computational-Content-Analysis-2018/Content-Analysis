         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward Kennedy and John Kerry  along with Senate colleagues  sent the letter below to President Bush  urging him to immediately release the Low Income Housing and Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  funding included in the Appropriations bill   2 6 billion dollars in funding has been allocated to this program      With heating fuels costing 10 to 22 percent more than last winter  the funding for this program is needed as soon as possible to reduce the energy burden on families  individuals with disabilities      The soaring cost of home heating is already imposing an unfair burden on hundreds of thousands of families in Massachusetts and across the country  and winter doesnt even officially begin until late tonight  said Senator Kennedy  Theres no justification for the Bush Administration to hold back these emergency funds  They should be released immediately  Its wrong for the Administration to play Scrooge with the families who desperately need this assistance now     President Bush needs to make these emergency funds available  Thousands of Massachusetts families cannot afford to heat their homes  This is unacceptable any time  but especially on the first day of winter  just days before Christmas  as we dig out from New Englands third significant snowstorm  said Senator Kerry  Instead of being the Grinch who stole LIHEAP  we need the Bush Administration to immediately provide help and hope for millions this holiday season       The letter appears below      December 21  2007        The President  The White House  Washington   D C  20500    Dear Mr  President      The Consolidated Appropriations bill for FY2008 included  2 57 billion in funding for the Low Income Housing and Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   including  586 million in contingency funds to be released at your discretion  We are writing to urge you to release the LIHEAP funds immediately  The high energy prices facing consumers and the severe weather of the past few weeks warrant this release      This winter  the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimates that households can expect to pay between 10 to 22 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2006 2007 winter  and many of these families are carrying energy debt from previous years  As such  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden on families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens to ensure their health and safety through the cold winter months      Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population  During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305  Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise  Home heating prices are projected by the EIA to reach almost  1 000 this year for the typical family  an increase of almost 80 percent higher than the average cost of home heating during the winter of 2001 02  As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the programs purchasing power  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding  The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million      LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Childrens Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical  Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children  In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills  For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances       We request that your Administration release the  586 million in FY2008 LIHEAP contingency funds that were recently approved by Congress to help low income seniors and families with their home energy expenses during a winter that has already seen a significant share of severe winter weather and cold conditions and promises only to get colder      Sincerely           _____________________________ _____________________________  Jack Reed Susan M
