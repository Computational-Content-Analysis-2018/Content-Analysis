         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today at a press conference with Senators Reed  Durbin  Corzine  Dodd  Lautenberg  and Feinstein  Senator Edward M  Kennedy spoke out on the shameful bill that would allow gun manufacturers to strip away law enforcement and gun violence victims of their right to go to court  Rather than debating the Department of Defense Authorization bill that would send support to our troops overseas and here at home  the Senate instead debated whether gun manufacturers should receive legal immunity  and therefore not be held accountable  for deaths they cause through incompetence  negligence or illegal activity     Senator Kennedy has offered an amendment that closes the existing loopholes in the federal law that bans cop killer bullets  Current law contains no restrictions on assault weapons and rifle ammunition that is designed or marketed to be armor piercing  Kennedy s amendment would not apply to ammunition that is now routinely used in hunting rifles or other centerfile rifles     About his amendment  Senator Kennedy said  It is outrageous and unconscionable that cop killer bullets continue to be sold in the United States at all  Yet under current law  purchasing cop killer bullets is no more difficult than buying a lottery ticket or a pack of cigarettes  Bullets that are designed or marketed to be armor piercing have no place in our society     Following are his remarks as prepared for delivery for the press conference    Statement by Senator Kennedy Gun Liability Bill July 29  2005  as prepared for delivery  This dangerous special interest legislation will protect gun manufacturers and sellers who provide guns to criminals or even terrorists  With this bill  Congress is aiding and abetting in the perpetuation of these crimes    This bill has one motivation  payback by the Bush Administration and the Republican leadership of the Congress to the powerful special interest of the National Rifle Association  In the caves of Afghanistan  our troops found an Al Qaeda manual that instructed terrorists on how to buy guns legally in the United States  without having to undergo a background check  Al Qaeda understands that we have created a mess that allows    even encourages    criminals and terrorists to traffic in guns  But we won t do anything about that    the so called gun show loophole    because the NRA has snapped its fingers and said NO  This Administration continually says that we are engaged in a war on terror  but it takes the position that the war on terror doesn t allow us to prevent terrorists from buying guns in this country  Because of the actions of this Administration and this Congress in caving to the NRA  terrorists can now add assault weapons to their arsenal  All to appease the NRA so they ll give campaign contributions and get out the vote  This is not only a disgrace    it s criminal  and it has to stop    Let s be clear about what this bill does not do  It does not help our law enforcement officials fight crime or terrorism  It does not meet the urgent need to strengthen any of our gun control laws     The manufacturers of guns    unlike the manufacturers of nearly every other consumer product in the country    are not subject to consumer product safety standards  As it stands  manufacturers and sellers in the industry are free to design  make and market these products with no independent review of their potential risks  The gun industry is the only industry whose products are not subject to basic consumer health and safety regulation     Why stop with the gun industry  Why not make tire manufacturers immune from lawsuit  Or car manufacturers  Or bicycle manufacturers  Or toy manufacturers  Obviously  it would be absurd to shield any negligent manufacturers from liability for their actions  But when it comes to shielding the gun industry  the NRA is calling the tune  And too many members of this body are tragically dancing to it     It is clear what will happen if Congress gives the gun industry this unprecedented legal immunity  on top of its existing exemption from federal consumer safety regulations  Guns will be more dangerous  Gun dealers will be more irresponsible  More guns will be available to terrorists and criminals  There will be more shootings  and more dead children   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
