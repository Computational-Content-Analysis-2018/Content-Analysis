         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC  Rep  George Miller  D CA  and Sen  Edward Kennedy  D MA  today introduced legislation to build and elevate the teaching profession to make sure that every classroom is headed by an excellent teacher  The lawmakers said that the Teacher Excellence for All Children  TEACH  Act provides a blueprint for improving teacher quality under No Child Left Behind law Teacher quality is the single most important factor in determining a childs success in school  Closing the teacher quality gap is key to closing the academic achievement gap  said Miller  chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee  We owe it to teachers and their students to provide more than rhetoric about our commitment to encouraging talented people to enter the field and stay there  We must dedicate the necessary resources and demand the necessary results to make sure that every classroom in America has a high quality teacher A good education begins with a good teacher  said Kennedy  chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pension Committee  One of the most significant steps we can take to improve the nations schools is to do more to support the recruitment  training  and retention of high quality teachers  Day in and day out  in thousands of schools across the country  teachers struggle to give our children the knowledge and skills they need to succeed  Our teachers are at the forefront of the constant effort to improve public education  It is their vision  energy  hard work  and dedication that will make all the difference in successfully meeting this challenge  States are experiencing a severe shortage of highly qualified teachers  and an unprecedented percentage of the current teacher workforce will retire in the next five years  The teacher shortage is especially acute in high poverty schools and in the subject areas of math and science  Americas most at risk students are too often taught by the least prepared  least experienced  and least qualified teachers  Students in schools with high poverty levels are twice as likely as their peers to be taught by teachers with less than three years of experience The TEACH Act of 2007 would help increase the supply of excellent teachers  ensure that children are taught by teachers with expertise in their subject area  build a teaching career ladder  identify and reward the best teachers  and retain the best teachers and principals The TEACH Act  Provides financial incentives to encourage excellent teachers and principals to enter the profession and to elevate the standing of the profession   Creates a  200 million grant program for institutions of higher education to recruit teachers from among students majoring in math  science  foreign languages  special education and English language learners   Forgives some teachers educational loans of up to  20 000  and  Creates TEACH Grants that would provide up front pre paid tuition assistance of  4 000 per year for high achieving graduate and undergraduate students who commit to teaching a high need subject in a high need school for four years  For more details of the TEACH Act  please click here

President  of all the challenges we face today  one of the most important is creating greater opportunities for the nations children to learn and succeed in life  If America is to remain competitive in the global economy  if all Americans are to have access to the American dream  we must ensure that all our children receive a good education A good education begins with a good teacher  One of the most significant steps we can take to improve the nations schools is to do more to support the recruitment  training  and retention of high quality teachers  We owe a great debt to Americas teachers  Day in and day out  in thousands of schools across the country  they struggle to give our children the knowledge and skills they need to succeed  Our teachers are at the forefront of the constant effort to improve public education  It is their vision  energy  hard work  and dedication that will make all the difference in successfully meeting this challenge As Shirley Hufstedler  the nations first Secretary of Education  said The role of the teacher remains the highest calling of a free people  To the teacher  America entrusts her most precious resource  her children  and asks that they be prepared  in all their glorious diversity  to face the rigors of individual participation in a democratic society All children need and deserve teachers who can help them succeed  We in Congress must do all in our power to help them do so  We took a major step toward this goal when Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act  which recognized that all students deserve first rate teachers to help them reach their potential in school  The law established a goal to guarantee a highly qualified teacher in every classroom by the end of 2007  Few states have reached that ambitious target  and much more remains to be done to achieve success  Extensive research shows that teacher quality is the most important educational factor affecting student achievement  One recent study showed that having a highly qualified teacher can improve student academic growth by as much as one full year  Another showed that students taught by highly qualified teachers for three consecutive years significantly outperformed their peers on academic assessments  A comparison of low performing and high performing elementary schools with similar student populations found that differences in teacher qualifications accounted for 90 percent of the difference in performance in reading and math  Theres strong evidence that a good teacher can make all the difference in closing achievement gaps for the neediest students in our public schools Investing in teacher quality is cost effective and fiscally responsible  A recent study involving 1 000 school districts found that each additional dollar invested in more highly qualified teachers resulted in greater improvements in student achievement than any other use of school resources  Unfortunately  research also shows that high quality teachers are the most inequitably distributed educational resource in the nation  The most at risk students are too often taught by the least prepared  least experienced  and least qualified teachers  Students in high poverty schools are twice as likely to be taught by teachers with less than three years of experience  Such teachers are less likely to receive the resources and support they need to succeed  Often they leave the profession and further destabilize already struggling schools  By contrast  children of the affluent and the privileged are much more likely to be taught by highly prepared and qualified  expert teachers with broad knowledge and experience in the subjects they teach To enable more teachers to receive the assistance they need to improve their instruction  ensure that every child receives a high quality education  and level the playing field for Americas students  Congress must act on a comprehensive plan to build and sustain a strong teacher workforce That is why today I am introducing the Teacher Excellence for All Children Act of 2007  the TEACH Act  Its purpose is to assist the states in better recruiting  training  retaining and supporting our teachers  Our distinguished colleague in the House  Congressman George Miller  is introducing companion legislation  and I commend him for his leadership on this issue The TEACH Act addresses four specific challenges head on   It increases the supply of outstanding teachers  It ensures all children have teachers with expertise in the subjects they teach   It improves teaching by identifying and rewarding the best teaching practices and by expanding professional development opportunities  and  It helps schools retain teachers and principals by providing the support they need to succeed Enrollment in public schools has reached an all time high of 53 million students  and is expected to keep increasing over the next decade  To educate this expanding population  additional high quality teachers are urgently needed Many schools today face a crisis in recruiting and retaining highly skilled teachers  particularly in the nations poorest communities  We now have approximately three million public school teachers across the country  Two million new teachers will be needed in the next ten years to serve the growing student population  Yet we are not even retaining the teachers we have today  A third of all teachers leave during their first three years  Almost half leave during the first five years  Over 200 000 teachers leave the profession each year  6  of the teaching workforce The shortage of highly qualified teachers is especially acute in the fields most essential to Americas future competitiveness  In 2002  20  of math teachers and between 17  and 28   depending on the field  of science teachers lacked certification in their fields  Students in high minority and high poverty schools are at an even greater disadvantage  Almost half of math classes in high poverty and high minority high schools are taught by teachers who dont have a college major or minor degree in math or a related field  such as math education  physics or engineering  The plight is even worse in middle school  70  of math classes in high poverty and high minority middle schools are taught by a teacher who doesnt even have a minor in math or a related field  Meanwhile  students in other nations are surpassing American students in math and science achievement Too often  teachers also lack the training and support needed to do well in the classroom  They are paid on average almost  8 000 a year less than graduates in other fields  and the gap widens to more than  23 000 after 15 years of teaching  Thirty seven percent of teachers cite low salaries as a main factor for leaving the classroom before retirement  The TEACH Act will do more to recruit and retain highly qualified teachers  particularly in schools and subjects where they are needed most  The bill provides financial incentives to encourage talented individuals to pursue and remain in this essential profession  and it offers higher salaries  tax breaks  and greater loan forgiveness   To attract motivated and talented individuals to teaching  the bill provides up front tuition assistance   4 000 a year  to high performing undergraduate students who agree to commit to teach for four years in high need areas and in subjects such as math  science  and special education  It also creates a competitive grant program for colleges and universities to recruit teachers among students majoring in math  science  or foreign language The TEACH Act will also help deliver access to the best teachers for the neediest students to help them succeed  In high poverty schools  teacher turnover is 33  higher than in other schools  In the poorest middle schools and high schools  students are 77  more likely to be assigned an out of field teacher  Almost a third of classes are taught by teachers with no background in the subject  no major degree  no minor degree  and no certification  Despite our past efforts  this problem is worsening  In most academic subjects  the percentage of secondary school teachers out of field  those teaching a class in which they dont have a major  a minor  or a certification  increased from 1993 to 2000  Clearly  we must do a better job of attracting better teachers to the neediest classrooms and do more to reward their efforts  so that they stay in the classroom To encourage expert teachers to teach where they are needed most  the bill provides funding to school districts to reward teachers who transfer to schools with the greatest challenges  and provides incentives for teachers working in math  science  and special education The bill establishes a framework to develop and use the systems needed at the state and local levels to identify and improve teacher effectiveness and to recognize exceptional teaching in the classroom  It encourages the development of data systems to track student progress and relate it to the level of instruction provided in the classroom  It also encourages the development of model teacher advancement programs that recognize and reward different roles  responsibilities  knowledge  and positive results with competitive compensation initiatives  Too often  teachers lack the training they need before reaching the classroom  On the job  they have few sources of support to meet the challenges they face in the classroom  and few opportunities for ongoing professional development to expand their skills  The bill responds to the needs of teachers in their early years in the classroom by creating new and innovative models that use proven strategies to support beginning teachers  New teachers will have access to mentoring  opportunities for cooperative planning with their peers  and a special transition year to ease into the pressures of entering the classroom  Veteran teachers will have an opportunity to improve their skills through peer mentoring and review  Other support includes professional development delivered through teaching centers to improve training and working conditions for teachers  Since good leadership is also essential for schools  the bill provides important incentives and support for principals by raising standards and improving recruitment and training for them as well This legislation was developed with the help of a broad and diverse group of educational professionals and experts  including the Alliance for Excellent Education  the American Federation of Teachers  the Business Roundtable  the Center for American Progress Action Fund  the Childrens Defense Fund  the Education Trust  the National Council on Teacher Quality  the National Council of La Raza  the National Education Association  New Leaders for New Schools  the New Teacher Center  Operation Public Education  the Teacher Advancement Program Foundation  Teach for America and the Teaching Commission  I thank them all for their help and their work on behalf of our nations children Mr  President  the TEACH Act is good for Americas children  its good for Americas economy  and its good for Americas future  It is an essential part of our ongoing effort to ensure that No Child Left Behind becomes a reality and not just a slogan       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner
