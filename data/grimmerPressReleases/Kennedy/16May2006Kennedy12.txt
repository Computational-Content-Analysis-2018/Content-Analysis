         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the defeat of Senator Isakson s immigration amendment I applaud my colleagues for standing up for comprehensive reform by defeating the amendment offered by Senator Isakson that would have derailed our bipartisan legislation altogether  The measure demonstrated a basic misunderstanding about immigration control and the nature of our current crisis  We confront a crisis of undocumented immigration because we have failed to provide legal channels for immigrants entering the United States  and a burgeoning culture of illegality has emerged as a result  We cannot gain control of our borders until we address these core problems Our legislation includes massive new resources to strengthen the borders  doubling the number of border patrol agents to 12 000 and putting new technology at the border to create virtual fence and a comprehensive surveillance plan  Our plan is the toughest and most effective because not only does it include strong enforcement provisions  but will truly strengthen our national security by including a pathway to citizenship for those already working here  and a realistic visa program for the future Enforcement first may be an attractive campaign slogan  but it is bad policy and I commend my colleagues for rejecting this short sighted approach   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
