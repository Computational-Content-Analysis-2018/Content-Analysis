Tim Fitzpatrick  CEO of SLM Corporation  and Michael S  Dunlap  Chairman and CEO of Nelnet  Inc  Chairman Kennedy raises concerns about the collections process and the possible use of tactics that are prohibited by federal law and regulations   The letters appear below  April 26  2007Tim FitzpatrickChief Executive OfficerSLM Corporation12061 Bluemont WayReston  VA 20190Dear Mr  Fitzpatrick I am writing about information that has come to my attention which raises concerns about private lenders treatment of borrowers in the Federal Family Education Loan Program   Specifically  I am concerned that several private lenders may be engaging in harsh and inappropriate tactics with regard to borrowers whose payments are overdue and or whose loans are in the collections process  tactics that are prohibited by federal law and regulations   My office has obtained information indicating that the company may have engaged in the following practices     Telling a borrowers spouse that the borrower would go to jail if he didnt pay  a blatantly false assertion     Putting a borrower into default who lost his home in a natural disaster  adding substantial default and collection fees to his loan balance  taking tax refunds  and garnishing his wages  all in violation of guidance from the Secretary of Education     Harassing a widower about illegitimate  forged loans under the name of his deceased spouse     Refusing to negotiate with borrowers about deferment     Regularly calling borrowers at their job after being instructed to stop     Harassing borrowers neighbors  family and co workers     Using abusive and profane language to intimidate borrowers     Attempting to collect debts not owed     Attempting to collect from deceased borrowers families and relatives     Attempting to collect from elderly  disabled borrowers     Firing employees who attempt to help borrowers obtain correct information about their loan status     Instructing employees to give borrowers the run around rather than provide them with correct information on their loan status  and    Intentionally sending loan payment notices to an incorrect address in order to force a borrowers account into default In light of these events  I ask that you provide to my office information and documents concerning your companys collections practices concerning federally guaranteed student loans   Please see the attached Document Request for specifics   I ask that you coordinate the production of documents with Nicholas W  Bath  Counsel to the Committee  at  202  224 6912 Thank you for your
