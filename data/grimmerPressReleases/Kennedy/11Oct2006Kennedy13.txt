         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  BOSTON  MA  Senator Edward M  Kennedy today addressed the Boston Harbor Island Alliance at their annual breakfast and speak on the importance of cultural tourism and preserving the heritage of the Commonwealth for future generations  Senator Kennedy has been a lifelong advocate of preserving and protecting our national historic treasures  including the Boston Harbor Islands  The Islands Recreation Area is one of the Commonwealths crown jewels and a destination for visitors across the nation and around the world  Senator Kennedy said  Sadly our national parks have been suffering for several years from chronic funding shortfalls of as much as  600 million a year  Its time to change direction and begin respecting our parks again  by providing the funds they need to meet the maintenance backlog and ensure that visitors have a safe and enjoyable experience  We owe it to future generations to be better stewards of these landmarks  Our parks provide more than just a sense of local pride  Theyre investments in local economies wherever they exist  As far back as 1972  Senator Kennedy introduced a bill to determine the feasibility of establishing the Boston Harbor National Recreation Area  In the 1990s  Senator Kennedy worked with Congressman Joe Moakley and the delegation to create the park and secured federal funds to assist with the opening and improvement of facilities on the Boston Harbor Islands  The Boston Harbor Island Alliance is dedicated to ensuring that people enjoy and utilize the resources of the Boston Harbor Islands National Park Area  Remarks of Senator Edward M  Kennedy Boston Harbor Island Alliance Moakley Courthouse  As Prepared for Delivery   Over the last decade  the Alliance has far exceeded our hopes and expectations as the Harbors defender and advocate Thanks to you  the Islands Recreation Area is one of the Commonwealths crown jewels and a destination for visitors across the nation and around the world  and next month well be celebrating its 10th anniversary   It was a proud day when President Clinton signed the law that created it in 1996  It was the culmination of the impressive work of so many of you here today  who did so much to make it happen  You refused to tolerate the pollution that marred its great beauty  I was proud to work with you then for its enactment  and all of us in Boston are extremely grateful for the work youve done to restore its prestige  In so many ways  you embody the best in public private partnerships   As you know  the Harbor has always been a special place for my family  I remember when I was a boy  my grandfather would take me down to the waterfront and say that on a clear day you could see all the way to Ireland   When the Recreation Area was established  we began a new experiment to see if the federal government could work with local organizations to bring state and local groups together to plan a stronger future for the Harbor and Islands It was a novel and relatively untried approach  and many felt it would be difficult to bring so many interests together  But its been a remarkable success  and its a tribute to the patience and perseverance of the talented women and men who make up the Alliance  Few things are more challenging than creating a broad consensus  but the rewards are impressive when all that hard work pays off   That perseverance reminds me of John Winthrop and his commitment to beginning something new and challenging and wonderful here nearly 400 years ago  He wrote that if America was to become the city on a hill he wanted it to be  we must be knit together  We must entertain each other in brotherly affection  We must be willing to give up our superfluities to supply others necessitiesWe must delight in each other  make others conditions our own  rejoice together  mourn together  labor and suffer together  always having before our eyes our commission and community in the work  as members of the same body  That is the spirit that has helped make this unique partnership such a remarkable success  As we approach this tenth anniversary  we look back with pride on the progress weve made  and we recommit ourselves to the Alliances mission   Year after year before 1996  the Harbor was suffering from constant pollution  It was clear that major investments were needed to restore the Harbor  and many were understandably worried about seeing their sewer bills go through the roof  No one did a better job of making the call for change than Joe Moakley  He never flinched in the face of the challenge of cleaning the Harbor  He used his seniority in Congress to make the Harbor clean up a federal budget priority too  I was proud to work with him and our entire state delegation in the effort  and we were blessed to have a President in office  Bill Clinton  who truly understood the importance of this project The result was the inclusion of hundreds of millions in the federal budget in the 1990s to clean up the Harbor and pay for wastewater improvements   One of my biggest disappointments since the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994 has been the cuts theyve made in grants for clean water programs that cities like Boston rely upon  Sadly  theyve been relentless in their attacks on the Clean Water Act and federal support for communities to clean up their waterways  Instead  theyve shifted more and more of the burden on to local communities  which are far less capable of paying for these expensive improvements and the technical know how to get the job done   This Administration has even chosen to cut funding from the federal low interest loan programs that cities and towns rely on to make wastewater and drinking water improvements These are short sighted cuts that put the environment  public health and local economies at risk  Even the EPA has warned of an impending 270 billion dollar funding gap for wastewater improvement projects over the next 15 years   Without a renewed commitment to helping communities that have old and outmoded sewer systems  we risk reversing the extraordinary gains of past years for public health and the environment  Its obvious to each and every one of us that the grants weve received so far have made a tremendous impact on the Harbors water quality  Im sure if Joe were here today  hed be as proud as we are of whats been accomplished  Today  the Harbor has a healthier environment and a vibrant waterfront  and were moving forward to improve navigation in the inner Harbor as well   A decade ago  Joe and I worked together to include nearly  40 million in the budget to deepen and widen the channels in the Port of Boston to keep it safe for vessel traffic and make it competitive internationally Since then  two million cubic yards of material has been dredged to improve navigation for the hundreds of vessels that use the Harbor every year  I know that the Army Corps of Engineers is moving forward in other areas of the Harbor to make it safe for these vessels   Of course  theres much more to the Recreation Area than cleaning up the Harbor  and Ive been very proud to work with the Alliance to improve public access to the islands  Im particularly proud that the Greenway named for my mother will provide a permanent connection between Bostons historic downtown and our latest treasure   the nations most accessible waterfront  This gateway to our beautiful Harbor and Islands will be a visible statement of our commitment to the waterfront and its ties with the citys past and future   My mother grew up in the North End  and she often accompanied her father  Mayor Honey Fitz  on tours of the city  They went to countless places where families gathered     the markets  schools  churches and parks  I know she d be grateful for the Greenway named in her honor  with its special parks so that families can picnic and relax and enjoy our great city  and learn about its extraordinary history  Last year  we were able to include  7 million in the budget for a new National Park Service visitors center  Boston is blessed to have a rich diversity of national parks and historic sites  and the new visitors center will be the nerve center for all of them   Congressman Mike Capuano also deserves special recognition for his skillful work in obtaining funds for the Harbor Parks Pavilion project  one of the first jewels to be constructed on the Greenway  I look forward to continuing to work with Mike to see that it continues to be a federal budget priority  I also commend our state legislature for over riding a veto this year and providing  31 million in state funds for the Greenway   Were also very proud of the work thats gone into preserving the Boston Light   the nations first lighthouse  and the last manned lighthouse today  The Light is one of the most memorable icons of our state  and its gratifying to know that it will continue to light the way for generations to come By any measure  the Recreation Area has made extraordinary progress in the last 10 years and I look forward to working closely with the Alliance as it enters its second decade   This is a big year for all our parks and recreation areas  Its no secret that theyre in real trouble  Theyre underfunded and understaffed  The state has a backlog of  750 million in maintenance projects  It has only six park rangers to staff 450 000 acres of park space outside of the Boston metropolitan area  Its not just a problem for state parks  National parks and recreation areas face similar challenges National parks have been suffering for several years from chronic funding shortfalls of as much as  600 million a year  The result is a multi billion dollar backlog of deferred maintenance  This year the White House asked Park Service units to tighten their belts again  use just 80  of their operating budgets  even though costs are rising to keep these units running  The White House budget request for next year actually proposed to cut  100 million from the Park Service   Its time to change direction and begin respecting our parks again  by providing the funds they need to meet the maintenance backlog and ensure that visitors have a safe and enjoyable experience  We owe it to future generations to be better stewards of these landmarks  Our parks provide more than just a sense of local pride  Theyre investments in local economies wherever they exist   The Commonwealth has benefited enormously from the creation of the park system  Our 18 National Parks and affiliates attract 11 million visitors a year  and they employ hundreds of Commonwealth residents  Each year they receive close to  40 million in operating funds  plus millions more for restoration and new construction projects   Half a century ago  the Eisenhower Administration launched the Mission 66 initiative to restore the nations parks by their 50th anniversary in 1966  They were committed to the idea that the nations parks were for the people  and they created the investment program with public use in mind  Those early investments were responsible for many of todays facilities  including more than 100 visitor centers  and they now host nearly 270 million visitors a year   President Bush has ordered the Interior Department to get ready for the 100th anniversary by laying out performance goals  The bottom line  though  is that our parks are stretched too thin and they need real investments to clear up the maintenance backlog and provide the kind of visitor services that our people expect and deserve   The nation has an opportunity next month to elect candidates who will honor this historic legacy by supporting the funds needed to restore our Parks to their proper condition  Im optimistic that voters across the country will make the right choice and elect candidates who care about our parks  and who will stand up to an Administration that consistently undercuts them  You can count on me to continue the battle for the Boston Harbor Islands and all of the nations parks  Thank you so much    Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
