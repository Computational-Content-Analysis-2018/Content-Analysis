         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Congress was wise to include a sunset provision in the Patriot Act to require its key provisions to be re examined at a later time  In the years since 9 11  many of us have become concerned that the Act needlessly overrides basic freedoms  and we have an opportunity now to restore them without in any way endangering our national security    Nearly 400 cities and towns and four state legislatures have issued resolutions expressing some kind of concern over the Act s excessive reach  Republicans and Democrats alike have criticized the Act    As an example  concerned citizens from all parts of the political spectrum are disturbed by the Bush Administration s unqualified support for section 215 of the Act  which allows government agents to collect data on citizens    such as the books they buy  the goods they purchase  or their medical records    even their church records    without significant evidence connecting them to a crime or to foreign agents linked to terrorism     The power to do so is granted by a secret court on certification by the FBI that the items are sought for a national security investigation  and the secret court order can t be challenged in any way    We need to permit the FBI to pursue legitimate leads  but it s not too much to ask that reasonable restrictions be applied to prevent gross abuse of power     Section 505 of the Act grants the FBI the powers to obtain bank and financial records  telephone and e mail logs  and credit reports without any challenge or oversight at all  even from the secret court  All that s needed is the FBI s statement that the information is required for a national security investigation  A trial judge has already found that the use of such power violates the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution    Surely  it s time to correct these and other controversial provisions of the Act  We can protect individuals  libraries  bookstores  and churches from fishing expeditions  without undermining the legitimate needs of National Security  Our fundamental constitutional safeguards are indispensable to our democracy  They re a source of our country s strength  not luxuries or inconveniences to be ignored in times of crisis     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
