         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Thank you Jessica Alvarez for that great introduction  and I commend the National Capitol Immigration Coalition for organizing this event    Were here today to speak out for hardworking immigrant families    To speak out for Americas immigrant heritage    To speak out for Americas future   Many say that Congress will never hear us    But we say  Together  we can  Si se puede   Some say we can never win a path to citizenship for hard working immigrants   But we say  Si se puede   They say we can never pass a good new fair immigration law   But we say  Si se puede   Si se puede  Si se puede  Si se puede   Thats the dream that has inspired Americas greatest progress other years   Its the dream that inspired Cesar Chavez to bring fairness to our nations farm workers   It inspired America to demand fair civil rights laws   It inspired America to demand fair voting rights laws    And its the great dream that will guide us now  The American Dream of equal opportunity for all   And if we cant get this Congress to pass fair immigration reform now  well elect a new Congress in November that will pass it   We will pass an immigration bill in Congress that is worthy of America   Well pass a genuinely fair immigration bill that is worthy of America and worthy of the best of the American dream    Si se puede    Now is the time  As Cardinal Mahony said a few days ago  This is one of the most pressing moral and social issues of our time  Congress does not have the right or the luxury to let four weeks go by and refuse to deal with it    From my office in Boston  I can see the Golden Steps where my great grandparents arrived as immigrants from Ireland    They found a land that rewarded their hard work  respected their religious beliefs and enabled them to raise their families  They fought against discrimination and they overcame it  And this generation of immigrants will overcome it too   Immigrants today are not different  They work hard  They practice their faith  They love their families   Immigrants have contributed immensely to America throughout our history  In all of our wars  immigrants have fought side by side with Americans  and with great valor  Theyve earned 20 percent of the Congressional Medals of Honor  More than 60 000 immigrants are in the US military today  and many have made the ultimate sacrifice  dying in the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan    We say Congress must act now and do what is right   We will never give up  we will never give in  We are fighting for what is right  and we shall prevail     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
