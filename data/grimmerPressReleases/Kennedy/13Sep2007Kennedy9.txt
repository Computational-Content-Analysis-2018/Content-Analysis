         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in anticipation of President Bushs address this evening on Iraq Unfortunately  it is clear that the President will continue to stubbornly push  as he has for the last four years  for the same open ended commitment of our troops Staying the course has put our troops in the impossible position of winning every battle  but never being allowed to win the war  Instead  the Presidents policy has made our troops hostage to Iraqi politicians who have yet to show any willingness to make the tough decisions required to end their civil war Its clear that President Bush intends to drag this process out month after month  year after year  so that he can hand his Iraqi policy off to the next President  We have to change our policy now  Until we do  our troops will continue shedding blood in the streets of Baghdad and our national security will remain at risk      Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
