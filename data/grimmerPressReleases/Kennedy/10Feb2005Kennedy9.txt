         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Supporters of the legislation we are considering today claim that the issue is curbing reckless spendthrifts who evade their financial responsibilities  Nothing could be farther from the truth     The Orwellian title of this legislation is The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act  It should be called the Bankruptcy Abuse Promotion and Consumer Punishment Act  If it s enacted  millions of hard working  hard pressed Americans will face even greater hardships  so that credit card companies and banks can record even greater profits    Nowhere is the unfairness of this legislation more evident than in the way it slams the door on bankruptcy relief for people who have the misfortune to be ill  One of the serious costs of the national failure to guarantee affordable health care for every citizen is that illness is bankrupting millions of Americans who ve done everything right  They ve worked hard  played by the rules  earned a good salary  saved their money  even purchased health insurance   only to find it s not enough when serious illness strikes    They re already paralyzed heavily by our broken health care system  and this bill punishes them again under bankruptcy law  The profits of credit card companies and banks should not be placed ahead of the needs of hard working  hard pressed Americans    A recent study by Professor Elizabeth Warren and her associates at Harvard exposes the rationale for this special interest giveaway  Almost half of all Americans who file for bankruptcy every year are the victims of illness  They re not spendthrifts  They did not run up credit card debts on plasma televisions  expensive clothes  or trips to the Caribbean  They re middle class Americans who have had the misfortune to get sick     Most of these Americans did not seek relief in the bankruptcy courts willingly  In the years before they actually declared bankruptcy  they made extensive sacrifices  struggling to pay for their health care and make other ends meet  One in five cut back on food  A third had their electricity shut off  Half lost their phone service  Many more went without needed medical care     It s indefensible to deny them bankruptcy protection  It is reprehensible to put the interests of credit card companies and banks with great wealth and power ahead of the interests of working families in desperate straits  It is unconscionable to punish people because they have the misfortune to be sick    As this bill moves forward  we must amend it to protect families with high medical costs from its harsh provisions  The issue is not financial responsibility  These families have more than met that test  The issue is moral responsibility  Will the United States Senate take the responsible course and stand up to the powerful special interests demanding an even larger pound of flesh from the victims of our broken health care system  For those who have had the misfortune to be bankrupted by illness  we owe them the chance to start over  That s been the hallmark of our bankruptcy laws for more than a century and it s wrong for Congress to deny them that opportunity    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
