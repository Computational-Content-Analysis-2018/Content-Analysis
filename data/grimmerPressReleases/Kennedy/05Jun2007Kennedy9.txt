         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D CToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to the National Evaluation of Early Reading First by the Institute of Education Services  Helping our youngest children develop their early literacy and language skills is at the heart of the Early Reading First program  Congress should continue its commitment to this important goal  but today s evaluation suggests that much more needs to be done to strengthen this essential program  Early Reading First has encouraged promising practices in early childhood classrooms and greatly expanded the amount of training available to early childhood teachers  Today s study also raises important questions about the scope and quality of that training  and suggests little evidence of its effect on child outcomes  Early Reading First has produced encouraging progress in helping children recognize letters and words  but has done little to promote progress on other important elements of early literacy and language  As Congress reauthorizes the No Child Left Behind Act  I m committed to exploring new and innovative ways to ensure that Early Reading First makes a difference for those children who need it the most  It s clear that we need better training and interventions for teachers in the program  higher quality support for those children furthest behind  and new investments in the social and emotional skills so important to learning in the early years      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
