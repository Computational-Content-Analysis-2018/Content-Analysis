         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      The first meeting of a new subcommittee is always an important occasion  I particularly commend our full committee chairman  Senator Enzi  for his decision to devote a subcommittee to the issue of our defenses against biological attacks  and I also commend our subcommittee chairman  Senator Burr  for an impressive record of accomplishment on the issue  We re off to a good bipartisan start    Five years ago  Senator Frist and I worked with Senator Burr when he was a member of the House on the first legislation to deal with public health defenses against bioterrorist attacks  That measure was signed into law a year before 9 11  and in the wake of that attack  a more extensive bill on the issue was enacted in 2002     Senator Burr contributed important provisions in that bill  We also worked together on the compensation program for persons injured by the smallpox vaccine  and his leadership will serve the Senate and the country well in all aspects of this issue     The nation is obviously vulnerable to attacks with weapons of mass destruction  and our focus today is on developing new medical initiatives in the fight to keep America s families safe    We must also recognize that even the best new treatments will do little good if our emergency rooms are so overburdened that doctors and nurses cannot deliver effective care     The most modern disease monitoring systems will be of little use if public health agencies are so starved of funds that they cannot keep their communities safe      Unfortunately  the Administration s budget ignores this basic fact  Instead of strengthening our hospitals and public health agencies  the budget inexplicably reduces federal support for bioterrorism preparedness at the state and local level     Study after study shows that health agencies and hospitals are making progress  But it s very slow  and they have a long way to go  Despite the clear need for greater federal aid  the budget contains a twelve percent   twelve percent   cutback in the federal programs that strengthen health agencies  and a major cut in the program to strengthen hospitals      We took a significant step in BioShield in the last Congress to develop the cures of the future  but we ll slide back if these proposed cuts are allowed to take effect     Our committee has received many proposals to improve BioShield through additional incentives to industry  Incentives are an indispensable part of defending against bioterrorism  but the incentives have to be appropriate  We can t afford to squander resources on needless giveaways     In our effort to improve BioShield  we must be careful not to enact PhRMAShield      We ll hear today from a drug industry executive who is doing the right thing  Gordon Cameron is the CEO of Acambis  to whom America owes a debt of gratitude for what Acambis did in producing 180 million doses of vaccine to keep the nation safe from smallpox  I hope the Administration will build on this success by providing the funds needed to keep the production line for smallpox active    What did it take to get Acambis to complete this essential project  No wild card patent extension  No extra market exclusivity  It was just a contract under which Acambis produced the vaccine on time and on budget     Obviously  we need to examine how BioShield achieves its objectives  but we shouldn t rush into overturning a balanced system of patent incentives in the name of biodefense     A similar issue arises in cases when some patients may be harmed by the product itself  As part of the smallpox vaccination effort  Congress granted appropriate indemnity for the manufacturer of the vaccine and the health professionals who administer it  That indemnity was justified in the case of smallpox since the vaccine couldn t be fully tested or meet FDA standards in time  Targeted indemnity protections make sense   but that doesn t mean broad exemptions for negligence just because products have value for biodefense     It s also important to have fair compensation for persons injured by faulty products and proper safety protections for the workers who administer them      I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses and to working with my colleagues to consider these issues and make the genuine improvements that might be needed in BioShield  Thank you  Mr  Chairman      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
