         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DCToday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent the Attorney General a letter urging him to open an immediate investigation into the CIAs destruction of interrogation videotapesand  if necessary  to appoint a special prosecutor  The destruction of these tapes raises serious concerns that laws against torture and obstruction of justice may have been violated  An investigation is urgently needed to bring clarity and accountability to this disgraceful episode     The text of the letter is below      December 7  2007    The Honorable Michael Mukasey  Attorney General  Department of Justice  950   Pennsylvania Avenue NW  Washington   DC 20530    Dear Attorney General Mukasey     Like millions of Americans  I was outraged to learn about the Central Intelligence Agencys intentional destruction of videotapes showing agency officials subjecting detainees to severe interrogation techniques  I am writing to request that you immediately open an investigation and  if necessary  appoint a special prosecutor     Both the CIA Director  General Michael Hayden  and the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia  Karen Williams  have already acknowledged that the CIA destroyed these tapes      General Hayden stated that the tapes were destroyed because it was determined they were no longer of intelligence value and not relevant to any internal  legislative  or judicial inquiries  But the tapes were plainly relevant to pending inquiries  including the 9 11 Commission and the Zacarias Moussaoui prosecution  as well as to possible investigations to come  As you know from your confirmation hearings  Congress continues to have a strong interest in the CIAs interrogation practices  It is not the CIAs role to determine what evidence is relevant to such proceedings     General Hayden also stated that the tapes were destroyed because they posed a serious security risk  Were they ever to leak  they would permit identification of your CIA colleagues who had served in the program  exposing them and their families to retaliation from al Qaida and its sympathizers  But this claim also makes little sense  Millions of documents produced by the CIA would pose a serious security risk if leaked  yet the CIA does not respond by destroying them  The CIA has extensive procedures in place to prevent leaks  and they certainly have the technological capacity to conceal the identity of their employees on a videotape      The most plausible reason for the tapes destruction is the one that several officials gave to the New York Times  they were destroyed because officers were concerned that tapes documenting controversial interrogation methods could expose agency officials to greater risk of legal jeopardy  In other words  the tapes were destroyed because they revealed potentially serious criminal conduct by CIA interrogators  It is hard to escape the conclusion that this was a cover up     Section 1512 of Title 18 of the United States Code makes it a felony to corruptly alter  destroy  mutilate  or conceal a record  document  or other object       with the intent to impair the objects integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding  For purposes of this statute  an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense  and       the testimony  or the record  document  or other object need not be admissible in evidence or free of a claim of privilege  So long as it is foreseeable that the destroyed item might at some point be relevant to an official proceeding  its destruction is a felony under our obstruction of justice laws     The seriousness of this matter is hard to overstate  Our legal prohibitions against torture protect the ideals we hold most dear and the safety of our personnel abroad  Our legal prohibitions against obstruction of justice protect the integrity of our courtrooms and our entire legal system  If government officials violate these laws  it is imperative that these violations be identified and their perpetrators held to account      In your confirmation hearings  you pledged that as Attorney General  you would have no course but to follow the law  You stated that politics cant have anything to do with the jobs of the people in the Justice Department today  and that as Attorney General you would be working for all the people of the United States of   America  not just the President  You also stated that torture is antithetical to everything this country stands for     I hope and trust that these commitments you made to the American people will lead you to follow the rule of law and investigate this matter as fully  openly  and expeditiously as possible  The nation is demanding answers  and it deserves them from the Department of Justice      My colleague Senator Durbin has made a similar request  and I join him in asking that you respond to this request by Wednesday  December 12     With respect and appreciation     Sincerely       Edward M  Kennedy    Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
