         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Last night the Senate passed by unanimous consent a measure sponsored by Minority Leader Harry Reid  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Senator Richard Durbin  and Senator Joe Biden calling on the Bush Administration to stop delaying the report on Iraqi security forces that was due to Congress on July 11  The report  which holds the Administration accountable for making sure that the American people  and our soldiers    know the real progress we are making in training Iraqis and our ability to transfer responsibility for security over to Iraqis was required by law in the recent Iraq Supplemental Appropriations  Also required is an estimate of the level of US troops that will be necessary in Iraq in the future  The law requires an initial report on July 11  and additional reports are due every 90 days after that until the end of fiscal year 2006     Senator Kennedy said  The sounding call could not be louder or clearer that Congress and the American people want the Bush Administration to stop painting a rosy picture and provide an effective strategy for success in Iraq  It is unconscionable that the Administration has failed to give the American people a straight answer about how many Iraqi security forces are adequately trained and equipped and able to defend Iraq s security on their own  It is time to put facts behind our policy     The Administration has a history of not complying with required reports on Iraq troop training  Section 1204 of last year s Defense Authorization Act  Public Law 108 375  required the President to submit an unclassified report on a stabilization strategy for Iraq and an effective plan to train the Iraqi security forces  The report was due 120 days after enactment  The law was enacted on October 28  2004  and the report should have been provided by the end of February    In February 2004  Secretary Rumsfeld said  We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces  now more than 200 000 strong  In January 2005  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in reference to the number of Iraqi security forces  We think the number right now is somewhere over 120 000  Yet  on February 3  2005  in response to questions from Senator Levin at a Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing  General Richard Myers  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  conceded that only 40 000 Iraqi security forces are actually capable  He said  48 deployable  battalions  around the country  equals about 40 000  which is the number that can go anywhere and do anything     Below is Senator Kennedy s floor statement on the amendment  as prepared for delivery     Statement by Senator Edward M  Kennedy Overdue Report on Iraqi Security Forces  as prepared for delivery    Mr  President  I support this amendment  which calls on the Secretary of Defense to stop delaying the report required to be submitted to Congress on the progress being made to train the Iraqi security forces    The report was required in the recent Iraq Supplemental Appropriations Act  Public Law 109 13  which became law on May 11  The first report was to have been provided by July 11  Additional reports are due every 90 days after that until the end of fiscal year 2006     This is not a bureaucratic dispute  The information requested in the report goes to the heart of our ability to succeed in Iraq  It is vital to identifying when the Iraqi forces will be able to assume responsibility for security  It is essential to estimating of the level of US troops that will be necessary in Iraq in the future     Twice in the last month  President Bush has ensured us that training Iraqi security forces is central to our strategy for success    On June 28  President Bush said  Our strategy can be summed up this way  As the Iraqis stand up  we will stand down     On July 11  President Bush again said  Our plan can be summed up this way  As the Iraqis stand up  we will stand down    Unfortunately  the Administration has not been willing to give the American people a straight answer about the number of Iraqi security forces  who are adequately trained and equipped  We re obviously making some progress  but it s far from clear how much  The American people deserve an honest assessment that provides the basic facts    But that s not what we re being given  According to a GAO report in March  U S  government agencies do not report reliable data on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped     The Report goes on to say  The Departments of State and Defense no longer report on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are equipped with their required weapons  vehicles  communications  equipment  and body armor    It s clear from the Administration s own statements that they re using the notorious fuzzy math tactic to avoid an honest appraisal    In February 2004  Secretary Rumsfeld said  We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces  now more than 200 000 strong     In January 2005  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said  We think the number right now is somewhere over 120 000  Yet  on February 3  2005  in response to questions from Senator Levin at a Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing  General Richard Myers  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  conceded that only 40 000 Iraqi security forces are actually capable  He said  48 deployable  battalions  around the country  equals about 40 000  which is the number that can go anywhere and do anything     Obviously  we need a better accounting of how much progress is being made to train and equip effective and capable Iraqi security forces    The American people want to know   Our men and women in uniform want to know    Congress has been seeking information on this issue for a long time     Section 1204 of last year s Defense Authorization Act  Public Law 108 375  required the President to submit an unclassified report on a stabilization strategy for Iraq and an effective plan to train the Iraqi security forces  The report was due 120 days after enactment  The law was enacted on October 28  2004  and the report should have been provided by the end of February    We have still not received it from the White House   The Administration has been AWOL on the report    Given the high priority the President has placed on the training of Iraqi security forces  it is unconscionable that the Administration has failed to give the American people a straight answer about how many Iraqi security forces are adequately trained and equipped and able to defend Iraq s security on their own  It is time to put facts behind our policy     President Bush has not leveled with our troops and the American people and offered an effective strategy for success    He has spoken about the importance of training Iraqi security forces  but he has failed to outline a clear strategy to achieve their training and improve their capability     The American people and our soldiers deserve to know what progress is being made in training Iraqis to protect their own security     We all hope for the best in Iraq  We all want democracy to take root firmly and irrevocably  We need to train the Iraqis for the stability of Iraq  But we also need to train them because our current level of deployment is not sustainable  Our military has been stretched to the breaking point  Threats in other parts of the world are ever present  Our men and women in uniform and the American people deserve this report  because they deserve to know when the President has a strategy for success    The President says our troops in Iraq will stand down as Iraqi security forces stand up  but the Administration has failed to provide a realistic assessment of the progress being made in training the Iraqi forces    The American people deserve to know when the Iraqis will be able to take over responsibility for their own security  and what impact it will have on our military presence in Iraq     It s time for the stonewalling to end and for accountability to begin    I urge my colleagues to support this amendment      Laura Capps
