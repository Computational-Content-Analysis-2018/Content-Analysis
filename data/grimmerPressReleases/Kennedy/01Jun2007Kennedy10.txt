of Senator Edward M  KennedyCongressional Coalition on Adoption Institute LuncheonFriday  June 1  2007Boston  MA As Prepared for Delivery For more than two decades  the Congressional Coalition on Adoption has worked to improve national policies on adoption and help to meet the needs of the thousands of children waiting to be adopted every year  Nearly two hundred Members of Congress belong to the Coalition  and many of us have attended your informative briefings and other events   Ive worked closely on these issues with my Senate colleague Mary Landrieu  one of the chairs of the Coalition  and her passion and commitment to this cause are truly inspiring   As we all know  harmful influences in young peoples lives have lasting scars   Were reminded of that each time a child is a victim of abuse or neglect  or left without a safe and caring place to come home to  each time we see a child who lacks routine health care  immunizations  or mental health services  each time a young person drops out of school  joins a gang  or becomes a victim of substance abuse      These are the kinds of challenges faced by Americas foster children over half a million of them  with nearly 120 000 waiting to be adopted   The number of children in foster care has almost doubled in the last twenty years  and the average time a child remains in foster care has grown to about three years  Each year  20 000 children in foster care age out of the system  without ever being placed with a permanent family  and their lives are forever affected   Theyre likely to be poor  become homeless or go to jail  or depend on welfare   In Massachusetts  3 000 children are waiting to be adopted from the state foster care system this year   In recent years  the Commonwealth has legalized over 800 adoptions a year from the system   We have strong policies in place to support child well being and enable children in foster care find safe homes  but we obviously need to do better During my years in the Senate  Ive worked to make the safety and well being of children a higher national priority   In 2000  we passed a needed law to grant citizenship to foreign born children of American parents  and to children adopted by American parents outside of the United States  The law also improved the adoption process for families and children  especially for children being adopted from other nations   Several important federal incentives exist to support families in adopting children  The Adoption Assistance Program provides funds to states to help children whose special circumstances or needs make it more difficult to place them for adoption  States in turn use the funds to reimburse families for the costs of adopting a child  and provide monthly subsidies to adoptive families to assist with caring for the child The federal tax credit for adoptions   10 000 for domestic or international adoptions  is an important financial incentive to promote adoption  The Family and Medical Leave Act helps encourage adoption and foster care  by requiring companies to grant up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to employees working toward the placement of an adoptive or foster care child   Well continue to support efforts at the federal level to promote these important policies   In addition  many states have their own programs and policies to assist families in the adoption process and support adopted children  The tuition waiver program here in Massachusetts is an excellent example  it grants free tuition at many state colleges for adopted children  Were also proud of the many organizations and partners we can count on to support adoptions   Deutsche Bank is an important leader on this issue  and I commend them for all they do for this cause   Four other Massachusetts organizations have been rated among the most adoption friendly workplaces in America   South Mountain Company in West Tisbury was ranked eighth in the nation  College Coach in Newton was ranked the number four small employer and number four in its industry  Ocean Spray scored tenth in its industry  and Millennium Pharmaceuticals was among the top ten medium sized employers   Deutsche Bank and these Massachusetts corporations deserve our gratitude for their dedication and commitment to adoption  and for their other support  such as paid leave  in assisting employees to adopt  According to a recent annual survey  45 percent of major companies in the United States offered financial adoption benefits last year  compared to only 12 percent in 1990  That kind of employee benefit can make a real difference in the decision to adopt  It makes the adoption process more affordable  and it allows parents to spend more time and bond with the child  The benefit also makes good business sense  it attracts employee interest and improves employee loyalty and retention Despite this support  we still face too many challenges in finding a safe and permanent home for all children  The most common obstacles to adoption are recruiting adoptive homes  terminating parental rights  and managing court cases and child welfare cases   We still have much to do to help children in foster care beat the odds and thrive in spite of difficult circumstances  Thats why I care so much about the good work of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption  of the Institute  and of all the organizations and companies across the country who support foster children and adoption    The Institute has an indispensable role in educating legislators and many others about these issues  and in providing direct help to children waiting to be adopted   Your Angels in Adoption program has told the stories of those who have touched the lives of foster children and orphans to all of us in Washington   For eight years  youve helped raise awareness of the need to support these children who have not yet found a permanent home   Were inspired each year by the remarkable examples of people across the nation who have brought hope and stability to these children   Your Congressional Foster Youth Internship Program is another excellent example   It enables college students who have spent time in foster care to serve as interns in Congressional offices for a summer  Its a wonderful program that helps raise awareness of children in foster care  and it helps these young men and women to gain valuable work experience  We cant let children in foster care and those waiting to be adopted fall through the cracks  and because of you  were making impressive progress every day  every week  every year   Thank you all for attending this luncheon today  and thank you to the Institute for all they do so well   I look forward very much to working with you in the years ahead  and I hope many of you will join us in our efforts          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633   Keith Maley  617  565 4472
