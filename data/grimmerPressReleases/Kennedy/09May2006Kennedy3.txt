         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    This should be a historic week  The Senate has the opportunity at last to have a debate on the basic questions of health care     Senator Enzi has put forward a proposal that deserves debate and the opportunity for amendment  I commend him for his diligence in bringing forward his proposal    But after careful study and debate  I believe the Senate will conclude that the course laid out in this proposal is the wrong one for health care     The legislation will make health care coverage less affordable and less accessible for millions of Americans      It will raise premiums for Americans when they are older or when they fall ill  It will mean the end of laws to guarantee coverage for cancer  for diabetes  for mental health parity  and other essential services  It will undermine the laws that protect consumers from fraud and abuse  and it will give no real help to the self employed    We have a better approach  The proposal offered by Senator Durbin and Senator Lincoln will allow small businesses to band together to get the same low rates offered to larger employers  It provides real help for small businesses with the high cost of health care through tax credits and a reinsurance program to defray the cost of the most expensive claims    When our debate concludes  I believe the Senate will agree with the over 200 organizations who have written letters of opposition to this legislation  These organizations represent patients with diabetes and cancer and mental health needs  They represent older Americans  workers  health care professionals  small businesses  and Americans in all walks of life     They represent the over 15 000 Americans who have called the Senate to ask this body to oppose legislation that will take a step backward from our commitment to quality health care  And they represent the millions more who will be harmed if we do not reject the legislation before us    We have heard from governors  insurance commissioners and attorneys general from Maine to Hawaii  and from Florida to Alaska  All of them have urged the Senate to reject this bill    I urge my colleagues to oppose the current legislation B but I hope you will vote to proceed to consideration of this bill  The Senate has been denied the chance to take action on major health priorities far too long    Next week  seniors will be forced to pay a steep penalty if they are unable to navigate through the tangle of confusing Medicare plans and options  The Senate ought to vote on Senator Nelson s proposal to let seniors make their choice without the threat of heavy fines if they do not meet this arbitrary deadline    The Republican Medicare law also includes a provision so contrary to common sense that people hardly believe you when you tell them it was included  The legislation made it illegal for Medicare to bargain for discounts on drugs for seniors  We have a proposal to end that shameful prohibition  and we should vote on that proposal    On Medicaid  we should take action to end the cruel cuts imposed on the poorest of our fellow citizens by the Deficit Reduction Act  which paid for tax cuts for the wealthy through health cuts for the poor    We have been promised and promised that the Senate would vote on drug importation  but the vote never comes  Senator Dorgan  Senator Snowe  Senator McCain and I have a proposal to allow safe importation of lower cost medicines from Canada and elsewhere  Surely  health week is the time for a vote    Before the week is out  the Senate should see that the promise of stem cell research is no longer denied to the millions of patients and their families who look on with anger and bewilderment as the bill passed by the House languishes for month after month in the Senate    And we have failed year in and year out to fulfill the promise of this century of the life sciences  by making quality health care a right for every American  Let us at long last take action to extend quality health care to every American    So I say to my colleagues  vote for cloture on this motion  Vote for a health care debate  Vote for the chance to go on record with your answer to these important questions on Medicare  on Medicaid  on stem cells  on drug importation  on coverage  and on many other health priorities     Let us have a debate and let the Senate decide where it stands   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
