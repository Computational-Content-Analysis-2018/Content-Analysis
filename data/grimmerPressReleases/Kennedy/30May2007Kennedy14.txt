         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Clinton Press Office 202 224 2243 or press_office clinton senate govJennifer Mullin  Harkin  202 224 5698Melissa Schwartz  Mikulski  202 228 1122   WASHINGTON  D C  Senators Edward Kennedy  D MA   Tom Harkin  D IA   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   and Barbara Mikulski  D MD  today announced that they will introduce legislation next week to ensure that workers are able to enforce their legal right to equal pay  The bill will remove a technical hurdle created by yesterdays Supreme Court ruling in Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire  Rubber Company that will make it far more difficult for women and others to receive equal pay for equal work  Representatives Rosa DeLauro  D CT   George Miller  D CA  and Eleanor Holmes Norton  D DC  announced that they will introduce companion legislation in the House of Representatives Senator Kennedy said  Yesterdays Supreme Court decision creates an unacceptable obstacle to employees pay discrimination claims  This is not what Congress intended when we passed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1991  We are all dedicated to ensuring that workers may seek redress in the courts each and every time they are subjected to unlawful pay discrimination  Yesterdays Supreme Court decision reflects a poor understanding of the real problems with long term pay discrimination  said Senator Harkin  Most new employees feel less comfortable challenging their salaries  and it is very difficult to determine when pay discrimination begins  Furthermore  a small pay gap tends to widen over time  only becoming noticeable when there is systemic discrimination over a period of years  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ensure every worker receives the paycheck he or she deserves Unless Congress Acts  this Supreme Court ruling will have far reaching implications for women  and will gravely limit the rights of employees who have suffered pay discrimination based on their race  sex  religion or national origin  All Americans deserve equal pay for equal work and it is our responsibility to get this right  said Senator Clinton This weeks Supreme Court decision sends a dangerous message about the value of pay equity in this country  It is unacceptable that women and others would be limited in their opportunities to stand up for themselves and for their families  I am proud to team up with my colleagues to right this wrong  said Senator Mikulski Over the last quarter century  we have made strides in the American workplace against pay discrimination  but this recent Supreme Court ruling is another example highlighting that our work is not close to being done  said Representative DeLauro  When Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act it was with the intent that Title VII would empower people with the tools necessary to address pay discrimination  not create another hurdle  However  it seems that Congresss intent was not clear enough for the Supreme Court and so I am joining with my colleagues to introduce clarifying legislation so there is no further question about our commitment to ending pay discrimination and closing the wage gap  said Representative DeLauro As Justice Ginsburg suggests  the ball has now fallen into Congress court and we intend to address this ruling  said Representative George Miller  D CA   chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee  The Supreme Courts narrow decision makes it more difficult for workers to stand up for their basic civil rights at work and that is unacceptable Yesterday  the Supreme Court ruled by a narrow five to four margin to limit the ability of women and other employees to sue their employers for pay discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  writing in dissent  called on Congress to amend the law to correct the Courts ruling  The Kennedy Harkin Clinton Mikulski bill will take this action by stating expressly that the statute of limitations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 runs from the date of each payment of a discriminatory wage Lilly Ledbetter  an employee of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for 19 years  first brought charges of discrimination before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1998 with proof that she was being paid between 15 percent and 40 percent less than each of her male counterparts  including those with less seniority  A federal jury found for Ledbetter  and the district court awarded Ms  Ledbetter more than  3 million in back pay and compensatory and punitive damages  However  the Supreme Court overturned this award  holding that Ms  Ledbetters claim exceeded the statute of limitations Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that a charge of discrimination must be filed within 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred  The Supreme Court held that this period runs from the date the employer makes a pay setting decision  and not the date that the employee actually receives a paycheck with a discriminatory wage  even if the effects of the discrimination were not fully apparent to the worker at the time  In announcing their bill to clarify the intent of Congress under the law  Senators Kennedy  Harkin  Clinton and Mikulski underscored that this ruling is at odds with the interpretation that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had previously given to Title VII  as well as the rule that has applied to other federal civil rights statutes  such as the Equal Pay Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224
