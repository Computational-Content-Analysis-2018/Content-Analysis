         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE             CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner                202  224 2633 Judge Roberts  I join in welcoming you and your family to this committee  and to this famous room    the site of so many historic hearings   Today  our nation s flags are at half mast to honor the memory of Chief Justice Rehnquist and his deep dedication to his beloved Supreme Court  We know that Judge Roberts was especially close to him  and our thoughts and prayers go to the Rehnquist family and all who knew him  As we are all well aware  the Senate s action on this nomination is profoundly important  It s a defining opportunity to consider the values that make our nation strong and just  and how to implement them most effectively  especially the guiding principle of more than two centuries of our history    that we are all created equal  Our commitment to this founding principle is especially relevant today  Americans are united as rarely before in compassion and generosity for our fellow citizens whose lives have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina   That massive tragedy also taught us another lesson  The powerful winds and floodwater of Katrina tore away the mask that has hidden from public view the many Americans who are left out and left behind  As one nation under God  we cannot continue to ignore the injustice  the inequality  and the gross disparities that exist in our society  Across the years  we have experienced times of great turmoil and great triumph  as each succeeding generation struggled to live up to our founding principle and give it meaning for everyone  Americans have shed blood  campaigned and marched  They have worked in countless quiet ways  as well  to see that every one of our citizens is part of our democracy and has an equal opportunity for a good education  a good job  and a good life  Today  grandparents who were denied the right to vote expect their grandsons and granddaughters to be able to cast a ballot without discrimination or intimidation  And our society is better because of that progress   Today  fathers and mothers expect their daughters to have the same opportunities as their sons to attend college  play sports  and earn fair pay  And our society is better because of that progress   Today  parents expect their disabled children to live in hope    to receive an education that draws out their talent  and enables them to reach for their dreams like all other Americans  And our society is better because of that progress  Too many have sacrificed too much  worked too hard  and come too far  to turn back the clock on that progress  Americans today expect their elected representatives to carry on the great unfinished business of making America the land of opportunity for all  and we expect our courts to defend our progress as their constitutional responsibility   The challenge today is especially difficult because of vast global economic changes and major new threats to our national security  and we need the ingenuity  innovation  and commitment of every American   Our military leaders are the first to say that highly qualified  racially diverse armed forces are essential to defending our country and the cause of freedom at home and abroad   Every citizen counts  We must continue to remove barriers that hold back millions of our people  We must draw strength from our diversity as we compete in a new world full of promise and peril   So the central issue before us in these hearings is whether the Supreme Court will preserve the gains of the past  and protect the rights that are indispensable to a modern  more competitive  more equal America  Commitment to equality for all is not only a matter of fairness and conscience  It is also our path to sustained national strength and purpose   We also are a government of the people in which citizens have a strong voice in the great issues that shape our lives  Our system of checks and balances was drawn up in full awareness of the principle that absolute power corrupts absolutely  and was designed to make sure that no branch of government becomes so powerful that it can avoid accountability  The people have a right to know that their government is promoting their interests  not the special interests  when it comes to the price of gasoline and the safety of prescription drugs  the air we breathe and the water we drink  and the food and other products we buy  The people have a right to keep government from intruding into their private lives and most personal decisions   But the tragedy of Katrina shows in the starkest terms why every American needs an effective national government that will step in to meet urgent needs that individual states and communities cannot meet on their own   Above all  the people and their Congress must have a voice in decisions that determine the safety of our country and the integrity of our individual rights  We expect Supreme Court Justices to uphold those rights and the rule of law in times of both war and peace  All this    and more    will be before the Supreme Court in the years ahead  and its judgments will affect the direction and character of our country for generations to come   Judge Roberts you are an intelligent  well educated and serious man  You have vast legal experience and you are considered to be one of the finest legal advocates in America  These qualities are surely important qualifications for a potential Supreme Court Justice  But they do not end the inquiry or our responsibility  This Committee and the full Senate must also determine whether you have demonstrated a commitment to the constitutional principles that have been so vital in advancing fairness  decency and equal opportunity in our society   We have only one chance to get it right  and a solemn obligation to do so  If confirmed  you could serve on the Court for a generation or more  and the decisions you make as a Justice will have a direct impact on the lives of our children  our grandchildren and our great grandchildren   Because of the special importance of an appointment like yours  the Founders called for shared power between the President and the Senate  The Senate was not intended to be a rubber stamp for a President s nominees to the Supreme Court    and  as George Washington himself found out  it has not been   Judges are appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate  and it is our duty to ask questions on great issues that matter to the American people  and to speak for them  Judge Roberts  I hope you will respond fully and candidly to such questions  not just to earn our approval  but to prove to the American people that you have earned the right to a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land   Unfortunately  Mr  Chairman  there are real and serious reasons to be deeply concerned about Judge Roberts  record  Many of his past statements and writings raise questions about his commitment to equal opportunity and the bi partisan remedies we have adopted in the past  This hearing is John Roberts  job interview with the American people  He will have a fair chance to express his values  state his views  and defend his record  The burden on him is especially heavy  because the Administration  at least so far  has chosen not to allow the Senate to have access to his full record  We can only wonder what they don t want us to know  In particular  we need to know his views on civil rights  voting rights  and the right to privacy    especially the removal of existing barriers to full and fair lives for women  minorities  and the disabled   From the start  America was summoned to be a shining city on a hill  But each generation must keep building that city  Even in this new century  some Americans are still denied a voice at the ballot box because of their color  denied a promotion because of their gender  denied a job because of their age  denied hope because they are gay  or denied an appropriate education because they are disabled  Long established rights to privacy are under heavy siege   We need a Chief Justice who believes in the promise of America  and the guarantees of our Constitution  a person who will enter that majestic building near here and genuinely believe the four inspiring words inscribed in marble above the entrance  Equal Justice Under Law  I look forward to hearing from Judge Roberts about whether  if he joins the Supreme Court  he will uphold the progress we have made and will guarantee that all Americans have their rightful place in the nation s future      Judge Roberts  I join in welcoming you and your family to this committee  and to this famous room    the site of so many historic hearings     Today  our nation s
