         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           CONTACT  Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner March 4  2007                                                      202 224 2633KENNEDY  BILL CURBS USE OF ANIMAL ANTIBIOTICS HARMFUL TO PEOPLE   Congress has plan to antibiotic use in livestockWashington  D C  Today  the Washington Post reports that another antibioticcefquinomeis on track to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   The drug would be administered to treat pneumonia like disease in cattle  This drug is classified as highly potent and would be the first in its class to be approved for use in animals In February  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  joined by Senator Olympia Snowe and Representative Louise Slaughter introduced the Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2007  The increased use of antibiotics in livestock has created microbes resistant to all but the newest and most expensive drugs  The Act will protect the health of Americans by phasing out the non therapeutic use in livestock of medically important antibiotics  unless their manufacturers can show that they pose no danger to the public health   Kennedy has introduced similar legislation since 2002  Senator Kennedy said  Infections are posing a greater and greater risk to people as they grow resistant to today s antibiotics   We must make certain that we do not weaken the effectiveness of antibiotics through overuse as animal feed additives    But as we spend billions of dollars in the race to develop new antibiotics to keep people safe and healthy  it makes no sense to undermine our own efforts through the indiscriminate use of the these essential medicines in agriculture A summary of the legislation is below THE PRESERVATION OF ANTIBIOTICS FOR HUMAN TREATMENT ACT OF 2007SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY AND OLYMPIA SNOWEBackground         The widespread use of antibiotics beginning in the 1940 s provided  for the first time in history effective treatments for infectious diseases   These miracle drugs have saved countless lives  but they are losing their effectiveness   Antibiotics that once had the power to cure dangerous infections are now often useless  because microbes have become resistant to all but the newest and most expensive drugs  and some superbugs are impervious to any weapons in the medical arsenal    Resistance to antibiotics takes a heavy toll on patients across the nation   The World Health Organization estimates that 14 000 Americans die every year from drug resistant infections  This means that one American dies from a resistant infection every 38 minutes           It seems scarcely believable that these precious medications could be fed by the ton to chickens and pigs  but thats exactly whats happening in farms all over America   Over 20 million pounds of antibiotics are fed to farm animals every year   Thats more than is used in all of medicine   These precious drugs arent even used to treat sick animals  They are used to fatten pigs and speed the growth of chickens   The result of this rampant overuse is clear  meat contaminated with drug resistant bacteria sits on supermarket shelves all over America   Every family is potentially at risk   The most vulnerable among us  children  elderly  persons with HIV AIDS  are particularly endangered by resistant infections           At a time when the nation is relying on antibiotics and other medications to protect our homelands security from the grave threat of bioterrorism  we can no longer squander these precious weapons in the fight against disease by feeding them indiscriminately to livestock Provisions of the Legislation     The Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2007 will protect the health of Americans by phasing out the non therapeutic use in livestock of medically important antibiotics  unless their manufacturers can show that they pose no danger to the public health  The Act requires this same tough standard of new applications for approval of animal antibiotics      The Act does not restrict use of antibiotics to treat sick animals or to treat pets and other animals not used for food The below provisions are in the Senate bill      The Act provides for Federal payments to farmers to defray their costs in switching to antibiotic free husbandry practices  with a preference given to family farms  The Act also authorizes grants for research and demonstration programs on means to reduce the use of antibiotics in the raising of livestock      The Act requires manufacturers to report   1  on the amounts of antibiotics they supply for animal use  2  on the animals to which those drugs are given and  3  on the uses for which those drugs are supplied      CONTACT  Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner 202 224 2633
