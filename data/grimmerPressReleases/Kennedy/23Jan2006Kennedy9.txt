         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today  by a 3 1 vote  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  EEOC  approved a plan to reorganize its field structure  The plan downgrades eight district offices and expands the jurisdictions of the remaining offices without adding new staff  Commissioner Ishimaru cast the lone vote against the plan and used his opening statement to criticize the process by which it was formed     Senator Kennedy issued the following statement in response to the plan s approval  Senator Kennedy led a group of 30 Senators that sent a letter to Chair Cari Dominguez voicing opposition to the plan and asking for the vote to be delayed until the GAO could study it  I am deeply concerned that this plan will weaken the Commission s ability to fulfill its crucial mission of enforcing our nation s civil rights laws  By slashing the number of regional attorneys  the EEOC s ability to enforce laws against employment discrimination will be diminished  As we celebrate the Agency s fortieth anniversary  now is not the time to undermine decades of progress     Below is the letter to Chair Dominguez    July 6  2005   The Honorable Cari Dominguez  Chair Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 1801 L Street  N W  Washington  D C  20507   Dear Chair Dominguez    We are writing to express our opposition to your proposal to reorganize the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  EEOC   This matter is of great concern to us in light of the EEOC s crucial role in the enforcement of the nation s anti discrimination laws and its important presence in our states  Any changes to the EEOC s structure should enhance its capabilities to deter  detect  and litigate violations of the nation s civil rights laws  We are not confident that this proposal will do that  and fear that it will actually undermine the Commission s work    Reducing the number of regional attorneys and managers will diminish the Commission s litigation capabilities  There will be fewer people to refer charges to Washington for litigation  and regional attorneys who must make important litigation decisions will be separated from the investigators with front line information needed to make those decisions  Over time  these problems will likely reduce the number of charges that are litigated    We have particular concerns about the effect of the restructuring on our states  We are not satisfied with your generally unsupported assertions that the restructuring will not diminish the extent to which our constituents have ready access to meaningful EEOC services    In addition  we believe that the Commission should defer going forward with action on the restructuring proposal until the Government Accountability Office has released the results of its study on the issue  The information provided in that report will address many questions that remain unanswered  and it will be a valuable guide in assessing the likely impact of restructuring  We urge you not to go forward with a decision before all of that information has been consulted     We do appreciate the time your staff has taken to brief Congressional staff on the proposal and your commitment to ensuring that no current employees are forced out of their jobs  However  at this time  we oppose your proposal because of our serious concerns that  if implemented  it will undermine the Commission s ability to serve the public    With respect and admiration    ______________________________   ______________________________ Edward M  Kennedy      Barbara A  Mikulski
