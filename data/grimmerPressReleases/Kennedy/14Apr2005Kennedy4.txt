         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today we consider the nomination of Thomas Griffith to a lifetime position on the U S  Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit  As my colleagues are well aware  the Senate has confirmed 205 of President Bush s nominees  We rejected only 10  because their records did not show the fundamental commitment to upholding the basic rights of all Americans  which is essential if we are to have judges who apply the law instead of their own ideology    The Senate s role in reviewing judicial nominations is an important part of our system of checks and balances  Our democracy is the envy of the world because it does not allow one faction to impose its extreme views on the nation  Each of the three branches of government provides a check on an abuse of power by the others  The role of the Senate in carefully reviewing the record of judicial nominees was written into the Constitution for a reason    to assure independent judges with the highest integrity and the highest qualifications     The D C  Circuit is widely regarded as the nation s most important court of appeals  and it has often been a stepping stone to the Supreme Court  Although located here in the District of Columbia  the D C  Circuit s decisions have national reach  It has a unique role among the federal courts in interpreting federal power and has exclusive jurisdiction over many laws that protect consumers  employees  rights  civil rights  and the environment    The D C  Circuit is the only federal appellate court that can hear appeals on rules to protect the environment under the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act  It has exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to the North American Free Trade Act  It decides far more appeals than any other circuit of decisions by the National Labor Relations Board  As a practical matter  because the Supreme Court can review only a small number of lower court decisions  the judges on the D C  Circuit often have the last word on interpretations of these important rights  For many citizens seeking justice  the D C  Circuit is the court of last resort    Given its importance to the issues that affect Americans  daily lives  the Committee is right to take special care in selecting judges for lifetime positions on the D C  Circuit  Because the District of Columbia has no Senators  the Judiciary Committee has a particular duty with respect to the D C  Circuit  We must be confident that appointees to this prestigious court have the highest qualifications and ethical standards  and will fairly interpret the laws  particularly laws that protect our basic rights     Mr  Griffith has not satisfied the high standard required for confirmation to the D C  Circuit  His record raises troubling questions that have not been resolved by his testimony before the Committee  I m troubled by his positions on Title IX  when he served on the Department of Education s controversial Title IX Commission  He joined in several of the Commission s recommendations that would have weakened the protections under that landmark law prohibiting discrimination against women in education  He also proposed what he admits is a Aradical change in the interpretation of Title IX  As a member of the Department of Education s Title IX Commission  he suggested eliminating the substantial proportionality part of the well established Athree part test for assessing compliance with Title IX     That test has been in place since 1979  and has been critical to enforcing one of the most successful civil rights laws ever enacted  It s revolutionized opportunities for women in sports  Every federal court of appeals to consider the issue has approved the substantial proportionality part of the test  Since it was adopted  every Administration    Democratic and Republican alike has agreed that it is a valid measure of non discrimination  and not a quota     Yet Mr  Griffith urged the Commission to eliminate the test  He argued that all numerical tests are illegal  unfair  and wrong  a view that is plainly inconsistent with established interpretations of Title IX and many other civil rights laws  It s vital that anyone confirmed to a life time position as a federal judge demonstrate a firm commitment to the rights of all Americans and to the nation s progress on civil rights  women s rights  and individual liberties     In responses to written questions  Mr  Griffith claimed that his opposition to the substantial proportionality test was based on reasons other than a belief that the test is illegal  Instead  he now asserts that when he criticized decisions upholding substantial proportionality  he meant only that  under those decisions  even if substantial proportionality is a permissible means  it is not a required means  for complying with Title IX    Response to the Written Questions of Senator Kennedy  Dec  6  2004  at 2   But the transcript of Mr  Griffith s statements as a member of the Title IX Commission makes clear that he does not believe the proportionality test is ever a permissible means of complying with Title IX    When another Commissioner pointed out that the proportionality test had been upheld by every court of appeals to consider it  Mr  Griffith stated  I think the courts got it wrong  He explained that  the courts  said  the proportionality test  was reasonable   but  not required  Now I disagree with that  I think they were wrong  given the plain language of the statute  So  in fact  Mr  Griffith believes that the proportionality test is not reasonable and not even permissible under Title IX    He has also claimed that he opposed the proportionality test out of concern that it might be misused by some as a quota  But this characterization is not reassuring  because it cannot be reconciled with his attempt to eliminate the test  If he truly believed the proportionality test was lawful  the solution is not to eliminate it  but to improve compliance and understanding of the law    In short  his words now can t conceal his deeds as a member of the Title IX Commission  when he was actually in a position to do something to protect civil rights and prevent discrimination     Many civil rights organizations have expressed grave concerns about Mr  Griffith s statements concerning Title IX and it s implications for how he would interpret civil rights laws  His nomination is opposed by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights  the National Women s Law Center  the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund  the NAACP  and many other organizations dedicated to protecting civil rights  I ask unanimous consent to include in the record some of the letters the Committee has received from these organizations    Mr  Griffith s nomination also raises other troubling issues  I can t recall any other judicial nominees who failed to comply with the requirements of the bar association where they practiced law  or whose records raised such serious questions about whether they had been involved in the unauthorized practice of law  These are important issues that cannot be ignored or brushed aside  and they demonstrate a cavalier lack of respect for the law   Mr  Griffith allowed his membership in the D C  bar to lapse twice    not once  but twice    while he practiced law in the District of Columbia  and each time  he was suspended for failure to pay his dues  His second suspension was for three consecutive years  If that were his only problem  perhaps it would not be decisive  But what followed is a far more serious problem    He has practiced law in Utah since 2000 without joining the Utah bar  In May 2003  the Utah Bar formally advised him in writing to take the state bar exam  because he was practicing law as General Counsel for Brigham Young University  The law intern Mr  Griffith assigned to research the issue also advised him that under Utah law  it would be prudent for him to take the bar exam  Yet Mr  Griffith never took the exam  and his recent testimony before the Committee makes clear that he has no plans to do so    Utah law is very clear  Those who practice law in the state must join the state bar  Mr  Griffith admits that there is no exception in Utah law for those who practice law as general counsel to a university  He claims however  that he was not required to take the bar exam because he practiced law in close association with members of the Utah bar whom he supervised in the General Counsel s office     In making this claim  he relies on a letter written after he was nominated from five past presidents of the Utah bar  and on the May 2003 letter from the bar s General Counsel  Obviously  those letters can t alter the plain requirements of Utah statutes     More importantly  the letter from the Utah bar s general counsel in no way suggested that Mr  Griffith could practice law indefinitely without joining the bar  merely by associating with current bar members  Instead  it made absolutely clear that Utah has no general counsel exception rule allowing individuals who serve in such positions to actually practice law without licensure  and that he should take the Utah bar as soon as possible  The letter indicates that if he cannot avoid the practice of law as part of his duties  he must closely associate with someone who is actually licensed until he takes the bar  In no way does that letter imply that Mr  Griffith may practice law indefinitely in violation of Utah law    Mr  Griffith also gave a false answer  under oath  to the question on a Utah Bar application of whether he had ever been suspended as an attorney  Specifically  he denied under oath that he had ever been suspended B despite his two suspensions from the D C  Bar  In fact  he never disclosed his suspensions to the Utah bar before it appeared in the press  I asked Mr  Griffith whether he ever corrected the mis statement in his Utah bar application  He replied that he felt no need to do so  He also stated that he did not think the question about suspension referred to the type of suspension he had received  Is that the kind of legal reasoning we want in a federal judge    Some of Mr  Griffith s supporters ask us to ignore this issue as unimportant to the question of his confirmation  They urge us to disregard Mr  Griffith s repeated failure to comply with the rules of two different bars  But compliance with such rules should be a standard by which every lawyer is judged  especially those that seek to be federal judges     In other contexts  the Administration has treated the failure to maintain bar membership as a very serious matter  When the Justice Department discovered late last year that one of its lawyers had been suspended for failure to pay D C  bar dues  it took strong action    announcing that it would notify each court in which the attorney had filed an appearance during the period of his suspension  The Department is also considering whether the attorney should be fired or subject to other discipline    Given the importance of the D C  Circuit  Mr  Griffith s record on his efforts to rationalize his opposition to Title IX and his disregard of basic bar rules in Utah and the District of Columbia are extremely troubling  He should not be confirmed to a lifetime position on a federal court  and I urge the Committee to oppose his nomination   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
