         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Its an honor to be here with the Chiefs of Police to take this stand against the escalating gun violence in our communities  We all know what needs to be done and its a scandal that we have done so little for so long      We need to strengthen Brady Law background checks for gun purchases  especially for persons with mental illness     We need to close the gun show loophole once and for all      We need to renew the assault weapons ban      We need to pass Senator Feinsteins bill for stricter requirements on the sale of extremely dangerous fifty caliber sniper rifles     We need to amend federal law to ensure that all cop killer bullets are banned     The Chiefs compelling report and specific recommendations are a clear call to action  Without further delay  Congress and the Administration need to do our part by enacting concrete reforms that will reduce crime and protect the safety of police officers and all Americans     I commend the IACP for its outstanding leadership and for its impressive work in producing this ground breaking report  Im hopeful that we can work together  across party lines  to reduce gun violence  solve gun crimes  protect our police officers and do all that we can to make our communities safer           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
