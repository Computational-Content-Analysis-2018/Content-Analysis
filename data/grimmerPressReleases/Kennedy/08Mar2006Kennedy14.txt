         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   I commend our colleagues for all their work on this legislation and their commitment to strengthening pensions Millions of Americans are increasingly concerned about their retirement security  and rightly so  For years  each leg of the three legged stool of retirementprivate pensions  private savings  and Social Securityhas been sound  but that s no longer true  and the stool obviously needs repairs The personal savings rate has now fallen below zero  That s no surprise  when wages are stagnant and costs are soaring for basic necessities such as energy  housing  health care and education  The 40 million workers and retirees who rely on guaranteed defined benefit pensions need them now more than ever But the pension system is in trouble  too  In the past 5 years  700 pension plans have gone onto life support  and workers have lost  8 billion in pensions they earned by foregoing pay and other benefits Our Senate Pensions Committee and Finance Committee agreed on a bipartisan bill that passed with 97 votes  and I hope we can work together the same way in the conference  One key goal is to make sure that companies can keep their pension promises by requiring the money to be there to pay for them  Companies should contribute more money to single employer pensions in a fair and predictable way  without unfairly penalizing companies in cyclical industries like manufacturing  We don t want companies to drop their defined benefit plans  which would hurt the very workers and retirees we re trying to help We must also see that workers don t have to pay the price of company mismanagement or a poor economy  The issue is basic fairness  Employees have worked hard and given up other benefits to earn these pensions  In Enron  and Polaroid  and too many other cases  rank and file workers lost their pensions while executives walk off with millions of dollars Executives should be prevented from feathering their own retirement nests if workers  benefits are in jeopardy  If limits on new pension benefits are needed to protect pension plans  rank and file workers should not have their pensions capped while management pensions keep rising Workers and the public also deserve to know more about the financial state of pensions  They ve earned these pensions  and they deserve to know whether the funds are there to pay them  We need to see that this information is available  Long term financial solutions are important  but we also must address near term crises  In recent years hundreds of thousands of workers and retirees at steel and airline companies have lost their pensions in bankruptcy  and these failures have also placed huge strains on the federal pension insurance system  The Senate bill gives government the power to negotiate payment plans to prevent companies from dumping their pensions completely  I urge my colleagues to support this basic provision  Airline pensions are an example of the crisis  Hundreds of thousands of pilots  flight attendants and mechanics have lost their pensions  and the pensions of other employees are at risk  Appropriate relief will enable these companies to shift to the new rules and to protect the pensions that employees have worked so hard to earn Some multiemployer plans have had financial difficulties  too  because of poor stock market returns and a weak economy  The Senate and House bills will enable companies and employees to work together and agree on a plan to restore these plans to good financial health Hybrid pension plans  including cash balance plans  also have a growing role in our retirement system  But older workers can lose a large portion of their promised pensions when companies switch from traditional defined benefit pensions to these plans  The Senate bill provides transition protections to older workers  It also ensures that companies cannot erode benefits by requiring employees to work extra years for pensions they have already earned Another key protection of our pension laws is to prohibit conflicts of interest and self dealing by pension fund advisers  As Jack Javits  the father of ERISA  used to say  We should not relent  conflicts of interest are a very great evil Exceptions to these rules are risky  and I commend Senator Enzi for his leadership in this area  His expert knowledge of financial transactions was invaluable in writing fair language in the Senate bill that reflected the advice of experts in the industry  the Department of Labor  and the Securities and Exchange Commission Defined contribution plans also have an important pension role  We need to encourage workers to join these plans  and see that they receive good advice in investing for retirement  I support provisions to encourage companies to automatically enroll workers in these pensions  to automatically increase the amount they save over time  and to provide workers with the best advice  free from conflicts of interest  about their investment options We also need to prevent employers from overloading their pension plans with company stock  a problem whose consequences we saw so clearly with Enron and other cases  It s obvious we need new protections to help workers diversify their retirement savings Retirement security is also a critical issue for women  Senator Snowe and I developed language in the Senate bill to make pensions more responsive to the realities of women s lives and careers  and I hope it will be included in the final bill I m concerned as well about the cost of this legislation  The House bill contains  70 billion in tax cuts that are not in the Senate bill and are not paid for  With record deficits  they re difficult to justify  and I hope we can work out a satisfactory agreement Workers and their families rightly expect Congress to protect their pensions  Our responsibility is clear  and I hope we can meet it together   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
