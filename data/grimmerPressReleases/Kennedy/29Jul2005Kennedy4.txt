Documents   During John Roberts  term as Deputy Solicitor General  the Solicitor General s Office was involved hundreds of landmark cases affecting the rights of all Americans  Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have requested information on Judge Roberts  involvement in just 16 of the hundreds of cases the Solicitor General s office litigated while Judge Roberts served in a policy making role in the office  Each of these cases raises important issues about civil rights  and fundamental Constitutional principles  Americans deserve to know more about his views on these issues before the Senate decides whether to confirm him to the nation s most powerful court     A Handful of Cases Out of Hundreds     16 of 81   Less Than One Fifth of Roberts  Cases  Roberts signed the briefs in approximately 81 cases  78 of which were argued before the Supreme Court  The Democratic request represents well under one fifth of those cases in which he publicly participated      16 of 300   A Handful of Hundreds of Supreme Court Cases  The Solicitor General s office was involved in roughly 300 cases appealed to the Supreme Court  That would mean an average of 75 of those cases a year came through the Solicitor General s Office s  during the four years Mr  Roberts was there  Democratic members have asked for documents on only a handful of the cases in which he was not publicly named  Lucas v  SCCC  Lujan v  Defenders  Planned Parenthood v  Casey       Solicitor General Office Reviews Thousands of Cases  The Solicitor General s office opposes Supreme Court certiorari in more than 1 000 cases per year and makes decisions relevant to many hundreds of federal appeals each year  Of these more than 1 000 cases each year  a significant proportion crosses the desk of the Principal Deputy Solicitor General  The Democratic Committee request does not include any of these cases     Catalog of Cases   Board of Education of Oklahoma City v  Dowell  498 U S  237  1991   was an important school desegregation case in which John Roberts filed an amicus brief opposing efforts of African American families to pursue claims that their local schools would become re segregated     In Bray v  Alexandria Women s Health Clinic  506 U S  263  1993   John Roberts filed an amicus brief and participated in oral argument requesting that the Court hold that the obstruction of family planning clinics by anti abortion activists did not harm women because of their gender in violation of federal law     Franklin v  Gwinnett County School District  503 U S  60  1992   was a landmark case rejecting John Roberts  arguments to limit relief under Title IX for students who suffer even the most severe gender harassment  If accepted  his arguments would also have undermined other important civil rights prohibiting discrimination with federally funded programs  including Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act  prohibiting race and ethnic discrimination   Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  prohibiting disability discrimination   and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975  all which contain language nearly identical to that in Title IX    In Freeman v  Pitts  503 U S  467  1992   John Roberts filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to reverse a Court of Appeals ruling that required a Georgia school district to make further efforts to fully de segregate its public schools    In Herrera v  Collins  506 U S  390  1993   the Solicitor General s office filed a brief arguing that a Texas man could not seek relief in federal court based on his claim that new evidence showed he was actually innocent of the crime for which he had been sentenced to death    Lee v  Weisman  505 U S  577  1992  involved the question of whether a prayer by clergy selected by the public school at a graduation ceremony violates the principle that the government should not favor a particular religion    Lucas v  South Carolina Coastal Council  505 U S  1003  1992   the Solicitor General s office Office file a brief arguing that the state had taken petitioner s property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment when it passed building regulations which had the result of forbidding petitioner from building a permanent structure on his property  and that the state therefore must compensate him  John Roberts was not on the briefs    Lujan v  Defenders of Wildlife  504 U S  555  1992   is an important environmental case in which the Solicitor General argued to deny a citizen standing to challenge environmental harm  John Roberts was not on the briefs    In Lujan v  National Wildlife Federation  497 U S  871  1990   John Roberts argued as acting Solicitor General urging the Court to narrow citizens  ability to challenge unlawful land use decisions as harmful to the environment  John Roberts was on the brief and participated in oral argument    In Metro Broadcasting  Inc  v  Federal Communications Commission  497 U S  547  1990   as acting Solicitor General  John Roberts filed a brief contrary to the position taken by the FCC  in which he unsuccessfully attacked the FCC s affirmative action program with regard applications for new broadcast licenses     Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v  Casey  505 U S  833  1992   is a landmark case holding that the constitutional right to privacy regarding reproductive decisions prevents the state from requiring women to notify their husbands before deciding to have an abortion  The Solicitor General s office filed a brief in the case that urged the Court to overturn Roe v  Wade  John Roberts was not on the brief    Rust v  Sullivan  500 U S  173  1991   upheld the validity of an abortion gag rule regulation under the First Amendment  and did not directly involve Roe v  Wade  The Solicitor General s brief in the case  which Roberts co authored  not only argued to uphold the regulations  but also urged the Court to reverse Roe     Saudi Arabia v  Nelson  507 U S  349  1993   SG filed an amicus brief arguing that the Saudi Arabia should be immune from suit by an American who claimed he was recruited to work for the kingdom and then imprisoned and tortured  Roberts was on the brief    Suter v  Artist M  503 U S  347  1992   In a very important case concerning when a citizen s right to sue can be implied from a statute  the SG s office filed an amicus urging the Court to interpret an Adoption Assistance statute narrowly so as to preclude abused children from suing the states for failing to take reasonable actions to ensure that foster children are reunified with their natural families where possible  John Roberts was on the brief and participated in oral argument    Voinovich v  Quilter  507 U S  146  1993   a key Voting Rights Act case in which the Solicitor General filed a brief opposing claims by minority voters in Ohio  John Roberts co authored the Solicitor General s brief    Withrow v  Williams  507 U S  680  1993   was a key case in which the Solicitor General s office urged the Court to severely curtail Miranda rights by ruling that federal courts may not entertain Miranda claims in habeas corpus petitions filed by state prisoners  John Roberts was on the brief and participated in oral argument                 Past Nominees Have Been Forthcoming With Their Records   There is ample precedent of the Senate Judiciary Committee requesting and receiving

Including SG Documents  Produced for Bork Nomination     During the consideration of the nomination of Judge Robert H  Bork to the Supreme Court  in response to an extensive and detailed document request from the Judiciary Committee  the Department of Justice turned over a variety of types of documents in at least three separate transmissions       Over a period of more than three weeks  the Department conducted extensive searches in its archives and the archives of former President Nixon in order to produce documents directly responsive to the Committee s requests       Assistant

withheld and why      Among the documents produced by the Justice Department to the Judiciary Committee were internal memoranda and non public material related to Bork s work in the Solicitor General s office  While much of the material was returned to the Department after the nomination was defeated  some of the documents remain in Senate archives and even in the Bork hearing transcript
