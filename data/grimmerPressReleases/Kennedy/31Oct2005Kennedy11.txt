         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Last night the nation paused to pay tribute to Rosa Parks  whose life and dedication to equal opportunity for each and every American will be forever written in the heart and souls of the nation and in the pages of our history  The light that shone in the Capitol last night cast its beams across the country  The tears of the Parks  family were the tears of a nation that will remain eternally in the debt to this great woman who became a profile in courage for our time and all time   When Rosa Parks sat down half a century ago  America stood up  Her quiet fight for equality sounded the bells of freedom for millions and awakened the moral conscience of the nation  We will always remember that great December  when Rosa Parks sat alone  so that others could sit together   Her later life continued to show her quiet moral resolve and her firm dedication to do what is right  Now  she belongs to the ages  Her courage  dignity  and determination symbolize the best traditions of America  the still  small voice of deep patriotism that challenges any and all of us whenever we fail to live up to the highest ideals of our society  I can hear her say  I have fought the good fight  I have finished the race  I have kept the faith   Now  it is we who must keep that faith    a faith in a new tomorrow where all men and woman have the equal opportunity that is still too long denied to too many in our society   Today  as we mourn her passing  and are reminded of how much has been accomplished as a result of her sacrifice  we know the nation still has much work to do to fully live up to its ideals of equality and justice for all   As Robert Kennedy said  each time a person stands up for an ideal  or acts to improve the lot of others  or strikes out against injustice  they send forth a tiny ripple of hope  and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance  The ripples of hope sent out by Rosa Parks did that  They created a mighty current  She too was our Shepherd  She restored our soul  She led us in the paths of righteousness  She walked through the valley of the shadow of death  but she feared no evil  because she knew the Lord was with her  Goodness and mercy followed her all the days of her life  and now she dwells in the house of the Lord forever   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
