         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   BOSTON  MA Senator Edward M  Kennedy today discussed the critical choices that we face in a global economy and in Iraq  as well as the skyrocketing costs of college tuition at the annual Luncheon of the South Shore Chamber of Commerce  Senator Kennedy praised the important leadership the Chamber provides to the South Shore and its commitment to innovations in the business community    In Massachusetts  we see many positive economic signs  but signs of concern as well  At a time when our nation is surging past the 300 million mark  our state  home to the finest educational institutions  hospitals  and a dynamic entrepreneurial class  is losing population  Young families find themselves priced out of our communities and young companies look beyond our states borders  This trend cannot continue without serious implications for the state we all love so much  We need to invest in our communities and we need to champion policies that help our employees and our students reach their full potential  said Senator Kennedy    Kennedy also discussed the challenges that we face abroad  We must find a way to end this war and bring our fighting men and women home with the heros welcome they deserve  so that we can focus our military efforts on the real threats we face  said Senator Kennedy  Our troops have given all that any of us can ask  and its essential that we work together for a foreign policy worthy of their great sacrifice   The Chambers luncheon is held annually to honor volunteers for their efforts to further economic growth within Massachusetts  The South Shore Chamber of Commerce has members from 2 500 businesses  making it the second largest chamber of commerce in the New England  The Chamber is committed to working along side legislators in protecting the interests of the business community  as well as providing funding and counseling to new and expanding companies   Remarks of Senator Edward M  Kennedy South Shore Chamber of Commerce October 25  2006   As Prepared for delivery       Its always a privilege to be with the Chamber  and I commend you for all you do so well to keep the South Shore economy strong and to support our communities  Your vision and dedication to providing good jobs for our citizens and better communities for our families have made a difference  and were grateful for the many things you do every day to make that vision a reality     As we all know  we live in a time of extraordinary challenge for our country and our Commonwealth  Were tied down in a tragic and misguided war in Iraq  The war in Afghanistan is gong badly as well  We face the specter of growing threats of terrorist attacks  and an Iran and North Korea with nuclear weapons    Here at home  the idea of the American dream  that if you work hard and play by the rules you can leave a stronger future for your children  is under increasing strain     In Massachusetts  we see many positive economic signs  but signs of concern as well  At a time when our nation is surging past the 300 million mark  our state  home to the finest educational institutions  hospitals  and a dynamic entrepreneurial class  is losing population  Young families find themselves priced out of our communities and young companies look beyond our states borders  This trend cannot continue without serious implications for the state we all love so much    Without question  these are daunting challenges for the next Governor  and the next Congress too  We may not have all the answers  but weve shown time and again throughout our history that we have the capacity to overcome great obstacles if we have the will to try    President Roosevelt didnt have all the answers to pull us out of the Great Depression  and later presidents didnt have a blueprint to prevent Western Europe from descending into chaos and communism after World War II    But what they did have was Americans of all political parties willing to pull together for the good of the country  And after the past six traumatic years  thats what we must also do as well    I think of my brother Jacks generation  the greatest generation  the men and women who came back from World War II determined to make a difference for their country  and they did    They tackled Jim Crow with the Civil Rights Acts and the Voting Rights Act  and sought to end discrimination on the basis of gender  ethnic background  or physical handicap    They gave tens of millions of our senior citizens better health through Medicare  and they created Medicaid to make sure that the poorest among us would not be without decent care    They kept us safe in the world and signed the first nuclear arms treaties to prevent global war    And they even found the time to send a man to the moon    Inspired by those examples  we know we have the capacity to address the challenges that confront us today    Abroad  we must find a way to end this war and bring our fighting men and women home with the heros welcome they deserve  so that we can focus our military efforts on the real threats we face  Our troops have given all that any of us can ask  and its essential that we work together for a foreign policy worthy of their great sacrifice    We must engage directly with North Korea to prevent the unthinkable  The idea that we could sit back and farm out our national security interest to other nations has been a tragic mistake  and we cant afford it any longer    Above all  we must recognize that our ability to protect our interests and our country is very much dependent on our ability to work with our allies  Weve strained too many relationships abroad  and its long past time to start repairing them and regain our respect in the world    Here at home  we must recognize the growing squeeze on the middle class that threatens the idea of social mobility that has made the nation a beacon of hope and opportunity for so long    The economic fundamentals in our state are good  We have the best educated workforce in the nation  40  of our workers have a bachelors degree or higher  In the past year alone  the Boston Cambridge Quincy area has gained more than 22 000 jobs  including 9 000 in professional services and 8 000 in higher education and health care    Another leading indicator is very positive  the ability of companies in our state to compete for  and win  competitive small business innovative research grants  In the past five years  Massachusetts companies have received 3 900 such grants  worth a total of over 1 billion dollars  more than any other state except California  which has six times as many people as we do  Those grants in turn brought nearly 8 billion dollars in business investment to the Commonwealth  Since we created SBIR in 1982  Massachusetts has always been at the top  and we intend to keep it there    We see signs of encouragement in our local communities too  Unemployment in Quincy is down from 5 9  in 2003 to 4 5  today  and hopefully on its way further down to the 3 5  level we had in 2001  In Canton  its 4 1  today  down from 4 9  in 2003  and on its way back to the 3 0  we had in 2001  Weymouths on the right track too  unemployment is down from 5 8  three years ago to 4 8  today and we hope to get back to the 3 3  number we had in 2001    These positive signs  however  dont show the difficulties facing our middle class and the traditional good jobs weve relied on as the bedrock of our economy in recent decades  Weymouth has lost 38  of its manufacturing jobs in the past five years  Canton 28   and Quincy 25     Our working families also confront a cost squeeze thats undermining their aspirations  Housing costs are up 62   gas 49   health care 27  since 2001    Staggering health bills are the single biggest contributing factor to the personal bankruptcies soaring among Massachusetts families  Last year there were 27 000 filings in the Commonwealth  an increase of 51  since 2001    The rollback of overtime has stripped 198 000 Massachusetts workers of their overtime pay     Nationally  these factors are contributing to a growing gap between those at the top of the economic ladder and everyone else  a gap thats more pronounced here in Massachusetts than in all but two other states  Its pricing families out of their communities  a particularly important problem here on the South Shore    Adding to this squeeze is the growing crisis in providing genuine educational opportunity for all our families    No other state in the country has a more impressive history on public education  It was written into our constitution from the beginning    No other states economic well being is more closely tied to educational attainment  And no state has more to gain or lose in this new century of the life sciences  where the very best jobs will be landed by those who do well in the classroom    Globalization presents a huge challenge as well  As New York Times writer Tom Friedman has said  the world has become flat again  India and China are clearly challenging our economic leadership  and theyre focusing on math and science achievement     President Ken Quigley at Curry College understands the issue  Hes doing an extraordinary job giving young people the skills they need to compete  But as a state and a nation were not doing all we can to make certain that our children have the skills they need to succeed in this new world    Much of the problem is federal  the No Child Left Behind Act has never been fully funded  As a result  Massachusetts schools are short  180 million owed them by the federal government  and that shortfall has left more than 54 000 children behind across our state    Were going to change that after November  because we have to     In the last six years alone  the cost of attending Massachusetts public four year institutions has soared 49     from  9 000 to  13 000  and the cost of attending a private four year college has risen 24     from  29 000 to  35 000    Today the average Massachusetts student graduating from college is saddled with  18 000 in debt  and that huge burden undermines their ability to go on to graduate school  or to start their own businesses    The Pell Grant  which 78 000 Massachusetts students rely on each year  has not been increased in five years  It remains stuck at  4 050  despite repeated attempts to increase it to  4 500 and beyond    How do we turn around these trends that are threatening the economic future and quality of life in our Commonwealth   I think we start by focusing on the fundamentals  We need to invest in our communities and we need to champion policies that help our employees and our students reach their full potential   Locally  one project of enormous importance is the redevelopment of the South Weymouth Naval Air Station  which Mayor Madden has worked extraordinarily hard on with the South Shore Tri Town Development Corporation    Its an enormous opportunity for the region  one that we wont likely see again  to build the housing we need in a way that promotes smart growth principles and attracts outside investment  Its been a long time coming and its required the hard work of many people  but its going to pay off in a big way  Its been a privilege to work with Mayor Madden and the Development Corporation on the improvements in public transportation we need to make this vital project a success   We also need to deal with the congestion clogging the region  reducing housing options for commuters  and sending home prices through the roof  Its good news that the Greenbush Line is moving forward  after so much effective work by the Chamber  and Im delighted we were able to obtain record funds for Massachusetts roads and commuter rail lines in the federal transportation bill last year  Its a solid foundation to build on for the years ahead    Massachusetts needs to start thinking of our roads and transit systems as assets  not just budget costs  We need to invest in them if we hope to have real economic progress in the state  Route 3 needs to be widened  and putting it off isnt going to make it any less expensive   On education  the issue is straightforward  we can give our students the support they need to compete  or we can watch our competitiveness decline    Increasing the Pell Grant from  4 000 to  5 000 would bring in  63 million a year in additional assistance to Massachusetts families right away  and help slow the exploding costs of higher education   We also need to reform the student loan programs  which now serve lenders far more than they serve students  By creating a level playing field in Washington for direct student loans  we could save 13 billion federal dollars a year that could be used to increase student aid  Wed have to take on Sallie Mae and Company  but its a fight we need to make    The challenges ahead are great  to make our country safer and build a stronger future for our state economy and for all our people  But theres no reason we cant summon the will to do it and get it done  and hopefully  November 7 will give us the new momentum we need   Again  its a privilege to join all of you today  The South Shore Chamber is one of the most effective and committed Chambers in the country  and Im grateful to work with you on these challenges  I thank all of you for this opportunity and I look forward to standing with you in all the major battles ahead        Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley   617  565 4472
