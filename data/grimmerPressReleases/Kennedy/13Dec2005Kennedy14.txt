         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on LIHEAP funding    America can do better than the Republican budget plan in which billions of dollars will go from programs that assist low income families and senior citizens into the pockets of the already wealthy    Time and time again  Democrats have voted overwhelmingly to increase funds for LIHEAP  the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program   and time and time again  our Republican colleagues have voted no  Now  the House bill contains  1 billion in additional funds  and while it s a step in the right direction it s just not enough  The United States Senate should follow suit and provide more money for America s low income families and seniors    The maximum benefit level in Massachusetts right now is only  765 for the heating season  for a household at 100 percent of the poverty level enough for only about one tank of oil  It takes at least two to four tanks to make it through the winter  We can and must do more for those families struggling to make ends meet    Today  Senator Reed  Senator Snowe  Senator Collins  and I will offer a motion to instruct conferees to fully fund LIHEAP at its authorized level of  5 1 billion  Under this plan  Massachusetts will receive  158 million almost double what the House bill would provide    It s time for the poor and vulnerable in our society to start receiving a little of the favored treatment that Republicans lavish on the wealthy and privileged    FACT SHEET ON ENERGY COSTS AND LIHEAP     MASSACHUSETTS   In Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves approximately 134 000 households between 14 000 and 15 000 in Boston    And the need for LIHEAP is increasing  In November  Patsy Lewis  the Executive Director of the Worcester Community Action Council  reported that they had 3 500 households eligible for LIHEAP assistance  That s up from last November when the number was 2 500  Starting November 1st  in only four days the Council had 480 applications they typically receive 350 applications in a month  This was their busiest start up ever  It s clear that awareness and need for the program is increasing    The maximum benefit for Massachusetts is only  765 for the heating season  for a household at 100 percent of the poverty level enough for only about one tank of oil for the winter    In Massachusetts  the average price of heating oil     which nearly 40 percent of households use to heat their homes     is  2 39 a 20 percent increase from last years average of  1 87 FACT SHEET ENERGY COSTS AND LIHEAP    NATIONAL OUTLOOK   According to the Energy Information Administration  on average  households heating primarily with natural gas likely will spend  281  38 percent  more for fuel this winter than last winter  Households heating primarily with heating oil can expect to pay   255  21 percent  more this winter than last  Households heating primarily with propane can expect to pay  on average   167  15 percent  more this winter than last  Households heating primarily with electricity can expect to pay  on average   46  7 percent  more    Federal funding for the LIHEAP program has been stagnant for over a decade  If you adjust for inflation  the purchasing power of LIHEAP funding this year is only a little over half of what it was in 1982   Which amounts to a cut of  1 6 billion        The number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance has increased from 4 2 million in FY02 to close to 5 million this year  the highest level in 10 years  Yet  the program only serves about 15 6 percent of eligible recipients      33 million households are eligible for LIHEAP assistance  Combined  these houses will spend nearly  55 billion  compared to the  2 billion available for LIHEAP    94 percent of household served by LIHEAP funds have at least one member who is elderly  disabled  a child under 18  or has a single adult living with one or more children    The average LIHEAP household has an income of less than  10 000    Households in poverty will owe an average of 25  of their entire annual income for their energy bills    At the projected level of family expenditures needed to keep LIHEAP eligible homes normally warm or cool with their essential appliances running  an average of about  1936 in FY06   the 2005 LIHEAP average benefit of  318 would cover less than 15 percent of the average bill    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
