         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for scheduling today s committee meeting  and I commend you for the thoughtful way the committee has handled Dr  Crawford s nomination to be Commissioner Modern drugs  vaccines and medical devices can work miracles    but only if FDA does its job to see that they re safe and effective  We use food and food products from around the world    and we count on FDA to see that they re not contaminated  FDA needs an effective commissioner to meet these challenges For three of the last four years  however  the Administration has left the FDA with only an acting commissioner  It s high time FDA has a full fledged commissioner  and I intend to support Dr  Crawford s nomination  He s trained as both a veterinarian and pharmacologist  and has many years of experience in government  industry  and the academic world  His impressive record and clear commitment to public health will serve the agency well I look forward to working with Dr  Crawford on the major challenges the agency faces  We need to improve drug safety and monitoring adverse events that occur after drug approvals  FDA needs the authority to require better labels and insist on clinical trials of drugs already on the market    not just request them  We also need to invest in information technology  to learn more quickly when new drugs have unanticipated safety risks  We should also prevent the corrupting effects of conflicts of interest on advisory committees  Above all  FDA needs enough resources to do its job effectively  I intend to work with Dr  Crawford to see that FDA and Congress address these serious needs We must also work quickly to resolve the pending application to make Plan B for emergency contraception available over the counter for women age 16 and above  FDA s own reviewers said Plan B should be approved for over the counter sale  Its scientific advisory committee recommended the same thing  Major professional organizations with expertise in this area all urged its approval  because the evidence proves that the drug is safe and effective  The facts are clear  Plan B is safe and effective  The deadline for acting on Plan B was five months ago  It s time for the Bush Administration to put aside politics  put women and families first  and stop ignoring the deadline for action On so many issues under this Administration    from stem cell research to climate change    the lifesaving power of solid science and need to protect public health takes a back seat to politics In recent days  we ve seen glaring examples of this trend  Last week  the Administration took a dive on seeking a meaningful settlement in its action against the tobacco companies  Today  it was reported that the Administration official who whitewashed the report on climate change will soon be in the pay of a major oil company And now FDA shouldn t drop the ball  too  Each day  4000 kids take their first smoke  Half end up addicted  No parent says  I hope my child grows up to be a smoker   So FDA should support the legislation that Senator DeWine and I have introduced to ban efforts by tobacco companies to encourage children to smoke Dr  Crawford has the background and qualifications to address these issues  As a scientist  he recognizes that science is nothing if it lacks integrity  He understands that science loses its power to heal  to inform  to improve lives if the facts are ignored at the whim of politics I support his confirmation  and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
