         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  From our earliest days as a nation  education has been the mainstay of our democracy and the engine of the American dream  Our nations founders knew that an educated citizenry would strengthen our land and build up the values and character that make us Americans  They invested in education because they looked to the future and saw an even greater America over the glowing horizon We looked forward when we passed the GI bill  And it allowed service men and women coming back from the Second World War to get a college education  They became the Greatest Generation  The GI bill produced 67 000 doctors  91 000 scientists  238 000 teachers  and 450 000 engineers  It funded the education of three Presidents  three Supreme Court Justices and about a dozen Senators who served in this very chamber  That is the kind of vision we have had in America when it comes to education  And it is our vision today as we reclaim our destiny and invest once again in the next generation In these past few days  we have made a new promise to American students and families  a promise to invest more as a nation to ensure that all of our young people  regardless of background  get the education they deserve and the training they need to succeed in todays global economy  We have pledged here in the United States Senate that it doesnt matter where youre from  What matters is where youre going  And no American should be denied the right to go to college because of money Last week  we showed this commitment again when we made another new promise to students  providing them with the largest new investment in student aid since the GI bill  We increased the Pell Grant by more than  1 000  We provided relief for student loans by saying your monthly payments will never exceed 15 percent of your monthly income  We said if you become a teacher  a firefighter or enter other public service jobs  your loans will be forgiven after ten years The bill before us brings about other key reforms that will make college more affordable to young Americans Our legislation will take steps to ensure that the student loan system is working in the best interest of students  by pursuing needed ethics reforms in the student loan industry   It will simplify the federal financial aid application and delivery process  to ensure that a complex system does not work as a barrier to access for low income students   It demands that colleges do their part to keep college costs down  if we do our part to provide needed student aid  they must do their part to keep their tuition and fees reasonable    And it will reform and improve our teacher preparation system  Teachers are the backbone of our K 12 educational system  and this bill will promote high quality teacher preparation programs  and help recruit and retain high quality teachers in high need schools I would like to thank all of my colleagues on the Committee for the work they put into this legislation  I especially thank Senator Mike Enzi  our Ranking Member  for all of his leadership on this bipartisan legislation And I would like all of the staff who worked so hard over the past few months to make this happen  This legislation received unanimous bipartisan support in Committee  and I hope to see that same broad support today  We know education is the real key to opportunity  This legislation reflects that knowledge  It is a commitment I believe we must make to ensure educational opportunity to each and every young person in this country  I urge the Senate to approve this important legislation  Our students deserve nothing less      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
