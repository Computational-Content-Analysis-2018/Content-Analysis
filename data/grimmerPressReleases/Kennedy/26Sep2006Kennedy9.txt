         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the declassified sections of the NIE   The declassified sections of the National Intelligence Estimate prove plain and simple that the war in Iraq and the Administrations failed policies have made us less safe  The report finds that Iraq conflict has become the cause celebre for jihadists around the world  It is no wonder the Administration is responding to this devastating report with worn out attacks and clichs  But as John Adams said  facts are stubborn things  and these latest are a clarion call that we need a new direction in Iraq    Given all of the statements that President Bush and Vice President Cheney have made that are completely at odds with the findings of 16 agencies in the intelligence communities  the American people should be asking  Did the President read this report when it was issued  Did he intentionally mislead us about our safety  Or is he simply ignoring the intelligence community    The American people deserve answers to these questions  and they deserve the full story     not those parts of the report that the Bush Administration selects    Facts  On September 7  President Bush said  We ve learned the lessons of 9 11We ve gone on the offense against our enemies  and transformed former adversaries into allies  We have put in place the institutions needed to win this war  Five years after September the 11th  2001  America is safer    and America is winning the war on terror   On September 11  President Bush said  Saddam s regime posed a risk that the world could not afford to take  The world is safer because Saddam Hussein is no longer in power   Despite the conclusion of the intelligence community five months earlier that new threats are emerging because of the war in Iraq  Vice President Cheney said the exact opposite on September 10  He said  We are better off there because of what we ve done to date  We are less likely to have a threat emerge against the United States from that corner of the world than would have been the case if Saddam were still there     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
