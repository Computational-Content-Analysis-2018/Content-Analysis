         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     It is a privilege to join my colleagues in introducing this bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act and increase the opportunities for workers to obtain the services and training they need to hold good jobs in the years ahead    This bill strengthens the current One Stop system we established in 1998  so that many more people can be served  The bill creates stronger partnerships with businesses to recruit new workers  collaborate in training current workers  improve career ladder opportunities  and work with local leaders to meet the changing needs of their community     The One Stop system is needed more than ever now  to serve hard working Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own as we struggle to rebuild our economy and adjust to the new century and the globalization forces that are transforming our society and our workforce  Current employees  especially the growing number of manufacturing workers  need effective training to be eligible for the available jobs in their area    We have also worked to remove the sequencing of services for persons entering the workforce who face barriers to employment  Providers can move adults directly to skills training  or create training programs that include literacy and language skills as well  so that job training is not delayed    The bill also encourages local providers to continue the training programs until employees can be self sufficient  For those who start on the minimum wage  the support system should be there to help them qualify for the better paying jobs that will enable them to support their families  Some men and women may obtain their first job through the system  and continue to participate as they move up their career ladders    The bill will also help young people  Last summer  the youth unemployment rate rose to 17  and we were all acutely aware of the special challenges that young workers face in this economy  The youth program will continue to work with both in school and out of school young men and women to help them obtain the education and the real job experience they need to be competitive    The bill pays particular attention to the needs of people with disabilities  Their access to the program is essential if the system is to be truly universal  It s unacceptable today that hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities are unable to find employment  Workforce training programs must coordinate with vocational rehabilitation programs to provide many more opportunities for those with physical and mental challenges    For over thirty years  since the Vocational Rehabilitation Act was first enacted in 1973  state vocational rehabilitation programs have brought new hope to individuals with disabilities throughout the country  so that they can reach their full potential and actively participate in their communities     Through vocational rehabilitation  individuals with disabilities can obtain the training  counseling  support and job opportunities they need in order to have independent  productive  and fulfilling lives  For millions of these Americans  vocational rehabilitation is the difference between dependence and independence  between lost potential and a productive career     In 1998  vocational rehabilitation became part of the state wide workforce system in each state  This reauthorization will strengthen that partnership  so that many more working age individuals with disabilities  even those with the most significant challenges  have realistic opportunities to obtain the services and support they need to reach their employment goals     The legislation also strengthens other aspects of independent living  so that students and adults with disabilities can receive the services and support they need for community based living     Our goal in this reauthorization is to see that the talents and strengths of all individuals with disabilities are recognized  enhanced  and fairly rewarded in communities and workplaces across the nation     The bill also contains the Adult Literacy Act  which funds critical programs for states to assist adults in obtaining the basic reading  writing  numeracy and English language skills that they need to be full participants in the workplace and in society     We all know that education is the great equalizer  Improving basic literacy is a key component of job training  Large numbers of persons are on waiting lists across the country to be served under this program    25 000 people in Massachusetts alone    and we need to do more to serve adults who recognize their need to improve these skills in order to improve their lives    I commend my colleagues and the many organizations representing governors  mayors  county officials  youth  women  and low income persons who were so actively involved in preparing this legislation  We have tried to listen carefully to the many leaders who have practical experience in implementing these laws    I look forward to continuing this bipartisan effort and to the early enactment of this needed legislation      Laura Capps  Melissa
