         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washington  DCToday Senators Kennedy  Baucus   Rockefeller  Stabenow  Menendez  Brown  and Casey called on the Senate to  provide up to  50 billion for the reauthorization of the State Childrens Health  Insurance Program  SCHIP   far exceeding the inadequate funding level proposed  by the President  The additional funds will not only maintain coverage for the  millions of children already enrolled in the program  but also expand health  care coverage to the six million children that are eligible for SCHIP or  Medicaid who are not yet enrolled in the program  SCHIP is even more  important today than it was when it began  More and more families are  struggling to make ends meet as their wages are not keeping up with inflation or  housing costs or rising health costs  More and more employers are struggling to  offer health coverage to workers and their families  and many workers offered  coverage cant afford it  Senator Kennedy said  Theres a reason why the  program has such support from our Democratic Congress and from Governors and  families across the nation  Its based on the powerful idea  that all children  deserve a healthy start in life Millions of low income children are  currently insured by the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP    This bipartisan  successful program has become a critical component of our  country s safety net by providing health coverage to uninsured Americans  With  more than 46 million Americans without health insurance  Democrats believe the  Senate must act urgently to give vital health care coverage to our country s  children  Below are Senator Kennedys remarks  as prepared for  delivery     REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDYCHILDRENS  HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM As Prepared for Delivery      Federal Budgets are statements of our  national priorities  and were proud to say that the budget before the Senate  this week puts children and working families first  Unlike the budgets of the  last few years that emphasized tax breaks for the wealthy  this budget expands  education and health care for children  One of its most important provisions is   50 billion in additional funds for the Childrens Health Insurance Program over  the next five years Theres a reason why the program has such support  from our Democratic Congress and from Governors and families across the nation   Its based on the powerful idea  that all children deserve a healthy start in  life  It means that millions of working families across the country can take  their children to a doctor when theyre sick without worrying whether they can  afford to CHIP is a promise to working families of health  coverage for their children  Its meant health care for millions of children  each year  who can now see a doctor to treat for an earache  for asthma  or for  any other illness or injury  Its meant the difference between a child  discouraged by disease  or a child healthy and ready to learn and  grow CHIP is even more important today than it was when it  began  More and more families are struggling to make ends meet as their wages  are not keeping up with inflation or housing costs or rising health costs  More  and more employers are struggling to offer health coverage to workers and their  families  and many workers offered coverage cant afford  it The result is that employer coverage has been dropping  and the number of adults who are uninsured has been soaring over the past  decade  But because of CHIP  the number of uninsured children has actually  declined by one third during the same time  CHIPs helping  hand  however  is out of reach for many families  9 million children still lack  health coverage  even though two thirds of them  6 million  are eligible under  CHIP or Medicaid  We must do more to get these children enrolled  through better  outreach and by simplifying the enrollment process  The  Administrations budget is an embarrassment  It provides less than half the  funds needed just to maintain CHIP at its current spending level  let alone  enroll more children  Since health costs are rising  level funding means a cut   Hundreds of thousands of children will lose their coverage under the  Administrations budget  Nothing better demonstrates why a Democrat Congress can  make such a big difference  Instead of rubber stamping a cut in CHIP  our budget  provides the funds needed to cover millions more children who need health care  and cant afford it today  No parent should be faced with a decision like that   and our budget makes sure they  wont       Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202 224 2633
