         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Mr  President  the American people have heard a great deal this week about intelligence estimates on Iraq    Yesterday  we learned that members of the Senate Armed Services Committee have not received 10 classified intelligence reports on Iraq produced by the National Intelligence Council since 2004    Its simply not possible for the Armed Services Committee or the Congress to adequately execute our oversight responsibilities without the benefit of all relevant documents from the intelligence community   At best  this is a bureaucratic oversight that should be corrected immediately  At worst  it represents a coordinated effort to deny Congress access to any sensitive documents that question the Presidents policy on Iraq   I know that the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee have requested those documents  and we look forward to receiving them in the very near future   Mr  President  earlier today  the Senate approved the conference agreement on the DoD Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007  I welcome the decision of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee conferees to support the Senates request for a new National Intelligence Estimate on conditions Iraq    The American people were shocked to learn last weekend about an assessment from the intelligence community which unequivocally concluded that the war in Iraq is creating a new generation of terrorists  It was especially shocking  given the Administrations repeated insistence that we are winning the war on terror and that America is safer because of the war in Iraq  That five month old assessment addressed the impact of the Iraq war on the global threat of terrorism  outside of Iraqs borders   But what about Iraq itself  What is the collective assessment of the intelligence community about the prospects for success in Iraq versus the likelihood of full scale civil war  The President insists that we are winning in Iraq  but remarkably  the intelligence community has not prepared a National Intelligence Estimate on conditions inside Iraq for more than two years  That must change    America is in deep trouble in Iraq  and its mystifying that an Intelligence Estimate focusing on the internal situation in Iraq has not been prepared since July 2004  We know that the President is determined to convince the American people that we are winning the war and that America is safer  but what does the intelligence community believe  The recent revelations about the April 6 Estimate underscore the value and importance of obtaining the collective wisdom of the intelligence community to inform our policy judgments and to ensure that the American people have the facts  not just the political spin of the White House    Stopping the slide into full scale civil war is our greatest challenge and highest priority in Iraq  The continuing violence and death is ominous  The UN reports that more than 6 500 civilians were killed in July and August alone  Militias are growing in strength and continue to operate outside the law  Death squads are rampant  Reports of torture in official detention centers remain widespread  Kidnappings are on the rise  and so are the numbers of Iraqis fleeing the violence   More than 140 000 American troops are on the ground  Its essential that we obtain  and obtain soon    a candid and comprehensive assessment from the intelligence community on whether Iraq is in or is descending into civil war and what can be done to stop the sectarian violence that is spiraling out of control   The stakes are enormously high for our troops and our national security  and completing a new NIE on Iraq should be one of Director Negropontes highest priorities    After our Senate amendment requiring a new Estimate was approved to this bill on August 3  Director Negroponte agreed to ask the intelligence community to prepare it    Certainly nobody has an interest in unnecessarily rushing the intelligence community  But it has been more than two years since an NIE on Iraq was prepared  and thats too long  It has been nearly two months since Mr  Negroponte announced his decision to ask the intelligence community to prepare a new assessment  yet the the first step  determining the scope of the issues to be covered    is still not finished    With Iraq on the brink of a full scale civil war  preparation of this intelligence assessment cannot be slow walked any longer  With more than 140 000 Americans under fire every hour of every day in Iraq  its wrong to delay this assessment  For the sake of our men and women in uniform  the intelligence community must move forward  and it must move forward soon    Yesterday I sent a letter to Mr  Negroponte with Senators Rockefeller Biden  Levin  Reid  and Reed urging him to move forward and indicating that preparation and completion of this intelligence assessment cannot be delayed any longer  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of our letter be included in the Record    As the intelligence community finalizes the terms of reference for the new Iraq National Intelligence Estimate  Mr  Negroponte should be mindful of the specific provisions in this conference agreement  which urge him to follow the parameters set out in the Senate amendment to this bill  Under the amendment  the following issues would be included in the new National Intelligence Estimate in Iraq    The prospects for controlling severe sectarian violence that could lead to civil war   The prospects for reconciling Iraqs ethic  religious  and tribal divisions   An assessment of the extent to which militias are providing security and the extent to which the Government of Iraq has developed and implemented a credible plan to disarm  demobilize  and reintegrate the militias into the government security forces and is working to obtain a political commitment to ban militias    An assessment of whether Iraq is succeeding in creating a stable and effective unity government  and the likelihood that the government will address the concerns of the Sunni community  and  The prospects for economic reconstruction and the impact it will have on security and stability    Its obviously important that we obtain an open and honest assessment from the intelligence community  particularly on the question of civil war  and my colleagues and I look forward to such an assessment  It is also our view that an unclassified summary  consistent with the protection of sources and methods  should be made available when the estimate is completed    We continue to believe the National Intelligence Estimate should be as thorough and comprehensive as possible  To this end  we would also benefit significantly by having it include the following areas   An assessment addressing the threat from violent extremist related terrorism  including al Qaeda  in and from Iraq  including the extent to which terrorist actions in Iraq are targeted at the United States presence there and the likelihood that terrorist groups operating in Iraq will target U S  interests outside Iraq   An assessment of whether  and in what ways  the large scale presence of multinational forces in Iraq helps or hinders the prospects for success in Iraq   A description of the optimistic  most likely  and pessimistic scenarios for the stability of Iraq through 2007  and  An assessment of the extent to which the situation in Iraq is affecting our relations with Iran  Saudi Arabia  Turkey  and other countries in the region     The war in Iraq continues to be an immense strategic blunder for our country  and having the most thorough and comprehensive National Intelligence Estimate possible will greatly inform the ongoing debate about our options for the future   A new National Intelligence Estimate is long over due  As John Adams said  Facts are stubborn things  It is abundantly clear that the facts matter on Iraq  They mattered before the war and during the war  and they matter now  as we try to deal effectively with the continuing quagmire  I look forward to obtaining the new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq and to obtaining it soon
