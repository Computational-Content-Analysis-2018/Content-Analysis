         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  DC  Today  Senators Kennedy  Rockefeller  Biden  Levin  Reid  and Reed wrote a letter to the Director of National Intelligence urging him to move forward on the National Intelligence Report on Iraq that is long over due  The last time the NIE on Iraq was updated was in 2004  yet much has changed in the security  economy and political stability of Iraq  On August 3  Kennedys amendment passed the Senate unanimously requiring Negroponte to task the intelligence community to prepare an updated National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq  The amendment was cosponsored by Senators Rockefeller  Biden  Levin  Reid  and Reed  A measure urging the completion of the new NIE was included in the final package of the DoD conference report  It has been more than two years since an NIE on Iraq was prepared and nearly two months since the DNI announced his decision to ask the intelligence community to prepare a new assessment  Preparation and completion of this intelligence assessment cannot be delayed any longer    Earlier this week  the American people were shocked to learn about an assessment from the intelligence community that unequivocally concluded that the war in Iraq is shaping a new generation of terrorists  That report pertained to the global impact of the war  not the conditions in Iraq itself    Below is the text of the letter  Copies of the letter with signatures are available upon request    September 28  2006  Ambassador John D  Negroponte Director of National Intelligence Office of the Director of National Intelligence Washington  D C  20511  Dear Director Negroponte   We welcome your response to our July 26 correspondence and our August 3 amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007 requiring an updated National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq  An NIE focusing on Iraq has not been prepared in more than two years  and we welcome your August 4 announcement that you will ask the intelligence community to prepare this document     As the intelligence community finalizes the terms of reference for the new Iraq National Intelligence Estimate  we draw your attention to a provision in the conference agreement on the Department of Defense Appropriations bill which urges you to follow the parameters set out in our August 3 amendment on the NIE  Under the Senate amendment  the following issues would be included    The prospects for controlling severe sectarian violence that could lead to civil war    The prospects for Iraqs ethic  religious  and tribal divisions    An assessment of the extent to which militias are providing security and the extent to which the Government of Iraq has developed and implemented a credible plan to disarm and demobilize and reintegrate the militias into the government security forces and is working to obtain a political commitment to ban militias    An assessment of whether Iraq is succeeding in creating a stable and effective unity government  and the likelihood that the government will address the concerns of the Sunni community    The prospects for economic reconstruction and the impact it will have on security and stability    Its obviously important that we obtain an open and honest assessment from the intelligence community  particularly on the question of whether Iraq is in or is descending into civil war  and we look forward to the assessment from the intelligence community  It is also our view that an unclassified summary of the judgments  consistent with the protection of sources and methods  should be made available when the NIE is completed    Additionally  we continue to believe the NIE should be as thorough and comprehensive as possible  To this end  we would also benefit significantly by having the following areas addressed in a new Iraq NIE    An assessment addressing the threat from violent extremist related terrorism  including al Qaeda  in and from Iraq  including the extent to which terrorist actions in Iraq are targeted at the United States presence there and the likelihood that terrorist groups operating in Iraq will target U S  interests outside Iraq    An assessment of whether  and in what ways  the large scale presence of multinational forces in Iraq helps or hinders the prospects for success in Iraq    A description of the optimistic  most likely  and pessimistic scenarios for the stability of Iraq through 2007    An assessment of the extent to which the situation in Iraq is affecting our relations with Iran  Saudi Arabia  Turkey  and other countries in the region    The stakes are enormously high in Iraq  and having the most thorough and comprehensive NIE possible will greatly inform the debate about our options in Iraq    We look forward to hearing from you about the final terms of reference for the new Iraq NIE and to receiving the updated NIE  Certainly nobody has an interest in unnecessarily rushing the intelligence community  But it has been more than two years since an NIE on Iraq was prepared and nearly two months since you announced your decision to ask the intelligence community to prepare a new assessment  With more than 140 000 troops on the ground in Iraq  preparation of this intelligence assessment cannot be delayed any longer   Sincerely      ___________________ ___________________ ___________________ John D  Rockefeller
