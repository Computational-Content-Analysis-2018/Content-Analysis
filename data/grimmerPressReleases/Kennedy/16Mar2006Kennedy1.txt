         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   This winter low income families have been struggling more than ever to make ends meet and keep their heat on during the cold winter months  In many places the need for heating assistance is still great  Democrats pressed for months to increase funds for LIHEAP to the authorized level of  5 1 billion  We urged the GOP leadership and the President to act  but the Republican majority blocked our efforts at every turn  and families paid a steep price for that neglect  The average LIHEAP grant has declined by almost 10 percent since 2002  and is now only  288 After months of fighting for full funding  the Senate added only  1 billion to LIHEAP for 2006  This additional funding was essential  but no one should be under the illusion that we ve provided adequate assistance to millions of struggling families around the country  many of whom are elderly and disabled Shamefully  the budget released by President Bush requests no increase at all in LIHEAP from this year s level  As a result  only  1 78 billion will be available for next winter  The Administration continues to ignore the needs of our most vulnerable citizens so we must wage the same battle all over again Heating oil costs are not expected to go down next winter  Families will continue to be forced to choose between heat  food  health  and rent  We need to act now  Our failure to fully fund LIHEAP this winter left families shivering in the cold  We can t let that happen again  I urge our colleagues to support our amendment  It s time to get this issue right for millions of hard working low income families   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
