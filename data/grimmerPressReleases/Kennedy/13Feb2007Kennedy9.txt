         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  HELP  Committee held a hearing on the ways paid sick days would impact everyday working families  Currently  almost half of private sector workers are denied paid sick days and of the lowest quarter of wage earners  79  have no paid sick days at all  The Healthy Families Act would require employers with 15 or more employees to provide seven paid sick days to care for their own and their families medical needs  benefiting 66 million Americans  46 million would gain access to paid sick days  19 million would gain paid sick days for leave for doctors visits and family care  and 1 million Americans would gain additional paid sick days  We need workplace laws that let working men and women be responsible parents too  The lack of paid sick days isnt just a family issue  its also a public health issue  Senator Kennedy said  When sick people go to work or sick children go to school  they infect their coworkers or fellow students and the public as well  In fact  a high proportion of workers who have constant contact with the public have no paid sick days85 percent of food industry workers and 55 percent of workers in the retail industry are denied that benefit  The Committee heard testimony from Deborah Ness  President  National Partnership for Women and Families  Dr  Jody Heymann  Professor at McGill University  Director  McGill Institute for Health and Social Policy and Project on Global Working Families  Heidi Hartmann  President  Institute for Womens Policy Research  Dr  Rajiv Bhatia  Director of Occupational and Environmental Health for the San Francisco Department of Public Health and Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine at University of California at San Francisco  and Mr  G  Roger King  Partner  Jones Day Below is a fact sheet on the legislation and the issue  as well as Senator Kennedys full statement which includes anecdotes from the workers present at the hearing who have suffered due to the lack of paid sick days  Letters and statements of support from Massachusetts Dancing Deer Baking Company  Childrens Hospital Boston  and the Trust for Americas Health are included  A PDF letter of support from the Medical Legal Partnership for Children is available upon request  SUMMARY OF HEALTHY FAMILIES ACTThe Healthy Families Act gives workers the right to paid sick days  It will guarantee working Americans seven paid sick days to care for their own and their families medical needs  The bill  which applies to employers with 15 or more employees   Guarantees paid sick days for an employees medical condition  an employees doctors appointment  or other preventative or diagnostic treatment  and to care for a family member with comparable needs   Provides prorated leave for part time employees working between 20 and 30 hours a week or between 1 000 and 1 500 hours a year   Allows employers to maintain existing policies that meet these standards  and encourage employers to provide greater benefits   Allows employers to request certification for leave for employees who request three or more consecutive days  Employers must keep health information confidential and separate from personnel files   Requires employers to post notice of the availability of paid sick leave and how to file an enforcement action   Allows an employee or the Secretary of Labor to enforce these rights in federal or state court   Requires a GAO study of how these paid sick leave policies are implemented and the benefits and costs to employers and employees of the leave   WORKING FAMILIES DESERVE PAID SICK DAYSThe Healthy Families Act would guarantee workers seven paid sick days a year  This would benefit 66 million Americans  46 million would gain access to paid sick days  19 million would gain paid sick days for leave for doctors visits and family care  and 1 million Americans would gain additional paid sick days   Americans strongly support paid sick days  The vast majority of Americans believe that working men and women deserve time off to balance their work responsibilities with their own  and their families medical needs   Ninety five percent of workers think it is unacceptable for an employer to refuse to provide sick days   Sixty percent of workers believe it is illegal not to provide sick days  Unfortunately  too often the reality for American workers falls short of our rhetoric about family values   Nearly half of American private sector workers do not have paid sick days  Only one in three has paid sick days for doctors appointments   The need is particularly urgent among lower wage workers  In the lowest quarter of wage earners  79 percent of workers have no paid sick days  Paid sick days are a childrens issue  When children come to school sick  it is harder for them to focus  and harder for the teachers to teach  And everyones children are protected when sick children stay home and avoid spreading germs   Schools are one of the most common sites for the spread of viral infections  While adults average about 2 4 colds per year  children in school average as many as 12 colds a year  Parents without an at home caregiver need about 4 days per year to care for sick school age children   The Center for Disease Control recommends that children who are sick remain home from school or daycare to prevent the spread of illness   Only one in three workers has paid sick days to care for a sick child  This means they must either lose a days pay or send a child to school sick  Paid sick days are a public health issue  We need paid sick days to stop the spread of infections that can threaten the health of our entire nation   Many workers in industries that require constant contact with the public lack paid sick days   78 percent of food service workers do not have paid sick days   55 percent of workers in the retail industry do not have paid sick days   29 percent of health care and social assistance workers do not have any paid sick days  These workers may spread disease among patients who are already ill   Every day we see examples in the press of norovirus outbreaks and workers being stricken with the flu  In one hotel in Nevada  a worker who lacked paid sick days went to work with a stomach virus and infected 600 guests and 300 employees   Workers who do not have paid sick days for doctors visits do not have the opportunity to get important preventive care  such as flu shots and vaccinations  Paid sick days are an economic issue  Paid sick days produce savings for businesses through decreased turnover and increased productivity   Businesses face a growing problem with presenteeismworkers coming in sick  In a recent survey  56  of human resource executives said that their business has a problem with presenteeism  up from 39  two years ago   The Institute for Womens Policy Research estimates that the Healthy Families Act would result in a net savings  after covering costs of paid leave  of  8 billion per year  Such savings are generated by reducing presenteeism  reducing employee turnover and preventing the spread of the flu   A Cornell study found that presenteeism despite medical problems costs  180 billion annually in lost productivity  and may be more costly than absenteeism due to illness  STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY PAID SICK DAYS HEARING  AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY  Each of us knows what it means to be sick  Weve all had to miss occasional days of work because of illness  Every parent knows what its like to care for a sick child  As members of Congress  we dont lose our pay or risk our jobs if we stay home when illness strikes  But millions of Americans arent so fortunate  Half of private sector workers in the United States do not have paid sick days  Seventy percent dont have paid sick days they can use to care for family members  They cant take a day off to recover from the flu  They cant leave work to care for a child who is running a fever  Among workers in the lowest income quarter  80  do not have the ability to take time off for an illness without losing their pay or even their jobs  This lack of protection is particularly difficult for women and children  Women have moved into the workforce in record numbers  but they continue to take primary responsibility for their childrens health  Nearly 80  of mothers say they are solely responsible for their childrens medical care  Were talking about hard working people like Stephanie Scott and Elnora Collins  who are here today  Stephanie is a full time teacher at a day care center  She and colleagues who have been at her workplace for years have no sick days  Elnora is a 67 year old home care worker who is caring for 2 granddaughters  She has no paid sick days  She tells us  One time I was so sick  I threw up at a clients house  She loves caring for older citizens and doesnt want to desert her clients  but she needs time off to care for her own health  Were talking about children like Jennetta Allen of Georgia  She says Once when I was little I got real sick at school  I waited and waited but Mom never cameWhen my Mom finally made it home she was crying more than I was  She told me her boss would not let her leave  My Mom was fired because her boss thought I might get sick again  Children need their parents to have paid sick days  I have here a letter from four pediatricians who work at Boston Medical Center and the South End Community Health Center  I will include this letter in the record  but  briefly  they say  We strongly support the Healthy Families Act because we believe  it  could be one of the most powerful treatments we have for children  By supporting the Healthy Families Act  you support minimizing expensive hospital stays for children  and getting parents back to work more quickly  If we truly care about families  we have to change our policies  We need workplace laws that let working men and women be responsible parents too   The lack of paid sick days is not just a family issue  its also a public health issue  When sick people go to work or sick children go to school  they infect coworkers or fellow students and the public  In fact  a high proportion of workers who have constant contact with the public have no paid sick days85 percent of food service workers and 55 percent of workers in the retail industry are denied that benefit  30 percent of health care workers cant take paid time off when theyre ill  Paid sick days are the obvious solution to prevent the spread of illnesses and reduce medical costs  Every day we see stories in the paper of stomach illnesses breaking out in restaurants or on cruise ships  We learn of flu outbreaks leading to hospitalization of the elderly  These diseases are very contagious  but their spread can be minimized if sick people stay at home  Paid sick days also give people the opportunity to obtain medical treatment for illnesses or chronic medical conditions  We all know that preventive care helps reduce medical costs  For all these reasons  paid sick days would result in significant savings to our economy and our healthcare system  Thats why employers support paid sick days too  Dancing Deer Bakery  a small business in my hometown of Boston Massachusetts  has written a statement that I will include in the record  saying that  A national paid sick days law creates a level playing field for all businesses We hope that a bill will move through both Chambers and be on the Presidents desk  Paid sick days should be a non partisan issue  A healthy nation is a productive nation   Paid sick days for workers is a vital step to address health needs  Thats why Ill be reintroducing the Healthy Families Actto provide seven paid sick days to workers each year  We must also move to take steps to deal with other family and work issues  We need to protect workers who seek greater flexibility in the workplace  We need to expand family and medical leavean issue which Senator Dodd has led for many years  We need to provide affordable child care  such as Senator Murrays bill to allow time off for parents to attend teacher conferences  The world and the workforce are changing  and our laws have to catch up  I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about how we can move forward and make paid sick days our national law  February 13  2007 The Honorable Edward M  Kennedy Chairman Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions 428 Senate Dirksen Office Building Washington  DC 20510 Dear Senator Kennedy  On behalf of Children s Hospital Boston and the children and families we care for  I want to thank you for introducing the Healthy Families Act  As the Medical Director of the Cerebral Palsy Program at Children s Hospital Boston  I work with families all the time who are trying to balance work responsibilities with caring for their child with complex health care needs  Arranging the time off for medical appointments is a major source of stress  It is important for employers to give families flexibility to meet the health care needs of their child in a timely manner  Children need to have their parents present for emergencies as well as for management of their chronic health concerns  Affording families paid sick days also can reduce the spread of disease in child care settings  schools and at work  This legislation eases some of the tough choices that families have to make to meet the competing demands of their family and professional lives  I appreciate your work on this important issue  Sincerely  Laurie Glader  MD FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact  Kate Fleming  The Rosen Group  212 255 8455  Kate

Labor and Pensions has its hearing on paid sick days today  the Chair  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  will have the support of one of the countrys foremost advocates for work life balance  Working Mother Media  WMM the publisher of Working Mother magazine and the force behind the 21 year old signature initiative Working Mother 100 Best Companieshas long advocated family friendly policies in the workplace  Now  WMM is standing with Senator Kennedy as he promotes common sense change that will enhance the lives of millions of working Americans  Every study  every piece of research shows that giving workers paid sick days to attend to personal concerns  as well as to those of children and extended family members  increases job satisfaction  workplace morale  company profitability  and more  said Carol Evans  CEO of Working Mother Media  Evans continued  This issue is particularly important to women  Mothers are the family health managers in America  and we need to make sure that when the family health manager also works outside the home  she can still perform her important job of keeping her family healthy  It is time to level the playing field by asking government to mandate a standard that protects the health of our working families that all companies must meet  With almost half  47   of full time  private sector employees receiving no paid sick days at all  the provision of a minimum standard for paid sick days will dramatically change the lives of countless workers and their families  and poorer Americans  in particular  will benefit from the proposed legislation  An estimated three quarters of low wage workers have no paid sick days  and recent research from the Urban Institute estimates that of working parents with incomes below 200  of the federal poverty line  41  have no paid leave at all  As a result  workers who least can afford it are forced to miss work to care for themselves and family members  and working women and mothers  as primary household caregivers  feel the burden most acutely  In response to the issues raised by the Healthy Families Act when it was first introduced  Working Mother Media now plans to focus increased importance on paid sick days in the business world by making sick leave policy a factor in evaluating applicants to the 100 Best Companies initiative  Evans noted that We hope that just by asking the question about paid sick days  more companies will pay attention to this vital issue  We are confident that our winners offer great supports to their employees  About Working Mother Media Working Mother Media  WMM   was founded by Evans in 2001 when she acquired  with MCG Capital of Arlington  Virginia  Working Mother magazine  the WorkLife Congress  and the National Association for Female Executives  NAFE  and their websites  Since then WMM has launched several new initiatives including the Best Companies for Women of Color  which includes the Multicultural Women s Conference  12 Multicultural Women s Town Halls in the U S   Canada and Brazil and web seminars  Working Mother magazine  launched 27 years ago  reaches 3 million readers and is still the only national magazine for career committed mothers  In 2006  WMM acquired Diversity Best Practices and the Business Womens Network  making Working Mother Media the largest media company in the country focused on diversity and the advancement of women  TFAH Supports the Healthy Families Act  Sick and Family Leave Measures in Bill Would Be Critical for Containing a Possible Pandemic Flu OutbreakMedia Contacts  Laura Segal  202  223 9870 x 27 or lsegal tfah org or Nicole Speulda  202  223 9870 x29 or nspeulda tfah org  Washington  D  C   February 13  2007  The following is a statement by Jeff Levi  PhD  Executive Director of Trust for Americas Health  TFAH   People shouldnt have to choose between protecting the health of their families and a paycheck during a crisis  The sick and family leave measures proposed in the Healthy Families Act  as introduced by Senator Edward Kennedy  D MA   are important for ensuring that all Americans  regardless of their economic status  could take time off when they are sick or to care for family members  But the proposed sick and family leave policies are also essential for containing the spread of infectious disease and limiting the risk of illness during public health emergencies  Currently  59 million workers in the U S  do not have paid sick leave  Eighty six million workers do not have paid sick leave that they can use to care for immediate family members  Three out of four low wage workers have no sick leave at all  One of the biggest current threats to our nations health is a possible pandemic flu outbreak  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  is proposing that individuals who might become ill during a pandemic should stay home from work until they are fully recovered  an estimated 10 days   and that household members of those who are sick should also stay home while the individual is sick until it is clear that the household member has not become ill  which is known as voluntary home quarentine  The CDC has also suggested that schools could potentially close for 12 weeks during a pandemic  leading parents and guardians to struggle with managing child care issues during that time frame  Compliance with public health recommendations will be critical during the first wave of a pandemic  when vaccines would not yet be widely available  The minimum seven days of paid sick leave a year that employees could use to meet their own medical needs or care for sick family members would allow people to meet most of the minimum requirement for recuperation and family care during a pandemic  TFAH also encourages employers to plan for a possible pandemic  and create tiered sick leave plans to allow for more time off during a public health crisis  when designated by the U S   Secretary of Health and Human Services  Trust for Americas Health is a non profit  non partisan organization dedicated to saving lives by protecting the health of every community and working to make disease prevention a national priority  www healthyamericans org and www pandemicfluandyou org Statement from Dancing Deer Baking Company in Support of Paid Sick Days February 12  2007 Employers  families and our economy depend on the existence of a healthy workforce  I commend Senator Kennedy for his leadership in seeking paid sick days for employees around the nation  At Dancing Deer Baking Company we have always sought to ensure that our employees can have the time to address their own and their families health needs  We also provide all employees with short and long term disability insurance as a secondary safety net  Full time non exempt employees at our company receive a minimum of 15 days per year in their first year of employment as paid time off  which can be used for any reason  including not coming to work because of the flu  which they start accruing immediately upon employment with us  It makes good business sense and good people sense to put structures in place to help people live more balanced  healthier lives  A national paid sick days law that sets a minimum standard is important because it means that employees do not have to choose between coming to work sick or staying home and losing a days wages  or a job  National data indicates about half of private sector employees do not have paid sick days  Thats an incomprehensible statistic  until you break it down and look at the granular  person by person implications  What you find is that health issues and family care issues are often the final straw that throws families into crisis  We see this in our work in the community targeted at ending family homelessness  Our Sweet Home Project provides funds that help homeless families  the majority of whom are the working poor  move to healthy  economically stable lives  A national paid sick days law creates a level playing field for all businesses  Personally I believe that we have a competitive advantage from our benefits policies  but many small businesses struggle with this issue  I believe that creating a level playing field with respect to incentives and requirements for doing the right thing is a good idea for all  It is encouraging that the Committee is holding hearings on paid sick days  We hope that a bill will move through both Chambers and be on the Presidents desk  Paid sick days should be a non partisan issue  A healthy nation is a productive nation  Founded in 1994 as a local bakery  Dancing Deer has advanced to the national stage through creativity  hard work and a maniacal attention to quality  detail and customer satisfaction  As we learned what and who did and didnt work organizationally  we developed a philosophy for the business  If people are happy  it shows in the food  Dancing Deer currently has approximately 70 Full time employees  The Companys policies are tailored to the inner city employee base  Dancing Deer has a low hourly requirement for full time benefits  just 24 hours per week  and a flexible PTO  paid time off  policy  which allows single parents access to health care  and other benefits while managing family commitments For more information contact  Ursula Liff  617  442 7300 ext  210 Ursula liff Dancingdeer com 77 Shirley
