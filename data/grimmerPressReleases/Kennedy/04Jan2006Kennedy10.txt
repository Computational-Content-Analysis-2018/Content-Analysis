         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I m concerned by President Bush s decision to bypass the Senate and give a recess appointment to Peter Kirsanow as a member of the National Labor Relations Board  I had made it clear that I was willing to work with the White House and Republicans to confirm a comprehensive package to fill all of the three existing vacancies on the Board  Mr  Kirsanow s record as a Member of the Commission on Civil Rights raises serious doubts about his fitness for high office and his commitment to fairness for all Americans  He is an ardent foe of basic worker protections  including the minimum wage and prevailing wage laws  and is a vehement opponent of affirmative action  He has also suggested that the internment of Arab Americans would be imminent in the event of another terrorist attack against the United States  The NLRB is vital in protecting the basic rights of employees across the nation  The last thing the Board needs is a member dedicated to undermining those rights   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
