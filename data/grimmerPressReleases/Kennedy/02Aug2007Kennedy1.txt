         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  Chairman  I strongly oppose the nomination of Leslie Southwick to a lifetime position on the Fifth Circuit  The New York Times has published an editorial on this nomination entitled  An Unacceptable Nominee  and that says it all  The editorial stated Judge Southwick has a disturbing history of insensitivity to blacks and other minority groups  and called on the Senate to reject allnominees who do not meet the high standards of fairness that are essential for such important posts  I agree  Im deeply troubled by Judge Southwicks position in Richmond v  Mississippi Department of Human Services to reinstate a worker who used a racial slur regarding a colleague  In that case  a white worker used the N word in referring to an African American worker during a work related meeting  Other employees expressed their concern that unless the employer disciplined the worker for using the N word  it would send a message that it condoned using racial slurs in the workplace  The employer  a Mississippi state agency  fired the worker Judge Southwick joined the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals of Mississippi reinstating the white employee who used this offensive word  The opinion claimed that this shameful racial slur was not motivated out of racial hatred or animosity directed at her co worker or toward blacks in general  but was intended as a shorthand description of her perception of the relationship existing between the  co  worker and  a  supervisor  The decision uncritically accepted the claims of the worker who used the slur  even though she had the burden of proof  Two of his colleagues on the court dissented  clearly explaining the problem  They said the N word is  and has always been  offensive  Search high and low  you will not find any non offensive definition for this term  There are some words  which by their nature and definition are so inherently offensive  that their use establishes the intent to offend Presumably  Judge Southwick saw that dissent before he signed on to the majority opinion  But he joined the majority anyway  He had the option of writing his own opinion  or asking the majority not to include such a bizarre characterization in its opinion for the court  Apparently  he did not see the need to do so At his hearing  he was asked numerous times whether he now regrets joining the majority in the case  He refused to say the decision was a mistake  He told me  dont change horses in mid stream  and added  I think the opinion is carefully written  and its written to give deference to the agency         Frankly  I was astonished at that answer  It seems that even now  he doesnt understand how serious the slur is  His vote in Richmond  and his failure even to distance himself from the majority opinion even now  shows a disqualifying lack of sensitivity to job discrimination  and to the significance of this cruel word  Its use shouts agreement with the racism that led to slavery in America and that persisted in the South until the 1960s  and continues to be a dark stain on our nations history  Harvard Law School Professor Randall Kennedy has written a book on the N word and its significance in American society  Here is what Professor Kennedy has to say about it Over the years  the N word has become the best known of the American languages many racial insults  evolving into the paradigmatic slur  It is the epithet that generates epithets  He also wrote that for many blacks the N word has constituted a major and menacing presence that has sometimes shifted the course of their lives  Former slaves featured it in their memoirs about bondage  In a law review article on the issued  Professor Michele Goodwin of DePaul University has stated that the word  Is perhaps the most provocative word in the American lexicon        For many African Americans  the word evokes memories of subordination supported by and arguably under written by the law  including Jim Crow lynchings  lack of accommodations  and denial of civil liberties  and it carries the political and legal force of second class citizenship  Fortunately  the Supreme Court of Mississippi corrected the problem  and ensured that the state agency would discipline the worker in some way  Some have said that Judge Southwick s vote in the case was affirmed by the Mississippi Supreme Court  That s not true  On the core issue of whether the worker should be disciplined for the use of this word  every member of the seven person Mississippi Supreme Court disagreed with Judge Southwick  Some would have held that the employee should be fired  but each of them disagreed with the result Judge Southwick supported  which would have let the employee entirely off the hook  I am also deeply concerned about his decision to join the majority opinion in S B  v  L W   which removed an eight year old child from the care of her biological mother because of the mothers sexual orientation  He also joined a concurring opinion in the case essentially holding that states rights allowed Mississippi to deprive a mother of her parental rights because of her sexual orientation  During his hearing and in written questions  he testified that he felt constrained to reach this result because of Supreme Court precedent  That explanation doesnt reflect what was actually in the majority and concurring opinions that Judge Southwick joined  Those opinions barely mention the Supreme Courts decision in Bowers v  Hardwick  even though he now suggests the Bowers case was the decisive factor in his decision  Moreover  the opinions he joined didnt mention at all the Supreme Courts equally relevant  and more recent  decision in Romer v  Evans  which held in 1996 that state laws indicating anti gay bias are constitutionally suspect  If Judge Southwick was only concerned with following Supreme Court precedent  Id have expected him to discuss Romer  because at the time of the decision  Romer was the Supreme Courts most recent guidance to lower courts on when state laws that discriminate based on sexual orientation violate the federal Constitution  Yet Romer isnt even mentioned in the decision Judge Southwick joined  Im troubled that he would rely on an older Supreme Court opinion upholding discrimination without considering an equally relevant  and more recent Supreme Court precedent striking down a discriminatory law In fact  there is very little attempt in the opinion Judge Southwick joined to even recognize the mothers fundamental constitutional right  much less to undertake the careful equal protection analysis that the Constitution requires  I am also concerned about the overall picture that Judge Southwicks record on the Mississippi Court of Appeals indicates of his views on workers rights and consumer rights  The Alliance for Justice found that in 160 out of the 180 published opinions involving state employment law and torts in which there was a dissent  he ruled 89 percent of the time against workers  consumers  and others who claimed they were injured by corporate abuse The Fifth Circuit has the largest minority population of all the federal circuits  It hears a large number of cases on civil rights and has had a historic role in enforcing those rights  It was acclaimed for its courage in protecting the civil rights of African Americans at a time when many state and local governments were hostile to their rights or unwilling to enforce them  Even after Congress enacted historic laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965  many states and localities in the South resisted the enforcement of these measures  Fifth Circuit judges like Elbert Tuttle  Frank Johnson  and John Minor Wisdom helped to fulfill the promise of equality contained in these important laws  We have an obligation to ensure that nominees to this Court today will uphold that proud tradition Judge Southwick does not meet that standard  Its notable that a large number of organizations representing civil rights and workers rights oppose the nomination  In particular  members of the local community  who would be most directly affected by this nomination  have expressed strong opposition  The Mississippi NAACP and the Magnolia Bar Association  an organization of African American lawyers in Mississippi  have written letters urging us not to confirm this nominee  and emphasizing in particular his lack of sensitivity on civil rights issues Judge Southwick should not be confirmed to a lifetime position on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  I urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
