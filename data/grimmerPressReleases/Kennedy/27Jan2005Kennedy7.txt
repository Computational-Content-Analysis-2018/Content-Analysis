         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Thank you Dr  Fukuyama for that generous introduction Im honored to be here at the School of Advanced International Studies  Many of the most talented individuals in foreign policy have benefited from your outstanding graduate program  and I welcome the opportunity to meet with you on the issue of Iraq Forty years ago  America was in another war in a distant land  At that time  in 1965  we had in Vietnam the same number of troops and the same number of casualties as in Iraq today We thought in those early days in Vietnam that we were winning  We thought the skill and courage of our troops was enough  We thought that victory on the battlefield would lead to victory in the war  and peace and democracy for the people of Vietnam We lost our national purpose in Vietnam  We abandoned the truth  We failed our ideals  The words of our leaders could no longer be trusted In the name of a misguided cause  we continued the war too long  We failed to comprehend the events around us  We did not understand that our very presence was creating new enemies and defeating the very goals we set out to achieve  We cannot allow that history to repeat itself in Iraq    We must learn from our mistakes  We must recognize what a large and growing number of Iraqis now believe  The war in Iraq has become a war against the American occupation  We have reached the point that a prolonged American military presence in Iraq is no longer productive for either Iraq or the United States  The U S  military presence has become part of the problem  not part of the solution We need a serious course correction  and we need it now  We must make it for the American soldiers who are paying with their lives  We must make it for the American people who cannot afford to spend our resources and national prestige protracting the war in the wrong way  We must make it for the sake of the Iraqi people who yearn for a country that is not a permanent battlefield and for a future free from permanent occupation  The elections in Iraq this weekend provide an opportunity for a fresh and honest approach  We need a new plan that sets fair and realistic goals for self government in Iraq  and works with the Iraqi government on a specific timetable for the honorable homecoming of our forces The first step is to confront our own mistakes  Americans are rightly concerned about why our 157 000 soldiers are there    when they will come home    and how our policy could have gone so wrong No matter how many times the Administration denies it  there is no question they misled the nation and led us into a quagmire in Iraq  President Bush rushed to war on the basis of trumped up intelligence and a reckless argument that Iraq was a critical arena in the global war on terror  that somehow it was more important to start a war with Iraq than to finish the war in Afghanistan and capture Osama bin Laden  and that somehow the danger was so urgent that the U N  weapons inspectors could not be allowed time to complete their search for weapons of mass destruction As in Vietnam  truth was the first casualty of this war  Nearly 1400 Americans have died  More than 10 000 have been wounded  and tens of thousands of Iraqi men  women  and children have been killed  The weapons of mass destruction werent there  but today 157 000 Americans are As a result of our actions in Iraq  our respect and credibility around the world have reached all time lows  The President bungled the pre war diplomacy on Iraq and wounded our alliances  The label coalition of the willing cannot conceal the fact that American soldiers make up 80  of the troops on the ground in Iraq and more than 90  of the casualties  The Administration also failed to prepare for the aftermath of victory  and so the post war period became a new war  with more casualties  astronomical costs  and relentless insurgent attacks The Administration failed to establish a basic level of law and order after Baghdad fell  and so massive looting occurred The Administration dissolved the Iraqi army and dismissed its troops  but left their weapons intact and their ammunition dumps unguarded  and they have become arsenals of the insurgency The Administration relied for advice on self promoting Iraqi exiles who were out of touch with the Iraqi people and resented by them  and the result is an America regarded as occupier  not as liberator  The President recklessly declared Mission Accomplished when in truth the mission had barely begun  He and his advisors predicted and even bragged that the war would be a cakewalk  but the expected welcoming garlands of roses became an endless bed of thorns  The Administration told us the financial costs would be paid with Iraqi oil dollars  but it is being paid with billions of American tax dollars  Another  80 billion bill for the black hole that Iraq has become has just been handed to the American people The cost is also being paid in shame and stain on Americas good name as a beacon of human rights  Nothing is more at odds with our values as Americans than the torture of another human being  Do you think that any Americans tell their children with pride that America tortures prisoners  Yet  high officials in the Administration in their arrogance strayed so far from our heritage and our belief in fundamental human decency that they approved the use of tortureand they were wrong  deeply wrong  to do that  The Administrations willful disregard of the Geneva Conventions led to the torture and flagrant abuse of the prisoners at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and that degradation has diminished America in the eyes of the whole world  It has diminished our moral voice on the planet Never in our history has there been a more powerful  more painful example of the saying that those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it The tide of history rises squarely against military occupation  We ignore this truth at our peril in Iraq  The nations in the Middle East are independent  except for Iraq  which began the 20th century under Ottoman occupation and is now beginning the 21st century under American occupation  Iraq could very well be another Algeria  where the French won the military battle for Algiers  but ultimately lost the political battle for Algeria  Despite the clear lesson of history  the President stubbornly clings to the false hope that the turning point is just around the corner The ending of the rule of Saddam Hussein was supposed to lessen violence and bring an irresistible wave of democracy to the Middle East  It hasnt  Saddam Husseins capture was supposed to quell the violence  It didnt  The transfer of sovereignty was supposed to be the breakthrough  It wasnt  The military operation in Fallujah was supposed to break the back of the insurgency  It didnt The 1400 Americans killed in Iraq and the 10 000 American casualties are the equivalent of a full division of our Army  and we only have ten active divisions  The tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians killed last year included nearly a thousand members of the new Iraqi security forces  and a hundred more have been lost this year  The recent killing of a senior Iraqi judge was the 170th assassination of an Iraqi official since June of 2003 We all hope for the best from Sundays election  The Iraqis have a right to determine their own future  But Sundays election is not a cure for the violence and instability  Unless the Sunni and all the other communities in Iraq believe they have a stake in the outcome and a genuine role in drafting the new Iraqi constitution  the election could lead to greater alienation  greater escalation  and greater death  for us and for the Iraqis  In fact  the Central Intelligence Agencys top official in Baghdad warned recently that the security situation is deteriorating and is likely to worsen  with escalating violence and more sectarian clashes  How could any President have let this happen  General Brent Scowcroft  who until recently served as Chairman of President Bushs National Intelligence Advisory Board and who also served as the first President Bushs National Security Adviser  recently warned of an incipient civil war in Iraq  He said  the  Iraqi  elections are turning out to be less about a promising transformation  and it has great potential for deepening the conflict President Bushs Iraq policy is not  as he said during last falls campaign  a catastrophic success  It is a catastrophic failure  The men and women of our armed forces are serving honorably and with great courage under extreme conditions  but their indefinite presence is fanning the flames of conflict The American people are concerned  They recognize that the war with Iraq is not worth the cost in American lives  prestige  and credibility  They understand that this misbegotten war has made America more hated in the world  created new breeding grounds and support for terrorists  and made it harder to win the real war against terrorism  the war against Al Qaeda and radical jihadist terrorists  Conservative voices are alarmed as well  As Paul Weyrich  founder of the Heritage Foundation  said last November  we are stuck in a guerrilla war with no end in sight  As former Coalition Provisional Authority adviser Larry Diamond recently said  There is a fine line between Churchillian resolve and self defeating obstinacy  We must recognize that line and end the obstinate policy of the Administration A new Iraq policy must begin with acceptance of hard truths  Most of the violence in Iraq is not being perpetrated  as President Bush has claimed  by a handful of folks that fear freedom and people who want to try to impose their will on peoplejust like Osama bin Laden  The war has made Iraq a magnet for terrorism that wasnt there before  President Bush has opened an unnecessary new front in the war on terror  and we are losing ground because of it  The CIAs own National Intelligence Council confirmed this assessment in its report two weeks ago The insurgency is not primarily driven by foreign terrorists  General Abizaid  head of our Central Command  said last September  I think the number of foreign fighters in Iraq is probably below 1 000  According to the Department of Defense  less than two percent of all the detainees in Iraq are foreign nationals  The insurgency is largely home grown  By our own governments own count  its ranks are large and growing larger  Its strength has quadrupled since the transfer of sovereignty six months ago from 5 000 in mid 2004  to 16 000 last October  to more than 20 000 now  The Iraqi intelligence service estimates that the insurgency may have 30 000 fighters and up to 200 000 supporters  Its clear that we dont know how large the insurgency is  All we can say with certainty is that the insurgency is growing It is also becoming more intense and adaptable  The bombs are bigger and more powerful  The attacks have greater sophistication Anthony Cordesman  the national security analyst for the Center for Strategic and International Studies  recently wrote  There is no evidence that the number of insurgents is declining as a result of Coalition and Iraqi attacks to date An Army Reservist wrote the stark truth  The guerillas are filling their losses faster than we can create them  For every guerilla we kill with a smart bomb  we kill many more innocent civilians and create rage and anger in the Iraqi community  This rage and anger translates into more recruits for the terrorists and less support for us  Our troops understand that  The American people understand it  And its time the Administration understand it  Beyond the insurgencys numbers  it has popular and tacit support from thousands of ordinary Iraqis who are aiding and abetting the attacks as a rejection of the American occupation  It is fueled by the anger of ever larger numbers of Iraqis  not just Saddam loyalists   who have concluded that the United States is either unable or unwilling to provide basic security  jobs  water  electricity and other services Anti American sentiment is steadily rising  CDs that picture the insurrection have spread across the country  Songs glorify combatants  Poems written decades ago during the British occupation after World War I are popular again The International Crisis Group  a widely respected conflict prevention organization  recently reported  These post war failings gradually were perceived by many Iraqis as purposeful  designed to serve Washingtons interests to remain for a prolonged period in a debilitated Iraq We have the finest military in the world  But we cannot rely primarily on military action to end politically inspired violence  We cant defeat the insurgents militarily if we dont effectively address the political context in which the insurgency flourishes  Our military and the insurgents are fighting for the same thing  the hearts and minds of the people  and that is a battle we are not winning The beginning of wisdom in this crisis is to define honest and realistic goals  First  the goal of our military presence should be to allow the creation of a legitimate  functioning Iraqi government  not to dictate it Creating a full fledged democracy wont happen overnight  We can and must make progress  but it may take many years for the Iraqis to finish the job  We have to adjust our time horizon  The process cannot begin in earnest until Iraqis have full ownership of that transition  Our continued  overwhelming presence only delays that process If we want Iraq to develop a stable  democratic government  America must assist    not control    the newly established government Unless Iraqis have a genuine sense that their leaders are not our puppets  the election cannot be the turning point the Administration hopes To enhance its legitimacy in the eyes of the Iraqi people  the new Iraqi Government should begin to disengage politically from America  and we from them The reality is that the Bush Administration is continuing to pull the strings in Iraq  and the Iraqi people know it  We picked the date for the transfer of sovereignty  We supported former CIA operative Iyad Allawi to lead the Interim Government  We wrote the administrative law and the interim constitution that now governs Iraq  We set the date for the election  and President Bush insisted that it take place  even when many Iraqis sought delay It is time to recognize that there is only one choice  America must give Iraq back to the Iraqi people  We need to let the Iraqi people make their own decisions  reach their own consensus  and govern their own country  We need to rethink the Pottery Barn rule  America cannot forever be the potter that sculpts Iraqs future  President Bush broke Iraq  but if we want Iraq to be fixed  the Iraqis must feel that they  not we  own it  The Iraqi people are facing historic issuesthe establishment of a government  the role of Islam  and the protection of minority rights The United States and the international community have a clear interest in a strong  tolerant and pluralistic Iraq  free from chaos and civil war The United Nations  not the United States  should provide assistance and advice on establishing a system of government and drafting a constitution  An international meeting  led by the United Nations and the new Iraqi Government    should be convened immediately in Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East to begin that process  For our part  America must accept that the Shiites will be the majority in whatever government emerges  Sixty percent of the population in Iraq is Shiite  and a Shiite majority is the logical outcome of a democratic process in Iraq  But the Shiites must understand that Iraqs stability and security will be achieved only by safeguarding minority rights  The door to drafting the Constitution and to serving in government must be left open    even to those who were unwilling or unable or too terrified to participate in the elections  The Shiites must also understand that Americas support is not open ended and that Americas role is not to defend an Iraqi government that excludes or marginalizes important sectors of Iraqi society  It is far too dangerous for the American military to take sides in a civil war America must adjust to the reality that not all former Baathists will be excluded from Iraqi political life in the new Iraq  After the Iron Curtain fell in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe  many former communists went on to participate in the political process  The current Polish President  a strong ally of President Bush in Iraq  is a former active member of the Communist Party who served under Polands martial law government during the 1980s  If communists can change in this way  there is no reason why some former members of the Baath party cannot do so  If Iraqis wish to negotiate with insurgents who are willing to renounce their violence and join the political process  we should let them do so  Persuading Sunni insurgents to use the ballot  not the bullet  serves the interests of the Shiites too  Second  for democracy to take root  the Iraqis need a clear signal that America has a genuine exit strategy The Iraqi people do not believe that America intends no long term military presence in their country  Our reluctance to make that clear has fueled suspicions among Iraqis that our motives are not pure  that we want their oil  and that we will never leave  As long as our presence seems ongoing  Americas commitment to their democracy sounds unconvincing The President should do more to make it clear that America intends no long term presence  He should disavow the permanence of our so called enduring military bases in Iraq  He should announce that America will dramatically reduce the size of the American Embassy    the largest in the world Once the elections are behind us and the democratic transition is under way  President Bush should immediately announce his intention to negotiate a timetable for a drawdown of American combat forces with the new Iraqi Government At least 12 000 American troops and probably more should leave at once  to send a stronger signal about our intentions and to ease the pervasive sense of occupation As Major General William Nash  who commanded the multinational force in Bosnia  said in November  a substantial reduction in our forces following the Iraqi election would be a wise and judicious move to demonstrate that we are leaving and the absence of targets will go a long way in decreasing the violence Americas goal should be to complete our military withdrawal as early as possible in 2006 President Bush cannot avoid this issue  The Security Council Resolution authorizing our military presence in Iraq can be reviewed at any time at the request of the Iraqi Government  and it calls for a review in June  The U N  authorization for our military presence ends with the election of a permanent Iraqi government at the end of this year  The world will be our judge  We must have an exit plan in force by then    While American troops are drawing down  we must clearly be prepared to oppose any external intervention in Iraq or the large scale revenge killing of any group  We should begin now to conduct serious regional diplomacy with the Arab League and Iraqs neighbors to underscore this point  and we will need to maintain troops on bases outside Iraq but in the region The United Nations could send a stabilization force to Iraq if it is necessary and requested by the Iraqi government  But any stabilization force must be sought by the Iraqis and approved by the United Nations  with a clear and achievable mission and clear rules of engagement  Unlike the current force  it should not consist mostly of Americans or be led by Americans  All nations of the world have an interest in Iraqs stability and territorial integrity Finally  we need to train and equip an effective Iraqi security force  We have a year to do so before the election of the permanent Iraqi government The current training program is in deep trouble  and Iraqi forces are far from being capable  committed  and effective  In too many cases  they cannot even defend themselves  and have fled at the first sign of battle It is not enough to tell usas the Administration hashow many Iraqis go through training  The problem is not merely the numbers  The essential question is how many are prepared to give their lives if necessary  for a future of freedom for their country  The insurgents have been skilled at recruiting Iraqis to participate in suicide attacks  But too often  the trained Iraqi forces do not have a comparable commitment to the Iraqi government  Recruits are ambivalent about America  unsure of the political transition  and skeptical about the credibility of their military and political institutions  The way to strengthen their allegiance is to give them a worthy cause to defend as soon as possible a truly free  independent and sovereign Iraq  We now have no choice but to make the best we can of the disaster we have created in Iraq  The current course is only making the crisis worse  We need to define our objective realistically and redefine both our political and our military presence  President Bush has left us with few good choices  There are costs to staying  and costs to leaving  There may well be violence as we disengage militarily from Iraq and Iraq disengages politically from us  But there will be much more serious violence if we continue our present dangerous and reckless course  It will not be easy to extricate ourselves from Iraq  but we must begin  Error is no excuse for its own perpetuation  Mindless determination doesnt make a better outcome likely  Setting a firm strategy for withdrawal may not guarantee success  but not doing so will almost certainly guarantee failure  Casualties are increasing  America is tied down  Our military is stretched to the breaking point  Our capacity to respond to crises and threats elsewhere in the world has been compromised The book of Proverbs in the Bible teaches us that  Pride goes before destruction  and a haughty spirit before a fall  Its time for President Bush to swallow his pride and end our countrys continuing failures in Iraq and in the eyes of the world  When the President delivers the State of the Union Address next week  I hope he will demonstrate his intention to do that  The danger is very real that if he does not  our leadership in the world will be permanently lost  We cannot let that happen There is a wiser course we can take in keeping with the best in our heritage and history a course that will help America  at long last  to regain our rightful place of respect in the world and bring our troops home with honor  Lets take that course  and take it now Thank you very much   David Smith   Jim Manley
