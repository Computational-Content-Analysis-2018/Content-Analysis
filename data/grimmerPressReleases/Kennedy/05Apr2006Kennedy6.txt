         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I d like to just take a few moments of the Senate time to try and put this legislation at least into some perspective from someone who s worked on legislation dealing with immigration for some period of time  and so that the American people really have an understanding what this debate is really all about  I think all of us understand what has been well stated here  and that is our borders are broken  they re powerless  Ten years ago we estimated about 40 000 were coming into this country illegally  maybe catching almost half of them  Now the estimates are from 400 000 to over a million and catching 5  or 10  of them  And we ve increased the expenditures by  20 billion in terms of just law enforcement and building fences and increasing border guards 300  over the period of the last ten years  and it doesn t work  It doesn t work  It has not worked  and it s not working here today  although there are a number of our colleagues that believe that that offer is the best way to try and get a handle on our borders  That was the position that was taken by the House of Representatives and passed by the House of Representatives  effectively criminalizing every individual that undocumented here in the United States and criminalizing any individual that might have been indirectly helping that    that person  whether it was a minister  a member of the clergy or nonprofit organization or humane group that was trying to be involved in a feeding program or looking out after the people that had been in battered shelters  or whatever the humanitarian condition might have been  That is why Bishop Mahony  the cardinal in Los Angeles  said the house legislation was such a vicious piece of legislation    those aren t my words  Those are his  Now that was the position of the House of Representatives  and many of us who have worked on immigration issues believe that that was not the answer  The fact is it was the majority leader who introduced similar legislation here in the Senate of the United States  And that  to many of us  represented the position of the Republican Party  That was the position that was introduced by the majority leader  And there wasn t a great deal of turmoil or opposition at the time he did that  So that was where many thought that was going to be the position of the Republican Party  Now that is at least one aspect of this debate and discussion     Another aspect of it  some three and a half years ago  the senator from Arizona  Senator McCain  introduced legislation dealing in a more comprehensive way  rather than just law enforcement  looking at other factors just besides the law enforcement  Over three years ago I had introduced legislation that looked at a number of different aspects in terms of legalization  other kinds of approaches  but different from Senator McCain  At about that time Senator Hagel and Senator Daschle introduced different legislation  This is all before the 2004 election  And then after the election  when we saw that these different pieces of legislation were introduced  were not working  Senator McCain and I worked together  And then in May of 2005 introduced common legislation  And we were convinced of a number of things  We were convinced  first of all  about the importance of securing our borders from a national security point of view  To have all these individuals who are coming in here in the wake of 9 11  We don t know who they are  this presents a national security issue  if you have millions of Americans who are virtually underground because they re undocumented  this is a national security issue     When we find out that homeland security is worried about different cells in different parts of the country and we know we have millions of Americans that are subject to exploitation because they re undocumented  this is a national security issue  So we looked at it and said  well  what are the features that are going to be necessary to deal with national security    yes  that s very important    to deal with the fact that there is this magnet of the United States which is the American economy with strong individuals who want to provide for their families  work hard  play by the rules  but provide for their families  And they re offered those jobs by American employers  here  And people come over there  send money back to look after their children or after their families or develop a community  Many hard working individuals and many of these individuals enlisted in the armed forces of our country  More than 70 000 are in the armed forces of our country  Permanent resident aliens are in the armed forces serving in Iraq and Afghanistan     We said  so what is necessary is that we have to bring these people out of the shadows  How are we going to do that  We have to entice them out so that they feel that they can be a part of our American system  And how s that going to do it  Since they came across this line instead of waiting their turn  if they were to follow the immigration laws  we ll say you have to go to the back of the line  You have to go to the back of the line  You have to wait until that line is cleared up  You have to pay a fine  pay your taxes  abide by the laws of this country  work hard  demonstrate a hard working record  and then in 11 years from now    11 years from now    you are eligible to become an American citizen     How are we going to get them out of the shadows  Well  the other side says  well  we can t do that because that s amnesty  That s amnesty  It s very interesting  whenever you talk about the undocumented  in many instances men and women would work hard  trying to provide for their families  devoted to their religion  98  of the undocumented are working today  working  Qualities that we admire People that work hard  provide for their families  have beliefs in their god  are attentive to their church  caring for their children  all qualities we admire  Well  it s too bad  we re just going to send them back or criminalize them  We re going to send them back  So we have a difference here in the United States Senate     We have an agreement that we have to get a border and it has to be secure  We have the undocumented  and the question is how are we going to deal with them  And we have differences in this body  Many say we ve got to send them back  We heard speeches even earlier today say that we can t permit any circumstances that they remain here in this country  No talk about how they re going to do it  Of the 240 amendments that are here  I didn t see any asking for  240 billion and get the buses out there to ship them back  while their children  who are American citizens  are pleading that they remain here  And their children who are going to school and want their parents to say  no  no  let s just get a bumper sticker solution and call it amnesty  Bumper sticker  It s amnesty  Bumper sticker  bam  Rather than dealing with a complex issue  So  Senator McCain and I worked on this issue  We worked out the program  the penalties  the requirements for people that are here to be able to earn  earn their way towards the possibility of citizenship  Bring them out of the shadows  Treat them in a humane way  Understand that we ve got a problem and an issue here and as much as those on the other side of the aisle might belly ache about this solution  they haven t got any answer other than criminalizing it  That s the answer they have  criminalizing it  So we have what I consider a just solution  It may not be the right one  May not be  But at least it s the  I believe  and the majority of the American people believe that earning your way to be a citizen in this country is an acceptable way to treat these individuals  So then the issue comes in  look  we have a magnet here in the United States  Now we re talking about the border  How are we going to lessen the pressure on the border  Well  a number of things in our bill  One is that we want to try and cooperate with Mexico  the countries of Central America in terms of trying to work out more effective ways and means of being able to do it  I think there are a variety of different ways  The Mexican government has indicated that and I think there are a variety of different ways of trying to do that to lessen the pressure  We re basically the only proposal that gives any consideration to that whatsoever  And I think it can be extremely meaningful  We find the remittances that go back to Mexico to many of these communities  So many of the people that are here remitting funds because they care about their families and their communities  We could work with Mexico to lessen the pressure  We understand there s still going to be a magnet  So we say  okay  let s set a figure  We had a negotiation 400 000 figures for temporary workers  They do after four years have an opportunity to petition for a green card  and do after five more years  which would be nine years  be able to become an American citizen if they demonstrate they ve worked hard  paid their taxes  haven t run into troubles with the law  they can be able to do that  So we are saying we want to make the border secure in terms of the security issues  And we want to make it safe for people to come  And we want to a process so that the magnet  which is the American economy  will draw people in an orderly way  Not replace American jobs  Advertise and see if Americans are ready but if they can t  there are jobs Americans won t do  there will be a legal way for people to come in  And the person that is down in Mexico will have an alternative  Do you want to risk going across the desert and dying in the desert or do you want to go to your embassy and find out if there is a job which you re qualified for and go to the United States and have at least some job protection in the job that you have  That s the alternative  Legality  Legality  Legality in gaining entrance  illegal across the border  earning the legal position by earning your legalization  And then we have the enforcement provisions in the United States if employers are going to hire undocumented  then we have 5 000 individuals have got to be trained and equipped to be able to go after employers who are going to attempt to violate the law  The temporary workers gets the biometric card  presents to the employer and they know he Oregon she is employable  If they don t  it is documented and that person will be subject to penalties  It has never worked before  never tried before  But it s a legal process and a legal system  And what many of us are saying here tonight is we have a total kind of a package that talks about the border  talks about the temporary worker  talks about law enforcement  and talks about earned legalization  That is the package  That is the package that came on out of the Judiciary Committee 12 6  Not bits and pieces  Not just border security like the Republican Leader had  or like the House of Representatives had  That is the package  And it garnered 12 members of the Judiciary Committee  Republicans and Democrats alike  in a bipartisan way  After seven days of hearings  six days of mark ups and scores of different amendments  And what Senator Reid is talking about is why not let us have a vote on that particular approach  That particular approach to the challenge that we re facing in terms of immigration  Why is it so that there those that just want law enforcement fine  But why is it that those who worked and worked hard and looked at it and studied it and studied it hard and had days of hearings and a lot of work  why should we be denied the opportunity to have a vote on the total package  That s what we re being asked  We re being asked  well  let s split that package up somewhat  Let s try and divert it because    and I know there are those strongly opposed to it  I respect them  I ve heard them  I ve listened to them  I ve listened to them  They re on our Committee and strongly opposed to it  And I respect that  But aren t we entitled to at least a chance to have a vote on a comprehensive approach on something that is so  What s so difficult about it  I agree with the Senator from Mississippi  This is important  We ought to be continuing on this issue  It is of vital importance and consequence  It affects the lives of millions of people  We ve seen what s been out there across the country  500 000 people in southern California  100 000 people in Chicago  You re going to see next Monday in ten different cities more than a million  more than a million individuals that are out there demonstrating  So why aren t we dealing with this  Why don t we deal with it  And what many of us are asking  including myself  give us at least opportunity to vote on that  If that is not successful  if we can t get the majority here  then so be it  So be it  We have to find a different approach     Now  Mr  President  we talk about trying to work through these accommodations  I m always interested in listening to individuals  people that are concerned about this  and we have found  as I mentioned earlier in this debate with the extraordinary stories from our friend and colleague  a Senator from New Mexico  Senator Domenici  telling his life story  absolutely extraordinary story of his parents  and to listen to the good Senator from Florida  Martinez  talk about these issues  and to listen to my colleagues  Ken Salazar s relatives were here 250 years before any of our ancestors were here down in the southwest and out in Colorado  And listen to Bob Mendez  as well  listen to our other colleagues who have been in this  They understand the difficulty and the complexity     We do have a recommendation here from our Committee  and it does seem that in the life of this institution  we ought to be able to have a vote on that particular proposal  If it doesn t carry  then we ll have to deal with the other reality  But to deny opportunity to get that as well as to consider other amendments  as the Senator from Illinois pointed out  that will be relevant and current tomorrow after cloture  I think  would be an enormous loss  Now  Mr  President  I would certainly work and I m glad to work to try to reduce the differences of views in opinion  I think all of us are going through the learning experience as much as we know about immigration  We always learn more from talking with people that are concerned  interested and knowledgeable about these issues  And he legislative process always is an evolving process  I ve certainly observed that over an extensive period of time  So we re always interested  If there are ways that we can achieve the outlines that we talked about  at least from my point of view  then it makes sense  but what doesn t make sense is to try to separate different groups against each other  and that I find difficult to be able to accept  We can t have one group that s been here for a lengthy period of time  another group that s been here almost as long  have them treated in different kinds of ways  That really doesn t solve the issue  doesn t solve the problem  It might help some people in terms of how they re going to vote on a particular issue  but it really is not dealing with the substance  and we are interested in dealing with the substance  not just getting safe political positions for our colleagues    We want to get this legislation done  So we certainly want to try and find common ground right up until the very end  I ll certainly work in any way  I know others are thinking and working hard on it  This is  as has been pointed out by every speaker  too important a piece of legislation to let slip by  It s too important  But I m proud of the proposal that is before the Senate  I think it is the result of a great deal of thought and examination by a variety of our different colleagues from all parts of the country and with all different kinds of constituents  When you get an issue that is volatile as this and you have 12 6 and you have the kind of bipartisanship reflected in this  recognizing that those of us who support this proposal understand it s a total kind of an approach to the challenge  These single shot approaches have not worked  Let s just try here in the United States Senate to give an opportunity for this comprehensive approach  which is meaningful in terms of our national security  is enormously important in terms of economic progress  and most importantly is a reflection of our humanitarian values  Let s give that a chance  That is what we are hoping  and I hope the senate will give us that opportunity to do so    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
