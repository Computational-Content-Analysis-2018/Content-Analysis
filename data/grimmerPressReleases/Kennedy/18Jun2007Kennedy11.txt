         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC Today  as the Senate prepares to take up the Employee Free Choice Act with a possible vote on Thursday  Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement  Also below is a fact sheet on how the Act will help restore middle class security  Now that the House has passed the Employee Free Choice Act with bipartisan support  Im pleased that the Senate is moving forward on this important piece of legislation  Weve finally raised the minimum wage but we still have a long way to go to restore the economic security that has been lost during the Bush years  Working people aren t getting their fair share of our economic growth  Their hard work is producing skyrocketing corporate profits  not higher paychecks  better benefits  or better lives for their families  The best way to see that employees get their fair share is to give them a stronger voice  THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT RESTORES MIDDLE CLASS SECURITYThe Bush economy is not working for working Americans   Americans are working harder than ever in the Bush economy  Productivity has been rising and companies are making huge profits on the backs of their workers  Corporate profits are up by more than 83  since 2001    Inequality has also reached alarming levels  Today  more than 40  of total income is going to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans  the biggest gap in more than 65 years    Six million Americans have lost their health insurance  and their retirement security is fading as well  We have created an economy that works for Wall Street  but not Main Street  and working families are being left behind    Its little wonder that most Americans want a voice at work in these insecure times  In a recent survey  58 percent of Americans indicated they would join a union if they could  a record number  The freedom to choose a union is vital to restoring the American Dream  especially for the most vulnerable Americans    Unions help American workers get their fair share  union wages are almost 30  higher than non union wages  Unions are also a cure for rising inequality because they raise wages more for low  and middle wage workers than for higher wage workers   Union cashiers earn 46  more than non union cashiers   Union food preparation workers earn nearly 50  more than non union workers   Union maids and housekeepers earn 31  more than their non union counterparts    The freedom to join a union is a womens issue and a civil rights issue  Union women earn 31 percent more than women workers who dont have a union  African American union members earn 36 percent more  and Latino workers earn 46 percent more    Union workers are almost twice as likely to have employer sponsored health benefits and a pension at work  They are more than four times more likely to have a secure  defined benefit pension plan than non union workers    Protecting the freedom to choose a union benefits all Americans  whether or not they have a union at work  In industries and occupations where many workplaces are unionized  non union employers will frequently meet union standards or otherwise improve compensation  A high school graduate in a non union workplace whose industry is 25 percent unionized gets paid 5 percent more than similar workers in less unionized industries       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
