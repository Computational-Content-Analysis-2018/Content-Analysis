         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     It is welcome news and I commend Secretary Spellings for taking an important step to end the outrageous 9 5  student loan bank subsidy     The Congress should follow up right away to stop further abuse of this indefensible taxpayer subsidy and do all it can to clean up past abuses by big banks like Nelnet  We should invest scarce education dollars in students instead of bigger profits for banks    I have battled to close this corporate loophole for more than two years  and this is the first time we can say with real hope that its days are numbered  Hopefully  Republican Congressional leaders will drop their efforts to protect this unjustifiable loophole and heed the Secretary s call to close it once and for all     College aid is for students  not banks   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
