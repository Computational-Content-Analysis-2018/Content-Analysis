         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee introduced the Employee Free Choice Act  The bill will strengthen the middle class by giving workers the freedom to choose union representation  In todays economy  when productivity is rising and corporate profits are soaring but wages have been stagnant and workers are losing essential benefits like health care and pensions  the Employee Free Choice Act is essential to help working families get their fair share of our economic prosperity The identical bill  sponsored by Rep  George Miller  passed the House earlier this month  Below is Senator Kennedys full statement upon introduction  STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDYON THE INTRODUCTION OFTHE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT March 29  2006For far too long  weve acquiesced in a lop sided economy that benefits wealthy individuals and corporations  but not Americas working families  Tens of millions of our men and women are working harder than ever  but they arent receiving their fair share of the economy they helped do so much to create and sustain Since President Bush took office  corporate profits have increased 65 percent  Productivity is up 18 percent  But household income has declined  the wages of working Americans are stagnant  Six million have lost their health insurance  Their retirement is uncertain as wellonly 1 in 5 workers today has a guaranteed pension  In short  working families are finding that the American dream is beyond their reach  This injustice is worsening each year  and it is time for Congress to deal with it  The best way to see that employees receive their fair share of Americas prosperity is to give them a stronger voice in the workplace  Unions were fundamental in building Americas middle class  and they have a vital role today in preserving the American dream for working families  Unions can make all the difference between an economy thats fair  and an economy where working people are left behind  Union wages are 30 percent higher than non union wages  80 percent of union workers have health insurance  compared to only 49 percent of non union workers  Union members are 4 times more likely to have a secure  guaranteed pension No wonder most American workers want union representation  The question is  why dont more of them have it  The reason is clear  In 2005 alone  more than 30 000 workers were illegally fired or retaliated against for attempting to exercise their right to have a union in their workplace  Every 17 minutes  a worker is fired or punished in some illegal way for supporting a union  Unscrupulous employers routinely break the law to keep unions outthey intimidate employees  harass them  and discriminate against them  They shut down whole departmentsor even entire plantsto avoid negotiating a union contract  Its illegal and unacceptable  but it happens every day  Clearly  the current system is broken  It cant stop these illegal  anti worker  anti labor  anti union tactics that take place every day  The penalties are so minor that employers treat them as just another cost of doing business  Even when workers succeed in forming a union  they often cant obtain a first contract because management stonewalls them and refuses to negotiate  Half of all cases alleging that employers refused to bargain are filed during first contract negotiationsand in most of those cases  the National Labor Relations Board finds an unfair labor practice Year after year  Congress has refused to act against these union busting tactics that are now all too familiar in the workplace  Its time to listen to the voice of Americas working men and women  and give them what they want and deserve  a fair voice in the workplace and a fair chance at the American dream  Thats why Im reintroducing the Employee Free Choice Act today  This essential legislation will strengthen protections for workers freedom to choose union representation  It will restore their democratic right to join together for better wages  better benefits  and better working conditions  It will help millions of working men and women to build a better life for themselves and a better future for their children  Im proud to have 46 of my fellow Senators joining me in sponsoring this important bill  and I hope that all of my colleagues will support it
