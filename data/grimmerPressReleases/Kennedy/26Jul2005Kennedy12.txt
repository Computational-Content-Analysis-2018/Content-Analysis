         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The White House knows that their position on the Deputy Solicitor General papers is not sustainable for a position as important as the Supreme Court of the United States  This is a lifetime nomination to be one of nine people who literally make life or death decisions for all of us  Judge Roberts was a political appointee deciding policy matters at the Justice Department  and the White House certainly knew when they selected him that his decisions and opinions in that office would be vital for Senators to perform their constitutional duty during his confirmation process     In my 42 years on the Judiciary committee  we have received many internal Justice Department documents as least at sensitive as these  even for confirmation proceedings that don t come close to the importance of a Supreme Court appointment  There is no privilege  there is no rule  and there is no logic that would bar us from getting these documents  and we need them to determine on behalf of the American people whether this nominee should be placed on the nation s highest court     We have four weeks to examine John Roberts record  and for the White House to set up a confrontation is counterproductive to proceeding on this nomination in a dignified manner  Instead of midnight press releases and staged photo ops with thousands of very old documents that will not give the Senate much insight into John Roberts  more recent views and record as a high federal official  the White House should acknowledge the importance of this process and agree to provide the vital information we need  The White House probably knew what was in these papers when they selected him  or now knows what they contain  The United States Senate and the American people also are entitled to know what the White House knows about John Roberts   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
