         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           The message from this election is clear   Theres little doubt that the American people want a change of course in Iraq   But they also want a government that stands with them and their families as they look to the future  jobs that reward their hard work  health care that is good and affordable  and education that continues to open the door to the American dream for all of our citizens            That was the agenda of the voters in this election and it will be the agenda of our Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee when we convene in the new year   And with Senator Reid as our majority leader  Americas families will see great progress on the issues that they care most about  Yesterday  Democrats selected the membership of our committee   Every member is an experienced legislator with a deep commitment to working families and a solid record for getting things done   So I welcome back Senator Dodd  Senator Harkin  Senator Mikulski  Senator Bingaman  Senator Murray  Senator Jack Reed and Senator Clinton   And I welcome our new members   Senator Obama  Senator elect Sanders and Senator elect Brown          I am also grateful to continue working together with Chairman Enzi   The gavel may change hands  but our partnership will not   Hes a true leader and has set the standard for fairness and statesmanship  and I look forward to working with him on the many issues before the Committee in the next Congress  My first priority will be to increase the minimum wage  Americans are working harder than ever  but millions of hard working men and women across the country arent getting their fair share   Were not rewarding work fairly anymore  and working families are falling behind  The minimum wage has been stuck at  5 15 an hour for almost 10 years   A minimum wage worker who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year still makes just  10 700 a year 6 000 below the poverty line for a family of three   In this era of skyrocketing costs  these hardworking Americans are forced to make impossible choicesbetween paying the rent or buying food  between paying for gas or paying the doctor   Americans understand fairness  and they know this is unfair   Thats why the American people took the battle into their own hands this year   They pounded the pavements for months to put minimum wage increases on the ballot in six states this year   And all six of these ballot initiatives passed by decisive margins   If there is one message from this election that emerged loud and clear  its that no one who works for a living should have to live in poverty   Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will benefit almost 15 million Americans   It will help more than 7 3 million children whose parents will receive a raise  Minimum wage workers serve in many of the most difficult and most important jobs in our society   They care for children in day care centers  and for the elderly in nursing homes   They clean office buildings  hotel rooms  and restaurants across the country   They are men and women of dignity  and they deserve a fair wage that respects the dignity of their work   Its long past time to give minimum wage workers a raise             Another high priority is to remove the barriers to lifesaving stem cell research          We are in the era of the life sciences  and no area of medical research has more promise than stem cell research to speed the search for new cures for diabetes  Parkinsons Disease  cancer  and many other serious illnesses           Thanks to the courage of leaders such as Michael J  Fox  the people of Missouri last week chose hope over fear by approving a constitutional amendment to allow stem cell research          Congress should learn from that example   Last year  a broad bipartisan majority approved legislation to tear down the barriers that have kept NIH scientists from realizing the full potential of this research   That bill was rejected by the President  but hope can never be vetoed          We will be back again and again next year until we succeed in overturning the restrictions on stem cell research that hinder the search for new cures  and delay the day when the hope of a better future becomes a reality for patients across America        We must also address the crisis in college affordability that affects every low and middle income family and that threatens our economic progress   It is more important than ever for our citizens to have a college education so they can compete in the global economy and have a fair chance at the American Dream   But because of soaring college costs  stagnant student aid and heavy student loan debt  its becoming increasingly difficult for our citizens to get such an education   Today  students and families are pinching every penny to save for college  but its not enough   Each year  400 000 low income students do not attend a four year college because of cost factors   Student debt is also a barrier to the pursuit of vital but lower paying professions like teaching  public health  and social work   Last year  we passed an increase in student aid through the Senate only to see our proposals die in the House   With the House and Senate under new management  next year we will provide needed help to families struggling to put their children through college   We will increase Pell Grants from  4 050 to  5 100  We will cap college loan payments to no more than 15  of your income   We will cut student loan interest rates   We will reform the student loan program so it works for students and not just the banks   And well use the savings to increase student aid           And at long last  we can no longer ignore the need for health care reform   We must reduce the cost of health and we must make it available to each and every American  Every Member of the Senate  and their staffs  and every federal employee has a sense of security about health care that is denied to millions of Americans   Members of Congress know that if we get sick  or if our children need medical care  our health insurance plan will cover virtually all of the costs          Tens of millions of our fellow citizens have no such guarantee   Nearly fifty million Americans lack health care coverage entirely  and tens of millions more have inadequate coverage   In a nation with the best doctors and finest hospitals in the world  it is profoundly wrong that so many Americans suffer from illnesses that could have been prevented or treated more effectively    if only health care had been available and affordable          The time is long overdue to address the crisis in health care   Bipartisan health care reform is possible  and our first step toward it should be effective legislation to strengthen and re authorize CHIP  the program that provides quality health care for 4 million children          But our experience with health reform in Massachusetts showed that we can do more   We proved that people from all parts of the political spectrum can come together to provide health care for all   So this  too  is one of our top goals for the coming Congress           Together  we can  we must    make the promise of this century of the life sciences a reality for all Americans by seeing that every American has quality  affordable health care   These are our top priorities for the new year  but they are not our only priorities  We must pass the CLASS Act and create a long term care infrastructure in this country that will support every Americans choice to live at home and be part of their community   Every older or disabled American has this right  and its our job in Congress to provide them with the support they need to make this a reality             We will strengthen early learning opportunities  starting at birth  for each of our children   Prevention works in health care and it can work in education as well             We must also ensure that our schools are equipped to meet the challenges of the global economy   Our nations future depends on many things  but certainly one of the most important measures of the strength of our democracy is the excellence of our public schools   This year  well revisit the reforms contained in the No Child Left Behind Act   The law charted a sound course for American education four years ago  but its time for us to reshape our commitment and provide better solutions for schools to respond to the challenges identified by the law   These reforms are right and were ready to work with President Bush  as we did five years ago   But given the many failures of implementation by his Administration and the meager commitments to education reform in his budgets  the President has a high hurdle to cross to demonstrate that he is seriously committed to these reforms           In addition  we must give workers a stronger voice in their own futures and in meeting the needs of their families  We must protect workers right to join together and fight for better wages and working conditions  free from employer intimidation   Workers need opportunities to improve their skills through job training programs   And families deserve paid sick days to care for loved ones without fear of losing their jobs      Americans who have worked a lifetime to provide for their families deserve to retire in dignity  not in poverty   We must ensure our retirement system works for all Americans  not just corporate executives  We can make bipartisan progress  too  on measures that will improve health care and reduce costs  not by denying services to patients  but by improving efficiency and effectiveness   Congress should aid doctors  hospitals  and patients improve their use of electronic medical records  and we should explore responsible ways to reward the quality of health care  not just the quantity of care  And we must fulfill our duty through our hearings and our legislative program to ensure that government is working for the people  That we have strong laws to keep workers safe on the job and that workers are fairly paid   That student loans work for students and not just the banks  That students are protected from exploitation in the private student loan market   That prescription drugs we rely on and the food we eat is safe   That the workers that risked their lives for others on 9 11 are cared for as they deal now with the illness and injury  These will be my priorities as Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee next year   They come directly out of this election where the American people spoke loud and clear   And I look forward to working with my colleagues to make important progress for Americas families   OVERVIEW OF HELP COMMITTEE ISSUES FOR THE 110th CONGRESS HEALTH 1         Expanding access to affordable healthcare   Medicare provides quality health care for more than 40 million Americans  Administrative costs are low and satisfaction is high   The most straightforward way to see that every American has affordable  quality health care is to extend Medicare to all citizens   Senator Kennedy and Representative Dingell introduced the Medicare for All legislation to do just that   This proposal should be the starting point for discussions on achieving universal coverage   In Massachusetts  all parts of the political spectrum came together to reach a solution that everyone could support  and that bipartisan spirit of compromise is a model for success in Washington too   2          Stem Cell Research   We are in the era of the life sciences  and no area of medical research has more promise than stem cell research to speed the search for new cures for diabetes  Parkinsons Disease  cancer  and many other serious illnesses   A broad bipartisan majority in both chambers of Congress approved legislation to tear down the barriers that have kept NIH scientists from realizing the full potential of this research   The President vetoed that bill last year  but Congress will keep working to overcome the Presidents opposition   3          Health IT   The Wired for Health Quality Act  sponsored by Frist  Enzi  Kennedy  and Clinton  improves the quality and efficiency of health care through better use of health information technology  which will reduce administrative costs and diminish medical  errors  4          Medicare Part D   Senators Kennedy and Stabenow have introduced legislation to lower the cost of drugs by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate discounted prices directly with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of beneficiaries   Negotiating discounted prices will result in lower expenses for seniors and savings for Medicare that can be applied to improving the drug benefit by filling the gap in coverage known as the doughnut hole  5          CHIP reauthorization   CHIP has been one of the health care success stories of recent years   It provides quality care for 4 million children who would otherwise go without   It is essential to build on the promise of CHIP by not only extending the program  but strengthening it as well   We should finish the job that the original CHIP legislation started by covering all children    6          FDA Regulation of tobacco products  Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America  Empowering the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products is long overdue  Effective FDA regulation will help to deter young people from starting to smoke and to assist current smokers in quitting  Senator Kennedy authored FDA legislation to give the FDA this authority  It passed the Senate twice but was blocked by the House Republican leadership  Enacting this important public health legislation should be a top priority for the new Congress  7         CLASS Act  Today  the only option for most Americans who develop severe functional impairments is Medicaid  Their reliance on Medicaid for critical functional support services creates the strong incentive for them to get rid of assets and remain unemployed  The CLASS Act will create a new insurance program to help more than 10 million individuals who develop severe functional impairments remain independent                                                                                                                                            EDUCATION 1       Enacting a higher education reauthorization that makes college affordable   Senator Kennedys proposals to help students and families include the STAR Act  Debt Relief Act and the Contract for Educational Opportunity Grants in the Right TRACK Act   Senator Kennedys top priorities for reauthorization are increasing student aid  making student loan debt more manageable and making sure our student loan programs work for students  not banks   He also will be looking to expand support for and improve teacher preparation programs   2         Funding and reauthorizing the No Child Left Behind Act    Democrats will make education funding a priority so NCLB can fulfill its promise  As Chairman  Senator Kennedy will advance an NCLB reauthorization agenda that seeks to strengthen key reforms  ensure the laws effectiveness  and promote solutions and strategies for schools to improve  Senator Kennedys priorities for reauthorization include ensuring that tests are used to improve instruction  not just labeling schools  and ensuring that students struggling to meet high standards have the best teachers and expanded learning opportunities  He also has a proposal to ensure that parents are given the information that they need to navigate the education system and help their children succeed            3        Ensuring that our students are competitive in the 21st Century global economy   Many of Senator Kennedys proposals on this theme are in the Right Track Act   They include increasing college student aid  greater support for math and science education  and creating incentives for high quality teachers    especially in high demand subjects such as math and science    to teach in high poverty schools  as well as assistance to states to raise standards and ensure that schools are internationally competitive    4       Reauthorizing the Head Start federal preschool program and enacting Senator Kennedys Early Care and Education Act  ECEA   so that all children can have access to high quality early childhood programs   ECEA would provide support to states to create a more cohesive system of early childhood education programs and improve standards for programs and educators in the early childhood arena    5        Reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act and provide additional funding for job training programs so workers can obtain the skills they need to succeed in todays global economy   6        Fully funding IDEA  LABOR AND PENSIONS 1      Raising the Minimum Wage   Senator Kennedys bill will raise the minimum wage to  7 25 per hour in three steps over a two year period  This increase will give nearly 15 million Americans a well earned raise  including the parents of more than seven million children   This increase will give a family with one minimum wage earner another  4 400 a year to spend on education  child care  paying the rent  or putting decent food on the table    2      Promoting paid sick days for workers   Over half of American workers do not have paid sick days  Senator Kennedys Healthy Families Act will guarantee working Americans seven paid sick days to care for their own and their families medical needs  Providing paid sick days will build strong families  protect our children  and safeguard our public health    3     Protecting Workers Right to Organize  In todays insecure economy  when too many working families are struggling just to make ends meet  it is more important than ever that workers have a voice at work   Senator Kennedys Employee Free Choice Act helps workers get their fair share of our nations economic growth by supporting the basic right of workers to choose their own representative  It puts real teeth in the law by strengthening the penalties for discrimination against workers who favor a union   And it will allow employees to choose a union when a majority of them sign an authorization designating a union as their bargaining representative   4     Strengthening Retirement Security  Workers deserve to retire in dignity  not in poverty  Senator Kennedys priorities include expanding retirement security for all American workers and finding ways to prevent corporations from using the bankruptcy courts to dump workers pensions while awarding big bonuses to executives  He will also continue the fight to protect Social Security    5      Strengthening Worker Safety   Too many American workers still face hazardous conditions at work  Senator Kennedy wants to make all workplaces safer by passing the Protecting Americas Workers Act to cover more workers  give families a role in safety investigations  strengthen protections for whistleblowers  and increase penalties for repeated safety violators  He will build on the MINER Act to make additional advances in mine safety legislation  Kennedy also plans to exercise close oversight over MSHA and OSHA to ensure that they vigorously enforce our safety laws and issue needed safety standards    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
