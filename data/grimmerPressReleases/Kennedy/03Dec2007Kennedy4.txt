         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      As Prepared for Delivery   In an address in Virginia the day before Thanksgiving  President Bush described America as a nation of great prosperity with a strong and growing economy where it is possible for people of all backgrounds to rise in society and realize their dreams  As we return from Thanksgiving and look to the Christmas season  wed all like to believe that vision  We all want to live in a land of opportunity where  with hard work and sacrifice  we can make our dreams come true      But for too many  this vision of the American Dream is nothing but a holiday fairy tale  Working families across the nation are facing a very different picture  rising gasoline prices  high health care costs  and skyrocketing mortgage payments  Parents are losing sleep at night wondering how they will pay for their youngest childs asthma treatment  or how to tell their oldest that they cant afford to send her back to college next year  For these families  Christmas presents and holiday travel must be sacrificed to pay winter heating bills and send children to the doctor  The holidays will be about struggling to balance the family budget  not celebrating the season      This is not just the usual holiday stress  American families are truly frightened about the future  Theyre scared about their jobs  their health  their kids  and their elderly parents  There is a deep and pervasive anxiety spreading across the country  According to a recent Gallup poll  78  of Americans think the economy is getting worse  Only 13  say its getting better  Parents are increasingly worried about their childrens economic futures  only 23  of American parents think their children will be better off than they are     We have entered a new age of economic insecurity  Middle class families are struggling in quiet desperation  living on credit card debt  watching their high risk mortgages balloon out of control  and wondering what they will do if their children become ill  or their jobs are sent overseas  Too many families feel like they are walking on a tightrope and losing their balance  with nothing to catch them if they fall  All they can do is keep struggling and sacrificing  and pray for better days ahead      But we can do more  The American people elected us to make their lives  and their childrens lives better  There is a looming crisis facing tens of millions of American families  and they cant wait any longer for our help  Its time to embrace new ideas and take bold steps to build a stronger foundation for working families     The new insecurity is affecting every Main Street in America  Families are strapped for cash  and crunched for time  For a middle class family trying to live on a budget  the numbers dont add up  Since President Bush took office  the cost of health insurance has risen 38   Housing prices are up 39   It costs 43  more to send a child to college  Even everyday items have seen substantial inflation the price of a tank of gas has gone up 66   A gallon of milk costs 12  more  a pound of ground beef is up 13   and a dozen eggs costs almost 50  more      Peoples paychecks arent close to keeping up with these spiraling costs  Wages have increased only 5   not nearly enough to keep pace with a familys essential expenses  As a result  Americans are forced to worker longer and harder to try to make up the difference    They work more hours  and take fewer days off  than employees in almost any other industrialized country  39 million Americans28 percent of the workforcework more than 40 hours a week  Almost 8 million people work more than one job  Its exhausting  and its unhealthy  but its the only way to make ends meet     These longer hours at work mean less time for family  Parents cant attend a parent teacher conference or take their child to the doctor when theyre out looking for a second job  They cant help with homework or read a bedtime story when theyre working a double shift  Working parents in the sandwich generation are particularly under pressure putting in long hours at work  and struggling to care for their children and elderly relatives as well  Theyre stressed to the breaking point trying to balance the jobs they need and the families they love    Despite their best efforts  working families cant get ahead  The average American family has about  3800 in the bank and about  2200 in credit card debt  They have a mortgage to pay or rent past due  and there is just nothing to fall back on if theres an accident  a job loss  or a serious illness      Families on the brink too often fall off  Over the last year  the number of families facing home foreclosure nearly doubled  There have been almost 225 000 foreclosure filings in the last month alone  225 000 in a single month  Thats not just a number  Thats hundreds of thousands of families that are losing their grip on the American Dream  and thats just the tip of the iceberg  The number of families facing bankruptcy has risen 40   Thats thousands more families facing the shame of spiraling debt  who will need years to get their financial futures back on track      Its not just the heavy squeeze on their time and their budgets that is making Americans so anxious  Its the breakdown of the fundamental promise of opportunity that should be the hallmark of this great nation     It used to be that if you had a good job  you had genuine security  You could support a family  put your children through college  and plan your retirement  You could count on a stable middle class lifestyle  and provide even better opportunities for your children      In todays economy  you can do everything right  go to college  earn your degree  get a good  professional job  and still not have real security  Even successful companies are cutting back or eliminating health insurance and pension benefits  Even good jobs can be offshored or outsourced  Loyal workers can be replaced with temps  or reclassified as independent contractors with no benefits  In the new economy  uncertainty and instability is the rule  not the exception  Any American can go to work in the morning and find their world turned upside down  through no fault of their own     This new economic turmoil is shaking the foundations of our economy and our society    Its becoming harder and harder to achieve permanent membership in the middle class  Incomes are volatile  More and more solidly middle class families face the very real possibility of suffering a major financial crisis at any time  Half of American families will see their income drop in the next two years  One in five see their income drop by more than half from one year to the next      It is also increasingly difficult for parents to build a stable future for their children  Most parents want to provide better opportunities for them  but its far more difficult to do so  particularly in minority communities  Children of middle income African American families are falling out of the middle class at an alarming rate  Nearly half these children end up in poverty  falling to the bottom 20  of the economic ladder  Thats shocking  that in the 21st century people of color still face huge system wide barriers that prevent them from passing their economic advantages on to their children     Perhaps most alarming of all  economic opportunity seems to be bypassing the poorest Americans altogether  This country is supposed to be a place where the rags to riches story can come true  Thats what we tell our children so they will work hard and strive to achieve  But in todays insecure economy  if you find yourself at the bottom  its almost impossible to move up  42 percent of todays adults who were born to poor parents remain poor  If you start at the bottom  youre likely to stay there     It didnt used to be this way  We used to be a nation of shared prosperity  where economic growth benefited all working families  and a stable middle class was the firm foundation of our economy  This past era of prosperity was not the result of chance  it was the product of responsible choices by both government leaders and the private sector      In those years  our goal in public policy was to spread wealth and opportunity across the economic spectrum  and to have a strong safety net in place to catch families who met roadblocks on the road to prosperity  If we were sick  we had health insurance  If we were laid off  we had unemployment insurance and decent savings to fall back on  and another good job was just around the corner      But in recent years  weve made different choices  Employers are abandoning their commitment to workers  Government security programs are inadequate and under funded  The gaps in our economic safety net have widened  and too many families are falling through the cracks                 Its time for a new approach to economic security that will give hope to the hardworking families struggling to stay afloat  We cant reclaim the American dream by tinkering at the margins  we need to ask the tough questions  and embrace the new ideas capable of restoring the vitality of the American middle class and renewing the promise of economic opportunity for working families     As we look to the future  we need to start now to address our economic challenges head on  so that we can strengthen the safety net for working families  and create real opportunities for workers to move up the economic ladder     First  we need to safeguard working families from the turbulence of the modern economy by providing stronger and better support for families in crisis     Our country is going through profound economic shifts  and too many workers are losing their jobs in the wake of these changes  Ive already introduced vital  bipartisan legislation  the Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act  to make sure that those who have worked hard and paid into the system get the benefits they deserve      I hope well see progress on that bill soon  but there is much more that needs to be done to assist Americans struggling to find a job      We also need an aggressive agenda to help families facing a health crisis  A troubling diagnosis should not be a ticket to bankruptcy  Too many working families cant afford health coverage  while others cant get it at any cost because they are not in perfect health or because they work in a job that the insurance industry has decided is too risky  Massachusetts has taken the lead in making sure all our residents have access to quality health care  We need to do the same at the national level to make sure that all Americans share this fundamental right     We must enhance retirement security for our workers  so that everyone has the opportunity and the ability to save for a secure future  Much more needs to be done to ensure that all Americans have both the means and opportunity to retire in dignity and good health      We also need to increase our support for caregivers  so that working men and women can cope with the relentless pressures of everyday life  For too many Americans  even a minor illness means a cruel choice between losing their job  or neglecting their sick child or sick spouse at home  We need to make paid sick days a basic economic right  like a fair minimum wage or a safe workplace  We need to give workers greater flexibility on the job  so they can spend more time with their families  more time at their childrens schools  and more time volunteering in their communities     But strengthening the safety net alone is not enough  We need to redouble our efforts to restore economic opportunity for working families      Americans are working harder than ever  but they are not reaping the benefits  More and more of our economic growth is going to those at the very top of the economic ladder  leaving middle class families and low wage workers struggling to get by      We need to make work pay fairly again  by restoring the promise that working hard will provide security and opportunities for the future  The obvious way to help workers obtain their fair share is to give them a stronger voice on the job  We need labor law reforms like the Employee Free Choice Act to protect the right to organize so that employees can stand up and fight for whats fair on the job      But thats just a first step  We need to encourage companies to provide good jobs with good wages and benefits  and deter them from shipping jobs overseas  We need to stop the illegal misclassification of workers as independent contractors  and protect workers overtime rights  We must reform our upside down tax laws so they will reward work instead of wealth  We should expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to help those at the bottom of the economic ladder who work hard and play by the rules  And we need to build on this years major victory for minimum wage workers by making sure that these hardworking Americans never again have to wait ten years for a raise      Its long past time to put working families back on the national agenda  and to restore the hope and opportunity they deserve      As the late  great Barbara Jordan once said  What the people want is very simple  They want an America as good as its promise  The promise of America is that it is truly a land of opportunity  where every working family can share in the nations prosperity  where we all rise together  and we can be confident that our children have a bright future      For decades we enjoyed that vision of shared prosperity  Im confident we can make that promise a reality for American families again  We owe it to all the workers that have seen their bills go up  while their paychecks go down  We owe it to all the parents that cant sleep at night because theyre worried about their childrens future  We owe it to all the families that are struggling  and need a reason to celebrate this holiday season  We owe the American people our best efforts  and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the weeks and months ahead to put working families back on track               Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
