         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today the Government Accountability Office released findings of their recent investigation into the Head Start National Reporting System  The GAO study highlights problems in the quality of the Head Start test and raises concerns about its future use in Head Start programs  GAO s findings reveal that the Head Start Bureau lacks data to show that the test actually measures the progress of children in Head Start programs  and failed to control for the validity and reliability of the assessment    Any assessment used in Head Start must be valid and reliable  fair to children from all backgrounds  and balanced in what it measures  said Senator Kennedy  Congress must have an opportunity to resolve these issues in the context of this year s reauthorization of Head Start  and consider the impact of this assessment on children    The National Reporting System  NRS  is a standardized test  developed by the Bush Administration in 2003  to measure the skills and progress of over 400 000 4  and 5  year olds in Head Start programs  The test is intended to measure how well Head Start is helping children progress and develop skills before their kindergarten year     While I am supportive of finding ways to measure the progress of Head Start children  the GAO raises important questions about the soundness of the NRS test  said Senator Dodd  At this stage  the test fails to give us an accurate picture of how well Head Start children are doing  These kids deserve better    This report confirms that the National Reporting System does not provide useful information that can be used to improve local Head Start programs  Further  the report says the NRS is not a tool that should be used to measure accountability  But perhaps more alarming is the fact that the Spanish language version of the NRS is even less reliable than its English language counterpart  It is clear that the NRS is of very limited benefit  Senator Bingaman said    This new report sheds light on the inequities in the Bush Administration s assessment of children participating in Head Start  For decades  this critical program has helped ensure that children enter school ready and able to learn  We cannot let a flawed assessment undermine a proven program  If we are going to assess children in Head Start  let s get it right  said Senator Clinton    Laura Capps  Kennedy   202 224 2633 Sean Oblack  Dodd   202  224 5372 Jude McCartin  Bingaman   202  224 1804 Sarah Gegenheimer  Clinton   202  224 4451
