         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I welcome Mr  McNulty to the Committee  I congratulate him on his nomination  and I commend him for his long career in public service    The Deputy Attorney General is one of the most important positions in the federal government  It involves overseeing the day to day functions of the Department of Justice  implementing policies and regulations  and seeing that our criminal and civil laws are enforced in a fair and impartial manner     The nomination comes at a time when many of us are concerned that the White House is abusing its power  excusing and authorizing torture  spying on American citizens and undermining the rights and liberties of our people    Prisoner abuse by military personnel is an important concern  The images from Abu Ghraib horrified us  and severely damaged our reputation in the Middle East and around the world    President Bush promised accountability  Yet the only prosecutions we ve seen have been of low level soldiers involved in the abuse  Only one C I A  official has been charged    The administration authorized many of these harsh techniques at the highest levels  under a radical new definition of Presidential power  Mr  McNulty  as the Deputy Attorney General  will be called on to assess the legality of such actions  His views on the reach of the President s power will be very important  and very relevant for this hearing     Congress and the American people deserve full and honest answers about the Administration s domestic electronic surveillance activities  There is no legitimate purpose in denying access by Members of Congress to all of the legal analysis that the President relied upon when he authorized these activities  Instead of providing us with the documents the Administration relied upon  the Justice Department continues to circulate summaries and white papers on the legal authorities it purports to have to ignore the law  It now appears that the President did so on at least thirty occasions after September 11th     Next Monday  the Committee begins hearings on this issue  but the President continues to give press conferences rather than providing Congress with real information     In 2001  the Administration sought a change to the law so that  in an emergency  they could wait 72 hours    instead of 24    to notify a court about wiretapping activities  Now  the Administration claims that 72 hours is not enough  even though they asked for 72 hours in 2001     The Administration has made a unilateral decision that Congressional and judicial oversight can be discarded  in spite of what the law obviously requires  This is about the fundamental values in our society    credibility  candor  competency and compliance with the law  We need a thorough investigation of these activities  Congress and the American people deserve answers  and they deserve answers now     The Department of Justice also plays a vital role in enforcing civil rights  and anyone confirmed to a leadership position in the Department must understand the importance of that role  The passing of Coretta Scott King reminds us of how much was sacrificed to make progress on the civil rights  and how much must still be done to achieve true equality     When the Department fails to do its job effectively  civil rights enforcement suffers  because private plaintiffs lack the resources  the expertise  and often the information that would enable them to bring cases successfully     Today  however  the Department seems to have abandoned its enforcement duties in some of the most important areas of civil rights  We re disturbed by recent reports that the Department s enforcement of the Voting Rights Act has become politicized  particularly in decisions on pre clearance of changes in state voting laws under Section 5 of the Act  In the past five years  it has filed only one case involving a pattern or practice of job discrimination based on race or national origin  It s brought only 3 cases under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act  which prohibits denying or diluting the right to vote based on race  national origin  or language minority status    none of which were brought on behalf of African Americans  The Appellate Section of the Civil Rights Division has filed very few amicus briefs defending civil rights in the federal courts of appeals  If confirmed  ensuring fair and non political civil rights enforcement must be among Mr  McNulty s top priorities    Another concern is the disturbing changes in the immigration court system  Most of the problem results from streamlining regulations that have impaired due process rights  Public criticism of immigration judges has increased by federal court judges    Immigration decisions can have a profound impact on human lives  The interests at stake are significant  especially for asylum seekers  who may face persecution or even death  The Attorney General has asked the Deputy Attorney General to lead a comprehensive review of the immigration courts  I trust that if confirmed  Mr  McNulty will conduct a thorough review of the immigration courts and restore fairness and integrity in this important process    I commend Mr  McNulty on his nomination and I look forward to his responses to these concerns      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
