         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  legislation put forth by Senator Edward M  Kennedy and colleagues  Senators Mike Enzi  Hillary Clinton and Orrin Hatch to modernize health care for the 21st century successfully was introduced in the United States Senate  Patient care declines in quality when physicians do not have access to timely information about the patients they serve and health care costs skyrocket when tests or procedures are duplicated because critical records are missing or inaccessible  Wasting scarce health care dollars on needless administrative costs drives up insurance premiums  and means that care is less affordable and less available  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act of 2007 sets forth the goal posts for improving health care through technology  reducing administrative costs and diminishing fatal errors caused by lack of information Senator Kennedy said  We have a responsibility to make the miracles of modern medicine available to every American  However  in our health care system  medical errors are all too common and coordination of care is often poor  Rising costs are crushing our health care system Senator Enzi said  Time is of the essence  without uniform standards  the industry is moving forward in a fragmented and disjointed direction  By passing this bill  we can establish an interconnected  nationwide health technology system to improve the quality of care in this country  This bill will eliminate duplicative tests and reduce medical errors  Moving from a paper based health care system to secure electronic medical records will save lives and reduce skyrocketing health care costs  Senator Clinton said  Americans are blessed with access to the most advanced medical care in the world  but burdened with a healthcare system that is plagued by medical errors  wasteful duplication and other inefficiencies that jeopardize patient safety and contribute to skyrocketing healthcare costs  Harnessing the power of health information technology will help make our healthcare system more efficient  more effective and help make sure precious health care dollars are used wisely  Senator Hatch said  Were facing a Tower of Babel in health care  If we dont act  well soon have completely different standards for publicly and privately insured patients  That will seriously impair the improvements in care that we all want to see through the use of health information technology  We simply cant miss this chance IT systems are linked securely and with strong privacy protections to a patients medical records and can improve care by warning a doctor or nurse if an order or prescription may harm a patient  These systems can issue reminders for screening tests  so that needed preventive care is not overlooked  Computerized records also allow doctors to look at a patients entire medical record at once  improving care coordination in our fragmented health care system The savings from better IT use are enormous  The Federal governments estimate is that the nation would save  140 billion each year from proper IT use  These savings from health IT could cut the cost of a familys insurance policy by over  700which equates to approximately a month of free health care  Despite the benefits of investment in health IT  utilization is low  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act of 2007 will give health care providers the assistance they need to invest in lifesaving health IT The Wired for Health Care Quality ActInformation technology is transforming all aspects of our modern society  but adoption of IT within health care has progressed slowly  IT systems linked securely and with strong privacy protections to patients medical records can improve the quality and efficiency of care while producing significant cost savings  Despite the potential benefits of health IT  investment and adoption has been limited  particularly among smaller providers who are most affected by the financial cost of implementing a health IT system  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act would give health care providers the assistance they need to invest in lifesaving health IT The legislation encourages the development of standards for health IT through  Codifying the role of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in coordinating the policies of federal agencies regarding health IT   Establishing a publicprivate partnership known as the Partnership for Health Care Improvement to provide recommendations to the Secretary with regard to technical aspects of interoperability  standards  implementation specifications  and certification criteria for the exchange of health information  The National Coordinator will serve as a liaison to the Partnership  The legislation also requires the Secretary to publish a schedule for assessment of standards for significant use cases after consulting with the Partnership   Requiring all Federal IT purchases conform to the standards recommended by the Partnership and adopted by the President  Adoption of these standards is voluntary for private entities   Establishing the American Health Information Community as a body providing recommendations to the Secretary regarding policies to promote the development of a nationwide interoperable health information technology infrastructure  These include recommendations regarding patient privacy  information security  and appropriate uses of health information  The legislation assures strong privacy protections for electronic health information by  Requiring that the national strategy on health IT includes strong privacy protections  including methods to notify patients if their medical information is wrongfully disclosed  The legislation encourages the adoption of qualified health IT to improve the quality and efficiency of care by  Providing grants for the purchase of health IT systems to providers demonstrating financial need   Providing grants to states to establish low interest loan programs to help providers acquire health IT systems that will improve the quality and efficiency of health care   Providing grants to facilitate the implementation of regional or local health information plans to improve health care quality and efficiency through the electronic exchange of health information The legislation will help providers use IT to improve quality by  Providing grants to integrate qualified health IT in the clinical education of health professionals and encourage the use of decision support software to reduce medical errors   Requiring the Secretary to designate a single organization to develop healthcare performance measures   Establishing a Health Information Technology Resource Center where IT users can learn from the previous experience of others who have implemented qualified health IT       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
