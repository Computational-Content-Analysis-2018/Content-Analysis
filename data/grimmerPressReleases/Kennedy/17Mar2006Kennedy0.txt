         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on Senator Frist s immigration bill  Senator Frist is prescribing the wrong medicine  We can t fix a broken immigration system with enforcement alone  We ve tried that before and it doesn t work  We also have to deal with the 12 million undocumented workers who are living here  working here  paying taxes here  raising their U S  citizen children here  and contributing to our economy  Countless businesses rely heavily on their labor and its long past time to provide legal avenues to bring this underground economy out of the shadows  The Judiciary Committee is doing good work to reach a bipartisan  tough but fair solution to this challenge  and it deserves adequate time to produce a bill that will solve the problem  not make it worse  Below are statistics about enforcement  from the National Immigration Forum  Over the last 20 years  border enforcement has ballooned  In 1986  the budget for the Border Patrol was  151 million  By 2002  the Border Patrol budget had reached  1 6 billiona tenfold increase  Between 1986 and 2002  the number of hours agents spent patrolling the border grew by a factor of about eight  By 2002 the Border Patrol was the largest arms bearing branch of the U S  government  excluding the military  Building a fence along the entire southwest border would cost roughly  9 billionabout  2 5 billion more than the total budget of U S  Customs and Border Protection in FY 2005 The border buildup has failed  Undocumented immigration has skyrocketed  Despite a dramatic increase in border enforcement  each year from 1990 to 2004 there were between 480 000 and 660 000 undocumented immigrants entering the U S  In all  nearly 9 million undocumented immigrants arrived after 1990  Since the mid 1990s  the number of undocumented immigrants entering the country has been slightly larger than the number of immigrants coming legally  The increase in border enforcement has led to an increase in the number of immigrants dying while crossing the border  From January 1995 through March 2004  more than 2 640 migrants died  In the last four years there has been on average more than one death per day  A record 460 migrants lost their lives this past year  according to the U S  Border Patrol Enforcement policies have backfired  We are spending more and succeeding less in controlling the border  Through the 1970s and early 1980s  the probability of apprehension along the border averaged 33   By 2002  the probability had dropped to 5   The cost of making an arrest along the border has increased from  300 in 1992 to  1 700 in 2002an increase of 467  in a decade   For perspective  the consumer price index rose approximately 28  during this period   Migrants who used to go back and forth across the border now stay longer  At the same time  facing increased costs and danger in crossing the border  they have changed their patterns of crossing back and forth across the border  Before 1986  the average length of stay in the U S  was 1 7 years  Today  the average length of stay has grown to 3 5 years  With the average length of stay longer  and the migrant flow across the border undiminished  the result has been a rapidly rising undocumented population in the U S now around 11 million While border enforcement failure is most spectacularly evident  Congress has passed a number of measures aimed at making life difficult for immigrants inside the U S   with the hope that these measures will help us gain control of the immigration system  These have also failed to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants The clampdown on immigrants has not been just on the border  Congress has made it more difficult for someone fleeing persecution and trying to enter the country to gain a hearing on their asylum claim  For those already in the U S   Congress has made it more difficult for persons who fear persecution if sent back to their home countries to successfully gain asylum  Congress has closed off avenues by which undocumented immigrants could adjust to legal status  New prohibitions against adjustment to legal status have been imposed on undocumented immigrants  Changes to the law in 1996 and since then aimed to eliminate review of discretionary denials of relief from deportation  eliminate or greatly restrict review by the federal courts of deportation orders  eliminate review of detention decisions  and place other restrictions on the ability of immigrants to get a fair hearing in the courts As the above statistics show  our ever increasing border buildup and enforcement policies have failed in the past  A look at who the undocumented are today  their ties to family and work in the U S   and a look at the U S  labor market needs  will give an idea of why a focus on enforcement only will continue to fail  The undocumented are putting down roots  As of March 2004  only 30  of the undocumented population arrived in the U S  after 2000  In other words  70  of undocumented immigrantsmore than 7 millionhad been in the U S  more than 4 years  Of that number  approximately 50  had been here more than 10 years  Most of the undocumented70 are living in families  Only 30  are single men and women  In 2004  nearly 2 million families headed by undocumented immigrants included U S  citizen children The undocumented are here to work and our economy depends on them  Participation in the labor force is very high for undocumented immigrant men92   This compares with 83  for native born men  Undocumented immigrants account for nearly 5  of the entire U S  labor force  No one has calculated the cost of losing 5  of our labor force   97  of the undocumented work in occupations such as in service industries  construction  production  installation and repair  Only 3  are employed in agriculture  Certain occupations have a very high concentration of undocumented workers  For example  approximately 25  of all drywall installers  meat and poultry workers  ground maintenance workers  and maids and housekeepers are undocumented workers Deportation of the large undocumented population is not practical  Deporting 8 9 million undocumented immigrants would cost more than  200 billion over five years more than double the annual budget of the entire DHS  It would take 200 000 buses  bumper to bumper  in a convoy 1 700 miles long  to transport undocumented immigrants to the border   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
