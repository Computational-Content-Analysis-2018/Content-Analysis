         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The President should try speaking with seniors in communities across America rather than a handpicked group    to get a real idea of the myriad of problems they re facing in light of the massive overhaul of the prescription drug program  I ve heard from countless seniors in Massachusetts that the system is simply not working  One woman told me that she called Medicare three times with questions about enrollment and received three different answers  Seniors who already have drug coverage through HMOs and retiree plans are being told to sign up for the new prescription drug plans  only to find out that by doing so  they lose their existing coverage  The plans are confusing  seniors are given information that contradicts itself and volunteers who are supposed to help navigate the maze of plans and options are overworked to the point of exhaustion  Americans deserve a prescription drug plan that gives them more than a headache   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
