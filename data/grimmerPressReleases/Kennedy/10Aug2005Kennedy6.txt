         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I want to start first by thanking all of you for being a part of America s campaign to change Wal Mart  This fight we re engaged in to change the working conditions for millions of Americans is rooted in the nation s basic ideals of opportunity and fairness  Here in Massachusetts we believe that when you work hard every day to provide for your families that health care and fair wages should come standard  We understand that an honest day s work should be rewarded with fairness in the workplace     In June  I introduced a bill with Congressman Weiner and Senator Corzine that if passed will hold Wal Mart accountable by shining the light on their practices for all to see  Americans deserve to know just how much money    several hundred million dollars each year    taxpayers are paying to subsidize the healthcare of Wal Mart employees     Americans believe that a fair day s work should bring a fair day s pay  That s the American dream  But that s not the case at Wal Mart  Somehow  the biggest company in the world can t manage to pay its workers a living wage  Thousands of workers in Wal Mart can t afford health insurance and have to rely on Medicaid to cover their families  health needs  Medicaid is a critical safety net for low income women and children  the disabled  and the elderly  It should not also have to underwrite the profits for large companies like Wal Mart    We re going to keep up the fight in the halls of Congress but we need you with us  By making your voices heard in your communities  you can force your elected leaders  your Governors  your state legislators  your city councils  to pay attention  By raising public awareness  you can force large companies like Wal Mart to act responsibly and do what is right     You are all leaders in this battle    a battle over what kind of America we want to live in    Wal mart s vision of America or ours     Thank you for your energy  your convictions and your commitment to changing America for the better      30    KEY FACTS  Wal Mart and Health Care Accountability   General   Wal Mart operates 3 400 stores across the U S   with stores in all 50 states

state and local governments   Workers  Income   Full time is defined as 34 hours per week  Wal Mart employees earn  on average   7 50 to  8 50 per hour  Full time employee at  8 per hour    272 weekly    14 144 per year  Poverty guideline for family of three    15 219   8 an hour Wal Mart worker is below poverty guideline  and therefore eligible for food stamps  Average wage of non supervisory retail trade worker   10 04 per hour  Former Wal Mart managers have stated that they were forced to lower wage costs by deleting hours or forcing employees to work off the clock  In Oregon  a jury found in favor of 400 Wal Mart workers  representing 27 different stores   who sued the company for unpaid  off the clock overtime   Health Coverage   Only 41 46  of Wal Mart employees are insured under the company plan  Nationally  68  of U S  workers at large firms have employer sponsored insurance  Low insurance coverage participation rates are due to Wal Mart s benefit policies which  1  specifically deny coverage to some employees  and 2  make it too expensive to purchase for others   Wal Mart requires full time workers to wait 6 months before they become eligible to buy into the Wal Mart medical plans  and 2 years for part timers  Average waiting period at large firms is just 1 3 months  Part time workers can never buy family coverage under the Wal Mart plan  workers who slip from full time to part time status lose family coverage   Out of pocket expenses for Wal Mart plans include   Monthly premiums  Family   143 54    249 71  Single   33 04    72 04  Annual deductibles   350    1 000 per person  Co payments  vary  In 2001  Wal Mart workers paid 42  of the total cost of plan  up from 36  in 1999  In Massachusetts last year  Wal Mart worker paid 48  of the total cost of the plan  Typical employee of large company pays only 16  of total premium for single coverage and 24  for family  In 2002  Wal Mart spent an average of  3 500 per employee for health care coverage  Nationally  average spending per employee in the wholesale retailing sector was  4 800  average spending by U S  employers in general was  5 600 per employee  Full time workers hired in 1998 or later are required to pay a  50 surcharge every two weeks to buy coverage for spouses who are eligible for medical coverage through his or her employer  this can double the premium cost of spousal coverage under Wal Mart s least expensive plan  depending on deductible   Wal Mart does not cover costs of preventive or wellness care  except under limited circumstances    KEY FACTS  Health Care Accountability    SOURCE  Glied  Lambrew  and Little  The Commonwealth Fund Report    The Growing Share of Unemployed Workers Employed by Large Firms  Oct  2003     A significant proportion of the nation s uninsured are workers in large firms  500  employees   or their family members  In 2001  this population represented 26  of the nation s uninsured  totaling 9 6 million people  This number exceeded the number of low income  uninsured children targeted by the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   6 3 million   the number of unemployed adults who are uninsured  3 9 million   and the number of older adults ages 55 to 64 lacking insurance  3 2 million  in that year  This number is also higher than the number of uninsured  4 million  who would benefit from the president s individual tax credit proposal     The trends show that this population will continue to grow  Although uninsured rates have risen at firms of all sizes  they have risen fastest among large employer workers  From 1987 to 2001  the rate of uninsured workers in large firms increased by 57   while the rate of uninsured workers in small and mid sized firms increased 25  and 27  respectively     The uninsured in large firms have disproportionately low incomes  Per analysis of the CPS data  1988 2002   46  of low income workers in large firms are uninsured for some time during a year  while only 14  of middle  and 8  of high income workers in large firms are uninsured  Low income workers in large firms are less likely to be offered employer sponsored insurance than higher income workers in the same firms      The disparities in employer sponsored coverage by wage level have been growing  and are expected to continue growing as large firms have been shifting toward a lower income workforce     The three basic explanations for why workers may not have health insurance include  they declined coverage when offered  they are not eligible for the coverage offered  or their firm doesn t offer health insurance benefits     The majority of large firms offer health insurance  however   Kaiser HRET  surveys suggest the majority of uninsured workers at these firms were not offered health coverage  In 1998  71  of uninsured workers in large firms weren t offered coverage by their employers     Compared with insured workers in large firms  uninsured workers are more likely to work part time  however  the majority of uninsured workers do work full time  68    2002 CPS data       Researchers suggest the potential reasons for this growing problem include     An increase in low income workers  A decrease in unionization rates  Unions  as worker advocates  traditionally secured health benefits for workers    A decline in manufacturing jobs  This sector was most likely to offer jobs with health coverage  perhaps due to greater historical presence of unionized workers    An increase in the number of small establishments within larger firms  i e   franchises   Per Census data  these small establishments are less likely to offer coverage than single establishment firms of the same size     SOURCE  AFL CIO and Good Jobs First www goodjobsfirst org  accessed via AFL CIO website    The number of Americans insured by employer sponsored insurance has dropped due to two main causes  a rise in the number of jobs that do not provide coverage at all and growth in the number of workers who decline coverage because it is too expensive     Firms are passing on higher health care costs to employees  making coverage increasingly unaffordable for low income workers    According to the September 2003 KFF report  the amount of the monthly premium employees pay for family coverage has increased nearly 50   Cost shifting in the form of co pays and deductibles also increases the cost of care to employees  which hits low income families and those with high medical costs the hardest     The growing low income workforce is faced with the unavailability  and  or unaffordability of health coverage on the job     This trend places added burden on public programs that are already under stress due to fiscal constraints
