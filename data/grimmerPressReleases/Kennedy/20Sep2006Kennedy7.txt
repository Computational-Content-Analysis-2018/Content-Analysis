misconduct  The Senators appealed to Gonzales to put the health of the American people and the interests of justice first in the final resolution of this case    The letter was sent by Senators Kennedy  Leahy  Durbin  Lautenberg  Feinstein  Reid  Harkin  Cantwell  Boxer  Sarbanes  Levin  Wyden  Jeffords  Dodd and Kerry  Below is a text of the letter and a PDF version with signatures of the letter is available on request    The Honorable Alberto R  Gonzales Attorney General of the United States U S  Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW Washington  DC 20530 Dear Attorney General Gonzales   We write to express our serious concerns regarding the latest developments in the matter of United States of America v  Philip Morris USA Inc  et al  Last month  the U S  District Court for the District of Columbia issued the long awaited decision in the government s case against the tobacco industry  While the Court issued a very strong decision on liability  the remedies imposed were clearly inadequate to address the enormous harm caused by the industry s misconduct   The lengthy decision exposed  in striking detail  the egregious history of misconduct that tobacco companies have engaged in for decades  In her opinion  Judge Kessler wrote   Over the course of more than 150 years  Defendants lied  misrepresented and deceived the American public  including smokers and the young people they avidly sought as  replacement smokers   about the devastating health effects of smoking and environmental tobacco smoke  they suppressed research  they destroyed documents  they manipulated the use of nicotine so as to increase and perpetuate addiction  they distorted the truth about low tar and light cigarettes so as to discourage smokers from quitting  and they abused the legal system in order to achieve their goal  to make money with little  if any  regard for individual illness and suffering  soaring health costs  or the integrity of the legal system   The findings of the Court prove what many of us have long suspected   that the tobacco industry has conspired for decades to deceive the citizens of our nation about the extraordinary health danger posed by their products and to entrap generations of children into a lifetime of addiction and premature death  It is important to note that the Court found that industry misconduct is ongoing  The opinion states   e ven after the Complaint in this action was filed in September 1999  Defendants continued to engage in conduct that is materially indistinguishable from their previous actions  activity that continues to this day  The evidence supporting these findings is truly overwhelming and we are confident it will withstand any further legal challenges   However  despite the overwhelming proof of misconduct by the tobacco companies violating the RICO law  the trial judge concluded that a prior decision of the Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit prevented her from ordering appropriate remedies commensurate with the enormity of the harm  That decision  rendered last year by a divided panel  reversed an earlier ruling by Judge Kessler in the tobacco case  The Court of Appeals decision drastically limited the ability of the trial court to impose effective remedies for the tobacco industry s gross violation of the racketeering statute  It is imperative that the Justice Department pursue every available avenue of appeal to overturn this misguided Court of Appeals decision    We wrote to you last year when the original decision was handed down to urge that the Department file an interlocutory appeal of the D C  Circuit opinion to the Supreme Court  We understand that the interlocutory appeal was rejected for primarily procedural reasons  Now that a final decision in the trial proceedings has been rendered  we urge the Department to appeal the portions of the District Court s ruling that severely limit the remedies to be imposed on the tobacco industry  If allowed to stand  the decision on remedies in this case will have the effect of allowing the major tobacco companies to escape any meaningful accountability for the enormous injury their misconduct has caused   Furthermore  if allowed to stand  the D C  Circuit s erroneous ruling in this case could have devastating impact on future RICO cases where the government would be severely limited from recovering any significant damages from those who are found to violate our nation s racketeering laws  By prohibiting the government from disgorging the profits of proven unlawful conduct  the D C  Circuit s decision is inconsistent with the law of other Circuits and it would strip federal prosecutors of an essential enforcement tool needed to root out illegal activity in criminal conspiracies and in corporate board rooms  That result would do fundamental harm to our government s ability to battle corporate misconduct and corruption    As you consider our request  we ask that you also take into consideration the real life impact of the tobacco litigation on the future of our nation  Every dollar spent on smoking cessation and prevention  which would go toward curing addicted smokers and stopping our children from beginning to smoke  would save lives  As elected officials  we represent the interests of these people whose health is at grave risk from continued exposure to the tobacco industry s products  On their behalf  and especially on behalf of our nation s children  we urge you to put the health of the American people and the interests of justice first in the final resolution of this case   Sincerely   Senators Kennedy  Leahy  Durbin  Lautenberg  Feinstein  Reid  Harkin  Cantwell  Boxer  Sarbanes  Levin  Wyden  Jeffords  Dodd and Kerry    Laura
