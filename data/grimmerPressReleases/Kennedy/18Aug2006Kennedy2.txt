         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  This ruling establishes without question  the massive scope of the deliberate and decades  long conspiracy by the tobacco companies to condemn generations of Americans into a lifetime of addiction and premature death  Sadly  the Bush Administration seems all too willing to let the industry off with a slap on the wrist  In light of the now demonstrated enormity of its wrongdoing  the industry should not be able to escape its obligation to provide financial resources to help remedy the immense wrong the industry perpetrated on so many Americans for so long  and especially on children  Hopefully  the appellate courts will make the punishment fit the crime   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
