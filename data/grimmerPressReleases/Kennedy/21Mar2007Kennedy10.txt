         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  As prepared for deliveryId like to take a few minutes to  respond to some of the points made by the Senior Senator from New Hampshire made  yesterday regarding the track record of the Administration and Republican  Congress on education funding  Senator Gregg points to  historic increases in NCLB funding under President Bush  What he doesnt point  out is that most of that increase happened in the first year after enactment of  NCLB when Democrats controlled the Senate and demanded a substantial increase   Since then  new funding for elementary and secondary education has plummeted   No Child Left Behind is only half the story  Under  Republican control of the Senate  increases in funding for education programs  overall have gotten smaller year after year after year  CHART   Two years ago   funding for education was actually cut by over half a billion dollars  Last  year  the President proposed the largest cut to overall education funding in the  history of the Department of Education   2 2 billion   and again this year  the  President proposed an overall cut of  1 3 billion  My  colleague from New Hampshire is right that President Bush claims to include an  increase of  1 billion in NCLB funding in his budget for this year  But it is  not a real increase  First  it does nothing more than fill the cut that was  enacted in 2006  And worse  as he has time and again  the President robs other  education programs to pay for it  As I mentioned  overall  he proposes a  1 3  billion cut to education programs overall  Thats not providing new resources  for our schools  thats a shell game But even more  important than these points is the fact that the funding that has been secured  is simply insufficient to fulfill the bipartisan promise to leave no child  behind  This was a promise  not a political slogan  But year after year of  broken promises from the White House and the Republican Congress have left 3 7  million children behind  Their budgets have meant larger not smaller class  sizes  Theyve meant fewer teachers trained  This  irresponsible neglect comes at a time when schools are being asked to do  more Senator Gregg also claimed that the Republican  Reconciliation bill last Congress provided  9 billion in student benefits and  did not cut  12 billion from the student loan programs   The facts are that  22 billion was cut from the student  loan programs  About  9 was spent by that bill  more than half of it on  sweetners for the banks such as increased loan limits on federally subsidized  loans and reduced origination fees which translate to increased profits for  banks  A small grant program was included  but as Senator  Gregg acknowledged yesterday  90  of students are not eligible for that program   4 7 million Pell eligible students were left out in the cold   The Senate bill included  6 billion in grant aid for all  Pell eligible students  but the Republicans jettisoned that proposal in a  partisan conference  This program also wrongly limits  eligibility to students to be enrolled in school full time to be eligible  so  forget it if youre trying to support a family and have to work while youre  trying to get your degree  This limitation and others related to curriculum also  excludes virtually all community college students But  the most important fact is one conceded by the Senator from New Hampshire    the  vast majority of the cuts to student loan programs were not dedicated to student  aid  Instead   12 billion was used to offset tax giveaways for the wealthy   Our schools  children and families deserve more than  accounting gimmicks  Our schools need new resources to make progress on reform   and families need real help to afford a college education for their children   Republican budgets have provided neither   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
