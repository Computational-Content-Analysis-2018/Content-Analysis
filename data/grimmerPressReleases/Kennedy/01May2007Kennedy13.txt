         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The President is wrong to veto the Iraq spending bill and reject its needed timeline for the orderly  responsible  and safe withdrawal of our forces from Iraq  He was wrong to lead us into the war  wrong to conduct it so poorly  wrong to refuse to change course  We cannot continue business as usual in Iraq  It is time for America to end its participation in the brutal civil war  The message from the American people couldnt be louder or clearer  Instead of stubbornly defying the will of the American people  President Bush should listen to their plea and begin working with Congress to bring this tragic war to an end      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
