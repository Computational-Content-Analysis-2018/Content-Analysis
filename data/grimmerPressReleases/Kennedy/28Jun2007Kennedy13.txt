         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  This vote on cloture is more than just a vote on immigration reform  Its a vote about whether the Senate intends to keep moving America forward in the long march of progress that has been so important for our nation and our role in the world  Year after year we ve had borders that aren t secure and immigration laws that dont work Year after year  we ve had people dying in the desert because they want a better life for themselves and their families Year after year we ve had millions of people living in fear every day  worrying that they could be deported Year after year we ve had an underground economy that hurts American workers  exploits undocumented workers  and abuses hard working immigrant families  Year after year  we ve heard talk about reforming our system  We ve heard the bumper sticker solutions and the campaign ads  We know how divisive it is But now is the time fix our dysfunctional system  I ve been around here long enough to know that opportunities like this don t come very often  The American people are demanding a solution  President Bush is committed  Senator Reid has made this a priority  Senators from both parties agree that now is the time to end this crisis  Politics is the art of the possible  and this legislation is our best opportunity for change and reform  It is time to protect our borders and strengthen our national security  This bill will double our border guards  increase the number of inspectors  and crack down on smugglers and employers who break the law  It is time to face up to the fact that we have 12 million undocumented workers  This bill will give our nation a chance to know who is here  and provide a pathway to citizenship for those who prove they are here to work hard  obey the law  learn English  and pay taxes  It is time to renew our commitment to family values  This bill takes a family backlog that now stretches some 22 years  reduces it to eight years  and ensures that a majority of future immigration will be based on family ties  It is time to ensure that our immigration laws do not undermine the wages and working conditions of American workers  This bill  by preventing unscrupulous employers from exploiting undocumented workers  protects American workers too  Mistreatment of immigrants is a moral issue in its own right  it is also an attack on the rights of all workers  This bill isn t perfect  But it is a strong bill and a good solution  There is no alternative plan at all  Those who are most critical of this bill have offered only slogans  cynicism and silent amnesty  The Senate can do better than that  A vote for cloture is a key step toward a fair and realistic solution to our immigration crisis  Even more important  it is a critical step toward proving to the American people that this Congress is genuinely working together to solve our nation s problems       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
