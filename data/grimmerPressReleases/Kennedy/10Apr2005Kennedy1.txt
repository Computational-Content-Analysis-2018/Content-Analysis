AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES   Thank you  George  for that generous introduction and I m very grateful for this Harry Truman Award  I ve always admired his leadership and his common touch  and the idea of his Fair Deal still inspires all of us who work for a stronger and fairer nation at home and around the world    It s a special privilege to join in welcoming all of you to Boston  In cities and towns across our Commonwealth  we re very  very proud of our 15 community colleges  As you know so well  they make an incredible difference in the lives of people every day  I know that our state director  Jan Motta  and most of our presidents are here  and it s always a privilege to thank them for their extraordinary dedication and success  Our community colleges are a lifeline for countless students because of your extraordinary ability to unlock the golden door of opportunity    Your leadership is especially significant for high school students  who can expand their horizons through dual enrollment  Students who dream of careers that require instruction in math or science or foreign languages can take courses at community college not available in their high schools  They gain confidence in their academic skills  earn college credits  and pay amazingly low tuition  Math  science and engineering are big aspects of education that obviously need to be strengthened if the nation is to meet the increasingly serious challenge of globalization  Collaborative programs between community colleges and local school districts are the wave of the future in education  and it s gratifying to see all of you in the forefront     After leaving high school  many of those students stay with you to continue developing the skills they need to qualify for good jobs or go on to 4 year colleges  Your partnerships with 4 year colleges provide smooth transitions and easy transfers of credit  They keep college affordable by limiting student debt and enabling students to earn their degree as soon as possible     Obviously  the debt burden and the difficulty of balancing work and education are serious concerns for many students  I understand that today  only about 25  of all college students earn their degrees within 6 years  We need to do more to see that students can go on to college  and obtain the support they need to stay on and graduate  Certainly  we can do more on campuses and in state and federal policy to make this process more effective  and I d like to do all I can in Congress to make it happen    Of course  even beyond the students and families who depend on you  there are countless local businesses that look to you as well  You provide the essential training that enables employees to respond to the changing needs of their businesses  It s impressive to know of your specific and often on site services to firms to improve their workers  literacy and English language skills     You turn letters like GED  AA  and RN into real jobs  real salaries  real promotions in their careers  and real improvements in productivity for the business world  The need for their abilities will only grow  as businesses struggle to remain competitive with firms across the street and around the world  America s skilled workforce has always been our greatest resource  and with your leadership  it will stay that way for generations to come    The current hostile budget climate in Congress is an abomination  It s difficult to believe this White House wants to eliminate Perkins grants  eliminate Upward Bound  eliminate Talent Search  eliminate Gear Up  and impose a devastating cut of 66  on Adult Education  We have our work cut out for us in Washington in the coming weeks to rescue their capsized budget on education  and the good work you ve done on all these programs makes a compelling case for real federal support     By the skin of its teeth  last month the Senate passed an amendment I proposed to restore  5 4 billion in cuts to higher education and job training  The challenge now is to keep that proposal in the final bill  Without it  communities across the country will be forced to make impossible choices that no responsible community should have to make    Money is not the only answer for education  but it sends a clear signal about our national priorities  and we can t afford to send the wrong signal on education now    The many challenges we face in education    strengthening public schools  improving access to college for students of all ages  training teachers  offering good vocational education and good continuing education  improving early childhood education    all of these challenges heavily involve our community colleges  We need you now more than ever    One final point  Our country is only as strong as its citizens  Active citizens lead our democracy forward  You have a unique opportunity to involve the students on your campus in community service while they learn  Courses that engage students in real problem solving as part of their studies are a natural for community colleges  because so many of your students depend on the real life applications of their course work  Many of you have made a strong commitment to service learning on your campus  and I m delighted to know you ve provided several sessions on the idea in this conference  I hope you ll continue to build on it  because it s a powerful way to develop citizens for the future who will be both well educated and active members of their communities  All students should learn the power and promise of active citizenship  In these difficult times  it s the most effective way to prevent our democracy from being hijacked to serve a narrow minded ideology    I know that will never happen on your watch  That s why it s such a privilege to work with all of you  I admire your dedication  and above all  I admire your constant contributions to a stronger  better  and fairer America    Thank you for this award  and thank you for all you do to change the world every day  Harry Truman would be very  very proud of you   Melissa Wagoner   Brent Carney  617  565 4472
