         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  The President today tried to put a high gloss on his harsh budget  but there s no denying the fact that it will make life even harder for millions of Americans already struggling to put their kids through college and make ends meet  If you re already wealthy  then this budget will make you wealthier  But if you re a widow  orphan  or are disabled  you ll see a cut in benefits  Budgets are moral documents and this one is clearly unfair    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
