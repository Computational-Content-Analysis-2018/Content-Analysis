         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington D C Today  as the House and Senate supplemental conferees finish up their work  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  the lead advocate for increasing the minimum wage  applauded the conferees decision on the minimum wage portions of the bill   The tax package included in the bill  which will include  4 8 billion in tax cuts  is significantly lower than the  12 billion package that was included in the Supplemental in the Senate  I am pleased that the House and Senate have reached an agreement that     after 10 long years    will finally allow a minimum wage increase to proceed to the Presidents desk   After a decade of struggle  fairness and decency finally are winning out for 13 million hardworking Americans who have been waiting too long for a raise   Six million children have been waiting too long for better food  better health  and better opportunities for the future   While I have always supported a minimum wage increase with no strings attached  Im glad that weve been able to agree on a smaller tax package than the Senate passed bill  I dont believe we need to load on more tax breaks for business before we can give Americans a raise   Our troops are away fighting to provide a better future for the people of Iraq   We need to show the same commitment to provide a better future for their families  friends  and neighbors here at home  There are 50 000 military families that will benefit from this increase in the minimum wage   I hope the President will do the right thing for our troops and for Americas low wage workers by signing this important bill        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
