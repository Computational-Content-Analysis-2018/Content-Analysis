         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I welcome Secretary Harvey and General Schoomaker today  I know they share our concern for the safety of our troops  and I look forward to their testimony The most lethal threat to our troops are the improvised explosive devices  When the war began  we had a severe shortage of armored vehicles to protect our troops  Over 2 000 servicemembers have given their lives in Iraq42 from Massachusettsand another 16 000 have been wounded Three years ago  I spoke with General Schoomaker about this issue  and he assured me that he would look into it  Two years ago  before this committee  he said that  I am confident that we re doing everything we can to move more up armored Humvees and other armored vehicles into theater  Yet  nearly a year later  soldiers were still digging through dumpsters to find armor for their vehicles Nine times  the Army said they had enough armored vehicles  only to turn around and add more  Each time  the Army paid for them with funds Congress added to purchase armored vehicles in excess of the stated requirements Another major problem is that the Army and the Marine Corps seem to have different requirements and different acquisition strategies for armor On body armor  the Marines asked for an analysis of the killed and wounded to assess the effectiveness of available body armor  They didnt ask for this study until their second rotation  in the second year of the war  The Army has been on the ground the entire war  has taken the bulk of the casualties and wounded  Yet the Army did not request a similar assessment The Los Angeles Times reported that nearly a year ago  the Joint IED Task Force identified a vehicle that could blow up roadside bombs  called JIN  Joint IED Neutralizer   But 10 months later  not a single such vehicle has been shipped to Iraq  despite support from General Votel  the head of the task force  and Secretary Wolfowitz  The Army is waiting for more testing data  but the Marines plan to send the vehicle to Iraq anyway We have heard this story over and over again  New protection equipment is available  but our troops in the field have to wait months and months to get it  We need to know what it takes to cut through the red tape  We need to know why there have been such delays Weve heard the Pentagons reassurances before  It is difficult to have confidence in them now Timeline on Armor IssuesRecognizing the Problem In September 2003  a group of Rhode Island National Guardsmen in Iraq are attacked in an unarmored humvee  Senator Reed raises the shortage of armored humvees with Secretary Rumsfeld in a closed door meeting  Rumsfeld s response  News to me In the beginning of November  Senator Kennedy meets Brian and Alma Hart at the burial of their son John  at Arlington National Cemetery  They tell the Senator about John s wish that they do something to improve the availability of armored humvees to the troops  Later that month  Senator Kennedy raises the lack of humvees to General Schoomaker at an Armed Services Committee Hearing  General Schoomaker claims that the plant is operating at maximum capacity Bureaucracy Senator Kennedy continued to work on increasing the number of humvees behind the scenes  and encountered bureaucratic intertia  He called General Schoomaker just before Christmas  and the General told him he would check out the level of armor for the troops in Iraq  and report back to the Senator In January 2004  Senator Kennedy met with representatives from Armor Holdings  who tell the Senator that the plant is not at maximum capacity  and that the Army had not yet asked them to do so In February  Senator raises the shortage of armor again with General Schoomaker at an Armed Services Committee Hearing  General Schoomaker acknowledges that they don t have any money programmed in for armor kits for trucks  which the insurgents are beginning to target in Iraq At the end of February  Secretary of the Army  Les Brownlee calls the Senator to let him know that the Army intends to raise the production rate of armored humvees to 450 month  and that the Army will have all the humvees by August At the beginning of March  Dov Zackheim  the Comptroller of the Pentagon  testifies before the Appropriations Committee saying that the Pentagon says they will not fill their requirement until December  at a rate of 300 armored humvees per month  In April  it is clear that the production rate will remain at 300 per month and that the requirement will be filled in October It is clear that the bureaucracy within the Pentagon is not focused on solving the issue  and the comptroller s office is not giving the Army what it needs to fix the armored humvee problem  Throughout the year  the need for these armored vehicles continues to rise Congress Adds MoneyThat spring  Senator Kennedy and others offer amendments to the Defense Authorization Bill to increase the funding for armored humvees and armor kits to convert existing canvas topped humvees into armored vehicles  Total funding is over  1 billion  Plant production for Armored humvees rises towards 450 per month  but kit production is still unclear In June 2004  Senator Kennedy travels to Aberdeen Proving Ground and is briefed on their efforts to provide more protective armor to our troops  Later that day  he visits Protech  a Massachusetts company that produces body armor to observe their operations  He is joined by Brian and Alma Hart  who s son  John  was killed in Iraq in an unarmored vehicle The Army You HaveIn December 2004  Secretary Rumsfeld travels to Kuwait and Specialist Wilson asks the Secretary why the troops are having to dig through dumpsters to find the steel they need to armor their vehicles After this exchange  OSD holds a meeting with the steel producers to set the priority for steel production  The also hold a meeting with automotive technology producers to focus on what technologies are needed for future humvee development  The Pentagon also purchases additional Armored Security Vehicles for Iraq Also in December of 2004  Senator Kennedy meets with General Benjamin Griffin  Commander of Army Materiel Command  at Natick Soldier Systems Center  General Griffin demonstrates the additional shoulder and deltoid body armor to the Senator Still WaitingIn January 2005  the Army and Marine Corps come over to brief the hill  They reveal that the Army is still lacking  450 million to buy all the armor kits and vehicles it needs  The Marine Corps needs  300 million for its armor kits and humvees  This money is not included in the President s FY2006 Defense Budget In April 2005  Senator Kennedy and Senator Bayh offer an amendment to the FY 2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill to add  213 million for additional armored vehicles  The amendment passes 60 40 Continuing Efforts In 2005  the Senate Armed Services Committee continued to provide additional protective gear to our troops  The
