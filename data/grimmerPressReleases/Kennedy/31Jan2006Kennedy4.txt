         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    2229  A bill to provide quality  affordable health care for all Americans  to the Committee on Finance     Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  in this century of the life sciences  medical miracles have the potential to improve the health and extend the lives of millions of Americans and millions more across the world     But for too many of our citizens  quality affordable health care is a distant dream  and the promise of the century of the life sciences rings hollow     Forty six million Americans have no health insurance  Under the current Administration  the number has climbed every year of this Administration  from 40 million in 2000 to 46 million today  Thats equivalent to the population of 24 States and the District of Columbiacombined     Thats 46 million Americans who wonder whether a cough or fever will turn into a serious illness that brings financial ruin  and 46 million Americans who have to make the impossible choice between paying for a visit to the doctor or paying the rent to keep a roof over their heads     Even these figures understate the problem  Over a two year period  82 million Americans  one out of every three Americans under 65  will be uninsured for a period of at least two months     The burden of lack of health insurance falls most heavily on minority populations  Less than 13 percent of white Americans are uninsured  but over 20 percent of African Americans lack health insurance  For Hispanic Americans  the figure is even more appallingover a third of Hispanic Americans lack coverage     Over 80 percent of the uninsured are members of working families  They work 40 hours a week  fifty two weeks a yearbut all their hard work cant buy them the health insurance they need to protect themselves and their familiesbecause they cant afford it and their employers dont provide it     In any given year  one third of the uninsured go without needed medical care  Eight million uninsured Americans fail to take the drugs their doctors prescribebecause they cant afford to fill the prescription  270 000 children suffering from asthma never see a doctor  27 000 uninsured women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year  They are twice as likely as insured women not to receive medical treatment until their cancer has spread  As a result  they are 50 percent more likely to die of the disease     The list of grim examples goes on and on     Some argue that despite the lack of health care coverage  the uninsured get the care they need  But thats a myth  The facts prove otherwise     Thirty five percent of the uninsuredover 15 million Americansskip recommended treatment because of cost  Over a third of the uninsured need care but do not get it  and nearly half postpone care because of its cost  Millions of Americans are at risk of ignoring serious illnesses  because they cant afford to see a doctor for a needed test     Whether the disease is AIDS or mental illness or cancer or heart disease or diabetes  the uninsured are left out and left behind  In hospital and out  young or old  black or white  they receive less care  suffer more  and are 25 percent more likely to die than those who are insured     But the large and growing number of the uninsured is only part of the health care crisis  Costs are rising out of control  making health care coverage less affordable for businesses and individuals  and undercutting American industry in the global marketplace     There is no doubt that America has the finest health care professionals  the best hospitals and the most creative medical researchers in the world  But having the best components is no guarantee of success for the health care system as a whole     In the amount of money spent on health care per person  America is first in the world by a large margin  By that standard  we spend 49 percent more than the Swiss  88 percent more than the Germans  150 percent more than the British  and 160 more than the Japanese  Despite this enormons expenditure  Americas health care system fails all too often to deliver quality health care  Among the worlds leading industrialized countries  the United States ranks only 22nd in average life expectancy and 25th in infant mortality     The most significant difference between the American health care system and those of our economic competitors is that these other nations regard health as a right  not a privilege  They make certain that their citizens have access to good health care  By establishing a national system of care  they have been able to hold down costs and keep quality high     In the United States  we have refused to commit to quality health care for all Americans     As a result  those who can afford the best care receive it  but millions of other Americans are left by the wayside     Because of our fractured system of care  Americas health care system is the most economically inefficient in the industrial world  The administrative costs alone of our system are nearly double those of Canada  Reducing our administrative costs to the low level of the Canadian system would save about  250 billion every year     The difference between the way health care is financed in Canada and the U S  saves the Canadian auto industry  4 00 an hour in worker compensation compared to the U S  The Canadian branches of the big three automakers have released a joint letter with the Canadian Auto Workers Union stating that the Canadian system is a strategic advantage for Canada and has been an important ingredient in the success of Canadas most important export industry     Wise investments have helped contain health care costs here at home too  Since 1996  costs per patient in the Veterans medical system have actually decreased 7 percent  while private sector costs per patient have increased by 62 percent  The VA system did not achieve these savings by stinting on patient care or denying needed services  The VA has been widely praised for improving its quality of care through investments in information technology and a strong commitment to quality for all  Page S372     As a result of Americas failure to focus on comprehensive care and cost reduction  costs are soaring out of control  Health care premiums have gone up over 70 percent in the last five yearsover 5 times the overall rate of inflation in the economy  More and more small businesses cant afford to offer health care to their employees     Health care costs mean that working Americans who have health coverage through their job are increasingly worried that their employer will eliminate the coverage on which they rely  Those who obtain coverage on the individual market must often pay huge premiums and accept large gaps in their coverage if they have any history of illness  no matter how slight  Many cannot obtain coverage at any price     Even those who have health insurance have little security  Millions of Americans have seen health care costs eat away their savings and cut into their paychecks more and more every year     Since the year 2000  the average cost of a family health insurance policy has increased by over  4 500  so that it now costs the average family nearly  11 000 for a health care policy  Family earnings have not kept pace  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation  health insurance premiums climbed by 73 percent over the last five yearsbut earnings increased only 15 percent     The costs keep climbing higher and higher  Almost one in five working families have seen their premiums go up over 15 percentand one in ten have faced increases over 20 percent     These out of control costs are devastating for both individuals and businesses  Working families often face the agonizing choice between paying for health insurance and paying rent or buying groceries  Or they compromise by buying a meager insurance policy that provides little refuge when big danger strikes     Its no wonder that unpaid medical bills cause nearly half the bankruptcies in America     Its no wonder that practically every business leader in America cites rising health care costs as a top concern  When General Motors has to spend more on health care than it does on steel  its time for a change  When ten percent of the total cost of a ton of steel manufactured in the United States is consumed by retiree health benefits alone  its time for a change  When Starbucks spends more on health care than it does on coffee  its time for a change     In world markets  American businesses have to compete with foreign firms whose health costs are heavily subsidized by the government  American workers are the best in the world  but we give other nations an unfair advantage  because we refuse to enact long overdue policies to reduce health costs and ease the heavy burden of health care for American employees     To say that this Administration and its Republican allies in Congress have stood idly by as this crisis has worsened would be untrue  To say they have taken no action as 3 000 more Americans have become uninsured during every single day of the Bush Administration would be inaccurate  They have taken actionby making the health care crisis worse     Tomorrow  the House of Representatives will vote on a budget bill that will make the health care crisis worse for the 50 million Americans for whom Medicaid is literally the difference between life or death  The Republican bill makes them pay more and more for the health care on which their lives depend  I urge the House to reject these distorted priorities     Currently  communities across the nation are struggling to cope with the disaster caused by the Republican Medicare drug plan  Millions of seniors have faced a baffling array of choices  instead of the certainty of Medicare in getting the medications they need  Millions of persons with disabilities  or those facing the challenge of HIV AIDS or living with mental illnesses have been denied the prescriptions they require  or have been told to pay exorbitant fees by the insurance companies that Republicans put in charge of the drug benefit  Try telling those who have been denied their medicines that they are in charge of their health care     Tonight  the President will try to make the American people believe that the solution to rising health costs is to shift more and more of those costs to patients  or to deny care to those in need  Thats the wrong prescription for health care     The Presidents proposal will let the wealthiest Americans rack up billions of dollars in tax giveaways  while shifting the costs of health care to working families and those least able to pay     Our people deserve true health care reformnot gimmicks and giveaways that worsen the crisis  They deserve a guarantee that when they get sick  theyll be able to obtain decent health care at a price they can afford     Medicare has meant quality health care for millions of senior citizens for forty years  The time has come to make Medicare available to every American who wants to enroll in it  Its the best way to bring the enormous promise of this new century of the life sciences to every American     Americas failure to guarantee the basic right to health care for all its citizens was one of the great public policy failures of the 20th century  and we must not allow that failure to continue in this new century     There is a better way  Our goal should be an America where no citizen of any age fears the cost of health care  and no employer stops creating jobs because of the high cost of providing health insurance     We should build on the tried and true and trusted model of Medicare  Administrative costs are low  patient satisfaction is high  and patients have the right to choose any doctor and hospital they think is bestnot the one an insurance company thinks is best for them     Today I am introducing legislation to extend Medicare to all Americans  from birth to the end of life  Those who prefer private insurance can choose any of the plans offered to members of Congress and the President  I call this approach Medicare for All  because it will free all Americans from the fear of medical expenses and enable them to seek the best possible care when illness strikes  Nothing is more cynical than a Member of Congress who gives a speech denouncing health care for all  then goes off to see his doctor for a visit paid for by the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan     To ease the transition  Medicare for All will be phased in by age group  starting with those 55 65 years old and children up to the age of 20     The plan contains a number of provisions to reduce costs and improve quality  including more effective use of health information technology  It also puts new emphasis on preventive care  because preventing illness before it occurs is always better and less expensive than treating patients after they become ill     My proposal will be entirely voluntary  Any American who wishes to stay in their current employer sponsored plan can do so  and employers can tailor their health plans to provide additional services to their employees that wrap around Medicare coverage     As we implement this reform  financing must be a shared responsibility  All will benefit  and all should contribute  Payroll taxes should be part of the financing  but so should general revenues  to make the financing as progressive as possible     We can offset a large part of the expense by a single giant stepbringing health care into the modem age of information technology  By moving to electronic medical records for all Americans when they go to the hospital or their doctor  we can save hundreds of billions of dollars a year in administrative costs while improving the quality of care  Equally important  we should pay for health care based on value and results  not just the number of procedures performed or days in a hospital bed     We all know that Medicare is one of the most successful social programs ever enacted  It makes no sense to make it available only to senior citizens  I have no doubt that if we were enacting Medicare today  we would not limit its benefits to seniors  The need for good health coverage is as urgent today for all Americans as it was for senior citizens 40 years ago  when Medicare was first enacted     The battle to achieve Medicare for All will not be easy  Powerful interests will strongly oppose it  because they profit immensely from the status quo  But no battle worth fighting is easyand the struggle to fulfill the promise of this century of the life sciences for all our citizens is as worthy as any in American history  Page S373     I urge my colleagues to make good on the promise of America  and see that all our citizens receive the quality health care that should be their birthright  I urge the Senate to support Medicare for All
