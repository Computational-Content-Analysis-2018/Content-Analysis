         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  For months  we have been ready to roll up our sleeves and get back to work on the PATRIOT Act  but the White House has continued to block bipartisan efforts to improve the original bill and accept oversight of its intrusive surveillance programs  Again  and again  the Administration has refused to join in serious negotiations with Republican and Democrats on matters of national security  including the National Security Agency s warrantless wiretaps and the FBI s use of National Security Letters  The latest proposal offers improvements  and deserves to pass  however  it is unacceptable and undemocratic that further amendments could not even be considered  We need to implement these improvements quickly given the Administration s disregard of Congressional oversight  The proposed re authorization bill requires public reports on the use of two of the most controversial provisions  Section 215 and National Security Letters  It also requires the Inspector General to audit their use  and it mandates a report on any data mining activities by the Justice Department Americans deserve national security laws that protect both our security and our constitutional rights  and more changes are clearly needed  One of the most glaring omissions in the proposal is the failure to include a four year sunset provision on National Security Letters  even though it would be consistent with the new reporting and auditing requirements that will take effect The latest changes provide some additional protection for libraries  but these safeguards should apply to all of the means used by the government to obtain sensitive information  including financial documents and library records  We also need a report on the government s use of computerized searches from all federal agencies and we will continue to seek such a requirement as part of efforts toward other reforms  We have not yet achieved the 9 11 Commission s goal to maintain governmental powers that enhance our national security while ensuring adequate oversight over their use  With so much at stake  the Administration s refusal to work with Congress can only weaken our national security and further undermine the public s trust in their government  So this battle will go on  and I regret we could not accomplish more in this needed legislation   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
