         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  MORRIS  Good morning  and thank you for joining Americans United  and Senator Kennedy  especially those of you who are in New Mexico  We know it s early there  My name is Cara Morris  And I think there s a lot of you who are familiar with the work that Americans United did on Social Security last year  So we are building on that success  We ve shortened our name  but we have broadened our scope of issues  So we have  like last year  agreed to meet the president head on wherever it is that he s traveling  You saw us in Tennessee on Wednesday and Minnesota yesterday  and this morning we have a rally planned in Rio Rancho  New Mexico  Monday  the president will see us again in New Hampshire  He ll see our grassroots activists on the floor  on the ground  And he will see Americans United television ads on WMUR  So if you haven t had a chance to see them  please take a minute and check out our Web site  which is americansunitedforchange org  So just happy to have you join us  And we are very thankful that Senator Kennedy has agreed to join us  as well  So I d love to turn it over to you  Senator KENNEDY  Well  thanks  so much  And welcome to all of you  We ve all heard the slogan A day late and a dollar short  Well  for this administration  on education  they re five years late and billions of dollars short  Money isn t everything  but it is an indication of a nation s priorities  And when we re talking about nation s priorities in education  people have to look at the difference at the enormous gap  the huge gap  between words and deeds  If I was a report card for this president and the education policy  on ideas I d give it a B   It gets a B     although the ideas are B  B   you have to get a B  because he turned in the paper last year  The idea of adjunct teachers  advanced placement  those were Jeff Bingaman s ideas  We re glad he s gotten them in  But we had those ideas last year  He had even submitted money   40 million last year  but there was no effort to fight for it here in the Congress  So I give him a B  for ideas  I give him an F for funding  an F for follow through  and an F for the basic education foundation KENNEDY  Every educator knows that you have to invest on the education  Finally  let me just say the reason I m so skeptical about this administration s policy  because last year I added a  5 6 billion education amendment on our budget resolution  That had six Republicans on it  That went to the conference  And when the White House came into the room    that  5 6 billion would have provided loan forgiveness for 57 000 new teachers in math and science to teach in poverty areas in this country  but when the White House got into the room with the budget  that didn t come back at  2 3 billion  it didn t come back at  1 billion  it didn t come back at  500 million  it came back as zero  So it s difficult for me to believe how serious the administration is in committing the nation in terms of education  Last year  we used to see for the first time a cut in total education funding  The administration tried to eliminate in their budget vocational education  education technology  the Even Start program that does so much to help break down barriers for young children that speak a second language and their parents  That involves family literacy  They tried to eliminate the Gear Up program  which is an enormously successful program to  inaudible  more classes  particularly among the disadvantaged  into college opportunities  and eliminated the Drug Free Schools program  which was a key part of our whole No Child Left Behind  in the earlier years    had been enormously important in terms of helping to reduce school dropout rates  Difficult for many of us who ve been following education for years to believe that this administration is serious MORRIS  Thank you  Senator Kennedy  We re ready to open up the floor for questions KENNEDY  Can I just add a word of back and forth on this  Just we re sending down to you a basic sheet that ll have most of those ideas  One additional area is the basic research fact sheet  As you probably know  the Department of Energy Office of Science RD portfolio is down  The National Institutes of Health  for the first time in 36 years  the budget fell  Department of Agriculture research funding is down  NIH  NSF  Department of Education and USDA all have less basic research    this is the key    basic research funding  And NASA s RD funding declined 6 percent for human space vehicles  But in aeronautics  research is down  Earth science is down  Biological and physical science are down  And the president s budget request included  2 5 billion more in cuts than the Congress even approved  Now we have our federal research investment is shrinking as a share of U S  economy  The RD investment has plateaued at 1 1 percent of U S  GDP and is expected to decline further  to less than 0 04 percent  So this is the clear indication of priorities in the last year  It s difficult to see how  when we all understand the challenges of China  India  world competition  but this administration has been absent in the battle of research and the battle of science  We are shortchanging our competitiveness  we re shortchanging our opportunity and we re shortchanging our future  That s the bottom line MORRIS  Thank you  Senator  And we ll take our first question QUESTION  Good morning  Senator  Last week  a bipartisan group of senators introduced a package of three bills together called the Protecting America s Competitive Edge Act  And Senator Domenici announced a couple of days ago it has now 60 cosponsors  And  of course  what s interesting about it is that 30 are Democrats and 30 are Republicans  So as in many science and technology issues  this is a bipartisan effort  Can you give us any idea of how the Congress will proceed  or the Senate  with these bills and whether you think that this will tell the White House what the priorities are of the Congress KENNEDY  Well  this is an excellent recommendation  an excellent suggestion  And I think it builds on the superb report that we had from the Academy of Sciences  Engineering and NIH not long ago  that really spelled out a blueprint about what we have to do in this country to get focus and attention on the math and science and competitiveness  And I m sure you ve been through that study  but anyone that hasn t  it is well worth spending  and it doesn t take a long time to get through it  you know  45 minutes  It s got a lot of very substantial meat and very serious recommendations in specific areas about how to get people to focus on math and science  One of the most interesting aspects is a recognition that you have to start at the earliest grades if you re expecting children to get into math and science  We can t just do it on the cheap and try and catch kids in the last years of high school and when they get to college  So it has a very comprehensive suggestion  These plans    this legislation was introduced  has very substantial support  and I would hope we ve move ahead  I find that this is an area where we can really come together in the Congress  Our committee  the Human Resource Committee  under Chairman Enzi  has had remarkable degree of bipartisan  You know  for example  this year in the conference  we had higher education  we had virtually unanimous    we had a unanimous committee vote for increasing dramatically the amount of student aid assistance  We increased student aid assistance by  6 billion for Pell and  2 billion for the math and science KENNEDY  And we saw that virtually cut in half    even more so    when it came out of the conference committee  That s in the last month  And they provided  12 billion for tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals  This is why many of us are so skeptical  because every place along the line where the administration could have an influence    in the higher education just a few weeks ago  in the math and science program or several months ago in allocating funding for the budget  these items all got short shrift  And I think there are few more important challenges to our future than strengthening our competitiveness in the global economy  And we should compete not by just lowering our wages  but by raising our skills  And what I ve mentioned about this is true with job training as well  And what I think most of us understand is skill training has to be a continuum in lifetime  We have to have a continuing lifetime program for upgrading skills for American workers  Just finally  on New Mexico  we have  of course  seen a number of the cutbacks in New Mexico this last year with the president s program  in Title I program  26 000 disadvantaged children are going to be outside of coverage in the Title I  And they eliminated a  4 million program that was in the New Mexico Classrooms for Technology  There s 14 000 eligible children in New Mexico for the afterschool services that are not going to receive it  And we ve seen the significant cut in funding to train the math and science teachers in New Mexico  And last year  just about every school district in New Mexico saw a reduction in Title I programs  You have 39 800 of the 44 000 Pell Grant recipients  This president has pledged in each of his elections to raise the Pell Grant to  4 500    it s  4 050 now    and has never supported it legislatively  And this year  of the 44 000 Pell Grant recipients in New Mexico  39 800 of them will receive no increase in aid under the new student aid program in the Republican budget MORRIS  I think we have time for just one more question QUESTION  Senator Kennedy  I have a question  When you put together the No Child Left Behind Law with President Bush  can you give me a sense of your discussion about the commitment on funding  especially for some of these programs that he s recommending cutting that you mentioned earlier  And have you talked to him since  Can you give a sense of the context of his commitment to you years ago about funding these programs  and what has changed KENNEDY  Well  as you may remember    and you probably will    just the year before the president became president  we had six weeks on the floor of the Senate on the extension of the Elementary  Secondary Education Act  and we didn t get any place at all  The Republican proposed legislation at that time eliminated any coverage for migrant children    or I think there s 500 000 migrant children    immigrant children    those are the children that are going to be American citizens    800 000 homeless children    about 700 000  All of those were excluded  And when we had our first negotiations and conversations with the president  he said  Look  all of them are in  I ll include all of those in  So I thought  Well  we may very well have the opportunities to make some changes  And the basic concept    I m not going to go through  but let me just mention it very quickly that states would write the curriculum  that we would have smaller class sizes  which is going to take an investment  you re going to have better trained teachers  so you re going to have to invest in the teachers  because the teachers  by and large  across the country don t have the sufficient resources to be able to upgrade their skills  you re going to have much better kinds of evaluations of kids    as you re familiar with  the tests that they use in an awful many places cost about  25 to  30 per child instead of over the  100 per child  and supplementary services  parental kind of involvement  and then we re going to have the evaluation so that we were going to move  over a 12 year period  to proficiency  Now  when you leave out    you have 10 million children that fall into the category and 4 million of them don t get any kind of help and assistance  how in the world do you think that we are meeting our commitment to all of the children that are affected by Title I  That s what we were supposed to do  When we passed    when President Kennedy said he d go to the moon  he didn t say  Well  we ll just have enough money to get the astronauts to the moon  and then they re on their own on the way back  And when we passed Medicare  we didn t say  Well  we re going to leave the people out in Albuquerque  but we re going to cover the rest of the country KENNEDY  And when he said  We re going to get all children  we all understood that that is the nature and the type of commitment  We were going to have reform and resources  We knew what we needed  And that s why I say B  on ideas  but F on funding  There are over 3 5 million children that are being left out and left behind  and that is absolutely wrong  We adjusted our authorization figures to be able to complete it and not be excessive  and the administration signed off on those authorization figures  And those authorization figures are not being reached today  So this is just a fundamental failure MORRIS  Senator Kennedy  thank you so much for joining us today  We appreciate   KENNEDY  If there  you know  additional questions  if they want to be in touch  the writers  they can call 202 224 2633  OK  And we ll be glad to give you any more answers or information  or give you the places    references where we go  Thank you very much  Have a good time down there  All the best  Bye bye
