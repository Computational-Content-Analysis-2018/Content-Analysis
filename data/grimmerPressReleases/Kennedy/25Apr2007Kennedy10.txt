         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   As Prepared for Delivery  I commend the Task Force for its exceptional work shedding new light on the problem of poverty   This report raises a number of interesting issues and is a wake up call to both Congress and the President  The release of the report is especially timely   Hurricane Katrina brought the problem of poverty into Americas living rooms  but as the immense hardships have faded from our TV screens  theyve faded from the public conscience as well   None of us can ignore the fact  however  millions of our friends and neighbors continue to struggle to survive  The official number in poverty is 37 million  37 million men  women  and children who cant put food on the table or meet the basic needs of their families   Its an appalling number  and theres ample evidence that the actual number is much more widespread   37 million may just be the tip of the iceberg  We have a responsibility to tackle this problem more effectively   We must make work pay  provide both security and opportunity  and protect the most vulnerable in our society  Americas children  We know that families living in poverty are now increasingly likely to be working families   Since the 1970s  the number of full time workers in poverty has more than doubled  from 1 3 million then to 2 9 million today  The fundamental promise of the American Dream is that hard work leads to success and a better life  but that dream has proved to be a nightmare for many families   We have an economy that works for Wall Street  not for Main Street   The economic growth of recent years has largely bypassed working families   Those at the bottom of the economic ladder have been left farther and farther behind  Raising the minimum wage is a crucial first step in reform  Weve been stalled for far too long in Congress trying to get our bill to the Presidents desk  but weve finally reached a bipartisan agreement on a fair compromise  and Im very hopeful the President will sign it  Raising the minimum wage is only a first step though   I strongly support the Employee Free Choice Act  which will give workers the ability to choose a union that will fight more effectively for better pay and working conditions   Im grateful to the Task Force for supporting this important bill  and I look forward to its passage  In addition to making work pay  we must provide greater security and opportunity to the millions who can t find work   As todays report points out  only 35 percent of the unemployed receive unemployment benefits   Its obvious that our unemployment insurance system is in dire need of reform to serve those who need it most    Finally  and perhaps most importantly  we must protect the most vulnerable Americans  the 13 million children living below the poverty line  an increase of 1 4 million on Bushs watch   One in five children in the United States now lives in poverty  the highest child poverty rate in the industrial world  Thats a sad reflection of our national priorities and a profoundly moral issue   As the Gospel teaches us  Inasmuch as you have done it unto the least of these  you have done it unto me   We are not doing nearly enough for the most vulnerable children in our country  The Task Force calls on us to improve the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit  two of the most successful programs we have to lift children and working families out of poverty    I will also be introducing separate legislation to reduce child poverty  It calls for a 1 percent tax on the wealthiest Americans  to be used in a dedicated fund to combat child poverty and give Americas poorest children better food  better health care  and better opportunities for the future   Its a sound investment for the nation as well  the cost of childhood poverty has been estimated at  500 billion a year in lost productivity  in potential earnings  and in higher health related expenses  In the 1960s  President Johnson led America in a War on Poverty  and we are still fighting that war   Clearly  we have made progress over the decades  through Medicaid  Head Start  food stamps  and other measures  But it hasnt been enough   It is shameful that in the richest and the most powerful nation on Earth  nearly a fifth of all children go to bed hungry at night  because their parents are working full time and still can t make ends meet  It is time for Congress to bring true hope  honest opportunity  and genuine fairness to those mired in poverty across the country   I look forward to continuing this battle with you in the current Congress   We have a new majority  and with hard work together  we can make real progress for the great goal we share   Thank you all very much  POVERTY AND HUNGER FACT SHEET    Today  37 million people live in poverty  an increase of 5 4 million during the Bush Administration       13 million children are living in poverty  an increase of 1 4 million under Bushs watch   One in five children in the United States lives in poverty  the highest child poverty rate in the industrialized world     Since the late 1970s  the number of full time workers in poverty has more than doubled  from 1 3 million then to 2 9 million today  One third of welfare households have a full time worker     The child poverty rate for Latino children  28 9   is almost 3 times the rate for Caucasians  10 5     The child poverty rate for African Americans  33 6   is almost three and a half times the rate for Caucasians     4 million elderly Americans live in poverty   An additional 2 4 million live on the brink of poverty   It is predicted that we will have a 41  increase in the number of poor or near poor elderly Americans by 2015     35 million Americans are hungry or on the verge of hunger  an increase of nearly 2 million under Bushs watch   One in six children are hungry or on the verge of hunger     During the 1960s and 1970s  the yearly earnings of a full time minimum wage worker were roughly equal to the poverty level for a family of three   Today a full time minimum wage worker earns just about  10 700 a year  almost  6 000 below the federal poverty guidelines of  16 600 for a family of three         To reach the poverty level for a family of three  a minimum wage worker would need to earn  7 98 per hour  thats  2 83 more than the current minimum wage     Great Britain implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
