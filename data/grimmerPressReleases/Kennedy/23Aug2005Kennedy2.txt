         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Report attached  faxed copies available upon request   FOR  IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner                  202  224 2633 Massachusetts  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released a report detailing the state of education in Massachusetts and highlighting federal education funding for the Commonwealth over the past year  The report  called Ready to Learn  Ready to Teach and Ready to Succeed  was developed by Senator Kennedy and provides important information for parents  schools  and communities on education in the Commonwealth   Through the various federal programs encompassed in the report  the students  and families  of Massachusetts are given educational opportunities to open doors of opportunity and compete in today s global economy   Senator Kennedy said  If our nation is to succeed in this global economy  our students  teachers  schools  and families need real support  not broken promises  to help them achieve their maximum potential  There are many highly successful federal initiatives in place to prepare Massachusetts  youngest residents for school and for a lifetime of learning  Head Start  Even Start and Reading First are federal programs that focus on developing young students  early literacy  ability with numbers  and social skills  Nearly 500 000 Massachusetts adults and children participate in Even Start  a literacy program that teaches young students and their parents to read at the same time  yet under President Bush s FY 2006 education budget  Even Start funding is eliminated  Massachusetts ranks 6th in the nation in participation for six year olds in Head Start programs and 465 000 adults and children participate in Even Start  a literacy program that teaches young students and their parents to read at the same time  Under President Bush s FY 2006 budget  Even Start funding is eliminated  The report outlines the ever growing challenges faced by teachers serving on the frontlines of our schools every day  Many schools across the country already face teacher shortages  but the problem will only worsen over the next ten years with two million new teachers needed to grow with the increasing student population  With a third of all teachers leaving the field within the first three years of teaching  Senator Kennedy has proposed legislation that would reward students who become teachers and serve in low income schools and those who teach math  science or special education  The Teach Excellence for All Children Act of 2005  TEACH  would provide loan repayment assistance and up front tuition assistance for future teachers  Senator Kennedy has also focused his work on enabling high school graduates to afford a college education  including securing more federal funding for need based student aid  One of the biggest barriers to college is the skyrocketing cost  It s estimated that nationally  each year  at least 400 000 college ready students will not attend a four year college because they cannot afford to do so  For students who do attend college  the costs have never been greater  Students face an average of  5 800 in unmet financial burden even after their grants  their loans  and their part time work  Senator Kennedy has a proposal  called the Student Aid Reward Act  which would reform the federal student loan program and direct billions of dollars in savings from that reform into increased student aid  Students who graduate from high school and join the workforce look to further their education as working adults in order to stay competitive in the workplace  He believes that the federal funds that support these post secondary programs must be flexible and adequate to meet these changing educational needs  Many highly successful grant programs in Massachusetts such as GEAR UP and TRIO provide college awareness opportunities  counseling  tutoring  and other supports so that low income and first generation students can apply to  attend and finish college  Senator Kennedy has fought in the United States Senate to ensure that these programs continue to receive the funding that s necessary to sustain these competitive grants  An amendment  sponsored by Kennedy during the budget debate this year would have restored 5 4 billion dollars to TRIO and GEAR UP  The amendment was stripped by the Republican leadership  Under the Bush administration  numerous education initiatives have been slashed or zeroed out in the budget   The report shows that Massachusetts received over  658 million in programs to help kids enter school ready to learn  over  110 million in programs to provide teachers with supports they need to enter the classroom ready to teach  and  328 million in programs to help graduates be ready to succeed    Massachusetts  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released a report detailing the state of education in Massachusetts and highlighting federal education funding for the
