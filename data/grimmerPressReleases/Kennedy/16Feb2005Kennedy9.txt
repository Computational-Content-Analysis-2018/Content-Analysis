         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Thank you  Mr  Chairman  and I commend you for calling this hearing on prescription drug imports      In recent years  these drugs have revolutionized the practice of medicine  providing new treatments for heart disease  diabetes  and many other serious diseases  Often these drugs can prevent such diseases from spiraling out of control and causing enormous suffering  even death  and great expense to patients and our health care system    Yet not all Americans have access to affordable  effective  and safe supplies of the drugs their doctors prescribe  Americans pay almost double the price charged for the same drugs in other developed nations  and the cost of drugs continues to skyrocket in a way that is neither fair nor sustainable  It s no surprise that innovative seniors discovered that an opportunity for instant relief was available in Canada  and began organizing bus trips across the border from many of our northern States to purchase the safe and more affordable drugs for sale in every Canadian pharmacy     In Massachusetts  the City of Springfield began using Canadian pharmacies to provide prescription drugs for its city employees and retirees  Springfield s example led the way for other cities  such as Boston  to do the same  Whole States are involved as well  as Governor Pawlenty will tell us  The Internet revolution vastly expanded the opportunity  enabling patients across America to go to Canada on the Internet and save thousands of dollars a year on their prescriptions     Meanwhile  the European Union has had parallel trade in drugs from one member nation to another for decades  As we will hear from Dr  Rost  parallel trade in Europe is safe and it saves money    American experiences such as Springfield s and Minnesota s and the European experience with parallel trade show us that we can import drugs safely and that importation will make drugs more affordable  Access to affordable drugs is critical to patients in Springfield  in Boston  and in every city and town in Massachusetts  In fact  it is critical to patients in every American State    Senators Dorgan  Snowe  Grassley  McCain Jeffords  Clinton  Bingaman  and I introduced a bill last week  S  334  to allow the importation of safe  FDA approved drugs manufactured in plants inspected by FDA  and we hope it will be enacted quickly this year  It will allow American patients to buy safe drugs at the fair prices that Canadians and Europeans pay  not the exorbitant prices that patients are forced to pay here in the United States     Finally  President Bush has threatened to veto any attempt to change the new Medicare prescription drug law  and I agree that nothing should be done to weaken an already weak drug benefit  We re talking today about the safe importation of prescription drugs from Canada and Europe  But I believe that the White House should consider an additional common sense step as well to curb the costs of the new Medicare law and assure a better drug benefit for seniors and the disabled  By allowing the Medicare program to negotiate fair prices with drug manufacturers  we can save  190 billion over the next decade  The Veterans Administration has such negotiating authority and has used it wisely to cut costs and help our veterans with their prescription drug needs  And I believe this is a practical step that the White House should consider as well    I welcome Surgeon General Carmona  Governor Pawlenty  and our other witnesses today  and I look forward to their testimony      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
