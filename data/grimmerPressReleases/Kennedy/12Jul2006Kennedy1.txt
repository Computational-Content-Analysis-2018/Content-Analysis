         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        Washington  D C   Today  after participating in the Senate Judiciary hearing on comprehensive immigration reform  Senator Edward M  Kennedy joined leading clergy and faith leaders from 20 different organizations for a conference focusing on immigration reform and faith principles and practice  Across the country  religious communities strongly support the McCain Kennedy plan to fix our broken system while speaking out against the draconian House bill that would criminalize the undocumented and those who provide them with help  Different faith communities have taken the lead in organizing the historic rallies in support of comprehensive reform that involved over 4 million people this year    While Congress debates immigration  you know the immigrants  You know them by name as members of your congregations  as people who love their families  practice their faiths and participate in your communities  You know them as human beings  created in the image of God   Senator Kennedy said to the religious leaders  So you  more than most  know that immigration reform is about our security  but it must also be about our humanity   Other Congressional participants included Senators McCain and Brownback  Representatives John Lewis and Howard Berman along with religious leaders including Sojouners founder Jim Wallis    Below are Senator Kennedys prepared remarks    Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy To Interfaith Religious Leaders  As Prepared for Delivery   Thank you for the warm introduction and thank you for your interest in immigration reform that is strong and fair   While Congress debates immigration  you know the immigrants  You know them by name as members of your congregations  as people who love their families  practice their faiths and participate in your communities  You know them as human beings  created in the image of God   So you  more than most  know that immigration reform is about our security  but it must also be about our humanity   There are few issues more basic to our faith than how we treat others  not just our friends and countrymen  but those from other countries and traditions   Leviticus teaches us that  The alien living with you must be treated as one of your native born  Love him as yourself  for you were aliens in Egypt   And we remember the words of Christ from St  Matthews Gospel that we are not only to feed the hungry and care for the sick  but to welcome the stranger  And Thomas Merton took that further when he reminded us that we are wiser as people when we not only welcome  but we listen  to the voice of the stranger   That is our tradition  That is our faith  That is our calling  Especially in these difficult times with the high emotion and political fervor that surround the issue    There is a vocal band in the House of Representatives that insists that immigration is just an enforcement problem  They propose to build more fences and hire more border patrol  They are the ones who declared undocumented immigrants to be criminals and the clergy and Good Samaritans who help them to be felons  They want immigrants simply to report to deport   But that is not the approach that Senator McCain and I have taken  and that passed the Senate 62 to 36   Our bill contains tough enforcement  yes  at the border  at our ports  and at the workplace   But it also provides a path for the 12 million undocumented immigrants to earn their way to American citizenship  These are workers with jobs  They are parents with children  In fact  1 6 million of the undocumented are children  and three million American citizen children have undocumented parents  Our bill says we need to bring these families out of the shadows   Finally  our bill provides a program for the future to allow more people to come to meet our ongoing labor force needs  Without this step  we are destined to return to repeat the mistakes of the past and end up with a large undocumented population once again   That is our plan  It is supported by community leaders  business leaders  and religious leaders  It has bipartisan support in Congress  It has the support of President Bush  who has been an outspoken leader on this issue   But most important  it is supported by a majority of Americans because they understand that this is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive solution    Despite this support  the path before us is rocky and hard  Little time is left in this session of Congress  and those opposed to comprehensive reform are doing everything they can to play out the clock    You  like Isaiah  are the prophets for our time  anointed to preach good news to the poor  bind hearts that are broken  proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners  We need your voice on this issue more than ever  And I look forward to working with you closely in the critical days that lie ahead   Again  thank you for your support and your interest in immigration reform  And thank you for having me here today                Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
