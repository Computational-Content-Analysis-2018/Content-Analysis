         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Thank you  Nan  for that wonderful introduction  I commend the Alliance for its long standing commitment to the rule of law and your dedication to liberty  justice  and opportunity for all  Youve been a pioneer in educating the public about the impact of the federal courts on Americans everyday lives  and the important film you will present today continues that vital service At the heart of many of the serious challenges we face is the Bush Administrations lack of respect for the rule of law  The Administration views our system of justice as merely another arena for furthering its right wing ideology  It sees the Senates constitutional role in confirming those who enforce our laws as a road block to be circumvented whenever possible The on going scandal over the firing of United States Attorneys is a stunning example  Using a stealth provision slipped into the Patriot Act reauthorization  the Administration has replaced U S  Attorneys without Senate review  Each day the evidence grows that the White House fired U S  Attorneys because they balked at using the enormous power of federal law enforcement to serve the partisan ends of the Republican Party  Carol Lam in San Diego had been too vigorous in pursuing corrupt Republican Congressman Randy Duke Cunningham  David Iglesias in New Mexico had refused to indict Democrats before last Novembers election  John McKay in the State of Washington had refused to pursue voter fraud charges as a means of challenging a Democrats close victory in the 2004 election for governor  Equally disturbing  several of the U S  Attorneys appointed without Senate review have scant litigation experience  but deep partisan credentials  For instance  Bradley Schlozman the new U S  Attorney for the Western District of Missouri  was involved in the politicization of the Justice Departments voting rights enforcement efforts  After President Bush took office in 2001  the Department filed only one case alleging race discrimination against African Americans in voting  but it took a number of steps to undermine voting rights for partisan gain  In 2003  Mr  Schlozman and other political appointees approved Tom DeLays Texas redistricting scheme over the unanimous objections of career staff that the plan discriminated against Latino voters  The Texas plan was later struck down by the Supreme Court because of its discriminatory effect  In 2005  Mr  Schlozman again overrode career professionals in approving a Georgia photo identification requirement for voting that clearly discriminated against minority voters  That law was later blocked by a federal court that compared it to a twenty first century poll tax  Mr  Schlozman also was involved in filing amicus briefs in the key battleground states of Florida  Michigan  and Ohio in 2004  seeking to prevent the counting of provisional ballots in the Presidential election  Other attorneys with relatively little litigation experience but strong partisan credentials have been placed in U S  Attorney positions in states likely to be vital in the 2008 election  such as Florida  Iowa  Minnesota  and Arkansas  to name a few  Add to this that John McKay and David Iglesias were removed in battleground states because of their unwillingness to pursue meritless voter fraud allegations  Tim Griffin  Karl Roves former deputy  was sent to Arkansas  The conclusion is inescapable that the Administration has methodically placed reliable partisans in positions where they can influence the outcome of the 2008 election  The havoc the administration has played with the Justice Department is complemented by the damage it has done to the courts  In choosing nominees for the federal courts  particularly the Supreme Court  President Bush selected ideologues  and then sought to circumvent the process by which the Senate obtains information about the nominees  legal views   In my years in the Senate  Ive had the honor of participating in 23 Supreme Court nominations  including the nominations for each of the justices now serving on the Court and hundreds of lower court judges  More than any other President before him  George Bush has succeeded in denying the Senate the information it needs to make informed judgments about nominees to the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts  Despite days of testimony  the hearings for John Roberts and Samuel Alito served only to obscure the legal views and philosophies that would guide their work if confirmed  The film Quiet Revolution comes at a time when the Supreme Court nomination process is in need of a serious overhaul  I intend to work with Senator Leahy  the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  and my colleagues on the Committee  to ensure that the process again becomes a means for learning about legal views and philosophies before nominees are confirmed The breakdown in the nomination process matters  because the Supreme Court decides issues of enormous importance to Americans daily lives  The confirmation process is the Senates constitutionally conferred opportunity to determine that nominees deserve to be entrusted with this awesome responsibility  In the past  questions asked at confirmation hearings  together with the candidates records  often gave Senators a solid basis for deciding whether or not to confirm a nominee  In fact  I voted for three of the five Supreme Court Justices nominated by President Reagan In rare instances  it may be possible to know from the nominees records alone whether they should be confirmed  In most cases  though  a realistic exchange during the hearings is invaluable  This is particularly true when  as in the Roberts and Alito nominations  a President intentionally selects nominees for their legal views and for their lack of a paper trail that would reveal such views  In past years  Senate questioning of nominees generally served well the Framers desire to ensure checks and balances in appointing Supreme Court justices  The system worked as it was intended in 1970  when President Nixon s nomination of Harrold Carswell was derailed after the Senate discovered his segregationist past  The process also worked in 1987  when the Senate rejected Robert Bork s extreme views  prompting President Reagan to nominate the more moderate Anthony M  Kennedy  who was confirmed unanimously  The confirmation process broke down  however  because the Bush Administration learned the wrong lesson from the failed Bork nomination  It decided it could still nominate extremists  as long as their views were not well known  The previous Bush administration tried a similar approach with Clarence Thomas nomination  but the current White House turned the effort to hide nominees views into an art form  It insisted that the Senate must confine its inquiry largely to its nominees  personal qualities  and coached its nominees to evade the Committees questions  Many Republican Senators used their time to praise  not probe  the nominees  Guided by White House aides  the nominees resisted attempts to explore their judicial philosophies  As a result  the thoughtful exchanges of past hearings were replaced by carefully directed theater  which left the Committee with only hints about how nominees viewed the major legal issues of the day  Thats unacceptable  Qualified Supreme Court nominees are selected from among the nations most seasoned and intellectually vigorous lawyers  scholars  and judges  Of course they have thought deeply about the law and have substantive views on important legal issues  At the very least  they have read and debated the major cases that every first year law student has read  and they can intelligently discuss whether they agreed or disagreed with those cases  Instead of substantive answers on these issues  Roberts and Alito worked hard to give the impression of moderation  Over and over  they assured us that they would not bring an ideological agenda to the bench After confirmation  we saw an entirely different side of Judges Roberts and Alito  Although its still very early in their terms on the Court  they have already begun to reveal themselves as ideologues ready and willing to tilt the court away from core protections important to the American people  In fact  in their very first term on the Court  according to a report completed at Georgetown University Law Center  they voted together in 91 percent of all cases and 88 percent of non unanimous cases  more than any other two justices   They have held that the First Amendment does not protect public workers who blow the whistle on internal fraud and corruption  They have sought to radically cut back the Clean Water Act  which protects our natural heritage from pollution  The topics in which their decisions raise the greatest concerns  however  are among those that were most troubling during their confirmation hearings  government power and civil rights Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito have voted repeatedly to expand the power of the state at the expense of cherished individual rights  Their position is particularly troubling in light of the Bush Administrations unprecedented effort to expand Presidential power  It claims that the President can arrest American citizens on American soil and jail them for years  without access to counsel or the courts  It claims that the President can open the mail of U S  citizens and spy on persons on American soil  without the court order required by law  The Administration even believes that torture can be an acceptable practice  despite laws and treaties that expressly prohibit it Seldom has the nation been more in need of a Supreme Court that will restrain a President who overreaches  But the records of the two newest justices give little hope that they will do so  In Hamdan v  Rumsfeld  the Court reviewed the constitutionality of President Bushs military commissions  created to judge alleged enemy combatants in secret and without the protections typically afforded criminal defendants  The Court held that the President had violated both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions by establishing the commissions without Congressional authority  Justice Alito disagreed  although during his confirmation hearing  he claimed no longer to believe  as he had written in a 1985 job application very strongly in the supremacy of the elected branches of government  Although Chief Justice Roberts did not participate in the Hamdan Supreme Court decision  as a court of appeals judge in the same case  he too had sided with the President Justices Roberts and Alito have both sought to narrow individual protections against government power  They joined a 5 4 opinion in Hudson v  Michigan holding that your home is no longer your castle  Rejecting almost a century of precedent  they ruled that evidence obtained in unconstitutional searches of Americans homes can be used to convict them  Justice Alito had replaced Justice OConnor  and his vote probably changed the outcome of the case   The new justices records also raise alarm bells in civil rights  As an official in the Reagan Justice Department  Roberts had opposed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988  had sought to narrow Title IXs protection against sex discrimination in education  and had worked extensively but unsuccessfully to prevent a key amendment to the Voting Rights Act to outlaw unfair tactics that dilute minorities votes  Memoranda he drafted made clear that his opposition to the amendment reflected not only the Reagan Administrations position  but his own strongly personal held beliefs  During the Senate hearing on his nomination  I asked about his views on the Voting Rights Act  particularly his statement that the Acts protection against vote dilution was one of the most intrusive interferences imaginable by federal courts into state and local processes  In response  he suggested that his words were nothing more than an effort to articulate the views of the administration       for which I worked        Today  too late  its clear that Chief Justice Roberts s personal view is the same as the position he advocated then  In LULAC v  Perry  the Supreme Court held that Tom Delays Texas redistricting plan violated the Voting Rights Act by excluding many Latinos from the district at a time when their numbers had become large enough for Latinos to elect a representative of their choice Chief Justice Roberts denied the obvious injustice  He concluded that the courts should not have been involved  and that it is a sordid business  this divvying us up by race  Fortunately  a majority of the Court understood that the Voting Rights Act  far from dividing Americans  keeps the divisions that already exist in society from shutting minorities out of the political process  Even worse  although he did not participate in the LULAC case  it appears that Justice Alito may become the member of the Court most hostile to civil rights  In Burlington Northern  Santa Fe Railroad v  White  the Court reviewed the claim of a working mother whose employer had subjected her to shift changes  undesirable job assignments  and poor job reviews after she complained of sexual harassment  Justice Alito was the only member of the Court who argued that Title VII protects workers only from limited kinds of retaliation   The comments of Justices Roberts and Alito at argument in the Seattle and Louisville voluntary integration cases also did not inspire confidence  although it is  of course  a mistake to assume too much from Justices questions at oral argument  At his nomination hearing  Chief Justice Roberts had testified that the Court in Brown v  Board of Education was right to look at the discrimination in       context         But his questions at the oral argument ignored context  drawing no distinction between the stigmatizing segregation at issue in Brown and present day efforts to achieve integration so that all children enjoy the benefit of a diverse learning environment  Although Justice Alito had testified at his confirmation hearing that he valued having a diverse group of students in the classes he taught as a law professor  he seemed unwilling to recognize the importance of diversity in the voluntary integration cases  Its too soon to know for certain  but the oral arguments suggest that the praise the new justices heaped on Brown v  Board at their confirmation hearings will ring hollow once the final votes are counted in the voluntary integration cases  At a time when vast legal issues are being decided by the slimmest of margins  we cannot afford to learn nominees  views only after they have obtained lifetime tenure on the nations highest court  The only way to know whether a nominee will meet the high bar for confirmation is to have an honest  in depth exchange during the nominations process  The Judiciary Committee  the Senate and the American Bar Association need to work together  with the White House  to make that happen  I support reform despite my belief that the next justice will be nominated by a Democratic president and be sent to a Democratic Senate for confirmation Reform should begin with a few basic changes  We must somehow put the advice back into the constitutional requirement that nominees be appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate  In the recent nominations of Justices Alito and Roberts  President Bush made token calls to many of us in the Senate before announcing his selections  but it was clear his decision had already been made  A better course would be to allow real advice and consultation before making a choice  In addition  any qualified nominee to the Supreme Court will have spent many years thinking about legal issues  We should require that nominees share their thinking with the Judiciary Committee and not pretend that such candor is tantamount to prejudging specific cases  We know from their past decisions how most of the current justices interpret Roe v  Wade  yet they are not precluded from sitting on future cases involving abortion  Why then shouldnt we also know how Supreme Court nominees view Roe v  Wade and other important legal decisions  The Judiciary Committee also needs to improve how it obtains information  An in depth inquiry requires more than short rounds of questions that move from Senator to Senator  The Senate should insist on having the same access to the nominee s writings and other relevant documents as the Administration  and it should receive those records before the hearing  Each member of the Committee should have the right to submit a limited number of written questions to the nominee  which the nominee should answer in writing in detail under oath before the confirmation hearings  This will enable Senators to go into greater depth in the hearings themselves  and it will give the Senate  and the American people  valuable information in considering nominees In addition  no Senator should accept incomplete answers from a nominee about important legal issues  regardless of which partys President made the nomination  Nor should nominees who have served as high ranking government officials  as Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito did  get away with claiming they were just representing a client when asked about advice they gave in their roles as legal policy makers  Only if every member of the Senate insists on responsiveness from the nominees will we restore open dialogue to the nominations process  As Senator Arlen Specter wrote in his book  Passion for Truth The Senate should resist  if not refuse to confirm  Supreme Court nominees who refuse to answer questions on fundamental issues  In voting on whether or not to confirm a nominee  senators should not have to gamble or guess about a candidates philosophy  but should be able to judge on the basis of the candidates expressed views Finally  and above all  we must remember what this process is all about  Its nice to hear that a nominee has a loving family  faithful friends  and a sense of humor  Its important to know that nominees possess the intellect  life experience  and discipline to make a good judge  But its essential that we learn enough about their legal views to be certain that they will make good on the simple promise engraved in marble over the entrance to the Supreme Court  Equal Justice Under Law I commend all of you at the Alliance for all you do so well to keep those four basic words at the heart of this all important debate  Thank you very much  and I hope youll watch the Alliances important documentary  Quiet Revolution    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner
