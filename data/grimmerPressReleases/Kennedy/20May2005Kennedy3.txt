         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The 102nd Fighter Wing at Otis is truly America s First Responder  As we all saw on September 11  2001  Otis was the first air defense unit to respond  and its planes were in the air moments after receiving the call     The unit is on alert  24 hours a day  seven days a week  prepared for anything  One hundred times since then  the unit has scrambled in response to alert warnings    On December 22  2001  it was planes from Otis that intercepted the commercial airliner with the shoe bomber on board and escorted it safely to Logan Airport  protecting us from that terrorist attack  Last Tuesday  we saw another example of your indispensable role when Otis jets scrambled to intercept an Alitalia flight with a passenger on the no fly list  and escorted it to Bangor    Closing this base will make us more vulnerable by reducing fighter coverage for the Boston metropolitan area and the entire region  Under the Pentagon proposal  only four interceptor aircraft stationed at Bradley will be within a 175 mile radius of Boston  That s not enough for a large metropolitan area with so many high value targets    It s not clear how this closure saves money in the BRAC process  A full contingent of aircraft at Otis can conduct more efficient and more responsive operations than four aircraft stationed at Bradley  If the Air National Guard leaves  the Coast Guard will have to make an impossible choice    either bear the full cost of operating on the Massachusetts Military Reservation  or else shut down its Cape Cod Air Station  Either way the result would be a serious reduction in homeland defense operations on the entire East Coast    We had every expectation during the preparations for this BRAC round that the Pentagon understood the importance of Otis  But in the end  they got it wrong  and we intend to fight this closure     We have a team of experts now in Washington going over the BRAC data to identify the serious weaknesses in the BRAC proposal  The true military value of Otis was obviously not assessed accurately in the Pentagon analysis  and we will do all we can to reverse this misguided decision     We ll take our case directly to the Pentagon and the BRAC commission  and we ll fight for Otis every step of the way in the months ahead   Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
