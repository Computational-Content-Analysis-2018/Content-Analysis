         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Just a few minutes ago  the President of the United States vetoed the children s health insurance legislation that reflects the bipartisan support of the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States and has the support of children  families  of Americans all over the country      How could the President of the United States possibly veto this legislation  How could the president be so uninformed about the needs of these children  I think that this is probably the most in inexplicable veto in the history of the country      It is incomprehensible  It is intolerable  It s unacceptable      Democrats pleaded with the members of the Republican party to give us their help and their support so that we could pass this legislation  Now we have that opportunity  The ball is in our court  We can do something about it      This is a defining issue  not only about children but also about the values of this country  So I hope the Democrats and Republicans alike will come together and say that children ought to come first in the United   States of America      This is a value issue  It is a family issue  And it s something that demands action  and I hope we will over override this veto          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
