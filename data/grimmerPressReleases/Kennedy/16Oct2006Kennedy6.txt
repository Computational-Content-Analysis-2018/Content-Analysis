in federal funding for the Center  and an additional  200 000 is currently pending in the Labor  Health and Human Services appropriations bill expected to pass Congress later this fall  The Center was created to serve nonprofit groups in Southeastern Massachusetts and Northern Rhode Island through training  research  and volunteer service   Below are Senator Kennedys remarks as prepared for delivery      Remarks of Senator Edward M  Kennedy At Stonehill Colleges Martin Institute Easton  Massachusetts  AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY      A few years ago  Stonehill let me know its plan to create the Center for Nonprofit Management  It was a very impressive concept  an institution designed to make a difference for those who are working themselves to make a difference in our communities    You already had a strong tradition of community service  especially your Into the Streets program for students and faculty to volunteer in their communities  and your HOPE trips  when students give up their Spring Break to serve others  Stonehill was exactly the right place to create such a center    Across Southeastern Massachusetts  were blessed to have many non profits  and charities  and individuals working to improve cities and towns from Provincetown to Fall River and from Brockton to New Bedford and Taunton    Often  the work they perform isnt glamorous  But it is challenging  and no local organization can be expected to be familiar with every potential partner  donor  or volunteer base available  And thats where Stonehill and all of you have stepped in to fill that gap    The Center helps to magnify the impact of the remarkable work those volunteers are doing  Kate Crossin sets a wonderful and inspiring example today by transforming her volunteer work through the Center into a vocation and assisting homeless families in Brockton at the David Jon Louison Family Center  Thank you Kate for your commitment and for sharing your story with us today    Through the Center for Nonprofit Management  Stonehill is creating a model that can be used nationwide in the years to come to help students and universities bring positive change to their communities  and you should be proud    As my brother Robert Kennedy said when he spoke to students in South Africa in 1966  Each time a person stands up for an ideal  or acts to improve the lot of others  or strikes out against injustice  he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope  and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring  those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance    We know that works  because youve seen it work first hand  Paul Rusesabagina spoke here recently  This extraordinary Ordinary Man put his life on the line to protect 1 200 refugees from murderous bands in Rwanda    His example proves the truth of what President Kennedy liked to say  that each of us could make a difference  and all of us should try  His courage and achievement certainly call into question whether we can do more and why we arent  especially when we witness the tragedy unfolding in Darfur    The truth is we can do more  and its up to each of us to try    The Greatest Generation is one of the most inspiring examples  A generation of courageous men and women came home from World War II  grateful that good had triumphed over evil and committed to pushing America to live up its highest ideals at home and abroad    They believed in public service  in giving of themselves  and in a politics of hope and opportunity  They believed that America was a beacon to the world  that there was nothing we couldnt accomplish    They challenged totalitarianism everywhere so that the world could be free  They signed nuclear arms control treaties to protect our nation and the world those devastating weapons    They led the nation to break down the walls of institutionalized discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity through the Civil Rights Acts and the Voting Rights Act  They attacked discrimination based on sex  on religion  and on physical disability    They lifted up tens of millions of fellow citizens out of the crushing burden of poverty  They created Medicare and Medicaid so that seniors and low income families would no longer be denied the basic health care they need    They realized that education was becoming the ticket to the American dream and they passed landmark legislation to help remove cost as a barrier to students who made the grade    They found time to put a man on the moon  That was truly the politics of hope  a time when America lived by the motto of the Army Air Force in World War II The difficult we do immediately  the impossible takes a little longer    Too often now  we seem to have lost sight of those ideals  We see cynicism replacing hope in the electorate  and political leaders specialize in sowing fear and division    Young men and women are sent off to an endless war that America never should have fought    Hundreds of thousands of fellow Americans were needlessly left behind in the wake of Hurricane Katrina    The rising tide no longer lifts all the boats  Working families and the middle class fall farther behind  as the economic gulf between the haves and the have nots widens out of control    Every day  when children across the country put their hands on their hearts and say the Pledge of Allegiance  they conclude with these majestic words  liberty and justice for all    Is a nation where the top 1  now own more wealth than the bottom 90  of our people the just society which we honor with our hearts as we pledge allegiance to our nation     Is a nation where the top tenth of 1  have more income than the bottom third of our people the just society which we pledge our allegiance to    We see this transition from the politics of hope to the politics of fear all around us  and we ask  how we can change things    There is a way  and its called committing ourselves to the public square  becoming involved in our communities  speaking out for whats right  whats fair  whats just    Time and again throughout our history  weve learned that we have the capacity to find solutions to our problems  All we have to do is try    Our founders had no model for creating the worlds most enduring democracy  Abraham Lincoln had no formula for keeping the Union together during the Civil War    There was no manual for FDR to follow to lift us out of the Great Depression  Harry Truman had no way of knowing how to prevent Western Europe from descending into chaos after World War II    But at each of these critical moments in our history  they did have Americans ready  willing  and able to serve their fellow citizens and reach out to others  men and women just like all of you today    None of us has all the answers to the challenges that confront our communities today  but we each have the ability to make a difference  All we need is the will    We do have great challenges before us  How to end this misguided war  bring our courageous forces home in dignity and honor  and provide real security for our people     How to deal with the worsening crisis in health care that now has 46 million Americans without health insurance    How to keep our nation economically strong in the 21st Century  when other nations challenging us for economic supremacy    How to make sure that every child  in Brockton  in New Bedford  in Fall River  in Taunton  and here in Easton  has the opportunity to obtain the education they need for the jobs of the future    How to deal with festering energy problems that now threaten the very health of our planet itself    Each of these challenges is daunting  but all of them can be met if we truly devote ourselves to the task    Youre blessed to attend such a wonderful school  with a faculty that cares about you and pushes you to fulfill your potential for yourself  your country  and your planet    In the years ahead  the foundation youre laying with the Center for Nonprofit Management and your strong commitment to civic involvement will make a growing difference for countless people throughout this region    Its an extraordinary vision and opportunity  and I hope all of you will participate  Our community and our country need you  We need your time  your commitment  your energy  and your enthusiasm  and with it  we will not fail  Thank you all very much     Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
