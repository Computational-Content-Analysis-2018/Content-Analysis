         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC Today  the Senate voted to defeat an amendment offered by Senator DeMint  which would have repealed Davis Bacon prevailing wage standards for construction workers  Senator Kennedy released the following statement Today  the Senate stood up for fair wages for Americas hardworking construction workers who build and repair our nations bridges  This unconscionable amendment would have put the safety of the traveling public at risk  Paying construction workers fair wages assures that the work done is the highest quality  not sold to the lowest bidder  The American public who expect to travel our roads and bridges in safety deserve no less   Senator Kennedys Remarks on the Senate Floor this morningAs Prepared for Delivery This is a vital issue to protect the safety of the American public  This amendment would affect every man  woman  and child who drives on American highways and who travels across our bridges  When you drive to work in the mornings  you want your roads and bridges to be safe  When your children ride the bus to school  you dont want to wonder if the bridges are safe  That is why our laws require that workers for these jobs be paid the prevailing wage  so its not only fair for workers  but so we can assure the American public that the work that is done is of the highest quality  That is what our Davis Bacon laws are all about  What happened in Minneapolis was a terrible tragedy  All of us agree that our nations bridges must be repaired and rebuilt so that nothing like this ever happens again  This amendment would do the opposite  instead of making our nations highways safer  it would endanger the lives of the American public by attacking quality construction  Davis Bacon is a policy that was adopted with bipartisan support  and indeed  was championed by Republicans in the House and Senate  to ensure that workers are paid locally prevailing wages  Paying prevailing wages gets taxpayers quality work performed by well trained  highly skilled  efficient workers who are paid a fair wage  Senator DeMint asserts that Davis Bacon leads to sky high costs  This is simply not true  The annual salary of construction workers is very modest  the median wage for construction is  35 000 per year  Davis Bacon wages are often below this average  because they reflect the local wages and economic conditions  For example  A laborer in Greene  Alabama  earns  8 56 per hour or  13 696 per year  An ironworker in Des Moines  Iowa  earns  20 60 per hour  or  32 960 per year A laborer in Denver  Colorado  earns  16 29 per hour  or  26 064 per year  A bridge painter in Charleston  South Carolina  makes  8 47 per hour  or  13 552 per year  Several studies show that prevailing wage laws do not increase construction costs  Indeed  a study of nine southwestern and mountain states found that prevailing wages led to costs of building construction that were on average  6 to  35 per square foot less than without prevailing wages And better wages lead to better construction  A 2004 study analyzing federal highway wage data found that Better wages led to an average savings of  30 000 to  34 000 per mile of highway construction  Better wages led to higher productivity  higher wage states require 32 35  fewer labor hours to complete the same work than lower wage states Davis Bacon is also about treating construction workers fairly  These men and women work hard to ensure that we can travel our nations roads safely  and they deserve to be treated with dignity  They work long hours in the hot sun of summer and the freeing winds of winter  Year in  year out  month after month  in the most difficult and dangerous circumstances  they are out there every day and building our highways and bridges so that our economy can grow and our people can travel  Surely  we owe it to these hardworking Americans to make sure they are paid a decent wage  In fact  construction is one of our most dangerous industries  with over 1 100 deaths and over 414 000 work related injuries and illnesses each year  Construction accounts for more worker deaths than any other type of job  indeed  the industry accounts for 20  of all workers killed on the job each year  The fatality rate for construction workers is almost three times the national average Jobs involved in bridge building are particularly dangerous  Structural iron and steel workers had a fatality rate of more than 13 times the national average  Studies have shown that prevailing wage laws lead to lower rates of injury among workers  reducing the number of injuries by 10 to 20 percent That means that without federal prevailing wages laws  workers nationwide could suffer up to 76 000 additional injuries  leading to 675 000 more lost work days and billions of dollars in additional costs each year  For the safety of our citizens and the dignity of our workers  I urge my colleagues to oppose the DeMint amendment       Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
