         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washington  DC  Today President Bush declared that some people have selectively quoted from  the NIE  to make the case that by fighting the terrorists  by fighting in Iraq  we are making our people less secure here at home  He went on to say that this argument buys into the enemy s propaganda that the terrorists attack us because we re provoking them    Below is Senator Kennedys statement in response    Rather than accepting the cold hard facts from the intelligence community that the war in Iraq has created a new generation of terrorists  the President continues to attack those who disagree with his policies  Americans deserve the full story but instead all they hear is worn out White House spin  the Administration should declassify the entire intelligence report on the wars global impact and stop slow walking the Iraq report that is long overdue    Mr  President  its your propaganda the American people are no longer buying     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
