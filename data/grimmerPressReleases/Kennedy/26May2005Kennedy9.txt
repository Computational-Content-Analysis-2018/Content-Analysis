         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The essence of the American dream is that if people work hard and play by the rules they can provide security for their families  But more and more Americans today are finding that their security is slipping away  and if we do not take steps to protect them it will continue to erode     Economic security is being increasingly undermined by globalization  It s becoming harder for children to expect to do as well as their parents  Costs are rising while wages and benefits are falling  Americans are working longer and harder without enjoying the fruits of their labor     The 2001 recession hit the nation hardmillions of employees lost their jobs  and many of those jobs still haven t come back  The slow recovery was made worse by the pressures of globalization  More than ever before in our history  American workers are competing against workers around the world     Sadly  this competition has become a race to the bottom   whoever is willing to work for the lowest wages gets the work    That s why more and more American jobs are going overseas  We ve lost nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs since 2001  Most are good  middle class jobs  with decent wages and benefits  And it s not just blue collar jobs  millions of high paying white collar jobs are now at risk of being shipped overseas  especially computer jobs  and even many business and management jobs     This competition from abroad is also pushing down wages  Americans are working harder than ever  pushing productivity to record levels  But all that hard work is going into profits instead of employees  wages  Profits are up more than 70 percent since the recovery began  while wages have fallen in seven of the last twelve months     The sad truth is that the globalization is threatening the middle class  I remember when Americans who worked hard could support their families     But today  middle class jobs are hard to find  Increasingly  our workforce is dividing into workers with high skills in the right fields  who can still find high paying jobs with benefits  and the rest  who are left to compete for low paying work without benefits     Over the next decade  seven of the ten occupations that the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts will add the most jobs are low paying jobs  such as cashiers  food workers  retail salespersons  and janitors  At the same time  demand will increase for highly skilled workers in a few key fields  such as nursing and college teaching  that can t be shipped overseas  or in occupations that the global economy keeps in high demand  such as managers  accountants  and computer engineers     We must deal effectively with both sides of this division  We must invest in our economy to create more high paying jobs  We must strengthen labor protections  so that workers aren t harmed by globalization but share in the prosperity they create  At the same time  we must invest in higher education and job training to fill the high paying jobs of the future and help ensure our future competitiveness in this global economy     Today  more women  people of color  and older Americans are in the workforce than ever before  Women now make up just under half of the labor force  which also means more parents are in the workplace  Today  in 70 percent of American families  all parents are working  either one single parent or both parents  the exact opposite of 1960  when 70 percent of all families had at least one parent at home full time  Workers today  and in the future  will need more flexibility  such as guaranteed paid sick days and expanded Family and Medical Leave in order to balance their work responsibilities more fairly with their families  basic needs     Minorities are also becoming a larger part of the workforcein the last twenty years  the proportion of minorities in the workforce has grown by more than 45 percent  But minorities consistently have higher unemployment and receive lower pay than whites     In the global economy  our prosperity depends on making the best use of the talents of every American worker  When minorities don t have equal economic opportunities  our economy suffers    The workforce is also becoming older as the baby boom generation ages  and older workers are losing economic insecurity  Between soaring retiree health costs and increasingly threatened pensions  many employees can t afford to retire  Our retirement system itself has shifted to require workers to bear more and more risk  That makes it even more important to protect Social Security and preserve retiree health benefits and pensions     American workers face risk and insecurity in their daily lives and in their future  The global challenge is jeopardizing the very heart of the American Dream  But it doesn t have to be this way  Our economy can work for everyone if we make the right choices  We can create the same spirit of innovation  invention  and progress that brought us the automobile  the airplane  and the computer  Year after year  we brought the American dream closer for all our citizens  and we can t afford to let it slip away again    I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses on these all important issues  and to working with our colleagues to ease this unfair burden    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
