         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE             REMARKS AND FACT SHEET INCLUDED   Washington  DC   Today Senators Harry Reid and Edward M  Kennedy offered an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill  requiring the Administration to provide an honest and candid assessment every three months of the extent to which Iraq is now in a state of civil war   Also  more importantly  the amendment also requires the Administration to inform Congress and the American people what their plan is to combat the impact of civil war    A congressional mandate is needed because the Administration repeatedly denies civil war exists despite all of the evidence to the contrary including their own DoD report from Friday and therefore is failing to prepare    These facts are at odds with the Administrations statements about civil war   Sectarian divisions are increasing   Militia violence and death squad activity is increasing   The number of Iraqis fleeing the violence is increasing   Yet  the President continues to deny the possibility of civil war  Senator Kennedy said  The Vice President  Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State continue to deny it   As long as the Administration continues to deny the plain truth  America will be behind the curve and unable to adjust to the current realities on the ground and protect our troops    The measure would ensure that if the Administration determines that Iraq is not in a civil war  they are required to provide a description of the efforts to avoid civil war in Iraq  a plan to protect our troops in the event of a civil war  and a strategy to ensure that our troops dont take sides  If the determination is that Iraq is in a civil war  the amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to explain the mission of our troops and its duration  the plan to protect our troops  and a strategy to ensure that they dont take sides in a civil war  Senator Kennedy believes that the amendment is needed to ensure proper planning in the event of civil war            Below are the components required in the amendment  as well as Senator Kennedys floor statement and fact sheet              For each determination  the Administration through the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State will provide an assessment of      the levels of sectarian violence such as the level of polarization of communities along sectarian lines  and including an estimate of civilian casualties as a result of the violence       the number of civilians displaced by the violence       the degree to which Iraqi government forces exercise effective control over major urban areas       the extent to which militias have been mobilized  are providing security  and attacking other Iraqis        the extent to which the Government of Iraq has obtained a credible commitment from the political parties to disarm and disband the militias and are implementing a credible plan to disarm  demobilize and reintegrate militias into government security forces     KENNEDY AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY IN IRAQ  Amendment requiring a Report that Measures Security and Stability in Iraq After the Administration refused to quantify the progress or offer any realistic goals for when we can begin to leave Iraq  Senator Kennedy and his democratic colleagues required a report on the progress being made to train Iraqi troops so our soldiers can begin to come home   Vehicle Armor After the Bush Administration failed to offer proper armor for our troops  Kennedy and his colleagues provides over  1 billion dollars in vehicle armor for our troops in Iraq   Democracy Funding  Senator Kennedy and his democratic colleagues offered amendments to provide  175 5 million dollars in democracy funding to allow American non governmental organizations to continue their crucial democracy work on the ground in Iraq  after the Bush Administration slashed the budget for these programs    NIE Senator Kennedy and his democratic colleagues are requiring a National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq  because even though we are facing an increasingly grave situation of instability and violence in Iraq  the Administration has failed to provide one to the Congress in over two years      STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON CIVIL WAR AMENDMENT   AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY ON SENATE FLOOR   Next week marks the fifth anniversary of the vicious attack on America by Al Qaeda terrorists   Despite the passage of time  Americans still vividly recall with enormous pain and sorrow that dark and somber day   We recall the nearly three thousand Americans who were killed by Al Qaeda terrorists   We recall the brave firefighters and first responders who sacrificed their lives so that others could live   We recall the twin towers crumbling before our eyes  and the Pentagon ablaze beneath a plume a smoke   And we recall the pledge by the Administration and all Americans that this type of attack will never  ever occur again   As we approach this anniversary  there is little doubt that the President will  once again  resort to the politics of fear in an effort to convince the American people that the Iraq war is central to the global war on terror   Nothing is further from the truth   Scare tactics may have worked in the elections of 2002 and 2004  but this time  the American people know better     The American people know that the war in Iraq was a distraction from the real global war on terror and that Iraq had nothing to do with Al Qaeda     The American people know that America should have kept its eye on the ball and captured Osama bin Laden     rather than rushing headlong into a war that we did not need to fight   The American people know that the Administration should have implemented fully the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission to protect our ports and support our first responders    rather than spending more than  200 million each day on a failed policy in Iraq     The American people know that the war in Iraq has made American more hated in the world  created more terrorists  and made it harder to win the real global war on terror    The American people know that while we have been bogged down in Iraq  North Koreas nuclear stockpile has quadrupled and Iran has continued its pursuit of nuclear weapons   The American people know that we never should have gone to war in Iraq when we did  and for the false reasons we were given   Most importantly  the American people know that the Presidents stubborn insistence that we stay the course does not make victory any more likely and that we need to change our policy in Iraq    At almost every stage of the Bush Administrations conduct of the war in Iraq  weve seen major miscalculations and serious mistakes that place our troops at greater risk and jeopardize Americas standing in the world     Military leaders and retired generals know it   Middle East experts know it   Our allies know it   Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress know it   And most important  the American people know it   They saw it when the Bush team disbanded the Iraqi Army after the fall of Saddam  but allowed thousands to walk away with their weapons     They saw it when the Bush Administration waited a full year to begin training the new Iraqi security forces   They saw it when the White House failed to see the insurgency spreading like a cancer through Iraq     They saw it when the Bush team failed to see the danger of roadside bombs and improvised explosive devices yet sent our troops on patrol day after day  month after month  year after year   They saw it when the White House failed to provide proper armor for our troops  until Congress finally demanded it   Unfortunately  the Administrations repeated failure to see each new threat in Iraq has put our troops and our security in greater peril   Today  once again  the Administration refuses to recognize another seismic shift in Iraq  the dangerous prospect that we are drawn into a deadly and divisive civil war   While the President and Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld are on the campaign trail claiming progress in Iraq  military leaders and experts are urging the White House to heed the disturbing warning signs in Iraq   The President and his cabinet may not believe the fears of civil war are justified  but some of our military leaders do   General Rick Sanchez  former commander of the multi national forces in Iraq  said as long ago as January 7  The countrys on the verge of a civil war   General Peter Pace  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  said on March 13 that  Everything is in place if they want to have a civil war     Our Ambassador to Iraq  Zalmay Khalilzad  is concerned about the threat as well   On March 7  he said  The potential is there for sectarian violence to become civil war   We have opened the Pandoras box and the question is  what is the way forward     General Abizaid acknowledged the clear danger when he told the Senate Armed Services Committee on August 3  I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I ve seen it  in Baghdad in particular  and that if not stopped  it is possible that Iraq could move towards civil war   General Pace  at the same hearing  agreed about the threat of civil war  He said  I believe that we do have the possibility of devolving to a civil war  but that does not have to be a fact    Others think that a civil war may have already begun   Former Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi said in March that Iraq is probably in an early stage of civil war    The British Ambassador to Iraq wrote in August  The prospect of a low intensity civil war and a de facto division of Iraq is probably more likely at this stage than a successful and substantial transition to a stable democracy     Our colleague from Nebraska  Senator Chuck Hagel  concurred  saying  in August that We  in fact  are in probably a low grade  maybe a very defined  civil war    General William Nash  who commanded our troops in Bosnia after that countrys civil war ended  stated on March 5  We re in a civil war now  it s just that not everybody s joined in   He said  The failure to understand that the civil war is already taking place  just not necessarily at the maximum level  means that our counter measures are inadequate and therefore dangerous to our long term interest    These leaders see whats really happening in Iraq  not just the White House spin   They know that the polarization of communities along sectarian lines is increasing   In fact  80  of the Iraqi people voted along sectarian lines in the recent elections    Civilian casualties as a result of sectarian violence have skyrocketed   According to the United Nations  5 800 civilians were killed during May and June of this year and another 5 800 were wounded   An estimated 100 people a day were killed in Baghdad in July   Militia attacks continue unabated   The Shiite militia forces are growing in strength   The widespread infiltration of government security forces by those whose principal loyalty is to their sectarian militias  not the government  is well documented   Interior Ministry detention centers have been used to torture inmates just because they are Sunnis   Too often we hear that men wearing Interior Ministry uniforms have abducted Sunni men and boys  who later turn up dead    The numbers of civilians displaced or fleeing the violence is increasing as Shiites are forced from Sunni areas and Sunnis from Shiite areas   According to the United Nations  approximately 150 000 Iraqis had been displaced as of June    Despite these trends and the warnings of the experts  President Bush stubbornly continues to deny that civil war is even a real possibility in Iraq     Last December  he said  I know some fear the possibility that Iraq could break apart and fall into a civil war   I don t believe these fears are justified     The President reiterated the same view on February 28 when he said  I don t buy your premise that there s going to be a civil war     Again in March  President Bush dismissed the notion  saying  They know that they lack the military strength to challenge Iraqi and coalition forces directly    so their only hope is to try and provoke a civil warBy their response over the past two weeks  Iraqis have shown the world they want a future of freedom and peace    and they will oppose a violent minority that seeks to take that future away from them by tearing their country apart    In August  President Bush still denied that there was a civil war   He said  You know  I hear people say  well  civil war this  civil war that   The Iraqi people decided against civil war when they went to the ballot box    Again  on August 21  he said  You know  I hear a lot of talk about civil war   I m concerned about that  of course   And I ve talked to a lot of people about it   And what I ve found from my talks are that the Iraqis want a unified country and that the Iraqi leadership is determined to thwart the efforts of the extremists and the radicals and Al Qaida and that the security forces remain united behind the government    For a third time  on August 31  the President denied the possibility of civil war   He said  This cruelty and carnage has led some to question whether Iraq has descended into civil war   Our commanders and our diplomats on the ground in Iraq believe that s not the case   They report that only a small number of Iraqis are engaged in sectarian violence  while the overwhelming majority want peace and a normal life in a unified country   Vice President Cheney  too  has long denied the possibility of civil war   On March 19  he stated  What we ve seen is a serious effort by them to foment civil war  but I don t think they ve been successful   Secretary Rumsfeld dismisses it as well   In March he said  I do not believe they are in a civil war   That same month  Secretary Rumsfeld said  The terrorists are determined to stoke sectarian tension and are attempting to spark a civil war   But despite the many acts of violence and provocation  the vast majority of Iraqis have shown that they want their country to remain whole and free of ethnic conflict    In April  he said  I don t think a full fledged civil war will take hold of the country   In May  in an eerie echo of the past  when asked what political and military contingences would be in place if a civil war occurred  Secretary Rumsfeld responded  I don t think the scenario that you have described is going to happen  but life s filled with things you don t think are going to happen     That s vintage Rumsfeld  Stuff happens  he said  in response to the chaos that erupted in Baghdad after the first days of the invasion  as though no one could have anticipated such a possibility and it made no sense to waste time planning for such possibilities   That attitude has plagued our forces and our country throughout this misguided war  and it must stop   This July  as the situation took another turn for the worse  he said  There certainly has been an upsurge in sectarian violence  there s no question but that they re trying to incite a civil war   And they have been for a long time  and they have failed so far    Secretary Rice also refuses to see the possibility of civil war in Iraq   In February  she said  I don t think there is a brewing civil war in Iraq   Despite the escalating casualties and increasing sectarian violence  on August 4 she said  I don t think Iraq is going to slide into civil war   Two days later she repeated the claim and said  But the important point here is that Iraqis haven t made a choice for civil war   Iraqis have made a choice for a unified government that can deliver for all Iraqis   And when I say Iraqis  I mean not just their leadership  which clearly has not made a choice for civil war  but their population     On the same day she again denied the possibility of civil war  stating  It would be really erroneous to say that the Iraqis are somehow making a choice for civil war  or I think even sliding into civil war   Thats what the Bush team is claiming   They are so focused on the spin war on the campaign trail that they fail to see the real war in Iraq   They are so focused on using the war to win elections here at home that they fail to see the real needs of our troops in Iraq   But this time  the American people arent buying it   Theyve heard it all before and are demanding honest assessments and realistic strategies   They know that the President and Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld can say its not a civil war  but that doesnt make it so   They know that our brave men and women in uniform are doing everything they can to bring peace and stability in Iraq   They continue to fight insurgents and terrorists  but are at grave risk of being trapped in the middle of an unwinnable civil war   That is why I am offering this amendment today with the Democratic leader   It requires the Administration through the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State to provide an honest and candid assessment of the extent to which Iraq is now in a state of civil war   And even more important  the amendment requires them to say what were going to do about it   How are we going to advance Americas interests in Iraq in a time of civil war   How are we going to protect our troops from getting drawn ever deeper into an endless sectarian conflict     An article in Newsweek magazine on August 14 indicates that although the Bush Administration insists that Iraq is a long way from civil war  some inside the White House and the Pentagon have begun some contingency planning   The Administration should level with the American people about the real conditions and their planning   And thats the purpose of our amendment today   The amendment requires the Secretary of Defense  in consultation with the Secretary of State  to determine every three months whether a civil war is taking place and to inform Congress of the plan for our troops in the event of such a war   For each determination  the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State will provide their assessment of      the levels of sectarian violence such as the level of polarization of communities along sectarian lines and an estimate of civilian casualties as a result of the violence       the number of civilians displaced by the violence      the degree to which Iraqi government forces exercise effective control over major urban areas      the extent to which militias have been mobilized  are providing security  and attacking other Iraqis      the extent to which the Government of Iraq has obtained a credible commitment from the political parties to disarm and disband the militias and are implementing a credible plan to disarm  demobilize and reintegrate militias into government security forces   If the Administration determines that Iraq is not in a civil war  the amendment requires a description of the efforts by our government to avoid civil war in Iraq  a plan to protect our troops in the event of a civil war  and a strategy to ensure that our troops dont take sides    If the determination is that Iraq is in a civil war  the amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to explain the mission of our troops and its duration  his plan to protect our troops  and a strategy to ensure that they dont take sides in a civil war    The amendment is needed to ensure proper planning in the event of civil war    The trends in Iraq are discouraging and certainly point toward civil war   Indeed  the September 1 report prepared by the Department of Defense on Stability and Security in Iraq reaffirms what the American people already understand  the conditions of civil war exist  violence in Iraq is spiraling out of control and staying the course is not a viable option     The Department of Defense report says       Concern about civil war within the Iraqi civilian population and among some defense analysts has increased in recent months   Conditions that could lead to civil war exist in Iraq       Rising sectarian strife defines the emerging nature of violence in mid 2006       Sustained ethnic and sectarian violence is the greatest threat to security and stability in Iraq       Sectarian tensions increased over the last three months  demonstrated by the increasing number of executions  kidnappings  attacks on civilians  and internally displaced persons         Civilian casualties increased by approximately 1000 per month since the previous quarter   Assassinations in particular reached new highs in the month of July   The Baghdad Coroner s Office reported 1600 bodies arrived in June and more than 1800 bodies in July  90  of which were assessed to be the result of executions       Sectarian violence is gradually spreading north into Diyala Province and Kirkuk as Sunni  Shiite  and Kurdish groups compete for provincial influence         Both Shia and Sunni death squads are active in Iraq  and are responsible for the most significant increases in sectarian violence         Militias and small  illegally armed groups operate openly and often with popular support   The threat posed by Shiite illegal armed groups  filling perceived and actual security vacuums  is growing       The security situation is currently at its most complex state since the initiation of Operation Iraqi Freedom   Overall attack levels are higher than the last three months   The average number of weekly attacks increased 15   and Iraqi casualties increased by 51  compared    These facts are at odds with the Administrations statements about civil war   Sectarian divisions are increasing   Militia violence and death squad activity is increasing   The number of Iraqis fleeing the violence is increasing   Yet  the President continues to deny the possibility of civil war   The Vice President  Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State continue to deny it   As long as the Administration continues to deny the plain truth  America will be behind the curve and unable to adjust to the current realities on the ground and protect our troops    Instead of attacking those who want to change our course  President Bush ought to deal with the hard cold facts   This Defense Department report underscores the fundamental truth that our brave troops are being let down by an administration more interested in political spin than in finding a way to succeed   The Administration needs to look at all the facts and honestly address the question of civil war for the sake of our military and the American people    This legislation creates a continuing obligation to ensure that analysis on civil war is done regularly   Unfortunately  this is necessary  because the Congress has forced the Administration to step up to the plate on Iraq time and again    The facts in the report say one thing about civil war  but the conclusion about civil war says another   We need an honest assessment from the Secretaries of Defense and State about the conditions on the ground  and that is what the Kennedy Reid amendment would require    We also need some hard thinking within the Administration and a clear plan to protect our troops in a civil war   At every step of the way  this Administration has missed the threat to our troops  and Democrats in Congress have had to force the issue       Democrats        Required accounting of progress being made to train Iraqi troops so our soldiers can begin to come home        provided over  1 billion in additional funding for vehicle armor when the troops were digging through dumpsters to get the protection they needed in Iraq have to our troops        Are demanding an updated National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq because  the Administration has failed to provide one in more than two years        Provided more than  175 million for democracy programs in Iraq when the Bush Administrations budget did not provide it   We need an honest accounting of the situation so we can adjust accordingly and protect our troops   And we need a plan to protect our troops   The Presidents stubborn insistence on staying the course impedes success    Our soldiers and the American people deserve more from the Administration   Together  the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State need to set the White Houses political agenda aside and directly and thoughtfully address this ominous threat   The administration acts as if the mere discussion of civil war is defeatist   They have it exactly backwards   This amendment is an effort to make sure that the administration confronts and deals with the facts on the ground in Iraq and recognizes the emerging threat before it consumes our troops   This is the only way to achieve any measure of success   For too long  the Bush administration has pursued policies that have failed utterly to carry the day in Iraq and have made America less safe   Unfortunately  this administration has decided that domestic politics require that it stay this failed course through November  and so they have refused to confront the facts in Iraq   Instead  they have chosen political spin  false claims of progress  and baseless attacks on those who focus on the reality of the situation   We must do better   This administration owes it to the American people   Even more importantly  dealing with reality is essential and necessary to protect the lives of our brave soldiers    Iraq s future and the lives of our troops are close to the precipice of a new disaster   The time bomb of civil war is ticking  and our most urgent priority is to defuse it    Our government should work to reverse the downward spiral   And Iraqi leaders must make essential compromises to strengthen their government  prevent civil war  undermine the insurgency  and deal with the festering problem of militias   For the sake of our men and women in uniform and the stability of Iraq  all Americans are anxious for success  but we need to be realistic enough and smart enough and humble enough to understand that even our best efforts  may not prevent a civil war from overtaking events in Iraq   We need to begin planning now for this possibility  Thats what this amendment requires     Such planning is not an admission of defeat    It is essential and necessary for protecting the lives of our service men and women in Iraq  who are performing so admirably today under such enormously difficult circumstances     I urge my colleagues to support this amendment    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
