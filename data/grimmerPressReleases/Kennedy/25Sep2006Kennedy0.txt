         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   According to reports in Sundays New York Times and Washington Post  a National Intelligence Estimate prepared last April concludes that the war in Iraq has made the problem of global terrorism worse and that terrorist cells have metastasized and spread across the globe   For more than three years  President Bush and the Republican Congress have repeatedly claimed the war in Iraq is making America safer  Now  we learn that the 16 agencies in the intelligence community concluded just the opposite last April  that the Iraq war has become a rallying cry for extremists against the United States and made the war on terror more difficult to win   The American people have the right to hear from our nations top intelligence official about the conclusions of the intelligence community in this report  Before Congress adjourns this week  Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte should testify in open session about this report  In addition  an unclassified version of the key judgments and discussion about Iraq in the report should be made available to the public in a way that protects sources and methods   With more than 140 000 American troops on the ground in Iraq and terrorist attacks increasing around the globe  the stakes for the safety of all Americans are enormously high  It is our obligation to hear directly from Mr  Negroponte before adjourning at the end of this week  It is essential that Congress and the American people obtain a fuller understanding about the conclusions of the intelligence community about the impact of the Iraq war   In addition  the President and Vice President must explain statements they have made that are directly at odds with this National Intelligence Estimate    Despite the conclusion of the intelligence community that the war has been a recruitment tool for a new generation of extremists  on numerous occasions since the document was prepared  President Bush has claimed that the war has made America safer    On September 7  President Bush said  We ve learned the lessons of 9 11We ve gone on the offense against our enemies  and transformed former adversaries into allies  We have put in place the institutions needed to win this war  Five years after September the 11th  2001  America is safer    and America is winning the war on terror    On September 11  President Bush said  Saddam s regime posed a risk that the world could not afford to take  The world is safer because Saddam Hussein is no longer in power    Despite the conclusion of the intelligence community five months earlier that new threats are emerging because of the war in Iraq  Vice President Cheney said the exact opposite on September 10  He said  We are better off there because of what we ve done to date  We are less likely to have a threat emerge against the United States from that corner of the world than would have been the case if Saddam were still there    The American people deserve to know whether the President and Vice President are intentionally misleading us about our safety  or whether they are simply ignoring the intelligence community  Clearly  America deserves better from its leaders      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
