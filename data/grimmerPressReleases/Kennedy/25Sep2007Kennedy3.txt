         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     This is a very important hearing  and I commend Chairman Leahy for holding it  We are here to discuss the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the recent changes made to it by Congress in the Protect America Act  At stake are the fundamental goals of protecting both our national security and our civil liberties     These are not partisan issues  All members of Congress support these goals and know that sometimes there are tradeoffs between them that raise difficult policy questions on which reasonable people can disagree  But we often find that the law of surveillance can be structured so that no tradeoff is needed     That was the genius of FISA  It regulated surveillance in a way that prevented the government from abusing its powersthereby protecting civil libertiesand at the same time gave the government the legal authority and guidance to use its powers in the most effective way possiblethereby protecting national security  It is because FISA enhances both security and liberty that it has attracted such broad support from presidents  members of Congress  and the public alike      FISA was able to strike the right balance because of the way it was enacted  The Administration worked with Congress in a genuine partnership  There were hearings and debates  with many different groups given a seat at the table  It was an open  thorough  and collaborative process that took several years to get right     I know because I was there  I introduced the original legislation  and I presented the committee report on the floor of the Senate  A Democratic Congress worked with a Republican Administration to develop a wiretapping program we could all support  and it has served America well     That is why it is so troubling that the Bush Administration has consistently pursued a different path  They have insisted on going it alone  We asked Attorney General Gonzales and other officials for information on the Administrations warrantless wiretapping programs and for a commitment to work with Congress to develop the most effective laws  All we got were evasive answers and repeated assertions that the Administration was doing nothing wrong  Mr  Gonzales was clear that he did not feel he needed Congresss authorization or assistance     We are now paying a high price for that arrogance  Warrantless wiretapping has apparently been used to spy on Americans for years  without any oversight  The Administrations activities were likely illegal  As a result  prosecutions may have been jeopardized  intelligence professionals were put in fear of criminal penalties  public trust was undermined  resources were misallocated  and the Acting Attorney General and the FBI Director reportedly had to shut down surveillance programs for weeks  The Administrations reckless disregard for the law has made us less safe  It has also made many American afraid for their rights     It is time for this Administration to reverse course and work with Congress to make FISA as strong as possible  These hearings are a positive step      The way the Protect America Act was enacted last month was a step in the wrong direction  This important legislation was negotiated in secret at the last minute  with the Administration issuing dire threats that failure to enact a bill before the August recess could lead to disaster  Few people  if any  knew what the language would actually do  Before and after the Act was passed  the Director of National Intelligence made the outrageous claim that Congress was putting American lives at risk merely by debating how to make FISA more effective     Even today  a majority of this Committee doesnt know precisely what problem we are supposedly fixing  Despite subpoenas  the Administration has refused to give the legal justifications for the warrantless surveillance program  We have been denied access to the FISA Court opinions that we are told make new legislation necessary  We have been asked to immunize private sector communications firms involved in past illegal surveillance  no matter how flagrant or widespread the violations  We are being asked to legislate in the dark  I hope we will be able to remedy these problems through the process were beginning now     There are serious problems with the way the Protect America Act insulates executive surveillance from independent oversight  This lack of oversight is not only wrong for Americans privacy  it is also wrong for their security  If there is one thing we have learned from the history of FISA and from this Administration  it is that national security works best when all three branches play their proper role     There is no one on this Committee who does not want to see FISA made as effective as possible  As one of FISAs original sponsors  I would like nothing more than to see this happen  Modernizing FISA is our task  and it is a vital one  But lets not forget that only if the Administration commits to working with Congress in an honest and sustained manner can we fulfill this task          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
