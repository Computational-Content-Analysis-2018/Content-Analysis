         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Nothing we saw yesterday reduced our concern about John Roberts  views  Many of the documents made it clear that as a junior official in the Reagan Administration  he was part of an intense effort to impede progress on numerous key issues  such as progress on equal rights for women  It s all the more important  therefore  that we see the documents from his years as Deputy Solicitor General  It s time for the Administration to end the cover up and make these documents available     Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
