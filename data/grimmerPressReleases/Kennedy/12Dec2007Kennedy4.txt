         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  As the Senate prepares to consider legislation to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA   a group of senators is urging Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to make the FISA bill passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee  SJC  the base bill to be considered on the Senate floor  The SJC bill makes significant improvements to the FISA bill that was reported by the Senate Intelligence Committee  It enhances judicial oversight of broad new surveillance authorities  contains protections for innocent Americans  and does not provide immunity to telecom companies that allegedly cooperated with the administrations warrantless wiretapping program The Senators expressing their support for the SJC FISA bill in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Reid are Senators Ted Kennedy  D MA   Russ Feingold  D WI   Chris Dodd  D CT   Barack Obama  D IL   Bernie Sanders  I VT   Robert Menendez  D NJ   Joe Biden  D DE   Sherrod Brown  D OH   Tom Harkin  D IA   Ben Cardin  D MD   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Daniel Akaka  D HI   Jim Webb  D VA   and Barbara Boxer  D CA       Congress must enact a FISA bill that will produce needed intelligence  protect the privacy of Americans and respect the rule of law  The bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee does those things without undermining the structure of FISA and the rule of law by giving retroactive immunity to phone companies that may have illegally invaded the privacy of millions of Americans  Senator Kennedy said     The Judiciary Committee FISA bill fixes many of the flaws of the surveillance law we enacted in August and the new bill approved by the Intelligence Committee  Everyone agrees that we should give our intelligence officials the tools they need to go after suspected terrorists  Theres no reason we cant do that while still protecting the privacy of innocent Americans and ensuring adequate oversight of these broad new surveillance authorities    and without setting the dangerous precedent of granting retroactive immunity to companies that allegedly participated in an unlawful program  Senator Feingold said     I strongly urge the Majority Leader to take up the Judiciary Committees version of the FISA legislation  It is absolutely essential that as the Senate begins debating reforms to FISA we do not include retroactive immunity provisions for telecommunications companies that may have engaged in illegal conduct  Additionally  the Judiciary Committees version of the FISA legislation contains much stronger safeguards which will serve to protect Americans against the Presidents warantless wiretapping program  Senator Dodd said     The Judiciary Committee bill restores oversight and accountability to the FISA program without unnecessarily providing retroactive immunity to companies that cooperated with the Administration s warrantless wiretapping program  It is my hope that this bill will be considered by the full Senate  Senator Obama said     Of course we have to do everything we can to protect the American people  but we must fight international terrorism in a way that is consistent with our Constitution and the Bill of Rights  Senator Bernie Sanders said     I believe that the bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee strikes the healthiest balance between protecting our national security interests and safeguarding the basic civil and constitutional rights of American citizens  said Senator Webb  The Judiciary Committee bill also remains silent on immunity for the telecommunications companies  which is appropriate  If there is a compelling case for immunity  Senators supporting it will have the opportunity to make their case on the Senate floor      The text of the letter is below  A copy of the letter is available at http   feingold senate gov pdf ltr_reid_121207 pdf     December 12  2007    Dear Majority Leader Reid     We understand that the Senate will shortly be considering amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  As you know  the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Judiciary Committee have reported very different versions of the FISA Amendments Act  S  2248  and it is up to you  as Majority Leader  to decide how the Senate considers this legislation      We urge you to make the version of S  2248 reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee the base bill to be considered by the full Senate  While the structure of Title I of both bills is the same  and both make improvements over the Protect America Act  the reasonable changes to Title I made in the Judiciary Committee ensure that the FISA Court will be able to conduct much needed oversight of the implementation of these broad new surveillance authorities  and help to better protect the rights of innocent Americans  While we appreciate the hard work that the Intelligence Committee has done on this legislation  the process by which the Judiciary Committee considered  drafted  amended and reported out its bill was an open one  allowing outside experts and the public at large the opportunity to review and comment  With regard to legislation so directly connected to the constitutional rights of Americans  the results of this open process should be accorded great weight  especially in light of the Judiciary Committees unique role and expertise in protecting those rights     We also believe that the Judiciary Committee bill is preferable because it does not provide immunity for telecom companies that allegedly cooperated with the administrations warrantless wiretapping program  As this is such a controversial issue  we feel it would be appropriate to require the proponents of immunity to make their case on the floor     Thank you for your consideration     Sincerely     Russell D  Feingold  D WI   Christopher J  Dodd  D CT   Barack Obama  D IL   Bernard Sanders  I VT   Robert Menendez  D NJ   Joseph R  Biden  Jr   D DE   Sherrod Brown  D OH   Tom Harkin  D IA   Benjamin L  Cardin  D MD   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Daniel K  Akaka  D HI   Jim Webb  D VA   Edward M  Kennedy  D MA   Barbara Boxer  D CA
