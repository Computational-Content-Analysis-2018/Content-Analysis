         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        For far too long  Congress has stood by and watched while President Bush has slowly expanded the unilateral powers of the Presidency at the expense of the rest of the government and the people  From secret military tribunals  to indefinite detentions at Guantanamo  to illegal wiretapping  the President consistently shows a casual disregard for the rights of Congress and the courts to make and interpret the law    This hearing is one step toward reclaiming our responsibilities  and I commend Senator Specter for his leadership on this issue     If a President has constitutional problems with a law  he can veto it  Thats what George Washington did  His very first veto was based explicitly on constitutional concerns  In fact  until the Civil War  the majority of Presidential vetoes were justified on constitutional or national security grounds    Given the unprecedented frequency with which this Administration objects to legislation  wed expect to see constant vetoes  Ronald Reagan issued 78  and George Bush Senior issued 44  Clinton had 37  So how many vetoes has this president issued  Zero  Not a single veto in over five years  Not since Thomas Jefferson has a President gone this long without vetoing a single bill  But this Presidents issued 750 signing statements  ten times the total number of statements issued over the first 190 years of our nations history    This Administration has followed a consistent pattern of objecting to legislation in order to expand its own power and limit the powers of the legislative branch  With these signing statements  the President seems prepared to ignore any act of Congress if he feels it intrudes on intelligence policy  national security  foreign affairs  or law enforcement    The President doesnt even want to consult with Congress  in signing the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002  President Bush categorically rejected clear language in the law that required coordination and consultation with Congress  Claiming his constitutional authority trumped the new law  his signing statement went so far as to say that the Presidents constitutional authorities cannot be made subject to requirements to consult with Congress   On appropriations bills  the President has made clear that he will use every means possible to rearrange funding to meet the Administrations priorities  completely disregarding the express mandates established by Congress   The President has also used signing statements to reject affirmative action provisions  In his first term  he issued 15 signing statements indicating that affirmative action provisions would be ignored because the President regards them as a violation of our laws  regardless of what Congress and the courts say   Its easy to see why the President prefers signing statements over vetoes  Theres no chance for Congress to override his interpretations  The statements are often drafted so broadly that it is impossible for plaintiffs to bring lawsuits to challenge them in court    The President clearly retains the right to decline to execute plainly unconstitutional provisions  but the sheer scale and comprehensiveness of his disregard of legitimately enacted laws is shocking and disturbing  In the view of many legal scholars  President Bushs signing statements demote Congress to the role of presidential advisor    In recent signing statements  President Bush has refused to comply with provisions of the PATRIOT Act requiring him to report to Congress on the FBIs secret activities  He has declared his intention to ignore express legislative directives that U S  military advisors in Colombia not engage in combat    In perhaps his most shocking act of executive arrogance  President Bush stated his intention to disregard a ban by Congress on torture  The ban had passed with overwhelming bipartisan support  It cleared the Senate with the backing of 90 Senators  It unequivocally states that the U S  military may not torture prisoners  Congress clearly has the constitutional power to regulate the military  But this President  who lobbied against the ban  used his signing statement to perform an end run around Congress    Signing statements are certainly more effective than vetoes at unilaterally imposing the will of the President on an unsuspecting public  But it is unacceptable for the President to use them to invalidate sweeping portions of duly enacted law  In effect  the President is attempting unilaterally to create a line item veto for himself   Despite what President Bush seems to think  the Constitution is not obsolete  In the face of such blatant disregard for the rule of law  Congress can    and must    find a way to curb this gross abuse of executive power  Otherwise  Congressional oversight will continue to be meaningless  Today is a good step forward in making sure that Americans understand the risks of an unchecked Executive Branch         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
