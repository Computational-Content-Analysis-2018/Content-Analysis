         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  the National Assessment Governing Board released the results of the 2007 Trial Urban District Assessments  Eleven city school districts  including Boston  participated  Senator Kennedy commended the districts  many of which have made progress in recent years       Today s results show that the hard work of teachers  students  parents and administrators is making a difference  but there is much more work to be done  Senator Kennedy said  We are making progress  but our commitment to school children must continue       I m particularly proud of the efforts of students and educators in Boston Public Schools  In math  Boston fourth and eighth graders outperform the average for large city schools  Since 2003  Boston has cut the number of fourth grade students performing below basic by 18 percent  and has more than doubled the number scoring proficient from 11 to 24 percent  Boston is also helping its students overcome the harmful effects of poverty  In reading and math  lower income fourth grade students in Boston scored above the national average for low income students      But it s also clear that there is room for improvement  Far too many students in our urban districts lack the basics in reading and math  and the achievement gaps between white and Latino students and white and African American students persist   These city schools need more resources and support to turn around struggling schools and to give every child the opportunity to succeed  Unfortunately  the President chose to veto the bill that had the largest increase in Title I funds since we passed the No Child Left Behind Act   The President rejected this bill because it included  4 5 billion more for education than he proposed  the cost of just ten days in Iraq  These are the wrong priorities for education  and they re the wrong priorities for our nation      As we work to reauthorize No Child Left Behind  we ve drawn from the challenges schools face to come up with solutions that make the law better for students and teachers  We ve also learned from the successes of schools and districts  such as Charlotte  New York  and Boston  where progress has been made  I commend the districts participating in TUDA for their commitment to ensuring their students meet high standards and improve academically  We ll continue to fight in Congress to provide these districts and schools across the country with the funds and support so urgently needed           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
