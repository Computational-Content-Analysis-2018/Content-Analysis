         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      As Prepared for Delivery   This is one of our most important mark ups  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is a landmark statute  For nearly 30 years  it has regulated government surveillance in a way that protects both our national security and our civil liberties and prevents the government from abusing its powers  Its because FISA enhances both security and liberty that it has won such broad support over the years from presidents  members of Congress  and the public alike  It is important to remember that until this Administration  no Administration had ever resisted FISA  much less systematically ignored it     The bill were considering was reported last month by the Intelligence Committee  Members of that committee worked hard on it  and I commend them for their diligent efforts  Their bill contains notable improvements over the Protect America Act  but it also has a number of defects that trouble me greatly  For instance                Its the responsibility of this Committee to improve the bill to make it as effective as possible and ensure its constitutionality      I commend Chairman Leahy and his staff for doing an excellent job in preparing the substitute bill now before us  Their bill respects the Intelligence Committees reforms and clarifies and strengthens some of the most troubling language     There is still much more to be done  however  and I expect to offer several amendments  Im hopeful that working together  we can produce a bill that protects both our national security and our civil liberties in the best tradition of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
