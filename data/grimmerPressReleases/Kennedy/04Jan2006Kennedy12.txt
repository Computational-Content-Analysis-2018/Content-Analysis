         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I m troubled and disappointed by President Bush s appointment of Hans von Spakovsky to the Federal Election Commission  His record as Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights raises serious doubts about his commitment to upholding voting rights for all Americans  a commitment that is essential for anyone appointed to the Commission     Recent reports show that partisan politics in the Civil Rights Division have tainted decisions under the Voting Rights Act  Mr  von Spakovsky participated in these cases  and he may be deeply involved in the political interference that is undermining enforcement of our civil rights laws     By appointing von Spakovsky  the White House missed an opportunity to fill this important position with a person clearly committed to these fundamental rights    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
