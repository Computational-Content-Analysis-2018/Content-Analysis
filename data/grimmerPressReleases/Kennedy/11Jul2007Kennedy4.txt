         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  as the Senate resumes debate on Iraq  our heartfelt support and appreciation go to our troops in harms way All Americans support our troops   Theyve fought bravely and they continue to fight bravely under extraordinary circumstances   They have answered the call to service   Many are on their third or fourth tour of duty in Iraq  separated from their families and loved ones for years  They have borne a great burden  and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude History will write however  that the President has repeatedly failed them by failing to have a policy worthy of their sacrifice  The President failed our troops from the outset  by sending them into this misguided war without a plan to win the peace and by refusing to send sufficient troops to keep the peace   Who can forget the words of General Eric Shinseki  who warned that America would need several hundred thousand troops to secure Baghdad   Who can forget the way the Administration shunted him aside  ignored his advice  and allowed the looting and violence to spiral out of control  The Administrations insistence that a small  rapid force could achieve regional change and maintain a stable Iraq was utterly wrong  and chaos took the place of peace The President also failed our troops by repeatedly sending them into battle without proper equipment   Secretary Rumsfelds callous comment that  stuff happens and his mindless assertion that you go to war with the army you have    not the Army you might want or wish to have at a later time still ring loud and clear in this chamber  a constant reminder of the failure of leadership at the highest level of the Pentagon      The President failed our troops by relying for too long on a military solution to politically inspired violence and failing to engage in sustained regional diplomacy   We have been behind the curve every step of the way  rather than leading  reaching out  and working to find solutions with Iraqs neighbors  The President has also failed our returning troops home   Who can forget the horror we felt over the reports of our injured soldiers being housed in mold infested rooms at Walter Reed hospital   The services and medical care that our troops need and deserve have fallen far short of meeting our responsibility  We have given the President every opportunity   He has failed our troops by clinging to an unworkable policy that delivers less and less for our military and our mission in Iraq and stands no chance of succeeding now  in September  or ever  The best way to honor our troops is to bring Americas involvement in this misguided war to an end  not to pour more and more American lives into the endless black hole of our failed policy in Iraq  The American people know this war is wrong  Voting against it was the proudest vote of my entire career in the Senate   Its wrong to abdicate our responsibility by allowing this failed war to drag on and on  and allow casualties mount to higher and higher We dont need to wait until September to know that the surge will prove to be no better than the surges and failed strategies that preceded it  President Bush keeps trying to buy more time for his failed policy by promising yet again that hope and change is around the corner   But after more than four years of such smoke and mirrors  Congress and the American people have lost faith in the Presidents competence in managing the war  The American people have heard these new pleas before from the President   The death of Saddams sons was supposed to have quelled the violence   It didnt   Capturing Saddam and bringing him to justice were supposed to have stopped the violence   It didnt  Three elections and a new Iraqi Constitution were supposed to have brought stability   They didnt   At every critical step  the Administration has promised calm  but there is no calm  Our soldiers have constantly been faced with an increasingly violent and lethal insurgency The promise of success around the corner through the surge is no different   Initially  the Administration told the American people that the surge would add 21 500 troops to Iraq     But they didnt reveal about the fact that there would be a wave after the surge  and we ended up sending nearly 30 000 troops In January  Secretary Gates said  Its viewed as a temporary surge In February  Secretary Gates told the Senate Appropriations Committee    I think General Petraeus believes that he will have a pretty good idea whether this surge and whether this strategy is working  probably by early summer     In April  Secretary Gates told us more time would be needed  He said  I think it s been General Petraeus  view all along thatsome time  at some point during the summer  mid to late summer  perhaps  he has thought that he would be in a position to evaluate whether the plan was working so far     In May  President Bush said even more time would be necessary   He told us   As General Petraeus has said  it will be at least the end of summer before we can assess the impact of this operation  Congress ought to give General Petraeus  plan a chance to work   A week later  Secretary Gates said the Administration would make their evaluation of the situation and the surge in September Temporary surge   Early summer   Mid to late summer   At least the end of summer   September   These are the Administrations desperate efforts to hide its failure just a little longer I have no doubt that in September  the Administration will ask for yet another chance   But there are no more chances   Time is up  Its wrong to ask the American people and our military to cling to the false hope that September will bring change   It is wrong to ask our troops to bear the brunt of a failed policy  It is past the time to acknowledge that the Administrations policy has failed  and adopt a new course now to begin to withdraw our troops from Iraq  The facts are clear   President Bush argued that the surge would bring security  create an opportunity for political reconciliation  and enable reconstruction to make progress   When he announced the surge last January  the President said  America will change our strategy to help the Iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of Baghdad  Yet  more than six months later  the violence continues unabated In Baghdad  The Pentagons own June report on Iraq  which covered the months of February through May  stated Violence against coalition and Iraqi security forces remained consistent with previous levels Unidentified bodies continue to be found in Baghdad at an alarming rate   Press reports say that in April  411 unidentified bodies were found in Baghdad   In May  726 bodies were found   In the first six days of June alone  167 bodies were found in Baghdad   Many showed signs of torture and execution   Some had been beheaded   U S  casualties have also increased in Baghdad during the surge   Our troop losses in Baghdad this year have more than doubled over the same period last year   The number of Americans killed in Baghdad from January through June in 2006 was 96   But the number from January through June in 2007 was 250  two and a half times higher  The presence of additional U S  troops in Baghdad has also resulted in a spread in violence outside the city    The Pentagons June report confirms this trend   It said  Many insurgents and extremists have moved operations to Diyala  Ninewa  and the outlying areas of Baghdad ProvinceAmerican soldiers are bearing the brunt of the violence  and they understand this trend well   From January through June of this year  we lost 86 troops in Diyala  more than four times the number of troops killed there in all of 2006  Attacks against Iraqi civilians are spreading across the country as well  According to the Associated Press  nearly 1900 Iraqis have been killed in suicide attacks in 2007 and more than 4 400 have been wounded   Our troops continue to be attacked and killed at a higher rate than ever across Iraq  Every month in 2007  American casualties have been higher than in the same month in 2006  In January this year  83 of our soldiers were killed  compared to 62 in the same month a year ago In February this year  80 of our soldiers were killed  compared to 55 in the same month a year ago In March of this year  we lost 81 of our soldiers  compared to 31 in March a year ago     In April of this year  104 of our soldiers were killed  compared to 76 in the same month a year ago   In May of this year  126 of our soldiers were killed  compared to 69 in the same month a year ago In June of this year  100 of our soldiers were killed  compared to 61 the same month a year ago We dont need to wait until September to conclude that the surge has led to greater violence  not less  and that the time has come to bring our troops home Political progress has been non existent   In announcing the surge last January  President Bush told the American people that it would facilitate reconciliation   He said  Most of Iraq s Sunni and Shia want to live together in peace    and reducing the violence in Baghdad will help make reconciliation possible   In fact  it has not happened In December 2006  the Iraq Study Group outlined a list of commitments made by the Iraqi Government and stated that by the end of 2006 or early 2007  Iraqis would need to approve a provincial election law  set an election date  approve a petroleum law  approve a de baathification law  and approve a militia law  In fact  none of the dates has been met and none of the crucial Iraqi legislation so essential to reconciliation has been approved  The Pentagons report in June made this point bluntly   It said  Key legislative or reconciliation actionssuch as the Hydrocarbon Law  de Baathification reform and Article 140  Kirkuk were not completed during this reporting period  The Pentagons June report also addressed the problem more generally   It said  Reconciliation remains a serious unfulfilled objective   It said  Mass casualty attacks on Shia targets and the April 2  2007 attack on the Council of Representatives have made the Shia wary of reconciliation  It said   There is also significant evidence of violence against Sunni Arabs  sometimes involving government security forces  that undermines reconciliation efforts     It said  Public perceptions of violence have adversely affected reconciliation  As long as the commitment of our troops continues to be open ended  there is unlikely to be progress on reconciliation   It wont be until the Iraqis know our troops will not fight their civil war indefinitely that they will they begin to make the hard political choices necessary to achieve reconciliation Importantly  the surge has not even been able to deliver on the Presidents goal of enabling reconstruction to go forward and fulfill its promise of a better standard of living for the Iraqi people  On the fundamental issue of providing basic services for the Iraqi people  the Pentagon reported in June the Iraqi government has made little progress  Despite the billions of dollars our government has spent on reconstruction  the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found that Iraq is still plagued by power outages  inadequate oil production  and shortages of clean water and health care  Electricity levels in Baghdad are half what they were before the invasion  At the Baghdad International Airport  almost  12 million was spent on electrical generators  but more than half the money invested has been wasted  Problems with reconstruction are not limited to Baghdad  Of eight reconstruction projects that the United States had declared a success 6 months to a year earlier  the Special Inspector General found that seven of them were no longer operating as designed  because of plumbing and electrical failures  lack of proper maintenance  or apparent looting  Of the 142 primary health care clinics planned for Iraq  only 15 have been builtand of those 15  only 8 are open to the public800 schools have been built and thousands of teachers have been trained  but less than third of Iraqi students attend class  No one in this Administration can tell the American people in good faith and good conscience that we are making progress in Iraq   Bringing this war to an end will not destroy the Administrations policy    The policy has already self destructed   Nothing good will come of staying on the same perilous failed course   Iraq is sliding deeper into civil war   Instead of solving the problem  the open ended presence of our military is only making it worse Mr  President  the choice is clear   Do we continue to put our trust in those who have led us astray   Or do we end this failed policy and begin a new course in Iraq Finally  The cost in precious American lives for this failed mission is reason enough to end this mistaken and misguided war   But the cost here at home hit us again this week when our own Congressional Research Service raised the estimate of what we are spending in Iraq from  8 to  10 billion dollars  A month With the passage of this latest defense spending bill  we will have spent 450 billion dollars on the war We know where this money comes from   It comes from Americas families  and it means that urgent domestic priorities here at home are going unmet because they are starved of funds We know we must deal with the soaring cost of health care  and finding a way to cover the millions of Americans with no health insurance at all  This festering crisis is a major worry for families across America  and we owe it to our people to address it Six million uninsured children in America should be enrolled in the Childrens Health Insurance Program  But theres not enough money to do that   For the cost of six weeks in Iraq  we could cover every one of these children For less than the cost of one month in Iraq  we could double the budget at the Center for Disease Control  to keep Americas families safe from  bioterrorism and other deadly epidemics For the cost of two weeks in Iraq  we could double the funding for the National Cancer Institute  which is vital to finding a cure for that deadly disease For the cost of one day in Iraq  we could double the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to protect Americans from unsafe foods by increasing inspections  upgrading facilities  and hiring more safety personnel  For less than the cost of a day in Iraq  we could allow a million uninsured Americans to be served by community health centers In education  the price of Iraq is also very high Each year 400 000 high school graduates do not go to a four year college because they cant afford it   For cost of less than a week in Iraq  every one of these students could receive the assistance they need to go to college  We know that early education programs like Head Start make an enormous difference to a childs future  But Head Start now serves only half of the two million children eligible for the program   For the cost of three weeks in Iraq  we could serve every eligible child and family in the nation The Administration has failed to fund the No Child Left Behind Act by 56 billion dollars since its enactment in 2002   For the cost of less than 6 months in Iraq  we could make our public schools whole by providing all the funding theyve been denied over the past five years   For the cost of only 49 days in Iraq  we could fully fund this important program for the next school year The war in Iraq is also denying urgently needed resources for the first responders and emergency personnel who are keeping us safe at home in all 50 states For the cost of one month in Iraq  we could provide 3 million portable radios to our first responders  and enable them to communicate during a natural disaster or terrorist attack   Or we could provide our heroic firefighters with almost 12 million additional units of breathing gear or 40 000 new firefighting vehicles The list goes on and on  Countless high priorities here at home must go under funded or unfunded because the war in Iraq is draining vast amounts of our resources In the days ahead  the Senate will debate these all important issues   For the sake of our men and women in uniform  for the sake of our values and ideals  we must adopt a new course and bring our troops home to the heros welcome they have so clearly earned  and get about the business of putting America back on track        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
