         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  BOSTON  MA Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy joined U S  Congressman John Tierney and Lynn Mayor Chip Clancy at the Lynns GE  Aviations plant in celebration of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administrations  OSHA  award of the Voluntary Protection Program Star  Senator Kennedy discussed the critical importance of workplace safety for all working men and women in the Commonwealth and commended the conscientious efforts of the plant to have a workplace that maintains an environment with outstanding health and safety standards  As the leading Democrat on the Senate Health  Labor and Pensions Committee  Senator Kennedy is a leading advocate for the health and safety of all workers and is committed to strengthening OSHA standards  The talented men and women here at the GE plant design and make engines and parts for planes  ships  and submarines for our armed forces  They also make a valuable contribution to our aviation industry  and provide good jobs for Massachusetts workers  They help to keep our men and women in combat safe  and they deserve a safe workplace as well  said Senator Kennedy  We know that a safe workplace is a successful workplace and much needs to be done at the federal level to protect health and safety  We enacted new mine safety legislation this year  and I look forward to pushing for OSHA reforms in the next Congress with the help of my colleague John Tierney  The Voluntary Protection Program Star is awarded by OSHA to companies that exhibit exemplary health and safety programs  which exceed the standard regulation requirements  The GE facility designs and produces engines and engine components for both commercial and military aircrafts  Additionally the plant produces products for submarines and ships in the military  The first U S  jet engine originated from the Lynn plant  and 60 percent of their products today contribute to military engines  Less than 0 1 percent of United States companies have received this prestigious award  and the GE  Aviation plant is now one of the largest manufacturing and military facilities in the country to receive this distinction  REMARKS OF EDWARD M  KENNEDY PRESENTATION OF VPP AWARD  GE LYNN PLANT November 2  2006  As Prepared for Delivery Weve made great progress since the Occupational Safety and Health Act was first passed thirty six years ago  Weve made workplaces safer across the country  and reduced injury rates  but we still have a long way to go  Every day on the average  16 employees are killed on the job and 12 000 more are injured or made ill  Here in Massachusetts  78 workers died from injuries last year  and 700 more died of occupational diseases   These numbers are unacceptable  Much needs to be done at the federal level to protect health and safety  We enacted new mine safety legislation this year  and I look forward to pushing for OSHA reforms in the next Congress with the help of my colleague John Tierney  But legislation is just part of the answer  We also need the leadership of forward thinking companies that put safety first and require employee protection to be part of every decision in the workplace  The talented men and women here at the GE plant design and make engines and parts for planes  ships  and submarines for our armed forces  They also make a valuable contribution to our aviation industry  and provide good jobs for Massachusetts workers  They help to keep our men and women in combat safe  and they deserve a safe workplace as well  Over the years Ive learned that employees are the real experts in workplace safety  Theyre the ones operating machinery every day  and the ones who know the risks  The health and safety program here at Lynn demonstrates the benefit of making workers full partners in safety decisions  The safety committees  and the weekly meetings with worker representatives on health and safety show that safety is a top priority for GE  Everyone benefits from the results  The rate of accidents has been reduced dramatically over the last 10 years  The plant has made major improvements in ergonomics  and has adopted strict lock out tag out procedures to protect workers when machinery is being repaired  They also have an onsite rescue team  so they can respond immediately to an accident  We need innovative and effective management like this in many more worksites across the country  Our goal is to protect all workers on the job  and I look forward to working with Ed Foulke  the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health  who is here today  to see that more workplaces follow this example  We know that a safe workplace is a successful workplace  Everyday GE Lynn is proving that  Were proud of the ships you make for the Navy  and the engines you make for the F 18s and the Blackhawk helicopters  and even the Presidents new helicopter  Marine One  Its all a tribute to the high quality work you do  the skill and dedication of your workforce  and the extra mile you go to keep your employees safe  Massachusetts is proud of you  and so are all of us  Thank you very much    Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley
