         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today s report shows the real extent of the health care crisis gripping American families  Last year alone  almost a million Americans became uninsured    that s over 2 000 a day and 180 in Massachusetts alone  Instead of cutting Medicaid  as Republicans propose  we should be expanding opportunities for American families to meet their health care needs    I have proposed that Congress and the President should end America s health care worries by allowing every single American access to Medicare  regardless of age  It s high time we stepped up to the plate and recognized that health care should be the right of every American citizen     Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
