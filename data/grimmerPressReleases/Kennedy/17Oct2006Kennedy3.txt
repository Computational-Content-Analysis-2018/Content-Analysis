         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today  responding to new 2006 hate crimes statistics  Senators Edward Kennedy and Gordon Smith criticized Congress for not taking swifter action to combat these vicious and senseless offenses  The release of the most current statistics on hate crimes confirms that hate crimes continue to be a serious problem plaguing our communities  According to a new report from the FBI  over 8 000 Americans were victims of hate crimes reported in 2005  and the percentage of crimes motivated by racial or religious bigotry continues to rise   http   www fbi gov ucr hc2005 index html   2005 Hate Crime Report  The Smith Kennedy bill passed the senate 65 33 in 2004 and the House passed a similar bill 223 199 in 2005  but still no final action has been taken  The bill would authorize critical funding to support state and local law investigations and prosecutions of these vicious and senseless offenses  It would also award grants to state and local programs to combat hate crimes by juveniles  Senator Kennedy said  Everyday citizens are attacked because of their race  their ethnic background  their religion  their sexual orientation  or their disability  Clearly  we are not doing enough to protect our communities from these vicious crimes     Congress cant keep ignoring these serious crimes  Sadly  these statistics show only part of the problem  because so many hate crimes go unreported  Even more disappointing is the failure of many jurisdictions to participate in the FBIs valuable effort to collect data on these crimes  yet the numbers show that these senseless crimes continue to plague our neighborhoods  With increasing concerns about community violence and diminishing federal funding  Congressional action is long overdue  Crimes motivated by hate are deplorable  Smith said  They strike at the freedom of every American because they seek to intimidate entire groups of Americans and separate them from the communities in which they live  These statistics show once again why Congress needs to equip local law enforcement with the tools they need to combat hate crimes  Hate crimes legislation is supported by a broad coalition of over 200 law enforcement and civil rights groups  including the National District Attorneys Association  the National Sheriffs Association  the International Association of Chiefs of Police  the Anti Defamation League  the U S  Conference of Mayors  the Interfaith Alliance and the National Center for Victims of Crime   Laura Capps Melissa   202  224 2633
