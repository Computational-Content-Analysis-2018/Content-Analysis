         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I thank the chair  Mr  President  I want to talk for a few moments about the budget that has been submitted by this administration in the last few days and how it addresses the needs of the people of this country  or how it fails to address those needs  Effectively  what we are being asked in that budget that the President has set up  that we are going to see very serious and significant decline in supporting some enormously needed programs that help and provide opportunities for so many of our people in this country such as education programs and health programs  In order that we provide a tax break for individual Americans up to  46 billion this year  That s what a budget is about  about priorities and Mr  President  when I go back to Massachusetts  one of the first orders of business that people are talking to me about is  what in the world did the congress ever do in passing that prescription drug program Mr  President  I take pride in the fact that we passed here in the United States Senate a very good prescription drug program with Senators Grassley and Baucus  and we received over 70 votes here in the United States Senate and we built it on the Medicare system  The Medicare system  which is tried  tested and depended upon by millions of Americans  Medicare which was defeated in 1965 and accepted in 1965 in the United States Senate and right after that they accepted the Medicaid program to look after the neediest people in our society  primarily children and women  to take care of the poorest of the poor  Those programs were implemented in 11 months  It s been over a year for this program to be implemented and they didn t have a computer in 1965 to work on it  because it worked on a principle of building on a Medicare system similar to social security  American people had confidence in it and it worked  Well  we went to conference with the House of Representatives and that is when the influence of the insurance and drug industry came to play  They basically hijacked what was going to be a drug program for the senior citizens and drafted that to serve not the senior citizens but to serve the special interests  And I opposed that here on the floor of the Senate  our Republican friends forced that on through and now it is chaos in my state of Massachusetts with the prescription drug program  Why at least didn t our Republican friends say all right  let s have some real competition  Let s put the private sector and Medicare and let them compete and let our senior citizens make the choice  Do you think they would do that  No  They wouldn t bring a program back here that was built on the Medicare system  They wouldn t permit the citizens in my state make a choice They say we trust Medicare  it provides for our doctor s bills  it provides for our hospitalization  In 1964 and 1965  when you passed that  you didn t include prescription drugs because 97  of the private sector didn t include drugs  Why didn t we do the prescription drug program just like we did the Medicare program  Simple  workable  understandable  finished  No  no  we can t do that  We have to do it through a different way  We re going to have  instead of the Medicare system which is tried and tested and people understand  we re going to give the seniors of Massachusetts 45 different programs with different co pays  different formularies  different deductibles and there s mass confusion Mr  President with that program  Not only is there mass confusion but you have extraordinary circumstance that when a senior says I like this formulary can I afford this deductible  I can afford this co pay I think I ll go into this because of the cost of prescription drugs  they sign into it  Enormously interesting fact is that the company who they sign up with can change their formulary  can change the deductible and co pay  Do you think the senior can get out of that program without paying a penalty  Of course they can t  What kind of business is it  They feel that the private sector can do it so well why don t we have competition  Why did we have to provide a 7  inflator coast for all the H M O s when people in HMOs are 8  healthier than they are in Medicare  add that together  15  more if you re in the H M O  than if you re in a Medicare system  Why  Well  if that is the private sector  why isn t the private sector able to compete  Because this amounts to about a  46 billion subsidy  Do you hear me   46 billion subsidy  Just like it is about  139 billion subsidy for the drug industry  People wonder why the co payments are higher  There it is  my friends  With all the reform we hear about out here  do you think we re going to get a chance to support a change in that program by just adding  build it on Medicare  Let s just do that  Let s just add that  Have a real even competition and see what happens out there  many of my colleagues feel that way  We re going to press to try to do it  The point I m making  Mr  President  is I care deeply about these asbestos victims  It s enormously important we get it right  This bill doesn t do it  But we are not in this congress on a Friday at ten minutes of eleven  an empty chamber  why aren t we dealing with the challenges and the problems of the people back at home  I can tell you what they are concerned about  Why aren t we debating this Medicare  Today  this afternoon  why are we so busy with what we re doing and not dealing with this issue Why aren t we dealing with the home heating oil and the priorities for this  Here we have the President in his budget has recommended for this year  500 million less for home heating oil than even last year with record profits of the oil industry  Unconscionable profits of the oil industry paid for by who  Average Americans  Unconscionable  Why doesn t this President today on Friday bring head of corporations  bring in the executives of oil companies saying you ve drunk from that trough long enough  There s people in New England and around this country that can t afford on a fixed income with the explosions of the costs because of the war in Iraq   60 oil barrels  They didn t have anything to do with it and the oil companies are reaping profit because we have a challenge of turmoil in the Middle East  We re doing nothing about that this afternoon except facing a budget that s going to make it more difficult  In my state the average home uses three tankfulls a year  three tankfulls a year of oil they are getting those  the neediest in our state that qualify for this program they are going to get one tank full  What is the prospect for next year with the home heating oil crisis that we have today  they are not going to get a full tank for the next year Mr  President  we re talking about priorities  We re just giving you the examples of what has been happening in terms of cost of the LIHEAP and fuel assistance programs  Here are the costs going right up through the roof and we ve got the challenges that we have been facing out in the Middle East  Why are people so concerned about a corruption of culture that has taken over here in Washington  Why are they so concerned about lobbyists  Why are they so concerned about special interests  We have that debate  we re going to try and get action on this  which I will certainly support what we haven t talked about is what those lobbyists have been doing  what the impact has been on various programs that are affecting working families in the middle class I ll give you one example  Higher Education  The bill that came out of the United States Senate had  8 billion in student aid  The bill that came out of Conference had  3 8 billion in student aid and provided  12 billion in tax breaks for the wealthy people of this country  I call that a tax on middle class people  my friends  in order to give a tax break to the wealthiest individuals  The lobbyists were able to make the student loan program work for the banks and the wealthy in this country at the expense of the middle income families who are paying those debts now for their children to go on to college  In my state  the majority of the children that go to college get student aid and assistance  They need these programs  We ve seen an explosion of student loans in the last five or seven years  Who has been working on that and profiting from it  It has been the banks  There s that cozy relationship that exists now with Sallie Mae and the loan industries that pay their executives hundreds of thousands of dollars  contribute millions and millions of dollars  and they are getting their way  The American people ought to understand that lobbying has direct results President Bush  in his last campaign and his campaign previously  said we were going to get Pell Grants up to  5 100  In last year s budget  he only had it going up to  4 500 over 5 years  Do you think that even  4 500 is in his budget this year  No  Do you think that s in there  No So  Mr  President  if you re talking about what is bothering people  talking about even the issues in today s newspapers  here it is  mining fines among the smallest  laws limit size and allow reduction  This is the difference between the mine penalties and the fines that are paid for other consumer product safety  The violation of the FCC  EPA  even OSHA  That might not have saved all the lives or even half of those miners  lives who have been lost but why aren t we debating what s on the minds of people in West Virginia  Pennsylvania and other states today  Why aren t we dealing with their business  Here we have on the front page of another newspaper  White House knew of the levee s failure night of the storm  This is all about Katrina  Sure we ve had some hearings  but why aren t we talking about that  This is on the minds of people  Why aren t we doing some of that business  And then  if you look over here in the Washington Post  ex CIA official false US Data on Iraq  Heres  the official coordinated intelligence in the Middle East until last year accused the Bush Administration of cherry picking intelligence  This goes all the way through  basically saying the official intelligence was influenced  but even with the flaws it was not what led to war  Instead  he asserted the Administration went to war without requesting and evidently without being influenced by any strategic level assessments of any aspect of Iraq  People want to know  American sons and daughters are dying over there  why aren t we talking about this  My point is  Mr  President  that this budget that the President has put forward is not what the American people expect  It s not what they deserve  not what they are entitled to  And many of us are going to work in every possible way  It s the allocations of resource  money doesn t solve everything but it s an indication of a nation s priority  A nations priority for higher heating oil  a nation s priority in terms of lower drug costs  a nation s priority in terms of education cost  a nation s priority in an increase in the minimum wage  These are the things that are of concern to people Mr  President  and I would just hope that we would get back to the nation s business and get back to it soon  Americans are entitled to it and we have waited too long to be able to do it   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
