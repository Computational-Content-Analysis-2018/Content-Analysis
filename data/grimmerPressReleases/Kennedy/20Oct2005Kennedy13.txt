         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     It s shameful that the Republican leadership have decided to use a procedural maneuver once again to block emergency funding for LIHEAP  the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  Almost every Democratic Senator supported this additional funding  but Republican Senators overwhelmingly opposed it and it was defeated     It s clear that the Bush Administration and the Republican Congress have no intention of addressing the long term needs of the poor  Time and time again they close their eyes to the 37 million people who live in poverty today  Yesterday  they refused to increase the minimum wage by a modest amount  demonstrating that they seem unconcerned about the 13 million children going to bed hungry every night     There is no excuse for the Republican majority to look the other waybut they do     Rising energy costs are a huge part of the problem for people in poverty  According to a recent report by the Energy Information Administration  the outlook for the coming winter is bleak  Home heating bills are likely to soar  Significant numbers of citizens live with the constant threat of power shut offs  because they can t pay their energy bills  and there s no relief in sight  Families stay awake at night worrying how to make ends meet  Parents wonder how they can feed their children and keep the heat on  The elderly turn down their thermostats and put on extra sweaters in an attempt to save money  LIHEAP was created to help prevent these tragedies  but the program has been severely under funded in recent years  even as the need for assistance has risen sharply  The number of households receiving LIHEAP support has increased from 4 million in 2002 to 5 million this year  the highest level in ten years  Unfortunately  that number reflects only 15 6 percent of those eligible for assistance  Federal funding for LIHEAP has been stagnant for over a decade  As a result  the purchasing power of LIHEAP funding adjusted for inflation this year is now only a little over half of what it was in 1982  As poverty goes up  the need for LIHEAP assistance goes up as well  Yet the Bush Administration and the Republican Congress do nothing year after year  Millions of low income Americans set their thermostats at just 60 degrees or even lowerif their heat is still onwhile Congress  the Administration  and the vast majority of us rest content in warm homes  It s shameful that after the President and the Republican Congress froze LIHEAP funds through the Continuing Resolution  they continue to tune out the cries of low income families in need of home heating assistance  Winter is rapidly closing in on states across America  and yet even after Hurricane Katrina shocked the nation about the desperate plight of the poor we continue to ignore the urgent need  The time to increase LIHEAP funds is now  We will not give up the fight  We ll be back again and again and again  until our nation s neediest families are better protected this winter   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
