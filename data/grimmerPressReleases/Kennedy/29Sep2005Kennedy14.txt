         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Text of letter to Rumsfeld and fact sheet included   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633     Three years ago this month in a speech at the United Nations  President Bush began to outline his plans for war with Iraq     It was never in doubt that we could win the war  but we are dangerously close to losing the peace    Nearly 2000 Americans have been killed in Iraq  and nearly 15 000 more have been wounded  The insurgency shows no sign of weakening  Sectarian divisions are growing  and the security situation remains tenuous    The list of blunders in Iraq is clear and long  There were no weapons of mass destruction  persuasive link to Al Qaeda  no plan for reconstruction or to prevent the chaos that erupted after the fall of Saddam  no plan for the recovery or reconstruction  We should not have disbanded the Iraqi military with their weapons in tact  Month after month  our troops were wounded and killed because they were on patrols in vehicles with totally inadequate armor to protect them  We ve kept underestimating the strength of the growing insurgency    No foreign policy is sustainable without the support of the American people  The American people deserve to know the truth about our policy  They want to know how long it will take to fully train the Iraqis and when our military mission will be completed  They can deal with the truth  and they deserve to hear it    I m concerned by continuing reports that the Iraqi police and security forces we re training are substantially infiltrated by insurgents    Earlier this month  I received a shocking letter from a retired military officer  whose nephew is a Marine recently sent to Iraq  His letter says this  My nephew was briefed by just returned Marines that 100  of the Iraqi police and army have now been compromised by insurgents  He and his fellow Marines were warned that any and all operations that involve the Iraqi police or army units would result in ambush  Not all Iraqi police or army are members of the insurgency  but he was briefed that all units were infested with hostile collaborators to the point of being dysfunctional as partner security forces     We ve had warning signs before about the infiltration      A year ago  the New York Times reported that an adviser to the interim Prime Minister  Ayad Allawi  said that as many as 5 percent of the Iraqi government s troops are insurgents who have infiltrated the ranks or their sympathizers    At the time  Lt  Col  Jeffrey Sinclair of the 1st Infantry Division  said  The police and military forces all have insurgents in them  You don t have a pure force    In February  Major Don McCardle  deputy commandant of the 4th Iraqi Division Training Academy  said  After a recent battle in Mosul  some insurgent bodies were found wearing identification tags from the academy    In February  Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said  Penetration of Iraqi security and military forces may be the rule  not the exception    On July 25  the Inspectors General of the State Department and Defense Department released a joint report saying this  Even more troubling is infiltration by intending terrorists or insurgents  There is sufficient evidence to conclude that such persons indeed are among the ranks of the Iraqi Police Service     The report also said  A nettlesome issue has been the fact that some graduates do not enter the Iraqi Police Service after completing training  Keeping track of the numbers trained but not assigned is an elusive problem  Some U S  sources assert that the number might be as high as a third or more of those who have gone through basic training    a third or more     The report went on to say  The question of accountability for controlled equipment is particularly critical  The specter of weapons issued to members of the Iraqi Police Service but falling into the wrong hands is a concern     President Bush has said that our forces will stand down as the Iraqis stand up     The question is  who are we helping to stand up  Are the insurgents benefiting from our military training and then using inside knowledge to ambush and kill our soldiers  and even using our weapons to do it     I hope Secretary Rumsfeld and our witnesses today will begin to answer these questions openly and honestly     September 28  2005    The Honorable Donald Rumsfeld    Secretary of Defense    The Pentagon    Washington  D C   20301 4000    Dear Secretary Rumsfeld    Tomorrow you will testify before the United States Senate and the House of Representatives regarding the Administration s strategy in Iraq  In addition  in less than two weeks  your second written report to Congress measuring stability and security in Iraq will be due  1  These are significant events  We urge you to take advantage of these opportunities to provide frank answers to the questions the American public has been asking and that  thus far  the Administration has not answered     General Casey  America s top military commander in Iraq  in July stated that if the political process continues to go positively  and if the development of the security forces continues to go as it is going  I do believe we ll still be able to take some fairly substantial reductions  in U S  forces  after these elections in the spring and summer of 2006  No other Administration official has publicly confirmed this timetable  or  just as importantly  provided Congress and the American people with sufficient unclassified information to permit us to assess the Administration s progress on either front    The Administration s first report to Congress measuring stability and security in Iraq raised more questions than it answered  As a result  despite the fact that more than two years have elapsed since the fall of Baghdad  we have still not received a reliable  unclassified assessment of the security training progress we have made  We hope you use your upcoming testimony and the unclassified section of the next report to Congress to address three key questions       How many Iraqi security forces are now capable of fighting on their own  units rated by the Defense Department as Level 1  or taking the lead in the fight with a small number of embedded U S  forces  Level 2       How many Level 1 and Level 2 security forces must be in place before you feel it will be appropriate to begin reducing U S  forces   When do you anticipate this is likely to occur              What U S  troop levels likely will be required in the year ahead    The Administration s first report to Congress was also deficient in providing information needed to assess the Administration s progress in Iraq on the political front  As a result  it appears the Administration s measures of success for the political process do not sufficiently focus on building political consensus and reconciling differences across Iraq s sectarian lines  The Administration must provide answers to three key questions on this front      What specific measures does the Administration plan to take to forge the necessary political consensus and reconcile the sectarian and religious differences              How will we measure progress on reconciling Iraqi differences after the October referendum and December elections              What additional political milestones must be met next year before American forces can begin to come home    The Administration needs to find a way to provide the American people with unclassified judgments on these questions  Continued stonewalling  or simply saying these answers are unknowable or are conditions based are no longer satisfactory  The Congress and the American people deserve better information      Sincerely     Harry Reid    Richard Durbin    Carl Levin                       John D  Rockefeller IV    Joseph R  Biden Jr     Edward M  Kennedy    Jack Reed   Fact Sheet on
