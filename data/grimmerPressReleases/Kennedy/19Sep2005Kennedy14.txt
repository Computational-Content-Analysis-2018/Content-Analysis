         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633    On Friday  thirteen of my colleagues and I visited the stricken city of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast to see Katrina s devastation firsthand and hear from the affected residents  Like so many millions of Americans  I ve been moved by the news coverage of Katrina and her brutal aftermath for the past three weeks  But nothing I ve seen on television  nothing I ve read in the newspapers  and nothing I ve heard from the survivors we ve embraced in Massachusetts could prepare me for the staggering scope of the devastation when witnessed first hand    The destruction is massive in its scope  In many areas  the destruction is total  Much of New Orleans is a ghost town  Troops and police patrol eerily quiet streets  The desolation is frighteningly real    At least 40 percent of New Orleans was devastated by the calamity  We could see the high water marks on buildings  far above our heads  Debris is strewn everywhere  Massive amounts muck  black as ink and ringed with the rainbow swirls of oil and chemicals  cover everything    For so many of our fellow citizens    from New Orleans and throughout the Gulf region    there is nothing to return to  In Mississippi  entire communities are completely gone  All that s left of entire blocks are the concrete slabs where families once lived  Even the old oaks that graced Mississippi s historic shoreline for generations could not withstand Katrina s wrath    Survivors  stories are heart wrenching  Three babies died at the New Orleans convention center from heat exhaustion  A first responder at the convention center found he was the only doctor for 10 000 people  Dozens of elderly residents died of heat stroke or kidney failure  One woman waded through the floodwaters to Charity Hospital  floating her husband s body alongside her on a door    In Pass Christian  Mississippi  the police heroically stayed behind and braved the storm to rescue as many people as they could  Finally  as the flood waters were rising  they saved themselves by climbing onto the roof of the police station and watched their cruiser below tossed by the surging tide     Rescue workers we spoke with there found some 80 bodies    many in the attics of their homes  dead after desperately trying to claw their way through the roof to survival  Scratch marks were visible on the rooftops    The city s mayor is still missing  But the city attorney has been named acting mayor and has stepped up as a leader with determination and compassion  helping people recover and rebuild their lives    So much has been destroyed  But the spirit of the people we met remains strong  Like Job of the Old Testament  these people have had everything they own and cherish torn from their grasp  But they are determined to recover and rebuild their lives  They still have hope    and we must do all we can to help them    I was inspired by the heroism of the relief workers  the military  the churches  neighbors  friends  strangers    all coming together to support those in need    truly America at its best  Those we met on Friday were physically and emotionally exhausted  There still doesn t seem to be enough time each day to help all those who need our aid    not enough energy to heal the many broken hearts  Relief workers have suffered broken bones  sprained ankles  sunburns  dehydration  and infections from the contaminated floodwaters    But they press on  for they know there is so much remaining to be done  Those we met have an unyielding determination to rebuild that treasured region and rejuvenate its unique spirit  The work they do every minute  every hour  every day since Katrina struck  helps us all    our whole American family  They need to know that we are listening  and that we hear their concerns  We will not ignore them or put them aside  They deserve our leadership and our support  and we must prove to them that we are equal to the task    States across the country are responding  and I m proud of Massachusetts  efforts  Almost 500 Army and Air National Guard soldiers and airmen from our state have been sent to provide direct support to the hurricane victims as part of Operation Helping Hand  They re performing functions as diverse as security  command and control  law enforcement  communications  medical care  including mental health care  and spiritual guidance  The Massachusetts Guard has also activated an additional 150 persons for indirect support  staffing the Joint Operations Center and helping with logistics and airlifts  We ve shipped more than 200 tons of cargo using 17 aircraft  including Humvees  trucks  trailers  generators  a field ambulance  meals ready to eat  water  cots  tents  and medical supplies    There are almost 200 evacuees now living at Camp Edwards on Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod  We ve enrolled them in health care plans  helped children find their parents  offered mental health counseling  and enabled those who qualify for veterans benefits and Social Security benefits to continue to receive them without interruption or delay    anything to make them feel welcome and at home     For the evacuees who express interest in staying in Massachusetts  we re working with local housing authorities to have them placed in our towns  and the Black Ministerial Alliance has welcomed them into our congregations  FEMA will pay for plane tickets anywhere in the United States to reunite the evacuees with their family and friends    Finding employment for evacuees and schooling for their children are top priorities  and Massachusetts businesses and schools are eagerly lending a hand  Some have already found employment  and a job fair at the base has helped others    Massachusetts colleges have been eager to pitch in as well  60 public  private  and community colleges have enrolled over 1 000 displaced students and offered to assist them with financial aid  Displaced undergraduates will be able to attend public colleges and universities tuition free  And many campuses have offered to expedite admission  waive fees  and help secure housing  UMass Amherst has already enrolled more than a dozen undergraduate students and is housing them in local hotels until more permanent housing is secured  Boston University has accepted 321 displaced students  Boston College has accepted 150 students from Loyola and Tulane  Amherst is taking in students from Xavier and Tulane  Amherst and Williams College have invited faculty from Xavier to join their campuses for the semester    Katherine Barnett  a graduate student from Tulane  is now attending Boston University  I didn t think attending BU was going to be an option  but everyone there has been totally great  she said    When the tsunami struck Indonesia in December  and when earthquakes devastated Armenia  El Salvador  and Iran  the courageous team of health professionals from Massachusetts General Hospital was always among the first to respond  The team s response to Katrina is no different  Dr  Susan Briggs from Massachusetts General is leading the effort  She told me progress is being made with two mobile clinics  and they re reaching those in more remote areas  But in New Orleans  they re discovering many new storm related medical needs as people begin to return to the city    Three medical teams from Boston and one team from Worcester have been on the scene since the earliest hours of the disaster  and they have kept up a steady pace  Additional truckloads of medical supplies left Massachusetts at 5 o clock this morning for the Gulf  where our medical personnel are working  They ve dropped everything to help out    As we traveled in New Orleans and Mississippi  I was heartened by the spirit of determination to overcome this disaster and improve the lives of those most affected  I saw it on the faces of those who stayed behind to help with rescue and relief efforts  just as I have seen it in the faces of those who have had to leave all they know and go to safe havens across the country  It is the same spirit of determination that will carry them down the long road to rebuilding    The residents of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans take pride in their cities and towns  and they want to lead the way in reviving their own communities  They should not be ignored     First and foremost this means that we cannot have big businesses and outside contractors taking over the process of rebuilding  Local businesses    big and small    should get the lion s share of the work  And local people should get the lion s share of the jobs  New Orleans businesses and residents should rebuild New Orleans  Bay St  Louis should rebuild Bay St  Louis  Pass Christian should rebuild Pass Christian  And we should be there to help    Community leaders I spoke with in New Orleans mentioned the 9 11 families and their ability to band together as a voice for change  successfully pressuring the White House and Congress to form the independent 9 11 commission  Katrina survivors  they told me  don t need veto power over every proposal to rebuild their region    they just need a voice in the rebuilding of their own communities    There has been much discussion of the economic despair of those who were stranded in New Orleans and other areas  because they did not have the resources to escape the storm and flood  An enormous tragedy has afflicted a forgotten segment of our society  and it shames us all that in a country as rich as ours  we were not able to provide for the safety and security of all our citizens  but allowed race and class to devastate them     Our collective effort for rebuilding and reconstruction is an opportunity to make amends for decades of neglect  and genuinely address the needs of those most direly affected by this disaster     Estimates of the federal government s investment in this rebuilding effort are now as high as  200 billion  We must be certain that these funds go to the rebuilding of the new Gulf Coast and not to the accounts of the biggest contractors with the best political connections  The enormous job of rebuilding New Orleans and the Gulf Coast must be done right    The national government can help most by seeking to develop a common plan for the redevelopment of the region  We should have a commission on which everyone has a say    mayors  governors  community leaders  business leaders  citizens  the federal government    everyone  There should be hearings throughout the area to listen to the people s views of the kind of future they want  We should listen to the people of New Orleans on how they wish to revive the vitality of that special city  We should involve the best flood control engineers  the best community and urban development specialists  the best city planners  the best of everything  Redevelopment should not be determined by the biggest most powerful contractors  We need to work from a shared vision for the future in which we all do our part to build the new Gulf Coast    I commend President Bush for making the rebuilding of this damaged region a high priority for the federal government  and I believe a commission would give all of us the plan we need to get the job done right    We must cultivate and promote public private partnerships that are so important to successful community redevelopment  Already  many organizations are setting about the business of rebuilding in the Gulf Coast region  Private companies like Starwood Hotels and Resorts in New Orleans have already set a re opening date of November 1  and local small business owners are beginning to set up shop again  National and local philanthropic organizations like the Baton Rouge Area Foundation are beginning to examine the long term housing needs of the area  National efforts like those of ACORN are underway to organize residents who have been displaced and given them a fair voice and fair representation in the process    All of these groups and many others are key partners in the federal  state  and local efforts to rebuild the Gulf Coast communities devastated by Hurricane Katrina    It is essential  too  for contracts for rebuilding to include training for local people to do the jobs  That means training local residents for debris removal  environmental clean up  construction trades and other skills necessary to get the region back on its feet     Billions of federal dollars will be devoted to the effort  We must make sure that it is the residents of the region that benefit through jobs and training    We must give urgent attention to the few hospitals and clinics that are still operating  but they are working with reduced staff and few resources  Many  like East Jefferson General Hospital in the New Orleans area  do not have the resources to remain open much longer without government help    We should also give urgent attention to schools  to help that few that can reopen to do so  and to build new ones that can become the anchors for new communities    We must also make sure that we rebuild in a thoughtful way  drawing on the many lessons that we have learned from this disaster and other efforts at community building    We need to build water control systems that will be able to withstand giant hurricanes and floods in the future  We need to rebuild roads and sewers and power lines and whole public transportation systems  We need to restore the ecological resources of the region     The rebuilding process should not merely involve reproducing structures and systems in the way that they existed before the hurricane and flood  The people of the region have an opportunity to create better water control systems to ensure that this does not happen again  They have a chance to improve schools and rely on technologies necessary in the new economy  They have a chance to build the Gulf economy of the future    and in doing so to improve the entire nation s economic destiny  They have a chance to build a new economy that works for everyone    with diverse housing and more job opportunities    This new economy will of course still include a vibrant tourism industry  and there will continue to be jobs for the many service workers who call New Orleans home  A local union representative stressed to me that New Orleans can t just be a city in which only millionaires can afford to live    I am deeply concerned that the Department of Labor in Washington has taken harmful steps that will hurt the effort to revive the region  They have said that the big outside contractors moving into the area can pay construction workers sub standard wages  These workers have lost everything  and they are desperate to rebuild their homes and their lives and their communities  Yet now these giant contractors can come in from outside and deny fair wages    That s just wrong    The Department of Labor also says these big contractors don t have to reach out to hire minority workers  Yet  more than 40 percent of the people of New Orleans are African Americans  They represent a vast share of the people in the shelters who are left with nothing  How can the Labor Department say that these outside contractors can come into Louisiana and Mississippi  and thumb their nose at African American workers there    That  too  is gravely wrong  In his speech to the nation last Thursday  President Bush acknowledged that we must address the legacy of poverty as we rebuild  But authorizing sub standard wages and turning our back on minority workers is not the way to meet that goal     We have the ability in Congress to help New Orleans and the Gulf Coast area to rebuild themselves better than ever  All we need is the will to do it  I ve talked with my colleagues from the region in their offices and I listened to them on Friday as we saw the storm ravaged areas  Senators Landrieu  Vitter  Lott  Cochran  Sessions  and Shelby are determined to get the Gulf Coast back up on its feet  and I have appreciated the opportunity to discuss this with them    I appreciate  also  the leadership that Senator Enzi has provided on this issue as chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  Under his leadership  we introduced a strong bipartisan relief measure on education that should be before the Senate very soon  And we hope to have measures to meet the health and employment needs very soon    Senator Landrieu in particular has been an inspiration to us all  She was tireless in her efforts to expedite the federal response to the hurricane and is extraordinary in her resolve to help New Orleans recover  Her strength is a comfort to her constituents    and to the nation    Senator Frist  our leader  deserves praise as he returned briefly to his earlier career as Dr  Frist  I truly admire his courageous efforts to provide medical care in the early days at the makeshift hospital at the New Orleans airport     Friday was not a one time visit  It was just one day    but it will be a day I will not forget  We will not simply move on to a new issue tomorrow  This wound in our nation runs deep  and our response must be equal to the task  The hurricane destroyed communities  but it did not and could not destroy their spirit  They will rebuild  and we will help them to the very best of our ability  because in the end  we are one nation  one people  one family  It is in this way that we can best tap the true wealth of our nation  We must get it right    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
