         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent the following letter to the Acting Secretary of the Army Peter Geren urging him to reconsider the recent ban on military blogs on the Internet  The US Army has recently revised their policy on soldiers use of the Internet and their freedom to post on military web blogs  Below is the text of the letter that the Senator has sent to Secretary Geren in response to this policy  A PDF version is available upon request May 4  2007The Honorable Peter GerenActing Secretary of the Army1001 Army PentagonRoom 3E560Washington DC 20310 0100Dear Acting Secretary Geren It has come to my attention that the Army has recently revised its policy on soldiers use of the Internet  particularly their ability to post to military web logs  commonly known as blogs  This policy  Army Regulation 530 1  requires soldiers to clear the proposed content of their messages with a superior officer  This policy is a serious mistake that will have a chilling effect on opportunities for the public to connect personally with these brave fighting men and women  Todays Army is comprised of educated and articulate volunteers  and these dedicated men and women have earned our trust  With proper training and education  the Army should have faith that our troops are capable of discussing topics relevant to them without disclosing classified or other sensitive information  I was pleased to see that the author of the new policy  Major Ray Ceralde  believes there is some leeway in the policy  and that unit commanders can simply have soldiers register their blogs and then review the content for adherence to the policy  However  the plain language of the policy does not support such leeway  it is unlikely that commanders  faced with harsh penalties such as court martial called for by the policy  will apply such a loose reading of the policy As it stands  this policy will overburden immediate supervisors and OPSEC officers by requiring them to screen mundane communications  It will also prohibit soldiers from using internet chat rooms unless the soldiers immediate supervisor and OPSEC officer approve each message  In todays high tech world  such a policy doesnt make sense Soldiers  their families  and the public who read blogs and use other public forums will lose valuable insights into the lives of our soldiers if the policy continues to be enforced  This loss is particularly troubling  since it comes at a time when there is a deep need for Americans to connect with their soldiers I fully understand that sensitive information must be safeguarded  and that our nations adversaries may monitor and use relevant information to their own advantage  However  I believe we can meet that challenge by educating our troops rather than silencing them  I urge you to consider a common sense policy that trains our troops so that they can continue to communicate with their families and the public at large  I also ask you to provide a more thorough justification for the policy  What was the impetus for instituting it  Have any soldiers been charged with knowingly disseminating sensitive information though media outlets such as blogs and internet chat rooms  What efforts has the Army made to address this issue without requiring prior approval of content  What guidelines will be used by officers who review such content The Army should address this issue in a way that conveys faith and confidence in our troops  The current policy indicates a troubling lack of trust and a serious failure to educate and instruct the troops  I urge the Army to re evaluate this decision  At a minimum  the Army should redraft the policy to reflect the interpretation offered by Major Ceralde  I look forward to hearing your response      Sincerely Edward M  Kennedy          Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
