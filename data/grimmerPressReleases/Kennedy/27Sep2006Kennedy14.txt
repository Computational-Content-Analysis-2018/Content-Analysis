         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  DC   Today  U S  Senator Edward M  Kennedy asked the Deputy Director of the United States Citizenship  Immigration Service  Jonathan Scharfen during a Judiciary Committee hearing for an update on the status of the agencys term employees responsible for eliminating the immigration application backlog  Deputy Director Scharfen responded that the agency would extend their contracts   Sen  Kennedy said  I applaud USCIS for its decision to extend these employees terms  These important workers cut a backlog of millions of immigration applications  As a result  they have made an enormous difference to the enforcement of our immigration laws by ensuring that we let in those who would benefit America and keep out those who would harm us  The agencys decision today also recognizes the there is still more work to be done though  and now theyll have the experts in place going forward   Senator Kennedy had previously petitioned the agency to retain these employees   The letter Senator Kennedy and colleagues sent to Sec  Chertoff on August 25  2006 is below   PDF available upon request   The Honorable Michael Chertoff U S  Department of Homeland Security Washington  D C  20528   Dear Secretary Chertoff    Were writing to respectfully request that the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Service retain its term employees whose contracts expire at the end of this fiscal year  These employees have expertise in processing immigration applications and petitions  and CIS should not risk delays in those services by allowing their contracts to expire   Since 2002  more than 1100 employees were hired on a term basis to reduce the growing backlog of immigration applications and to process incoming applications  Since then  the backlog has been significantly reduced with CIS granting contract extensions   sometimes for as many as four years    to its term employees  We urge CIS to allow this progress to continue by either further extending the employees terms or making them permanent employees as quickly as possible   The Department has invested significant resources in the term employees training and security clearances  and these employees have developed expertise in processing immigration benefits claims  They are vital to the fulfillment by CIS of its mission to fairly and efficiently process immigration applications  However  CIS will be at risk of again falling behind on processing applications unless the Department acts to retain the employees whose current terms will expire on September 30  2006   As you know  Congress is considering immigration reform legislation  The Senate has already passed a comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform that has the support of President Bush  Passage of this legislation would make retaining these term employees particularly important  and we urge you to do so now   With respect and appreciation  and we thank you for your consideration of this request   Sincerely      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
