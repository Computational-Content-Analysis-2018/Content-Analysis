         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Bill summary and remarks included FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner    202  224 2633    Washington  DC  Today Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi put before the HELP committee the Defined Benefit Security Act   a bipartisan measure to bring retirement security to millions of Americans  The bill requires companies to protect their pensions with rules that are fair and predictable and includes needed changes to help avoid the danger of plans that are terminated  The bill also includes a provision to help the companies impacted by Katrina by giving the Secretaries of Labor and Treasury and the PBGC authority to postpone filing and payment deadlines for pension plans affected by Katrina     Senator Kennedy said   Millions of hardworking Americans find their retirement increasingly in jeopardy  Social Security is under attack  private pensions have been battered by a weak economy  low interest rates  and the stock market  and private savings are at historic lows  And now the devastation of Hurricane Katrina has torn apart the job security that millions had depended on  Now more than ever  workers deserve the support of Congress to preserve their hard earned pensions    and this bipartisan legislation will do just that    Below are Senator Kennedy s remarks and a description of the bill    STATEMENT OF EDWARD M  KENNEDY  MARK UP OF DEFINED BENEFIT SECURITY ACT  September 8  2005   Today we are considering much needed legislation to protect Americans  retirement  I commend our Chairman and Senator DeWine and Senator Mikulski for their leadership  and I urge the Committee to support it  As we know  millions of hardworking Americans find their retirement increasingly in jeopardy  Social Security is under attack  private pensions have been battered by a weak economy  low interest rates  and the stock market  and private savings are at historic lows  Obviously  workers deserve the support of Congress to preserve their hard earned pensions  Our bill requires companies to protect their pensions with rules that are fair and predictable  It also allows companies to contribute more to their pensions in good times  as a safeguard against economic downturns  And it preserves critical retirement benefits that workers in manufacturing industries receive when a plant closes     In addition  the bill includes needed changes to help avoid the danger of termination of pension plans  As we ve seen with the case of United Airlines  when a company uses bankruptcy to shed its pensions  workers and retirees are hurt and so is the economy  Our bill protects pensions already earned  It gives companies more time to meet their obligations  and it strengthens pension insurance  In particular  it will preserve the pensions of tens of thousands of airline employees at this crucial time when the whole industry is suffering from economic troubles and record fuel prices  The legislation also gives relief to multiemployer pension plans  which cover nearly 10 million workers and retirees  Large numbers of these employees work in industries where they move from job to job and would not be able to earn a pension without such multiemployer plans  since many of these employers  particularly small businesses  cannot afford to offer pension plans on their own     Finally  the bill addresses the problem of conversions to cash balance pension plans  which often hurt older workers who have worked for decades to earn their retirement  only to lose out when a company switches to a cash balance plan  I know that Senator Harkin has been a tireless advocate for protecting these older workers  and I hope that we can work with him to accommodate his concerns  Pensions that workers have earned need protection  and it s especially unfair for companies to discriminate against older workers  These are urgently needed protections for countless workers  It s encouraging that we ve made so much progress  and I know we can work together to expedite the enactment of this important legislation    Defined Benefit Security Act Enzi Kennedy DeWine Mikulski Substitute Summary   Title I Single Employer Funding Rules The Chairman s substitute adopts a stringent new funding regime to ensure that defined benefit plans are fully funded  The new rules require the amortization of all liabilities over ten years  based on assets averaged over no more than 3 years and liabilities measured over a modified yield curve  3 segments  that is smoothed over 3 years  Full funding is raised under the bill from 90  to a 100  target  but phased in over 10 years to avoid severe disruptions  Credit balances would continue to be available to companies in order to promote enhanced funding  but assets must be marked to market performance  To prevent funding holidays and ensure cash is always going into the plan  the substitute requires that plans funded at less than 80  must pay the greater of their normal costs or 25  of their minimum required contribution  The bill requires that lump sum distributions be anticipated in the plan s actuarial projections    Special new rules are established to encourage funding and prevent adverse actions  A new category of liability  known as at risk liability is created which requires plans that fall below 60  funding to calculate additional actuarial expenses on the basis that employees will leave early and take lump sums and early retirement subsidies  thus accelerating the decline in the plan if stronger funding rules are not triggered  At risk status  however  is not based on the credit rating or financial health of the company sponsoring the plan  Benefit limitations are also included in the bill  Plans falling below an 80  funding level may not increase benefits unless they are paid for up front  nor pay out lump sums  except at a reduced proportional rate based on the funding percentage of the plan  Severely underfunded plans  60   would be required to freeze new benefits accruals  No exception is created for collective bargaining agreements negotiated before a plan s funding level falls below these triggers  companies would be required to fund up to the trigger percentage to prevent the limitation from taking effect  Finally  companies of plans funded below 60  would be prohibited from enhancing deferred compensation for top executives    Title II Multiemployer Funding Rules In addition to restating current funding rules under ERISA  the substitute adopts a new regime for multiemployer plans facing funding crises  Generally  plans that face a funding deficiency within 7 years would fall into the endangered status  and must implement a funding improvement plan that is designed to improve funding by 1 3 over 10 years  More severely underfunded plans  that fall into critical status  would be required to reduce accruals prospectively and increase contributions as part of a rehabilitation plan designed to lift the plan out of critical status in 10 years     Title III Interest Rate Assumptions The Chairman s substitute requires that lump sums be calculated using the full yield curve rather than the 30 year Treasury bond rate  This change in law is phased in over 5 years    Title IV Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation The flat rate premium paid by all single employer plans for each participant is increased from  19 to  30  The board of directors of the PBGC is instructed to recommend to Congress premium increases to address the financial health of the corporation  The bill repeals the full funding exemption under the variable rate premium  expanding the base of single employer plans that pay the variable rate premium to include all underfunded plans  Companies that terminate their defined benefit plans through the bankruptcy process will be required to pay a premium of  1000 per participant for the three years  but only after the company successfully emerges from bankruptcy  The bill also sets new  lower premium rates for new plans or very small employers    Several sections of the Chairman s substitute are designed to cut the losses of the PBGC  In particular  the agency s guarantee is capped in bankruptcy when a company with a plan funded at less than 80  fails to make required payments into the plan  Shutdown benefits are treated as ad hoc amendments to the plan  effectively limiting the PBGC s exposure  Under current law  termination is the only tool that the PBGC can exercise when faced with a troubled pension plan  The substitute addresses this problem by granting the corporation the authority to negotiate alternative funding agreements that allow companies to keep funding their pension plans and avoiding a PBGC bailout  Conditions in the alternative funding agreement would give companies more time to fulfill their obligations  protect the pensions workers have already earned  and ensure that the PBGC would not suffer further losses by participating plans    The bill also adopts the airline funding relief incorporated in the Finance Committee s bill and includes a special provision addressing the so called soft freeze    Title III Disclosures The Chairman s substitute expands the notice and disclosure provisions of ERISA in order to achieve greater transparency and awareness of retirement security  The bill creates a new 90 day notice that informs participants and beneficiaries  unions and  in the case of multiemployer plans  contributing employers in a timely way of the true financial state of the plans for the most recent and two preceding years  Additional notices are required when benefits limitations are triggered or the company files for bankruptcy    The substitute significantly expands participant and employer access to multiemployer plan actuarial and financial information  For the first time  contributing employers and unions will receive annual statements detailing the financial health of the plans and providing essential other information about plan practices that will help them manage their affairs and anticipate problems    The substitute also expands the universe of underfunded or at risk plans that must file extensive financial information with the PBGC that will help the agency anticipate and cope with declining plans  Employees of companies required to make the so called Section 4010 filings will receive special notices informing them of the financial condition of their plans    Title VI Deduction Limits Deduction limits would be raised for single employer plans to 180  and for multiemployer plans to 130      Title VII Hybrid Plan Clarification The substitute provides retroactive relief and prospective clarity to employers establishing hybrid pension plans  The bill clarifies that hybrid pension plans  such as cash balance and pension equity plans  are lawful and it repeals the so called whipsaw rule for calculation lump sums  The substitute creates safe harbors for plans that have previously converted to hybrid designs and provided special transition protections to older workers when they did so  This retroactive relief is provided to companies that are not engaged in litigation on this issue  It also incorporates prospective conversion rules contained in the Senate Finance Committee pension legislation    Title V Authority to Postpone Certain Deadlines In light of the impact of Hurricane Katrina on business in affected areas  the Chairman s substitute instructs the Secretaries of Labor and the Treasury  and the Executive Director of the PBGC to exercise their authority to postpone certain pension deadlines for up to a year   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
