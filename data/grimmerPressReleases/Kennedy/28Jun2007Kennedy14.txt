         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  It is now clear that we are not going to complete our work on immigration reform  That is enormously disappointing for Congress and for the country  But we will be back  and we will prevail  The American people sent us here to act on our most urgent problems  and they will not accept inaction  I have seen this happen time and time again  America always finds a way to solve its problems  expand its frontiers  and move closer to its ideals  It is not always easy  but it is the American way  I learned this first as a child at my grandfather s knee  He taught me that in America  progress is always possible  His generation moved past the cruel signs in the windows saying Irish Need Not Apply  and elected that son of an Irish immigrant as Mayor of Boston  I learned that lesson first hand when I came to the Senate in 1962  Our nation was finally recognizing that the work of civil rights had not ended with the Emancipation Proclamation  nor with the Supreme Court s decision in Brown v  Board of Education  It was up to Congress to take action  The path forward has never been an easy one  There were filibusters of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  and of the Voting Rights Act of 1965  But we did not give up  and we prevailed The same was true in our battles for fair housing  and for an end to discrimination against persons with disabilities  On immense issues like these  a minority in the Senate was often able to create stalemate and delay for a time  But they have never been able to stop the march of progress  Throughout all of those battles  we faced critics who loudly warned that we were changing America forever  In the end  they were right  Our history of civil rights legislation did change America forever  It made America stronger  fairer  and a better nation  Immigration is another issue like that  We know the high price of continuing inaction  Raids and other enforcement actions will escalate  terrorizing our communities and businesses  The 12 million undocumented immigrants will soon be millions more  Sweatshops will grow  and undermine American workers and wages  State and local governments will take matters into their own hands and pass a maze of conflicting laws that hurt our country  We will have the kind of open border that is unacceptable in our post 9 11 world Immigration reform is an opportunity to be true to our ideals as a nation  Our Declaration of Independence announces that all of us are created equal  Today  we failed to live up to that declaration for millions of men and women who live  work  and worship beside us  But our ideals are too strong to be held back for long  Martin Luther King had a dream that children would be judged solely by the content of their character  Today  we failed to make that dream come true for the children of immigrants  But that dream will never die  It has the power to overcome the most bitter opposition I believe that we will soon succeed where we failed today  and that we will enact the kind of comprehensive reform that our ideals and national security demand  Soon  word will echo across the country about the consequences of todays vote  But we are in this struggle for the long haul  Todays defeat will not stand  As we continue the battle  we will have ample inspiration in the lives of the immigrants all around us  From Jamestown to the Pilgrims to the Irish to today s workers  people have come to this country in search of opportunity  They have sought nothing more than the chance to work hard and bring a better life to themselves and their families  And they come to our country with their hearts and minds full of hope We will endure todays loss  and begin anew to build the kind of tough  fair and practical reform that is worthy of our shared history as immigrants and as Americans  Immigration reforms are always controversial  But Congress was created to muster political will to answer such challenges  Today we didnt  but tomorrow we will      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
