         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I oppose the nomination of John Bolton to be our Ambassador to the United Nations     His confirmation hearings suggest he wrongly pressured analysts to produce intelligence conclusions at odds with the facts  and then retaliated against those who refused to abandon their principles     The lesson of the Iraq war is clear  We need to make decisions based on the facts and sound analysis of intelligence  We can t demand the results we want  and try to fire people who refuse to go along     It s hard to believe he has the diplomatic skills to be our representative at the world s pre eminent diplomatic body  What we need most at the U N  is a diplomat  not a bully    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
