         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     All Americans are inspired by the way the Iraqi people once again demonstrated their courage  dedication  and resilience by going to the polls to place their future    and the future of their country    squarely on the side of democracy     Every American salutes our men and women in uniform who are serving so ably under enormously difficult circumstances  and whose dedication and sacrifice have made today s elections possible  More than 2 100 of America s finest soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq we owe them and their loved ones an immense debt of gratitude  We all hope that successful elections will give the Iraqi people new confidence that a brighter future lies ahead     Successful elections can and should be the turning point we ve been waiting so long for  when our troops can begin to come home  As our Ambassador to Iraq  Zalmay Khalizad  said today  because of the training of the Iraqi security forces is proceeding  some draw down can begin in the aftermath of the elections    An open ended commitment of America s military forces does not serve America s interest and it does not serve Iraq s interest either  If America wants a new Iraqi government to succeed  we need to let Iraqis take responsibility for their own future    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
