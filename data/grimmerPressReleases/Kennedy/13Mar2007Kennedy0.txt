         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   I join in welcoming our witnesses to this joint hearing on the reauthorization  of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act  Our committees worked closely  together on the No Child Left Behind Act  and we look forward to continuing our  partnership on this reauthorization                Our goal  in the No Child Left Behind Act was to set high standards  close achievement  gaps  strengthen public schools  and enable every child to receive a good  education   Our priority this year is to make the improvements in the act needed  to deliver on the commitment made in 2002   Schools obviously need greater help  in achieving the Acts goals  and this is no time to retreat  The Act is  based on the fundamental principal that every child counts  black or white   native born or immigrant  disabled or non disabled   We cannot allow the great  hope of Brown v  Board of Education to provide a quality education for all  children to go unrealized   We cannot allow rampant inequality to undermine  opportunity and progress in our schools The No Child Left Behind Act has  already enabled schools around the nation to make unprecedented progress toward  those goals   All 50 states now have standards  assessments  and systems of  accountability to track the achievement of students  based not on the  performance of its overall student population  but on its progress in closing  achievement gaps and enabling all students to meet specific standards   Schools  throughout America now are using data from the Act to develop better ways to  improve instruction and meet the needs of individual students                Our Senate Committee has heard in recent weeks about some  of these changes   At the Achievable Dream Academy in Newport News  Virginia   longer school days and a more rigorous curriculum have enabled African American  students to pass the Virginia state assessment at rates equal or almost equal to  white students   A public private partnership in Boston has improved the  recruitment  preparation  training  and retention of teachers through an  intensive  year long residency program                 We know  however   that weve only just begun   At this stage of the reauthorization  we look  forward to hearing a range of ideas to build on the initial success of the Act  and deal with its problems                    We need more effective  ways to measure student growth toward standards  and to recognize schools for  that progress    Our goal is to focus on the lowest performing schools  instead  of simply classifying so many as failures                We cant just  label schools   We must help them improve   Over 9 000 low income schools are  confronting their weaknesses as they develop and implement the improvement plans  required by the law   The federal role in assisting these schools may be our  greatest challenge  and its a top priority for this reauthorization                 We must improve the quality of assessments  so that they  better reflect whats taught in the classroom  and are more useful in making  decisions about teaching and learning   English language learners and students  with disabilities deserve the full benefits of the Act  and that requires fair   accurate  and reliable ways to measure their performance                  We must strengthen the workforce of teachers and close  the gap in teacher distribution in high poverty and high minority schools   The  best way to close the achievement gap for students is to see that they all have  good teachers              We must give young students the support and  services they need to come to school ready to learn   We must re engage parents  and whole communities in the process  and make them stronger partners in the  education of their children                  We must help states develop  high standards that are aligned to rigorous curriculums  so that students who  graduate from school are ready to compete in the workforce or do well in  college               Most of all  we must use this reauthorization to  give schools the resources they need to implement these essential reforms   If  we shortchange our schools  were shortchanging America                   Time and again  Ive heard from teachers  principals   and administrators desperate for financial help to carry out these reforms   especially in low performing schools   We know we can do better   All we need is  the will to do it              I look forward to hearing our witnesses  recommendations and ideas on all of these issues  Thank you all for being here  today     Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
