         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Washington  DC   As the Senate prepares to vote this week on an estate tax minimum wage package  Senator Kennedy reiterated his opposition to the measure noting that the Republican plan includes a pay cut for workers who depend on tips for a living   The bill would change the minimum wage for tipped workers seven states     Alaska  California  Minnesota  Nevada  Oregon  and Washington  requiring them to be paid only the federal minimum wage  not the higher state minimum wage  until the state enacts a law with a tip penalty  The restaurant industry fought for this provision to be included in the Republican package    The Republican bill would boost the bottom line for Americas restaurants  while taking money away from waiters and waitresses  parking attendants  bellhops and other hardworking Americans who depend on tips to support themselves and their families  Senator Kennedy said  Instead of denying millions of workers minimum wage protection  we should raise the wage and expand the protection   The people who work in our restaurants  carry our bags  and clean our hotel rooms are work hard for a living and they deserve a well earned raise    Im confident this cynical ploy will be rejected by the Senate   Below is a fact sheet on the tip penalty        Under current federal law  restaurant owners can pay their waiters and waitresses as little as only  2 13 an hour  and the rest of their compensation is supposed to come from tips   The same is true for hotel maids  parking attendants  bartenders  all workers who rely on tips to make a living        Congress has increased this cash wage only 12 cents in the last 25 years         Federal labor and employment law sets a minimum floor  but states are free to guarantee higher wage for tipped workers   In fact  the Fair Labor Standards Act encourages states to enact laws that are more protective for workers than the federal law            Seven states  Alaska  California  Minnesota  Montana  Nevada  Oregon and Washington   do not allow a tip penalty   They guarantee that tipped workers get the full minimum wage plus any tips they receive        But the Republican bill would take power away from the states by nullifying these state laws providing stronger wage protections for tipped employees than the federal standard  In fact  the bill would change the minimum wage for tipped workers in these seven states  requiring them to be paid only the federal minimum wage  not the higher state minimum wage  until the state enacts a law with a tip penalty        Washington and Oregon have passed ballot initiatives to provide stronger wage protections to tipped employees than the federal protections   This amendment overturns the will of the voters in those states        It seems that Republicans support States rights except when it comes to fair wages for workers  Then Republicans support whats good for the restaurant industry     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
