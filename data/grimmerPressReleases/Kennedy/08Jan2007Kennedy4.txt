         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  met with President Bush at the White House to discuss reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act  The landmark education legislation celebrates its fifth anniversary today  Kennedy was joined at the meeting by Congressman George Miller  Senator Mike Enzi and Congressman Buck McKeon Senator Kennedy said  We have an obligation to revisit the No Child Left Behind Act and ensure that it lives up to its promise  At issue is our economic strength  our commitment to opportunity  and even our national security  so we need to take action this year to strengthen our public schools  No Child Left Behind is a landmark commitment to closing the achievement gap  and increasing opportunities for each of our students to learn and receive a quality education  We must renew and reaffirm those goals  They re important for the future of our nation We re prepared to work with the President and as a first step we urged him to send a message in this year s budget that every child counts and deserves the benefits of our liberty  We will continue to fight for the resources we know are needed to fulfill this promise Senator Kennedys proposal to strengthen No Child Left Behind is included below  THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND IMPROVEMENT ACTHELPS KEEP THE PROMISE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICENCLB provides an option for students to transfer to another public school of their choice  if their school fails to meet their accountability targets 2 years in a row  The Problem  The Bush Administrations regulations for carrying out public school choice recklessly have directed school districts to ignore health and safety codes and unnecessarily crowded students into schools  The Administration has consistently opposed class size reduction and school construction programs  two practical solutions to help reduce the overcrowding problem and accommodate more students  The No Child Left Behind Improvement Act    Ensures that school districts consider health and safety codes in providing options for students to transfer to other public schools    Provides new funds for schools that are overcrowded to carry out public school choice  supporting school construction and renovation efforts    Does not change NCLBs existing requirements for public school choice ENSURES FAIR ACCESS TO QUALITY SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICESNCLB provides an option for students to receive tutoring and other academic support  if their school fails to meet their accountability targets 3 years in a row  NCLB requires providers of supplemental services to comply with health  safety  and civil rights laws The Problem  The Bush Administration has failed to enforce civil rights protections for private providers of supplemental services  thus compromising fair access to services for children  especially those with special needs and limited English proficiency  and leaving beneficiaries vulnerable to discrimination  Rather than focusing on quality in these services  the Department of Educations guidance actually prohibits states from ensuring that tutoring services are delivered by certified teachers  The No Child Left Behind Improvement Act    Reverses the Administrations policy and reinforces civil rights laws  so that all supplemental service providers are barred from discriminating against children   Gives states the option of ensuring that supplemental services are provided by certified teachers   Requires all supplemental service providers to employ quality personnel   Does not change NCLBs existing requirements to provide supplemental servicesENSURES HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS AND PARA PROFESSIONALS IN EVERY CLASSROOMNCLB requires all teachers and para professionals to be highly qualified by 2006  The Problem  The Bush Administrations regulations fail to ensure that every state implement the teacher quality standards provided for under NCLB  running counter to the laws requirements for veteran teachers  Such action could result in difficulties in keeping experienced and committed teachers and para professionals in the nations schools  The No Child Left Behind Improvement Act    Ensures every state develop and implement the standard criteria under the law for ensuring that veteran teachers are highly qualified  High Objective Uniform State Standard of Evaluation  or HOUSSE    Ensures that every state provide all newly hired and existing paraprofessionals every opportunity under the law to demonstrate their skills and meet NCLBs requirements    Does not change NCLBs existing requirements for ensuring a highly qualified teacher in every classroom ENSURES FAIR AND ACCURATE ACCOUNTABILITY DECISIONSNCLB requires schools to make adequate yearly progress  AYP  for all students The Problem  The Bush Administration delayed guidance and final regulations for counting children with disabilities and English language learners for two years  As a result  states may have mislabeled potentially thousands of schools under NCLBs standards last year  Even after the Administration established clear policies earlier this year  the Education Department has refused to play by their own rules by refusing to allow schools to review last years scores  The No Child Left Behind Improvement Act   Requires the Secretary to give schools the option of re calculating AYP scores from last year  for a more accurate picture of student achievement under the Departments own new rules    Avoids misdirecting resources and unfairly penalizing schools because of the Departments own failure to issue regulations and guidelines in 2003    Does not change the laws existing requirements for accountability or adequate yearly progress  AYP  PREVENTS HIGH DROPOUT RATESThe Problem  Despite detailed requirements for including graduation rates in accountability systems under the law  this Administration has failed to collect data that shows whether students actually complete school  Without accurate graduation rate data  some students may drop out of school or fall through the cracks  even as student test scores improve  The No Child Left Behind Improvement Act   Requires the Secretary to collect and report information on dropout rates for each subgroup of students  each year    Provides for a more accurate calculation of dropout rates  as states develop new data tracking systems    Does not change the laws existing requirements to include graduation rates in the adequate yearly progress  AYP  determination IMPROVES THE QUALITY AND SCOPE OF STUDENT TESTING NCLB requires high quality assessments of all children to measure proficiency in reading and math  including accommodations for students with disabilities and native language assessments for English language learners  to the extent practicable The Problem  Despite NCLBs commitment to a higher standard of quality for the assessment of children under the law  the Administration has failed to promote fair testing standards for children with disabilities and English language learners  shirking responsibility to issue guidance on these issues  The No Child Left Behind Improvement Act    Provides new funds to help states develop native language assessments for English language learners  and better assessments for special needs children    Provides new funds to help states develop better assessment and data systems  including longitudinal tests to follow the progress of individual students from year to year REAFFIRMS CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS AND PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATIONNCLB contains explicit civil rights protections The Problem  The Bush Administration is ignoring and misinterpreting NCLBs critical civil rights language  and by doing so  has opened the door to religious discrimination against staff of supplemental services and after school programs  or applicants for such positions  The No Child Left Behind Improvement Act   Clarifies that discrimination on the basis of race  color  religion  sex  except as otherwise permitted under Title IX   national origin  or disability in any program funded under NCLB is prohibited   Clarifies that recipients of any services under No Child Left Behind may not be discriminated against  PROMOTES QUALITY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND RESEARCHUnder several authorized programs  NCLB requires the use of activities  strategies  and materials based on scientifically based research The Problem  In some instances  the Bush Administration has provided an overly narrow and rigid interpretation of scientifically based research that has ruled out some successful approaches to educational improvement  The Education Department has insisted that some schools modify programs toward a specific educational ideology  rather than ensure that they are tailored to proven and effective methods of teaching and learning  The No Child Left Behind Improvement Act   Requires the Education Department to ensure that all technical assistance and research activities make use of educational strategies  programs  and practices that have been successful in improving educational opportunities and achievement for all students    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
