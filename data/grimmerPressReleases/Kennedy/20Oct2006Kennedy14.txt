Boston Food Bank  Vicary Graham  chair of The Greater Boston Food Bank  and Catherine DAmato  president of The Greater Boston Food Bank presented the award to Senator Kennedy  Jim Perdue  chair of Perdue Farms Inc   honored Dan and Betsy Nally  the young founders of the nonprofit organization Turkeys 4 America  on the 10th anniversary of their first turkey drive  In November 1996 Dan and Betsythen ages 8 and 6collected 36 turkeys from their friends and neighbors to donate to the Greater Boston Food Bank after viewing a news story about a shortage of turkeys for needy families  Since that initial contribution to The Food Bank  Turkeys 4 America has grown into an annual event with chapters in the Midwest and West Coast  Last year Perdue Farms Inc  donated 1 000 turkeys to The Greater Boston Food Bank    The Greater Boston Food Bank distributes over 25 million pounds of food annually to more than 600 hunger relief agencies in a dedicated partnership to end hunger in eastern Massachusetts  The Food Bank serves 83 000 people each week  Established in 1981  The Food Bank celebrates its 25th anniversary this year    Senator Kennedy continues to work to address the root causes of poverty by fighting for better educational opportunities  fair wages  and affordable health care  He has also introduced the End Child Poverty Act which sets a national goal of cutting child poverty in half within a decade  and eliminating it entirely as soon as possible thereafter    Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy for the Greater Boston Food Bank 25th Anniversary Appreciation Luncheon  October 20  2006   As Prepared for Delivery    The civil rights leader Ella J  Baker told of how as a child  her family was able to share their food with others  She said in sharing their food  she felt they were sharing their lives  too  At the Greater Boston Food Bank  you share food with those who need it  but you also share your lives every day with those in our community who face hunger  need and loneliness  You are a modern example of the biblical story of the loaves and the fishes  For every dollar donated  you provide five dollars of food to the hungry  You involve more than 600 partners and 12 000 volunteers who serve 83 000 people a week   Your Brown Bag program provides seniors with supplemental bags of nutritious groceries  The Kids Caf serves wholesome meals to children after school  One of my favorite initiatives is your competition on National Hunger Awareness Day  which I had a chance to visit last June  Corporations send in teams to see which company can sort the most food  When I visited  my money was on Cirelli Foods of Middleboro because they had won two years in a row  But the Hartford Financial Services Group managed to eke out a victory that year  In this and so many other ways  youve made the Greater Boston Food Bank an instrument of hope for our communities and all of Massachusetts is in your debt  Sadly  the number of our neighbors and fellow citizens who face hunger is growing  Today  38 million Americans are hungry  an increase of 5 million in the past six years  A half million of those live in Eastern Massachusetts   Its shameful that in the richest country on earth 14 million children go to bed hungry at night  Their hunger affects not only their nutritional needs  It affects their dignity and self worth as well  They cant concentrate in school  so they often drop out  Some end up in trouble with the law  or even in prison   Even middle class families can suddenly be affected  A job loss or a serious illness can overwhelm a family budget already strained by the high cost of housing or heating  The elderly are vulnerable as well  Many of them have trouble getting by on fixed incomes  According to a recent study at Northeastern University  the number of seniors near or below poverty will rise from 6 million today to more than 8 million in the coming decade  How we meet this challenge is not just a matter of feeding people  It is a measure of our humanity as well  We must provide day to day sustenance for those who need it  But we are also obligated to do all we can to end hunger  Government  corporations  communities  religious groups  and individual citizens need to work together to develop more effective policies and faster responses  and the Greater Boston Food Bank is a shining example of the potential of these partnerships  A decade ago  the Clinton Administration launched an effort to cut hunger in half in the United States by 2010  and the strong economy in those years helped us make significant progress toward that goal   Now  however  the economy is weaker  The safety net is riddled with holes  and many Americans are falling through it   We know how to mend it  We know it can be done  All we need is the will to do it  We must reduce hunger in the nation by improving and expanding federal nutrition programs  But we also have a responsibility to our fellow human beings to do all we can to ensure that all Americans share the fruits of our prosperity  That means strengthening educational opportunities to help people get good jobs  It means fighting for wages that ensure that no one who works for a living lives in poverty  It means affordable health care for all  It means all those things  and I commend all of you for leading the way   Thank you so much for this Award  Youre the ones who really deserve it  and Im deeply grateful for all you do so well       Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley   617  565 4472
