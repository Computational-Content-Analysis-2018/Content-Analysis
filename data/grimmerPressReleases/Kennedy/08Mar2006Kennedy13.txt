         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  oppose the nomination of Richard Stickler to be Assistant Secretary of the Mine Safety and Health Administration and Arlene Holen to the Mine Safety and Health Review Commission This year 24 miners have already been killedtwenty one in our nation s coal mines  only three short of all of last year  It is clear that something is seriously wrong in mine safety  The Assistant Secretary of MSHA is the nation s top official in protecting miners  safety and we need someone who will be effective in meeting that responsibility  Last month Chairman Enzi  Subcommittee Chairman Isakson  Subcommittee Ranking Member Senator Murray and I traveled to West Virginia to meet with the families of the miners killed at Sago Mine  We heard from them about the tragic losses they suffered and the last messages their loved ones left for them These family members  and these miners  are the true experts on mine safety and their voices must be heard  We have held hearings in the Committee on changes needed in federal law to enhance the safety of all miners  and I look forward to working with my colleagues to report legislation needed to strengthen safety standards and enforcement Our nation s miners need and deserve a strong leader at the head of MSHA  But in his demeanor and responses in the committee hearing  Mr  Stickler failed to convince us that he is the right person for the job  He is not a safety and health specialist  His response  time and again  was that he would study and analyze these problems  which gave us little confidence  As numerous experts have testified  MSHA  NIOSH  and the health and safety community have been studying these problems for yearsand in some cases  decades The time for study is over  It is time for action  America s miners are paying the price for this long delay  We do not have all the answers yet  but clear consensus is emerging around certain basic protections that are urgently needed  We need an Assistant Secretary who will vigorously lead the agency and put these protections in place quickly  and who will aggressively seek other protections to make the United States once again the world leader in mine safety  With respect to Ms  Holen s nomination  my concern is that it would skew the make up of the Mine Safety and Health Review Commission  the body responsible for reviewing penalties  The Commission s work is of great concern  Last fall an administrative judge under the Commission chose to reduce penalties at the Jim Walters Resources Mine in Alabama from  435 000 to only  3 000 in a case in which repeated safety violations had taken place and 13 miners were killed  The Commission will be considering the appeal of this case  Imposing strong penalties against bad actors is a critical mission of the Commission and we must ensure that it is a balanced group Ms  Holen has served on the Commission before  but she is now being nominated to a seat vacated by a Democratic nominee  If Ms  Holen takes that seat  the Commission will be dominated by individuals with extensive industry ties and will have only one Commissioner who has worked on behalf of America s miners It is critical for the Commission to have a balanced representation  Such representation is not required by statute  but it has been the long standing practice of our Committee to insist on it  America s miners and the American public are not fairly served when the balance is tilted heavily in favor of the industry and against the interests of the miners  For these reasons  I oppose these two nominees and I urge my colleagues to reject them    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
