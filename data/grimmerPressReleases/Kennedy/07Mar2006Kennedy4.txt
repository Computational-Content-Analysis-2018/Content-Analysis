         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington DC  Today  the Pew Hispanic Center released new estimates of undocumented people in the United States  reporting that the number has climbed to 12 million  According to their data  one in every 20 workers is here without authorization  Senator Kennedy issued the following statement in response to the new estimates  The new numbers of undocumented workers in this country only underscore how urgent it is that Congress enacts comprehensive immigration reform  Clearly  our system is broken and past efforts to strengthen enforcement haven t worked  The only way to fix it and break the cycle of illegality is to provide tough and fair enforcement while offering a path to citizenship  Tomorrow  as we continue our negotiations in the Senate Judiciary Committee and examine issues of enforcement  we must be mindful that unduly punitive measures that criminalize hardworking immigrants will only further drive them into the shadows  We need to enact responsible reforms consistent with our country s ideals and our heritage as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws  Below is a link to the report  http   pewhispanic org reports  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
