         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to President Bushs radio address on immigration    I applaud President Bush for calling yet again for comprehensive immigration reform  He understands   along with a bipartisan majority in the Senate and the American people    that immigration is a serious and complex issue that calls for thoughtful and comprehensive solutions  In Congress  Senator McCain and I met with a bipartisan group of Senators on Thursday to affirm our commitment to oppose enforcement only measures and support comprehensive reforms that will keep out those who would hurt us  but welcome those who will strengthen America for the future  And we are determined to pass comprehensive immigration reform this year    There are those on the far right in Congress who are playing politics with immigration  They prey on people s fears in a desperate hope that if they just call for fences and continue to demonize hard working immigrants  it will delay progress and help them at the ballot box in November  But we know they are wrong  Their scheme would leave us weaker and less secure and we will not allow them to derail our strong bipartisan reforms    Under our comprehensive plan  we know first and foremost that we must strengthen and modernize enforcement   at the border  at our airports  and in the workplace  But that is not enough  To truly achieve immigration reform and protect our country  we must also provide a path for the 12 million undocumented immigrant men  women and children to earn the privilege of remaining here legally  And we must establish a program for the future to allow needed immigrants to come here legally and for our employers to hire them    We have a long and rocky road ahead to pass this plan through Congress and get it to the President s desk  To get there  I believe that President Bush must call congressional leaders to meet in September and accomplish real reform       Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
