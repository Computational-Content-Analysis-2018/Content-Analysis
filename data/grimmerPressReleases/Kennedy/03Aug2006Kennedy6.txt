         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE          Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement   Tonight the Democrats defeated a cynical ploy to strong arm outrageous tax breaks for the wealthy through Congress on the backs of Americas hardworking  low wage workers  Everyone in America knows that after 10 long years without one  minimum wage workers deserve a raise   But Republicans decided it was good politics to hold millions of minimum wage families hostage to provisions that increase the fortunes of a few thousand of the richest families by  753 billion   Talk about a trifecta   this Republican plan was cynical  it was contemptible  and it was cowardly   I applaud my Democratic colleagues for blocking it and I look forward to the next opportunity to bring up a straight up or down minimum wage vote      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
