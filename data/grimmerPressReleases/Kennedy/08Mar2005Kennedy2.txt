         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today we consider the nomination of Thomas Griffith to a lifetime position on the U S  Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit  The D C  Circuit is widely regarded as the nation s most important appellate court  and it s often been a stepping stone to the Supreme Court  It has a unique role among the federal courts in interpreting federal power  and has exclusive jurisdiction over many laws that protect consumers  workers  rights  civil rights  and the environment   Because the Supreme Court hears only a few cases each year  for many citizens seeking justice  the D C  Circuit is the court of last resort   Mr  Griffith s record raises concerns about his position on civil rights  He has proposed what he admits is a radical change in the interpretation of Title IX  the landmark law against gender discrimination in education  As a member of the Department of Education s Title IX Commission  he suggested eliminating the well established three part test for measuring compliance with Title IX   That test has been in place since 1979  and has revolutionized opportunities for women in sports  Every federal court of appeals that has considered the issue has approved the test  and every Administration  Democratic and Republican alike  has agreed that the test is valid  and not a quota   Yet Mr  Griffith pushed the Commission to eliminate the test as illegal  He argued that all numerical tests are illegal  unfair  and wrong  a view that is plainly inconsistent with established interpretations of Title IX and many other civil rights laws  It s vital that anyone confirmed to a life time position as a federal judge demonstrate a firm commitment to the rights of all Americans and to the nation s progress on civil rights  women s rights  and individual liberties   Mr  Griffith s nomination also raises other troubling issues  I can t recall any other judicial nominees who failed to comply with requirements of the bar association where they practiced law  or whose records raised serious questions about whether they had been involved in the unauthorized practice of law  These are grave matters  and the Committee has a duty to consider them carefully   Mr  Griffith allowed his D C  bar membership to lapse for three consecutive years while he practiced law in the District of Columbia  resulting in his suspension for non payment of dues  We also know that  in May 2003  the Utah Bar advised him to take the state bar exam  because he was practicing law as General Counsel for Brigham Young University  Yet Mr  Griffith never joined the Utah bar  although he continues to practice law in that state   Mr  Griffith also gave a false answer  under oath  to the question on a Utah Bar application of whether he had ever been suspended as an attorney  He denied ever having been suspended despite two suspensions from the D C  Bar  the second lasting three years   The American people have a right to know how Mr  Griffith would rule in cases involving Title IX and other civil rights laws  They have a right to a full explanation of Mr  Griffiths failure to obey the basic rules for practicing law  These issues were not resolved in Mr  Griffith s previous hearing  and I hope today s hearing will provide better answers to these important questions  I look forward to this hearing and to Mr  Griffith s explanations       THOMAS GRIFFITH NOMINEE TO THE U S  COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D C  CIRCUIT  Thomas Griffith is a graduate of Brigham Young University  1979  and the University of Virginia Law School  1985   He was engaged in private practice as an associate in the N C  firm of Robinson  Bradshaw  Hinson  1985 1989   and later as an associate and then a partner at Wiley  Rein  Fielding  1989 1995   before becoming Senate Legal Counsel  1995 1999   He returned to Wiley  Rein  Fielding in 1999  where he remained until becoming Assistant to President and General Counsel of Brigham Young University in 2000   Failure to take the Utah Bar Exam and to Pay Required Bar Dues  Thomas Griffith has repeatedly failed to maintain a law license in jurisdictions where he practiced  revealing  at best  carelessness about the basic rules that govern the conduct of all lawyers    Griffith admits that for three years beginning in 1998  he failed to pay D C  Bar dues and was suspended from membership in the D C  bar  During this time  he was practicing law in D C  including signing pleadings filed in court   Griffith admits that although he has practiced law in Utah since becoming General Counsel of Brigham Young University in 2000  he never took the Utah bar  He has had several opportunities to take the bar exam since moving to Utah  and the Utah Bar advised him to take the exam in 2003    As Griffith acknowledges  Utah law forbids the practice of law in Utah without first joining the Utah Bar   Hostility to Basic Interpretations of Title IX  a Landmark Law Against Sex Discrimination in Education   As a member of the Department of Education s Commission on Opportunity in Athletics  Title IX Commission  created in 2002  Griffith supported the Title IX Commission s harmful recommendations  which were eventually rejected by the Bush Administration    While serving on the Title IX Commission  Griffith made what he admits was a radical proposal to eliminate the substantial proportionality test for Title IX compliance  which has been upheld by every federal court of appeals that has considered it  This test allows educational institutions to comply with Title IX by offering athletic opportunities  spots on teams  to male and female students that are in substantial proportion to each gender s representation in the student body   Griffith s proposal was rejected by the conservative Commission by a vote of 11 to 4  However  legal issues related to Title IX will continue to come before the courts  including the D C  Circuit
