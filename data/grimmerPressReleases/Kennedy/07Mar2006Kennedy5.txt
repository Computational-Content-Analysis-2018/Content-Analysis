         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senate Democrats introduced The Small Employers Health Benefits Program  SEHBP   legislation to give small businesses affordable choices among private health insurance plans and expand access to health care coverage for their employees The Senators announced that SEHBP will be offered as the Democratic alternative to the Republican health insurance bill scheduled for consideration in the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee on Wednesday  The Small Employers Health Benefits Program  SEHBP  would allow small businesses across America to band together for lower health care prices by pooling their purchasing power and spreading their risk over a large number of participants  Employers would qualify for an annual tax credit to partially offset contributions on behalf of low income employees Senator Edward Kennedy  Ranking Democrat on the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  said  I believe that health care should be a right   not a privilege    in this country  The Democratic plan would give small businesses the same health care plans to choose from that members of Congress and federal employees have  And in addition to cutting costs by allowing small businesses to pool together  our plan would include a reinsurance program and tax credits to help lower premium costs  The Republican plan is really a wolf in sheep s clothing  harming millions of Americans by taking away their benefits and raising their premiums  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  the lead sponsor of the bill  said  The high cost of health insurance is the top concern for small businesses in Illinois and across America  The Small Business Health Benefits Plan will give employees of small businesses the same kinds of health care choices Members of Congress already have  for less than they pay now  while making it affordable for owners to provide it  With 46 million uninsured Americans  SEHBP is a lifeline to millions of workers who are without affordable  quality health insurance  U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D AR  said  The crisis of ever escalating health care costs is getting worse  Lincoln said  Many small business owners in my home state of Arkansas have been forced to drop or dramatically reduce health insurance for their employees  even though they desperately want to offer it  Our small employers know that offering health insurance helps them with recruitment  retention  employee performance  and the overall success of the business  This is something I firmly believe Congress should address right now  Our bill would help our small businesses  the true backbone of our communities  and it would allow us to begin to address the very real needs of the working uninsured  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  D NV  noted  As we look at ways to address the health care crisis to help Americans struggling with the increased costs of health care  we must provide meaningful access to affordable  comprehensive coverage  Unlike the Bush administration and Bush Republican approach  the SEHBP offers a real solution to small businesspeople  The SEHBP is modeled after the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  FEHBP   which has offered more than eight million government employees and retirees  including members of Congress and their staffs  a wide range of private health insurance choices for more than 40 years  SEHBP would give employees of small businesses access to a comparable range of private health plans  More than 45 million Americans lack health insurance  while millions of others pay very high premiums to get coverage  This legislation takes common sense steps that will help small business owners afford health insurance for themselves and their employees  said Senator Bingaman  D NM   a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  Small businesses are the engine of our economy  employing more than half of all private sector employees  However  these employers too often can t afford to provide healthcare for their employees  Our legislation will make it easier and more affordable for small businesses to offer healthcare benefits to their employees  putting us one step closer to the goal of expanding access to quality  affordable healthcare to all Americans  said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY    Laura Capps  Kennedy   202 22402633
