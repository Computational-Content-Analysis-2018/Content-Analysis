         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to the passage by the United States House of Representatives of the FDA Reauthorization bill      This bill will help every single American every single day as it is about the safety of all of our food and our prescription drugs  Hardly a day goes by without a new report of American families put at risk by unsafe foods  improperly tested imports  or dangerous side effects of powerful prescription drugs  FDA should be the gold standard for assuring the safety of American families  but that standard has become dangerously tarnished  The legislation that the House approves today will help FDA once again do the job that American consumers are counting on it to do to protect their health      This bill will give FDA urgently needed new resources  strengthen FDA s ability to protect consumers from dangerous drugs  provide important incentives to develop drugs for children  safeguard the food we give our families and feed to our pets  help reduce the cost of medicine by ending abusive practices that deny consumers access to generic drugs  and address many other urgent priorities that face the nation      This is not a perfect bill  and compromises were made to assure its passage  I am particularly disappointed that the House rejected two important measures in the pediatric program  by failing to make permanent the authority to require clinical studies for pediatric populations  and by not including measures to see that rewards for pharmaceutical companies were proportionate to the expenditures required  But after so many recent instances in which Americans have been harmed by unsafe prescription drugs and contaminated food  America cannot afford inaction on this important measure           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
