         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senators Edward Kennedy  Johnny Isakson and Susan Collins introduced legislation to make clear that federal workers who rely on physician assistants and nurse practitioners for their medical care are eligible for compensation for the care under the existing workers compensation law for federal employers Currently  many federal workers who seek care from nurses practitioners and physicians assistants  often because they do not have easy access to physicians  find that their treatments are not covered under the law  Senator Kennedy said  Federal workers deserve a compensation system that works for them if theyre injured on the job  The current law obviously isnt adequate to protect many federal workers who care for our national parks  screen baggage at airports  and provide a wide range of other services across the country  The legislation we are introducing today will ensure that these men and women who serve our government every day will be reimbursed for the care they receive from the professionals they know and trust       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
