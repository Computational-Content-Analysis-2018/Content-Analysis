         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Yesterday Americans rejected the politics of fear and sent a loud and clear message that they want a new direction for this country  including comprehensive immigration reform   Our reform plan has earned the support of religious  labor and business leaders and the millions of people from across the political spectrum who marched in the streets demanding action   The Republican leadership in the House wrongly turned a blind eye to progress for the sake of their own job security    But now    with a new Congress  we have an opportunity to pass a tough but fair plan that secures our borders  upholds our laws  and strengthens our economy I am glad that President Bush recognizes this opportunity and I urge him to recommit his efforts with members of his party so that we can enact a bill that will solve the problem once and for all   LAURA CAPPS   202 224 2633
