         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today Senator Kennedy and twenty of his colleagues in the House and Senate sent a letter to Speaker Hastert and Majority Leader Frist to express their disapproval of the tactic that was used to slip in a damaging provision on vaccine liability  Senators Kennedy  Dodd  and Harkin introduced a bill that would repeal the deeply flawed provision  and enact in its place a measure to give pharmaceutical companies and medical professionals appropriate liability on a targeted set of vaccines and other countermeasures    while ensuring that injured patients are properly compensated  Today s letter urges the Republican leadership to repeal their measure  for the sake of the health and well being of all Americans  To prevent this kind of stealth action  Democrats have included a provision in the Honest Leadership Act that would require that all conference committee meetings be open to the public and that members of the conference committee have a public opportunity to vote on all amendments  It would also make copies of conference reports available to Members  and post them publicly on the Internet  24 hours before consideration  unless waived by a supermajority vote  Below is the text of the letter and a fact sheet on the Kennedy Dodd Harkin bill  A PDF of the letter with signatures and the bill is available upon request  February 15  2006   The Honorable Bill Frist  M D     The Honorable J  Dennis Hastert Majority Leader      Speaker  U S  Senate       U S  House of Representatives 509 Hart Senate Office Building    235 Cannon House Office Building Washington  DC 20510     Washington DC 20515   Dear Speaker Hastert and Majority Leader Frist    All of us share the goal of seeing that the nation is properly prepared for an influenza pandemic or a biological attack  Effective planning and adequate funding are both indispensable elements of preparedness     We must also see that concerns about possible litigation do not deter responsible manufacturers from supplying vaccines and other drugs to our national stockpile  or dissuade medical practitioners from administering them to patients  An essential element of any program to limit the legal liability of manufacturers and medical professionals must be an effective and properly funded compensation program for patients injured by these products    Many of us worked closely with our colleagues in the majority to develop a bipartisan proposal to meet this national need  We are deeply concerned that a stealth provision to shield manufacturers from responsibility for making faulty drugs and vaccines was included in the Defense Appropriations Act without Congressional debate or public scrutiny    Legislation of such significance should have been debated in the open  not sneaked into a larger bill behind closed doors as a favor to special interests  Doing so without the approval of the members of a House Senate conference committee was  in the words of Thomas Mann of the Brooking Institution  a travesty of the legislative process    The provision included in the bill is not limited to vaccines for pandemic flu or other major threats to the nation s health  but could instead be used to allow manufacturers of virtually any drug or vaccine to escape responsibility for gross negligence or even criminal acts  The provision fails the basic test of fairness by including only an empty shell of a compensation program for injured patients with none of the funding needed to make compensation a reality    To correct this serious violation of Congressional procedures  we urge you to schedule immediate action on legislation to repeal this deeply flawed provision  and enact in its place a measure to give pharmaceutical companies and medical professionals appropriate liability protection while ensuring that injured patients are properly compensated  Signed by  Senator Edward M  Kennedy Senator Christopher J  Dodd Senator Patrick J  Leahy Senator Carl Levin Senator Jack Reed Senator Barbara A  Mikulski Senatory Patty Murray Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Senator Daniel K  Akaka Senator Dianne Feinstein Senator Ron Wyden Senator Mark Dayton Senator Barbara Boxer Senator Tom Harkin Senator Russell D  Feingold Senator Debbie Stabenow Representative John D  Dingell Representative David R  Obey Representative Lois Capps Representative Henry Waxman   The Responsible  Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2006   Background When faced with the threat of smallpox  the nation s health experts recommended that health care workers be vaccinated  Congress provided indemnification for those who manufactured and administered the vaccine  which had not undergone FDA clearance using modern procedures  The limited circumstances that made this policy advisable in the case of smallpox may recur if  for example  a pandemic strain of flu hits the United States and the only available vaccine has not been cleared for use under full FDA review procedures  yet HHS recommends that people receive the vaccine  Under these circumstances  it is advisable to provide a targeted indemnification for those who make and administer the vaccine  provided that patients who suffer injury are compensated     The Republican Approach   Blanket Immunity with a Fig Leaf of Compensation    Instead  in the conference report on the Defense Appropriations bill passed in December 2005  Republicans inserted at the last minute the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act  This Act provides a broad immunity for pandemic flu vaccines  other countermeasures  and a broad class of other products  including products that have received full FDA approvals and are used everyday by patients  The compensation program provided is one in name only  because the established fund has absolutely no money appropriated into it  As a result  the Republican plan will fail to protect the American people  It provides protection to a manufacturer even if its product is ineffective or unsafe  and offers no help to patients injured by a countermeasure    Broad immunity Republicans gave drug companies and those who administer a countermeasure effectively complete immunity from suit for injuries caused by the countermeasure when it is named in a declaration by the Secretary of Health and Human Services  A countermeasure can include any medical product to prevent  treat  mitigate  or diagnose an epidemic  Diabetes  obesity  methamphetamine addiction  and arthritis are considered epidemics  so products such as Vioxx could get complete immunity protection under the bill  and a court could not review the decision     Limit on immunity  bad actors  An injured person can break the immunity only by providing clear and convincing evidence that the drug company or the person who administered the medical product  the bad actor  acted with willful misconduct  This standard will be essentially impossible to meet    Willful misconduct includes only acts or omissions taken  intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose   knowingly without legal or factual justification  and  in disregard of known or obvious risks that are so great as to make it highly probable that the harm will outweigh the benefit  Gross negligence and recklessness are excluded  The Secretary of Health and Human Services must amend the definition of willful misconduct by regulation  but only to make it narrower    An administrator  such as doctor  can act with willful misconduct and may still be immune if it reports the injury within 7 days  A drug manufacturer can act with willful misconduct and is still immune unless FDA initiates and wins an enforcement action against it  Injured persons must meet extraordinary hurdles to bring a lawsuit  including bringing the suit in Washington  DC  heightened pleading requirements  very limited discovery  and special appeal rights for drug companies    Compensation The compensation program includes no funding  and drug companies receive immunity even when the drug is administered to the wrong person  but that person is denied compensation  Past experience has demonstrated that  in the absence of a compensation program  first responders will refuse to be vaccinated    The Democratic Alternative   Real Compensation and Targeted Indemnification   The Democratic alternative  the Responsible Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2006  repeals the Republican approach and replaces it with a responsible alternative  It will protect the American people by offering an incentive to manufacturers to make safe and effective countermeasures  while encouraging first responders  health care workers  and ordinary citizens to take these medicines in the event of a pandemic flu or infectious disease outbreak or a bioterror attack    The bill provides a limited liability protection for a limited set of countermeasures  and a fully funded compensation program modeled on the successful Vaccine Injury Compensation Program     Indemnification  not immunity Manufacturers of  and those who administer  certain countermeasures  including pandemic flu vaccine  are indemnified by the Federal government  In other words  injured patients may sue the Federal government in Federal court to pursue claims of negligence  strict liability  failure to warn  or malpractice  Patients will not be able to sue companies or doctors who administer these indemnified countermeasures    A targeted set of products Indemnification is available only where  1  the product has not undergone full FDA testing and  2  the product is recommended for use by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in a declaration  Products for epidemics like diabetes  obesity  and arthritis cannot be given the liability protection     Real compensation Any injured patient for an indemnified countermeasure will also be able to seek compensation through a program modeled after the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program  whether or not there is negligence involved  Claims against the government under both the indemnification program and the compensation program are paid for the same way claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act are paidno additional appropriations are required     Accountability The government can sue a manufacturer or doctor who was grossly negligent or reckless to recover payments made to injured patients under the indemnification or compensation programs      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224
