         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Money isn t everything  but it s a measure of a nation s priorities  Budgets are moral documents  They represent who we are  and what we value  Just six weeks ago  the President delivered a State of the Union Address that gave hope to many of us in Congress for a budget that meets the needs of the American people  The President told us that night that a hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency    and stays at it until they re back on their feet  But the budget before us tells a different story  It fails to meet our security needs  Americans are looking for real security in the face of terrorism  We ve seen a failed response to Hurricane Katrina  failure in Iraq  a failing grade from the 9 11 Commission  failure on the security of our ports  failure in curbing nuclear power in Iran and North Korea    failure after failure when it comes to our national security  But you would never know it from this budget  Does it prepare us for the next disaster  Does it support a winning strategy in Iraq  Does it fully invest in the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission  Does it secure our ports and inspect every shipping container crossing our shores  When it comes to nuclear weapons  does it provide the resources needed for real nonproliferation The answer to each one of these questions is no  The Administration and Republicans may talk about national security  But the real record is one of mistake and failure  This budget is a failure  too  when it comes to meeting the needs of our families here at home  When it comes to healing the sick  helping the poor  feeding the hungry  caring for the poor  the elderly  or the disabled  this budget falls short  When it comes to strengthening our economy  opening the doors of opportunity  creating new jobs  and equipping America to compete in the global economy  this budget again falls short  Instead  it cuts vital programs that people rely on  and offers even more tax cuts to the wealthy  Franklin Roosevelt had it right  The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much  he said  It is whether we provide enough for those who have too little  This budget does none of that  Countless families are facing serious problems  They re being hit on all sides with higher health costs  higher heating costs  higher college costs  and higher gas prices  Their jobs and their pensions are in danger  Their savings are at an all time low  They re caught in a prescription drug nightmare because of a bill that put the drug industry and the insurance industry ahead of patients  These are hard working men and women who play by the rules and take care of their families  but this budget lets them down  Instead of investing in education  it cuts school programs  Instead of helping the elderly with their heating bills  it slashes funding for low income heating programs  Instead of training workers for new jobs  it eliminates job training and vocational education programs  Instead of helping our young people afford college  it cuts college aid  But it provides for  1 7 trillion in tax cuts over ten years  Those are the wrong priorities for America  Compare that to recent cuts to Medicaid  Compare that with the  379 million cut in heating assistance for the poor  Compare that with cuts to education  Compare that with the  456 million needed to help disadvantaged high school students reach college under the TRIO Upward Bound and Talent Search programs  Compare that with the  630 million needed to fund essential anti poverty programs through the Community Services Block Grant HEALTH A budget is a statement of priorities  and we have seen where this Administration s priorities are on health  Time and again  this Administration and its allies in Congress have put the needs of the special interests in the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry above those of patients  The Republican Medicare bill forced seniors into confusing private drug plans instead of the Medicare program they know and trust  The budget legislation enacted earlier this year made massive cuts to Medicaid  The budget submitted to Congress compounds these errors with major reductions in Medicare  Medicaid and essential health programs  Let me describe each of these irresponsible proposals  and the harm they will do to patients  The Medicaid program is key to promoting a real culture of life in America  Medicaid provides care to a third of all mothers giving birth  including the prenatal and pediatric care their children need to be healthy Mere hours after the President had declared in the State of the Union Address that the government would meet its responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly  the President signed a bill to impose draconian cuts on the Medicaid program  According to CBO  that bill will cause 45 000 poor Americans to lose coverage over the next five years  and 65 000 will lose coverage within 10 years  About 60 percent of those losing coverage will be children  Because of these Medicaid cuts  13 million Medicaid beneficiaries will have to pay more for their prescriptions over the next five years  and 20 million will have to pay more over the next ten years  We know what happens when low income Americans are forced to pay more for their health care    they go without needed care  or lose coverage entirely  That s not a theory    it s fact  In Maryland  a quarter of families subject to increased premiums for Medicaid disenrolled  In Oregon  higher costs caused disenrollment  and 67 percent of those who disenrolled became uninsured When co payments rise for the poorest patients  health declines  A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that increased co payments for medications for poor families caused an 88 percent increase in adverse events  such as heart attacks and strokes  and caused a 78 percent increase in emergency room visits  When Texas forced CHIP enrollees to make higher payments  coverage declined dramatically  But this debate is not about statistics    it s about the impact that these reductions will have on people A single mother with two children  who makes  8 an hour  currently pays  3 when she visits the doctors and does not have any cost sharing when her children go to the pediatrician  Under the new law  when her child goes to the pediatrician with an ear infection  she may be charged  20  When she goes to a doctor for treatment and tests for diabetes  she will be charged  50  She will have to pay as much as  832 a year  A single mother with 2 children earning  25 000 a year now pays no premiums or cost sharing for her children s medical care and pays  3 co payments for herself  Under the new law  she will now be charged monthly premiums for Medicaid coverage for herself and her children  Even if she manages to pay the premiums  she may now have to pay  40 for a pediatrician visit  and she will have to pay as much as  1 250 a year for Medicaid  For a single mother of two earning minimum wage  the new Medicaid law imposes additional cost sharing on her children  They would now face co payments for certain prescription drugs    and these co payments would for the first time be indexed to the rate of medical inflation  which is higher than general inflation  And on minimum wage  her income won t even keep up with inflation since the minimum wage hasn t increased since 1997  To add to these damaging reductions  the President s budget proposes another  14 billion in reductions to Medicaid The Senate budget resolution has not adopted these serious cuts  but time and again  we have seen how House Senate conference reports follow the Administration s proposal rather than the Senate measure  The President s budget also proposes  36 billion in Medicare cuts over the next five years and  105 billion over the next ten years  This means higher premiums for seniors and the disabled and will result in reductions in the quality of care at hospitals and home health agencies  In Massachusetts  President Bush s Medicare proposals will mean that our hospitals will have to cut their budgets by more than  400 million  home health agencies by  50 million and nursing homes by  150 million Again  the Senate resolution has not adopted these reductions  but we know where the conference report is likely to end up  In addition  the budget resolution includes a deeply troubling procedural barrier to fixing the problems in the Medicare drug program  The Republican budget effectively torpedoes any sensible measure to improve the benefit provided to seniors by requiring any such improvements to overcome a point of order  The budget resolution tries to convince us that the cuts in public health programs have been avoided  but no sleight of hand should be allowed to conceal the truth  Essential public health programs from disease prevention to medical research will see massive cuts For many years  Congress has been committed to investments in NIH research  But President and Republican majority have abandoned that pledge by reducing funds for life saving medical research for the last three years  This year  the President wants to keep the NIH budget flat for the second year in a row  That hasn t happened in more than half a century 18 of the 19 NIH institutes will suffer cuts compared to the rate of inflation  which means that NIH will fall behind in the race for new cures  Research projects on cancer  heart disease  mental health  diabetes will be abandoned  We don t yet know what the House will do  but I fear that their cuts to life saving medical research will be even more draconian than President Bush s While the NIH budget languishes  other countries are increasing their investment in research  India  for example  just announced a 16  increase in its RD programs  much of which will be devoted to the life sciences  It s not just medical research that will suffer  Programs at CDC and other public health agencies have been cut back or eliminated entirely  Again  don t let anyone tell you that these reductions won t have real consequences  Under these reductions  Massachusetts would lose millions of dollars for programs that protect the health and safety of our people  The cuts meant that 17 rape crisis centers across the state would face significant financial hardship  and our programs on violence prevention and suicide would be eliminated  The cuts mean that programs to keep our children healthy would be eliminated  Programs to screen newborns as early as possible for hearing loss would be eliminated and so would our state oral health program  Although we are living with the threat of natural and man made disaster  the proposed cuts would compromise our state Emergency Medical Services and impair the systems ability to function as a safety net for catastrophe The President proposed to slash funding for international family planning and reproductive health programs by  80 million  a worldwide cut of 20 percent  A culture of life should help women to deliver and raise healthy babies  Instead  cuts in these programs will result in more unintended pregnancies  The world s poorest women and families will suffer because of these reductions based in ideology and not science Achieving a vision of a more just and fair America means more than holding on to the hard won gains of the past  The basic test of any budget is whether it takes action to secure a better future    and this budget fails that test  It includes no real proposals to stop the increase in the rising numbers of Americans without health care coverage    much less to achieve assured access to health care for all Americans  There is only the empty gesture of a reserve fund with no funding  which is constrained to provide no net increase in our investment to guarantee health care for all Americans  I hear my Republican colleagues speak often of a culture of personal responsibility    but where is their sense of responsibility for the fact that the number of the uninsured has increased by 6 million since the year President Bush was elected  This budget should make serious proposals to see that the 46 million Americans who lack health insurance entirely    and the millions more who are under insured    can look forward to the day when America sees health care as a right  not a privilege  Where is the personal responsibility to admit that the Medicare drug program is flawed  and that this budget should take steps to improve it  This budget should be a first step to a stronger America for seniors  but again it fails the test by shirking the responsibility of improving the Medicare drug benefit  America can do better  The Senate should have the opportunity to consider a budget that moves our nation forward to a day when every American    whether rich or poor  rural or urban  young or old    can be assured of quality health care  Sadly  this budget fails to make the progress that Americans deserve EDUCATION  This Budget Resolution also fails to make education a priority  In this shrinking world  education is an even greater priority than ever before  Our budget should reflect that  As a nation  we must invest in Americans by ensuring access to the highest quality educational opportunities  We must make the American worker and manager the best educated  best trained  and most sophisticated in the world  We need to nourish the capacities of every person in the nation In his State of the Union address  the President acknowledged the important role of education in maintaining our ability to compete in a shrinking world economy  Yet the President s budget proposes the biggest cut to education in the 26 year history of the Department of Education The Senate Resolution we are debating this week claims to add  1 5 billion for special education over the President s numbers  but it is a shell game because the overall funds available under this budget matches the President s  If we are serious about education  we need to commit new resources to it Even if we assume this increase for special education is real  this Budget Resolution is  4 8 billion short of the level Congress agreed to when the program was reauthorized in 2004  It is time for Congress to live up to its promises to disabled students and our nation s schools To be successful in the 21st century global economy  we must begin by ensuring our youngest students are ready to learn  Research shows that every  1 invested in high quality early education yields a  13 public benefit  yet this resolution provides no increase in Head Start funding  not even to cover inflation  This means 19 000 children will be eliminated from Head Start classrooms  and hundreds of thousands who are eligible for services will not be enrolled  In Massachusetts  15 000 eligible preschoolers will be without services Our ability to compete also depends on leaving no child behind  yet the promises in the law have been underfunded to the tune of  55 7 billion under President Bush His 2007 budget    and the budget pending before us    flat funds Title I grants to school districts  leaving 3 7 million children without the services promised under the law This budget is  12 3 billion less than the amount promised when we passed the Act Under this budget resolution  29 states will lose Title I funding  including Massachusetts  and another seven will be flat funded  We can t reform education without the resources needed to pay for the reforms  Promises alone won t provide the qualified teachers  high standards in every classroom  good after school activities  and the range of supplemental services that every good school needs if it s to provide the right help for students who need it  More than ever  schools are struggling to make adequate yearly progress  implement new standards  and phase in new assessments under the No Child Left Behind Act  More than ever  they need the resources promised by the President and Congress to meet these challenges Our ability to compete depends on helping all students build skills through career and technical education and improving access to college  Yet this budget assumes cuts to job training programs and elimination of Perkins vocational education  GEAR UP  TRIO Upward Bound and Talent Search These programs work  Let me give you just one example  Maria Loza  a GEAR Up student since the 7th grade  attended East Boston High School  Through GEAR Up  she received tutoring for school work and the SAT  and she visited college campuses and learned about the programs different colleges offer  She was so impressed by her experience that she became a GEAR Up tutor herself  Maria says  Everyone who worked in GEAR Up was a positive influenceGEAR Up gave me confidence and never doubted the fact that I could be valedictorian  Their kindness and help has countered the negativity I ve seen in my short life and I am indebted to them  Maria now attends Boston University on a full scholarship  Our ability to compete depends on ensuring cost is not a barrier to getting a college degree  yet this Resolution proposes no increase in the Pell grant In his campaigns  President Bush pledged to increase the maximum Pell grant to  5 100  but his budget would leave it frozen at  4 050 for the fifth year in a row    as the cost of college has continued to rise  Since the President took office  the gap between the cost of attendance at a 4 year public college and the maximum Pell grant has increased from  5 282 to  8 077  In the current school year  the maximum Pell covers only a third of the cost of going to college On two separate occasions last year  the Senate voted to immediately increase the maximum grant for Pell recipients to  4 500  Twice  this proposal was rejected by Republican conferees  Instead  in a back room deal  they cooked up a misguided plan that leaves 90  of Pell recipients without an extra nickel of aid  In Massachusetts  over 70 000 students are left with no additional assistance Later in this debate  I will offer an amendment    with my colleague Senator Menendez    that will ensure an increase in the Pell grant and provide increases in other programs that help Americans can afford to go to college and attain the American Dream Every student ready for college should have that opportunity From our earliest days as a nation  education has been the engine of the American dream  and we can t let it stall  We can give children  parents  schools  communities and states the support they need to re fuel this unique engine and keep our country great in the years ahead This budget should embrace this challenge and reflect the nation s priorities  I hope as this debate progresses my colleagues in the Senate will join me to make this happen   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
