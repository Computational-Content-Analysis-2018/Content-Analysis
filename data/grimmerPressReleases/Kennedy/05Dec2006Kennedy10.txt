         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today Senator Kennedy announced that his proposal for the Ryan White Modernization Act has been accepted by the bipartisan negotiators  clearing the way for final passage this year  Kennedys proposal    which has ended the stalemate    would take the current reauthorization bill and limit to a three year reauthorization  in order to leave stable the care delivery systems while the structure of the program is truly re vamped to reflect the disease of 2007  The bipartisan  bicameral bill reflects the balance of protecting our nations established systems of health care for those living with HIV and Aids and directing more resources to areas experiencing an increase in the disease  After two and a half years of negotiations  Kennedy is determined to reauthorize the bill this year After years and years of negotiations  this final proposal clears the way for reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act this year so that all people living with HIV AIDS will get the care and services they need to live long and productive lives  Senator Kennedy said  We must pass this bill now  it is about more than just money and health care services  its about caring and the American tradition of reaching out to people who are facing health challenges and in need of support Below are the details of Senator Kennedys proposal  1  Maintain funding levels of Title 1 and Title 2 at 95  of the previous year  but never allow funding to fall below 95  of what states and cities received in 2006 so it keeps the hold harmless for the length of the reauthorization 2  Counts all people with HIV for funding no matter where they live or how the data is packaged 3  Maintains the targeted funding pool for pharmaceuticals and therapeutics  instead of running out of money paying for hold harmless provisions which would happen if we continue with current law4  Includes an absolute repeal of the law after the 3 years so it forces the issue of restructuring to meet the needs of those living with the disease now 5  Expects HHS to continue to develop a framework to look at severity of need and to report their progress in 2008 6  Maintains 4 years of transition time for code states to switch to names without being penalized   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
