         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today we turn our attention to the important task of keeping the hardworking men and women of America safer on the job  I commend Senator Murray for holding this hearing and taking a lead on these issues that are vital to the safety and health of Americas workers  We plan a number of hearings this year on worker safety and healthweve already had hearings on the health effects of the 9 11 terrorist attacks  and Senator Murray has convened hearings on the dangers of asbestos and domestic violence in the workplace  We also will continue to work on mine safety  an issue we worked closely on with Senator Enzi and Senator Isakson last year  with the passage of the MINER Act  On Saturday  the nation observes Workers Memorial Day the anniversary of the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970  Its a time to remember and honor the workers who have died or been injured on the job  Its also a time to look to the future and work to strengthen the nations workplace safety and health laws Under OSHA  weve made significant progress  Since 1970  according to the National Safety Council and the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the overall job fatality rate has been reduced by 78 percent  In manufacturing  the fatality rate dropped by 73 percent and the injury rate by 59 percent  In construction  the fatality rate declined by 84 percent and the injury rate by 68 percent  The adoption of standardslike those for confined spaces  dangerous equipment  and grain dusthave prevented thousands of unnecessary deaths and illnesses  But even today  significant numbers of workers are still not safe  In 2005  over 5 700 workers were killed on the job  and over 4 million workers became ill or were injured  Thats 16 workers who die every day  and nearly 12 000 who are injured or become ill from dangerous conditions on the job  Some groups are at greater risk  Hispanic workers are almost 20 percent more likely to be killed on the job  Many of them are immigrants who do not know their rights  and do not receive safety training or protective equipment  This is an issue that we also need to bear in mind as we look at comprehensive immigration reform  Exploitation of the most vulnerable workers puts all workers at risk  These statistics represent real workers and their families  They include men like Emanuel Torres Gomez  Emanuel and his three brothers lost their father when he was killed in a dryer at a laundry processing plant in Oklahoma  The company knew it was putting workers lives at risk by failing to provide guardrails  but it did nothing  They include daughters like Michele Lewis  whose step father  Mike  lost his life in a trench collapse in Florida  The company failed to follow OSHA safety standards that would have saved his life  These families and thousands like them every year lose parents  sons  and daughters in preventable workplace tragedies  One reason is that companies blatantly ignore the law  but are rarely held accountable  Criminal penalties are so low that prosecutors dont pursue these cases  Employers who repeatedly violate the law pay only minimal fines  which they treat as just another cost of doing business  Our health and safety laws need to be strengthened so that fewer workers feel the pain that people like Michele and Emanuel have suffered  OSHA must do more to stop serious safety violations before  not after  workers are injured or killed  It needs to develop better standards for old hazards  and new standards for new hazards posed by new technologies and new chemicals  The record shows that when OSHA issues new standards and enforces them  lives are saved  Yet over the last six years  needed safety standards have languished  unfinished  It is time for swift action on strong regulations to protect Americas workers  Many serious issues face us as we try to make American workers safer on the job  We have an impressive group of panelists today and I look forward to hearing from them       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
