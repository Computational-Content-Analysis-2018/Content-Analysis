         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  today  on Workers  Memorial Day  we remember and honor the working men and women here at home who have died or been injured on the job in the past year  We also think of their families and the losses they have suffered  And we pledge to do more to end the unsafe and unhealthy conditions that still plague so many workplaces across America  Thirty five years have now passed since the enactment of the Occupational Safety and Health Act in 1970  and that basic law has made an immense difference in the safety of our nation s workers  The rate of fatalities  injuries  and illnesses has dropped year after yeara 78  reduction in the rate of workplace deaths and a 52  reduction in the rate of workplace related injuries and illnesses since the law was passed  and the reductions have been even greater in industries that OSHA has targeted in its standards and enforcement activities     But we still have a long way to go  There are still too many workers being hurt on the job  An average of 15 workers are killed and 12 000 more are injured every single day  That s over 5 500 worker deaths and 4 4 million worker injuries a year  In Massachusetts  72 workers died from traumatic injuries on the job in 2004 and over 600 died from occupational disease     These numbers represent real workers and their families  They represent fathers like Jeff Walters  His son Patrick was killed when a trench in Ohio caved in three years agoat a company with a history of safety violations  They include people like Ron Hayes  who also lost his son in a workplace accident  Since then  he and his wife Dot have made safety their cause and done a great deal to help families whose lives have been hurt by these deaths including deaths that in many cases could  and should have been prevented     Ron and Jeff asked us to prevent this from happening to other families  That s why I am introducing this billto fight for families like the Walters and the Hayes  and to do everything we can to see that other families don t have to suffer the same grief  Many companies are doing too little to deal with this challenge  They blatantly ignore the law  but they are rarely held accountable  even when their actions or neglect kill loyal employees who work for them  Offenders never go to jail  Criminal penalties are so low that prosecutors don t pursue these cases  Employers who violate safety laws again and again pay only minimal fines    they treat them as just another cost of doing business  We cannot allow these shameful practices to continue  These companies are putting millions of workers at risk in factories  construction sites  nursing homes  and many other workplaces every day  We also need to hold this Administration accountable for improving worker safety and enforcing the safety laws  We should require OSHA to do more to stop serious safety violations before they can hurt or kill workers  instead of sweeping them under the rug  We also need to protect workers with the courage to speak out against health and safety violations in the workplace  The most glaring flaw in current law is that too many workers are left uncovered  The Protecting America s Workers Act will extend the scope of the Occupational Safety and Health Act to cover 8 million public employees and millions of transportation and other workers  In addition  the bill imposes jail timeup to ten years  instead of only six months under current law   on those whose blatant violation of safety laws leads to a worker s death  Incredibly  under current law  it is only a misdemeanorpunishable by 6 months in jail for an employer to cause a worker s death through willfully violating our safety and health laws  In fact  we impose sentences twice that long for acts like harassing a wild burro on federal lands  Our laws should reflect our serious commitment to protecting workers  safety  instead of letting violators off with a slap on the wrist  We also increase civil penalties  to provide additional deterrence against employers  We require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to investigate more cases  We give workers and their families more rights in the investigation  and provide stronger protections for workers who report health or safety violations  I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting for safe workplaces for all of America s workers  The promise of OSHA is waiting to be fulfilled  The best way for Congress to honor the nation s dedicated working men and women on this Worker s Memorial Day is to end our complacency and see that the full promise of OSHA becomes a genuine reality for every working family in every community in America     PROTECTING AMERICA S WORKERS ACT     The Occupational Safety and Health Act  OSHA  was passed 34 years ago  Although we have come a long way toward our goal of providing every American worker a safe working environment  there is still much to do     Too many workers are being injured or even killed on the job  An average of 15 workers are killed and 12 055 workers are injured every single day  That s over 5 500 worker deaths and 4 4 million worker injuries per year  And some workers are particularly at riskHispanic workers are over 12  more likely to be killed on the job than other workers     There are still too many workers who are not covered by OSHA protectionsthere are over 8 4 million state and local public employees who are not covered  and millions more workers in the transportation industry     The Protecting America s Workers Act honors the memory of workers who have died in the workplace and amends OSHA to cover employees who are not protected by current law and to strengthen protections for workers     Give federal and state employees the same protection as other workers   Millions of workers in this country aren t protected by federal health and safety laws   This bill would provide OSHA protections to these workers  which include flight attendants  state correctional officers  and workers in our federal agencies  Provide meaningful penalties when workers are killed or seriously injured because of an employer s willful violations of our health and safety laws   Under current law  it is only a misdemeanor if an employer causes a worker s death through willfully violating our safety and health laws   The Act would make it a felony if an employer killed or seriously injured an employee through repeat and willful violations of our safety and health laws   It updates OSHA s civil penalties  which been unchanged since 1990  and provides a minimum penalty of  50 000 when a worker s death is caused by willful violations of OSHA  Protect the public s right to know about violations by employers   Workers and their families do not have a voice in DOL s handling of OSHA citations   This Act would improve transparency and accountability in the citation process  by    Requiring DOL to investigate all cases of workplace death or serious injury    Giving workers and their families the right to meet with DOL about an investigation of worker injury or death    Requiring companies to tell workers about their protected rights   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
