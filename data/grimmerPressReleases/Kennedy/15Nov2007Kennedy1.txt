         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  I oppose the minority leaders effort to provide yet another blank check to President Bush for his failed Iraq policy      I will support legislation approved yesterday in the House of Representatives requiring the President to begin to bring our combat troops out of Iraq in one month and complete the withdrawal by December of next year  I hope the Senate will support it  And I hope President Bush will sign it into law      Earlier this month  we reached another tragic milestone in Iraq  Weve lost more Americans in Iraq this year than in any other year  Its another painful and somber reminder of the enormous price in precious lives the Iraq war continues to impose  Its long past time for the Administration to change course and end the national nightmare the Iraq war has become      Our military has served nobly in Iraq and done everything we have asked them to do  But they are caught in a continuing quagmire  They are policing a civil war and implementing a policy that is not worthy of their enormous sacrifice     The best way to protect our troops and our national security is to put the Iraqis on notice that they need to take responsibility for their future  so that we can bring our troops back home to America  As long as our military presence in Iraq is open ended  Iraqs leaders are unlikely to make the essential compromises for a political solution     The Administrations misguided policy has put our troops in an untenable and unwinnable situation  They are being held hostage to Iraqi politics  in which sectarian leaders are unable or unwilling to make the difficult judgments needed to lift Iraqi out of its downward spiral      Brig  Gen  John F  Campbell  deputy commanding general of the 1st Cavalry Division in Iraq  spoke with clarity about the shortcomings of Iraqs political leaders  He said The ministers  they dont get outThey dont know what the hell is going on on the ground      Army Lt  Col  Mark Fetter said It is painful  very painful dealing with the obstructionism of Iraqi officials     About conditions on the ground  Army Maj  Gen  Michael Barbero said   its not as good as its being reported now     Yet  the President continues to promise that success is just around the corner  He continues to hold out hope that Iraqs leaders are willing and capable of making essential political compromises necessary for reconciliation     The American people know were spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a failed policy that is making America more vulnerable and putting our troops at greater risk     The toll is devastating     Nearly 4000 American troops have died     Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed or injured  and over four million more have been forced to flee their homes     Nearly half a trillion dollars have been spent fighting this war     Its wrong for Congress to write a blank check to the President for the war  Its obvious that President Bush wants to drag this process out month after month  so he can hand off his Iraqi policy to the next President      Its time to put the brakes on this madness  Its up to us to halt the open ended commitment of our troops that President Bush has been making year after year  We need to tell the Iraqis now that we intend to leave and leave soon  Only by doing so can we create the urgency that is so clearly necessary for them to end their differences     We cant allow the President to drag this process out any longer  This war is his responsibility  and its his responsibility to do all he can to end it  Its wrong for him to pass the buck to his successor  when he knows that thousands more of the courageous members of our armed forces will be wounded or die because of it  Everyday this misguided war goes on  our servicemen and women and their families continue to shoulder the burden and pay the price      If this issue were only about the tragedies of the war  that would be reason enough to end it  But it has become about so much more  Now were also starting to see the fallout here at home as the President refuses to deliver the relief that our families need     Earlier this week the President signed a Defense Appropriations Bill that includes a 10 percent increase in funding compared to last year  But he vetoed a bill that includes an increase half that big that would fund cancer research  investments in our schools  job training  and protections for our workers     That bill included  4 5 billion more than the President proposed for education  He said that  4 5 billion more for students is too much  Yet he has asked for 35 times that much more for the war in Iraq  He wants us to say yes to  158 billion for Iraq while he says no to  4 5 billion for American children     In Iraq  anything goes  The sky is the limit  Billions and billions and billions of dollars for Iraq  But here in America  right here at home  a modest investment in our school children gets a veto     The bill included  3 billion to improve the quality of our teachers      Those funds would have been used to hire 30 000 more teachers and reduce class sizes  They would be used for mentoring 100 000 beginning teachers and professional development for an additional 200 000 teachers  We could do all that for the cost of a single week in Iraq     But the President says no     The bill included  7 billion to provide high quality early education through Head Start      Yesterday  the Senate approved a Head Start bill to strengthen the program and make Head Start even better  Those funds would be used to build a basic foundation for learning that will help low income and minority children for the rest of their lives  We can do this for the cost of a little more than two weeks in Iraq     But even as we work in Congress to improve this vital program  the President says no     The same misguided rationale applies to the other investments in that bill  The Presidents choices cast aside urgently needed research on heart disease  diabetes  asthma  infectious disease  mental health  and many other areas that could find cures and bring relief for millions of our fellow citizens     The Presidents choices are also devastating for American workers as he rejects funding to enforce the labor laws that keep workers safe and give them a level playing field  Instead  the Presidents veto takes bad employers off the hook and puts the safety and lives of American workers at risk      The Presidents choices are devastating to veterans as well  Each year  nearly 320 000 brave service members return to civilian life  many coming from Iraq and Afghanistan      Tens of thousands of Reservists and National Guard members have lost their benefits and even their jobs because they served their country  Thats why the Appropriations Bill provided  228 million to help veterans find jobs  obtain training  and protect their right to return to their former jobs  President Bushs choices take away this modest welcome mat and slam the door shut in our veterans faces     The bill approved in the House of Representatives also takes an important step in reining in the Bush Administrations use of torture  Its difficult to believe that in this day and age  Congress needs to legislate against the use of torture to prevent the President of the United States from abusing prisoners      Torture and cruel  inhuman  and degrading treatment are already prohibited by law  Yet  must once again legislate  not because the conduct we would prohibit is somehow still lawful  but because the Bush Administration continues to twist and distort existing law in its misguided and immoral interrogation practices      The nation was shocked by the horrible images from Abu Ghraib prison  and America was shamed in the eyes of the world  The Administration tried to whitewash the episode by blaming it on low level soldiers  but the truth about our use of torture couldnt be concealed  Led by President Bush  Vice President Cheney  Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld  and Attorney General Gonzales  the Administration had set a course that undermined fundamental American values in the craven belief that torture could somehow make us more secure      Our interrogators were authorized to shackle prisoners in stress positions  induce hypothermia  and use sleep deprivation  extended isolation  bombardment with lights and loud music  and even the now infamous practice of waterboarding  The Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel gave its approval to the legally of these practices in the morally outrageous Bybee Torture Memorandum  which defined torture in an absurdly narrow way  Under the Bybee Memo  if the President approved the use of torture it  no one could be prosecuted for breaking our Nations laws or international obligations      The Administration withdrew the Bybee memo in embarrassment when it became public but the under Attorney General Gonzales the Justice Department continued to issue memorandums validating the use of extreme interrogation techniques  Indeed  now Attorney General  Michael Mukasey refused to denounce waterboarding as torture during his confirmation hearings     Only leaders who fail to understand the founding principles of America could approve such behavior  Our country needs to stand beyond reproach for the sanctity of each individual  for freedom  for justice and for the rule of law  But the Administration turned its back on all of these traditions  and on the ideals of America itself      In 2005  Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act  which ensured that all interrogations conducted by the Department of Defense would comply with the Army Field Manual  a comprehensive and effective approach to interrogation that prohibits the use of torture and cruel  inhuman and degrading techniques in favor of techniques that are most likely to be effective in gaining necessary information      Lt  General John Kimmons said when releasing the Manual  No good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices  I think history tells us that  I think the empirical evidence of the last five years  hard years  tells us that  The Manual itself tells us that the  u se of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results  may damage subsequent collection efforts  and can induce the source to say what he thinks the  interrogator  wants to hear      Last May  General Petraeus echoed these statements in a letter to all our service members in Iraq  saying that torture and other expedient methods to obtain information are not only illegal and immoral but also generally neither useful nor necessary     We now know  however  that the 2005 Act left open a loophole that undermines the basic safeguards against torture and cruel and degrading treatment  We applied the Field Manual to the Department of Defense  but not to the CIA     Last year in the Military Commissions Act  Congress left it to the President to define by Executive Order the interrogation practices that would bind all government interrogators  including the CIA  The Presidents Executive Order drove a Mack truck through this small loophole  The vague terms of the Order permit many of the most heinous interrogation practices      The provisions of this bill close that loophole  They require that all U S  interrogations  including those conducted by the CIA  conform to the Army Field Manual  This very simple and easily implemented reform means no more waterboarding  no more use of dogs or other extreme practices prohibited by the Manual      There will still be great flexibility in use of interrogation methods and our interrogators will be able to effectively get required information  but torture will be off the table     This bill is an opportunity to restate our commitment to the ideals and security of our country  Its an opportunity to repair the damage done to our reputation by the scandal at Abu Ghraib and the abuses at Guantanamo  Its an opportunity to restore our nation as the beacon for human rights  fair treatment  and the rule of law  And it is an opportunity to protect our brave servicemen and women  both in and out of uniform  from similar tactics     Its a simple but vital step in returning our nation to the rule of law and the ideals on which America was founded  and it deserves to be enacted into law as soon as possible           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
