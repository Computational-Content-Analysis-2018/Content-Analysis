         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following statement on the President Bush s reversal on Davis Bacon   I m pleased the President has finally reversed course on his incredibly damaging decision to suspend wage protections for workers rebuilding the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina  Unfortunately  this announcement does nothing to undo the harm done to hard working Americans who have already paid a high price in lost pay and lost jobs because of the Administration s award of billions of dollars in no bid contracts to their corporate cronies  It does nothing to ensure that local residents and businesses get the jobs and contracts first  And it does nothing to overturn his suspension of important anti discrimination protections  America can do better for the men and women of the Gulf Coast   Earlier today  prior to the White House changing its course  Senators Kennedy  Dorgan  and Harkin joined working men and women impacted by Hurricane Katrina to discuss how the Administration s policies have hurt those who have already lost everything  They heard firsthand from Diana Hill and Trina Daniels who were living in the lower Ninth Ward at the time of the storm who spoke about how the Administration s misplaced priorities are fundamentally unfair to those who are trying to rebuild their lives  The Senators blasted the Administration for suspending Davis Bacon  awarding no bid contracts to their corporate cronies rather than jobs to local workers  and waiving Affirmative while they refuse to use their tax cuts for the wealthiest as a way to offset the costs of rebuilding   At today s press conference Senator Kennedy said  The Bush Administration s response to the crisis has been fundamentally unfair  They have awarded billions of dollars in contracts to many of their corporate friends  Yet they also took the harsh step denying fair wages to workers implementing the contracts  They have allowed their no bid contractors to ignore safety protections and exploit undocumented workers  They have cut off emergency aid  at a time when many are still struggling to survive  These responses reflect the misguided priorities that have become the indelible hallmark of this Administration  Sadly  our Republican colleagues in Congress share the Administration s misguided priorities  Instead of finding ways to meet the needs of the hardworking Americans affected by Katrina and Rita  they are focusing on their proposal to grant over  70 billion in new tax cuts for millionaires   Today Kennedy is offering a bill  outlined below  titled the Rebuild with Respect Act to remedy these abuses  Also below are Senator Kennedy s remarks and fact sheets on the economic impact of Katrina  Davis Bacon in the Gulf Coast  the affect of waiving Affirmative Action  Disaster Unemployment Assistance  the hazardous conditions facing workers  and the need to hire locally in the Gulf Coast   The Rebuild with Respect Act Would    Allow Gulf Coast families to rebuild their own communities by requiring all recipients of federal disaster relief funds to employ individuals displaced from jobs or residences by Katrina and Rita and ensuring that federal contracts go to local businesses in the Gulf Coast region   Ensure that workers who have lost everything do not lose fair wages  too  by reinstating the protections of the Davis Bacon Act for workers in the construction industry    Recognize and address the racial inequalities that have sparked national outcry by requiring contractors receiving federal disaster relief funds to fully comply with all affirmative action requirements applicable under law    Ensure that the federal contracting process is fair to small and disadvantaged businesses    Protect the health and safety of recovery and reconstruction workers and volunteers in the Gulf Coast region by requiring federal agencies to develop a coordinated health and safety plan that includes safety training  needed equipment  and monitoring of safety conditions    Provide economic security for those who have difficulty finding jobs by providing an emergency extension of unemployment insurance benefits and expanding eligibility for the Disaster Unemployment Assistance program   Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy on the Introduction of the Rebuild with Respect Act October 26  2005  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita exposed the silent slavery of poverty for all of America to see  There s no excuse for ignoring what so obviously needs to be done to achieve genuine equality and basic fairness in this country  We know we re a stronger country when we re a fairer country and the crisis on the Gulf Coast has given us a chance to move closer to that goal   Yet  the Bush Administration s response to the crisis has been fundamentally unfair  They have awarded billions of dollars in contracts to many of their corporate friends  Yet they also took the harsh step denying fair wages to workers implementing the contracts  They have allowed their no bid contractors to ignore safety protections and exploit undocumented workers  They have cut off emergency aid  at a time when many are still struggling to survive  These responses reflect the misguided priorities that have become the indelible hallmark of this Administration   Sadly  our Republican colleagues in Congress share the Administration s misguided priorities  Instead of finding ways to meet the needs of the hardworking Americans affected by Katrina and Rita  they are focusing on their proposal to grant over  70 billion in new tax cuts for millionaires   Hurricanes Katrina and Rita left more than 500 000 people homeless and almost 500 000 people jobless  The families so immensely harmed by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have largely disappeared from our television screens  But  we cannot and will not forget the tens of thousands of families still suffering in the aftermath of these tragedies  struggling each day to regain lost hope and lost opportunity   Reconstruction is not just about reconstructing buildings  although that is important  We must help Gulf Coast families and communities rebuild their lives and spirit  Our efforts to do that should treat workers and their families with dignity and respect  and good jobs with good wages that provide a promising future for residents are a critical first step on the road to recovery   Today  we introduce the Rebuild with Respect Act  which will ensure that any program we enact to rebuild and revitalize the Gulf Coast region treat the affected workers and their families with dignity and respect  We re honored to be joined today by Diana Hill and Trina Daniels  former residents of the lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans who are now living in Baton Rouge  They lost their jobs and their homes in the wake of Katrina  and have come here to Washington today to tell their stories  What their experience abundantly illustrates is that current relief and reconstruction efforts are failing the hardworking Americans who call the Gulf Coast home   I never cease to be amazed by the resilience of working Americans  and I ve been particularly moved by the way these men and women have come together to help one another in response to the crisis on the Gulf Coast  Residents of the Gulf Coast have earned the right to rebuild their own communities  Together  we can do better   We cannot continue to ignore the immense challenges facing working Americans in this crisis  Now is the time to work together and support each other  Now is the time to restore hope and restore dignity  Now is the time to rebuild with respect  This Act will help us to do that  and I urge the Senate to approve it   THE DEVASTATING ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE GULF COAST STORMS   Hurricanes Katrina and Rita left more than 500 000 people homeless a1   _msocom_1 and almost 500 000 people jobless  The price tag for the cleanup alone could be well over  100 billion  All of this has happened to a region of our country that was already seeing poor economic times    Even before the first winds of the storms hit  Mississippi had the highest unemployment rate in the nation  Louisiana had the 8th highest  In New Orleans alone  nearly 12 percent of the population was unemployed before the storm  Those who were employed often made meager wages    The states devastated by Katrina and Rita are among the poorest in the nation  Mississippi and Louisiana have the highest percentage of people living in poverty in the nation  and Alabama is not far behind  Before the storms  23  of the local New Orleans population was living below the poverty line  including 38  of children    Many of those affected lacked the economic resources to escape from the storms  More than one in five households in Orleans Parish did not own a vehicle  and less than half of the households owned a home  These economically vulnerable families now face even greater challenges  as they lack the resources they need to recover from the storms    These unemployed workers are scrambling for income at a time when the costs of basic necessities are already skyrocketing  Since President Bush has taken office  gas prices are up 74 percent  health insurance costs are up 59 percent  college tuition costs are up 45 percent  and housing costs are up 44 percent    The storms  effects will raise these prices even further  For example  in the coming winter months the cost of heat is expected to strain the finances of many American families  Diminished supplies of heating oil and natural gas from the Gulf Coast are anticipated to cause heating bills to rise by 56  this winter    The ramifications of Katrina and Rita extend far beyond the Gulf Coast region  On a national scale  even smaller storms such as hurricane Ivan have produced temporary economic effects such as weaker job and income growth  higher unemployment  and decreased production and construction activity  In light of New Orleans  unique status as a hub of transportation and fuel production  the economic effects of Katrina and Rita will be far more significant  and far longer in duration    Americans are deeply concerned about the potentially devastating economic effects of Katrina and Rita  In an ABC News Washington Post poll  60  of respondents said the economy is worsening  Consumer confidence plummeted almost 19 points last month    the biggest monthly drop in 15 years   HARDWORKING AMERICANS REBUILDING THE GULF COAST DESERVE A FAIR WAGE  As the Administration is awarding billions of dollars in contracts to their friends  they are stripping away protections for the hardworking Americans that will get their hands dirty rebuilding the region  These people are struggling to survive  and now the Administration has repealed the law that ensures fair wages for reconstruction workers   It was two Republicans    Representative Davis and Senator Bacon    that sponsored the Davis Bacon Act  They wanted to ensure that large federal contracts would not drive down the price of labor  so they passed a law saying that workers on federal government projects should earn at least a typical local wage  That s all the Davis Bacon Act does   The wages guaranteed by the Act are fair and reasonable  In areas affected by Katrina and Rita  some typical wages include    9 16 per hour for Sheet Metal Workers in Pearl River County  Missisippi o  10 00 per hour for laborers in Livingston Parish  Louisiana  o  8 54 hour for truckdrivers in Mobile County  Alabama   While the Administration claims that suspending the Act s protections will produce significant cost savings  White House Chief of Staff Andy Card recently admitted that the government is not saving any money through suspension of the law   The residents of the Gulf Coast are not just rebuilding highways and schoolsthey are rebuilding communities and neighborhoods  And the foundation of such communities is good jobs with fair wages   SUSPENSION OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION REQUIREMENTS BETRAYS GULF COAST WORKERS  In addition to awarding billions in reconstruction contracts to its political allies  the Bush administration has also disregarded the interests of the most vulnerable workers in the Gulf Coast region by exempting these contractors from longstanding affirmative action requirements   These requirements    which have governed every large federal contractor for almost 50 years    do not mandate quotas or set asides  They simply require contractors to keep track of hiring data and make a plan demonstrating their efforts to promote diversity in the workforce   These rules were adopted because Congress believed  as President Kennedy said in 1963  that simple justice requires that public funds  to which all taxpayers  contribute  not be spent in any fashion which encourages  entrenches  subsidizes  or results in  discrimination   The protections of the law are critical to ensure fair and equal employment opportunities for minorities  women  people with disabilities  and disabled veterans that have long faced barriers to full inclusion in the workforce   Rebuilding efforts for Katrina and Rita are likely to result in some 150 billion dollars in federal contracts    roughly half the amount of money that the Federal government annually awards in procurement contracts in a typical year   This money will create thousands of jobs rebuilding the Gulf Coast region  Hiring for these jobs will be fast and furious  and in the haste to rebuild    despite all good intentions    employers may retreat to traditional methods of hiring that fail to reach minorities  women  and other disadvantaged groups   Many people affected by Hurricane Katrina were already struggling to make ends meet  Job discrimination  particularly at the hiring stage  remains one of our nation s most troubling and elusive problems  In light of the dramatic inequities exposed by Hurricane Katrina  it is precisely the wrong time to abandon laws that promote fair treatment and equal opportunity  AMERICANS LEFT JOBLESS BY HURRICANE KATRINA DESERVE AN EFFECTIVE DISASTER UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM   The impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the workforce in the Gulf Coast Region  More than 478 000 people have already filed for claims for unemployment insurance based on the storm s effects    These jobless workers will face tough competition in reentering the workforce  Economists estimate that many of the unemployed could remain so for nine months or more    In addition to those workers directly impacted by the storm  Katrina s devastation will also affect many workers whose livelihood depends on the vitality of the economies affected by the disaster    Unfortunately  many of those directly and indirectly affected by the storms are not eligible for state unemployment benefits    While the federal government has a program in place that provides Disaster Unemployment Assistance to workers affected by major disasters  this program suffers from a number of systemic flaws that have limited its ability to serve as a useful resource for disaster victims  The eligibility criteria are too strict  deadlines are too short  and the benefits are too small to be of any real assistance in a time of crisis    The Rebuild with Respect Act expands eligibility criteria for federal benefits  ensuring that more workers excluded from state assistance are helped by federal benefits    The Rebuild with Respect Act increases the deadline for filing for federal Disaster Unemployment Assistance to ensure that relocated workers have ample time to file for benefits  Workers left unemployed by Katrina will need a significant period of time to recover  perhaps relocate  and find work  Struggling evacuees should not have to worry that the clock will run out on their unemployment benefits if they are actively seeking work  but unable to immediately find suitable employment   Current DUA benefit levels are only about a quarter of the poverty level income for a family of four  This is a national disaster  and families are being relocated throughout the nation  The Rebuild with Respect Act provides a guaranteed minimum benefit level that is adequate to meet these families  basic needs  wherever they might be   WORKERS REBUILDING THE GULF COAST REGION NEED PROTECTIONS AGAINST HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS  Thousands of workers responded to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  including firefighters  police  and medical emergency teams  As the Gulf Coast area is rebuilt  thousands more will participate in the clean up and rebuilding   Workers cleaning up in the aftermath of the storms are being exposed to hazardous chemicals  oil and sewage contaminated waters  mold  and other hazardous substances  In New Orleans  the hurricanes left behind a trail of sludge filled with petroleum products  benzene  and various chemicals and human waste  Once dried  this dust becomes airborne and can manifest in those who breathe it as asthma  allergies and other respiratory disorders   Some workers have developed rashes and coughs from the work  According to the New Orleans Health Department  a respiratory illness outbreak in one city cleaning team was abated only after proper safety conventions were put in place  As people looking for work continue to migrate to the Gulf Coast  the training and protection of these new workers remains a paramount concern   Many workers lack adequate protections against exposure to environmental health hazards  These workers need health and safety training and proper protective equipment to continue this dangerous but vitally important work   We should learn from the mistakes of the September 11 recovery efforts  where thousands of brave workers were unnecessarily put in harm s way and developed workplaces illnesses because of the absence of proper equipment and instruction  and federal failure to enforce workplace safety and health standards  The federal government also waited too long to begin monitoring the health of these workers and volunteers   The Rebuild with Respect Act requires the federal government to immediately institute a medical monitoring program for workers and volunteers in the Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita disaster areas  The program will provide for physical and mental health monitoring  health care referrals  studies and sampling of exposures  and education and outreach regarding the risks posed to human health   It also requires the Department of Labor to develop site specific safety and health plans to monitor exposure to hazardous substances  provide safety and health training  and implement a personal protective equipment program  In addition it clarifies that the Department must fully apply and enforce all federal laws related to the safety and health of workers in the disaster areas  including public employees engaged in disaster relief and recovery activities for which federal financial assistance is being provided   FEDERAL RECONSTRUCTION FUNDS SHOULD SUPPORT LOCAL COMPANIES AND LOCAL HIRING   Since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the Gulf Coast the federal government has already entered into more than 15 contracts for reconstruction and recovery work exceeding  100 million in value  including 5 contracts exceeding  500 million in value S2   _msocom_2     President Bush has rightly said that as many jobs as possible should go to the men and women who live in Louisiana  Mississippi  and Alabama  However  the administration s actions have not reflected this    These contracts are not going to local contractors that employ local workers  More than 90  a3   _msocom_3 of the rebuilding contracts have gone to companies outside of these states including a large contract to rebuild Mississippi schools which was awarded to a politically connected Alaskan firm  The biggest contracts are going to out of state companies that may not provide economic opportunities for Gulf Coast workers S4   _msocom_4     Small local companies and local workers are being left out of the rebuilding process  A typical story is seen in the plight of Knight Enterprises  a minority owned small business in New Orleans that employs local  mainly African American electricians  After Katrina  most of the company s workers were left homeless and broke  While an out of state subcontractor working for a Haliburton subsidiary initially retained the company to provide electricians for a rebuilding project  the local electricians were soon replaced with the subcontractor s own out of state workers and the local workers were again left jobless    While Administration has recently stated that it will give preference local businesses in contracting for repair and reconstruction efforts  no specific goals have been set S5   _msocom_5     We need to prioritize improving the lives of affected workers    not lining the pocketbooks of the politically connected    in rebuilding the Gulf Coast region  The people affected by this tragedy need to rebuild their communities and neighborhoods  and restore their hope for the future    Residents of the Gulf Coast region have earned the right to rebuild their own communities    The Rebuild with Respect Act would require that 50  of all jobs created with federal reconstruction and recovery funds go to workers affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita    The Act gives contractors flexibility in deciding how to meet this requirement so that reconstruction efforts will go forward smoothly    We cannot consider the reconstruction process successful if only the physical structures are rebuilt    the people in these communities must also rebuild their lives  Good jobs with good futures for local residents are a critical first step on the path to recovery   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
