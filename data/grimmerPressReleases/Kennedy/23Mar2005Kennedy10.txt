         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Americans are asking when the President and Congress finally are going to address their most critical concerns    and health care is at the top of their list  I commend the Center for American Progress for its thoughtful proposal that shows there are innovative and realistic ways to meet the health care needs of American families if the White House and Congress are willing to take up the cause  Congress has just shown that it can convene extraordinary weekend sessions when it wants to  yet day after day 45 million Americans go without health insurance because they can t afford it and their employers wont provide it  Surely the health of our families deserves that kind of urgent attention    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
