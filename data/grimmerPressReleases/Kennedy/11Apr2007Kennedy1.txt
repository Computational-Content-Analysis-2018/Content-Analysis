         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C   Recent investigations of relationships between student loan companies and college financial aid officers show a pattern of back room dealing that has no place in financing higher education   An investigation by Senator Edward M  Kennedy has uncovered that  in late 2001  financial aid administrators at the University of Texas  the University of Southern California  and Columbia University and Education Department official Matteo Fontana acquired shares of Student Loan Xpress stock  known at that time as Direct III Marketing  Inc   from the current President of Student Loan Xpress  Fabrizio Balestri   Mr  Balestri apparently acquired the stock through a private placement of stock a few months before starting work as President of the company  on January 1  2002    It appears that the placement was organized and orchestrated by Direct III Marketing founder Robert deRose   Private placements are generally only available to certain accredited entities  usually wealthy individuals and institutions   and the law places restrictions on purchasers ability to resell shares acquired in this manner Mr  Fontana and the financial aid administrators bought the shares from Mr  Balestri at a significant discount to their market value  and at least one of the financial aid administrators apparently paid Mr  Balestri in cash  Strangely  Mr  Balestri later sent a Memorandum of Gift to each of the recipients of the stock  purporting to show that he had given them the shares for free    in fact  all had bought the shares from him at the significantly discounted price Importantly  the companys share of student loan business at the schools whose financial aid administrators purchased this discounted stock increased significantly over the next few years   For example  Student Loan Xpress had 5 15  of FFEL loan volume at Columbia University in 2002  by 2006  that share was 12 17  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement   The characteristics of this transaction  especially Mr  Balestris apparent effort to conceal his sale of shares to financial aid administrators and an Education Department official  raise significant concerns about its legality under securities laws  It also raises the question of whether a quid pro quo existed between these financial aid officers and Student Loan Xpress   I am referring this matter to the SEC for investigation  and my office will continue to probe inappropriate relationships between student loan companies and school officials charged with protecting students interests   I appreciate CITs cooperation with my investigation and its determination to get to the bottom of this matter quickly Senator Kennedy sent the following letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission last night Dear Chairman Cox  Im writing about facts that have come to my attention that raise concerns about the propriety of sales of shares of a company providing federally guaranteed student loans  Student Loan Xpress   The shares were acquired in a private placement by the current President of the company and quickly sold to others   I believe the facts surrounding these transactions warrant an inquiry by the Commission  Specifically  it has come to my attention that Fabrizio Balestri  who became President of Student Loan Xpress  currently owned by CIT  on January 1  2002  participated in late 2001 in a private placement of that companys shares  then named Direct III Marketing  Inc     It appears that the placement was orchestrated by Direct III Marketing founder and current Vice Chairman of Student Loan Xpress Robert deRose   Shortly after purchasing units  comprised of shares of stock and warrants to purchase shares  offered in the private placement  Mr  Balestri sold these units to financial aid officers at the University of Texas  the University of Southern California  and Columbia University and to Education Department official Matteo Fontana   It appears that Mr  Balestri acquired the shares in the private placement at a significant discount to their market value and sold them to the purchasers described above at the same discounted value   Apparently  at least one of the financial aid administrators paid Mr  Balestri in cash   It particularly concerns me that Mr  Balestri apparently later sent a Memorandum of Gift to each of the recipients of the stock  purporting to show that he had given them the shares for free  when all had bought the shares from him at the discounted price    The circumstances described above raise concerns about the legality of these transactions   Therefore  I write to ask that you investigate whether the transactions described above comported with applicable law and regulations     Thank you for considering this request  and I look forward to your reply                                                            Sincerely
