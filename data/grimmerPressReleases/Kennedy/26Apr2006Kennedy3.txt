         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  today  is Equal Pay Day  which means that 115 days into 2006  an average American woman will finally have earned enough in 2005 and 2006 together to equal what a man doing similar work earned by the end of 2005  Equal Pay Day is a sad reminder that gender discrimination is still very much a part of our country  In America today  women earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men  The wage gap exists in every segment of our society  Women of every race and national origin earn less than their male counterparts  African American women earn just 68 percent of the average earnings of African American men  Latinas earn only 57 percent of the average Latino male wage  Asian American women earn 88 cents for every dollar earned by Asian American men  Page S3569  This is not a problem just for poor women or rich women  it cuts across all occupations  There are even wage gaps in the operating room  The average male physician or surgeon makes  52 000 more a year than the average female physician  In the boardroom  the average male CEO makes  35 000 more a year than his female counterpart  There are wage gaps in the classroom  The average male teaching assistant earns  5 000 more a year than the average female  In the dining room  the average male cook makes  2 000 more than his female counterpart  The problem is not getting better  This years wage gap of 23 cents is the same gap that existed in 2002  Since 1963  when the Equal Pay Act was passed  the wage gap has narrowed by less than half of a penny a year  The wage gap is caused in part by how society deals with the realities of working womens lives  such as time out from the workforce to have children and care for family members  Among working women  nearly two thirds do not receive paid maternity leave when they give birth  a quarter have to quit their jobs to care for their children  and doing so permanently lowers their future earning potential  It is wrong to dismiss the pay gap as a consequence of womens choosing to take time out of the workforce  Women do not willingly choose to forego fair pay in order to have children and care for elderly parents  nor should they  More important  we cannot blame the pay gap exclusively on womens predominant role in childcare  The evidence shows that actual gender discrimination also accounts for the disparity between men and womens pay  In 2004  the Census Bureau concluded that the substantial gap in earnings between men and women could not completely be explained by differences in education  tenure in the workforce  or occupation  Similarly  a recent General Accounting Office report concluded that the difference in men and womens working patterns does not explain the entire disparity in their wages  Discrimination plays a role as well  and we need to combat it with Federal legislation to close the gap  Congress needs to act  I strongly support Senator Clintons Paycheck Fairness Act and Senator Harkins Fair Pay Act to prevent and remedy gender pay discrimination  It is appalling and unacceptable that such discrimination still exists in America  The issue is simple fairness  I urge my colleagues to stand up for working women and end wage discrimination by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Fair Pay Act
