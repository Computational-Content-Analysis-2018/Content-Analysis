         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  All of the men and women who would become legal residents of the United States under the terms of this legislation are required to pay income tax like every other worker in America  What the Sessions Amendment would do is really quite extraordinary and grossly unfair  It would arbitrarily deny those immigrants who have become legal residents one of the tax benefits available to every taxpayer under the Internal Revenue Code  That provision is the Earned Income Tax Credit  a provision designed to reduce the tax burden on low income families with children   It is fundamentally wrong to subject immigrant workers to a different  harsher Tax Code than the one that applies to every one else in the country  An immigrant worker should pay exactly the same income tax that every other worker earning the same pay and supporting the same size family pays    no less and no more  We should not be designing a special punitive Tax Code for immigrants that makes them pay more than everyone else  Yet  that is exactly what the Sessions Amendment seeks to do   The Sessions Amendment would result in highly inconsistent treatment of legal immigrant residents  and would drastically increase the amount of tax that many of these families had to pay  They would be subject to income and payroll taxes in the same manner as other workers but would be denied the use of a key element of the Tax Code that is intended to offset the relatively heavy tax burdens that low income working families  especially those with children  otherwise would face   Most of the EITC is simply a tax credit for the payment of other taxes  especially regressive payroll taxes  The EITC was specifically designed to offset the payroll tax burden on low income working parents  The Treasury Department has estimated that a large majority of the EITC merely compensates for a portion of the federal income  payroll  and excise taxes paid by the low income tax filers who qualify to receive it   A significant share of families that receive the EITC owe federal income tax before the EITC is applied  in addition to paying payroll taxes  Low income working immigrant families in this category who would be denied the EITC under the Sessions Amendment would consequently face a dramatic increase in their income tax bill  requiring them to pay much higher taxes than other taxpayers with similar earnings   Other families with even less income would not receive a refund to offset the disproportionately large payroll taxes they paid  unlike other workers with comparable wages and dependents   To qualify for the EITC  under current law  a taxpayer must satisfy the following criteria   be a US citizen or legal resident  have a valid Social Security number for both the worker and any qualifying children  have earned income from employment or self employment  have total income that falls below a certain level  and file an income tax return   Current law already clearly prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving the EITC  No immigrant can receive the earned income tax credit unless he or she is a legal resident who is a low wage worker paying payroll taxes and filing an income tax return  These are men and women who are conscientiously fulfilling their responsibilities to their adopted country and they deserve to be treated like all other workers in America   Denying the EITC to legal immigrant residents would unduly harm their children  including many children who are citizens  About 98  of the EITC goes to working families with children  Census data show that the EITC lifts more children out of poverty than any other federal program   As I noted  many of the children in these immigrant families are U S  citizens themselves  Denying the EITC to these legal residents would thrust a very a large number of children deeply into poverty   The CBO and Joint Tax Committee estimates show that the increase in refundable credits resulting from S  2611 would be more than offset by the income and payroll taxes the new filers would pay  The net effect of the increased costs and increased revenues would be a gain of more than  30 billion between 2007 and 2016  The new legal residents would pay over  62 billion in income and payroll taxes  while the cost of all refundable tax credits  both the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit  would be only  29 4 billion  Thus  The Federal Treasury will clearly benefit from these immigrant workers becoming legal residents   By expanding the population of legal resident immigrants  the Senate legislation would increase the number of federal tax filers  Since they would be taxed in the same manner as U S  citizens  these families also would qualify for tax deductions and credits  including the EITC and the Child Tax Credit  The CBO cost estimates show that  as a group  the new population of legal immigrants would pay more than twice as much in income and payroll taxes as they would receive in refundable credits   With the value of the minimum wage at its lowest level in decades  denying these low income workers the EITC is especially harsh  The federal minimum wage has not been increased for more than eight years  It would be particularly cruel to increase the tax burdens  and further diminish the after tax income  of immigrant families headed by minimum wage workers who have received legal status  It will mean even less money to support their children   Under the process established by S  2611  an immigrant who was undocumented prior to passage of the bill cannot become a citizen for a minimum of 11 years  Thus  the Sessions Amendment would deny millions of low income  taxpaying workers the benefit of the Earned Income Tax Credit for at least 11 years after they became legal residents  For 11 years their taxes would be much higher than every other worker earning the same wages and supporting the same size family  The ability of these families  already living on meager wages  to provide for their children would be further eroded  Is that fair  Is it reasonable to make them pay more under a harsher Tax Code than everyone else  I believe most Americans would answer that question with a resounding No   The Earned Income Tax Credit is not welfare  It is an earned benefit in the Tax Code that is available to all low income working families with children that pay taxes  Immigrant families who are legal residents are subject to the same Tax Code as all other workers in America  They have the same tax burdens and the same tax benefits as everyone else under current law  The Sessions Amendment would change that  depriving legal resident immigrant families of one of the primary tax benefits for low income families with children in the Tax Code  To do so would be terribly unjust  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
