         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  SMITH     Lots to absorb here this morning with the State of the Union address tonight  the passing of Coretta Scott King  We want to talk about some of these subjects this morning with Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy  who joins us this morning from Capitol Hill  Senator  good morning  I don t know if you ve had a chance to hear this news or not about the passing  the death of Coretta Scott King  I know you and your family have worked so hard and diligently in the struggle for civil rights in this country     A moment  if you will  to reflect on her passing KENNEDY  First  I think all Americans are thinking about Bob and Doug on their flight back from Iraq and wishing them the very best  and our thoughts and prayers are with their families  Coretta Scott King  the wife of Dr  Martin Luther King    Dr  Martin Luther King was really the driving force  not just for the civil rights movement  but for the great march for progress  And as he was the father of that movement  she was the mother of that movement  They together were the force in this nation  In an area where our founding fathers failed    founding fathers wrote slavery into the Constitution  we fought a civil war  but it wasn t really until we had Dr  King and Coretta Scott King in the  50s that awakened the conscience of the nation so the political leadership of the early  60s could begin what I call the march to progress  that of knocking down walls of discrimination on race  religion  ethnicity and gender  and disability  And we have benefited so much from their leadership and from their inspiration  A final point I want to mention is that I ve had the good opportunity to get to know the children over the years  and I have seen the time that they have spent with their mother  Their mother was not only a powerful and charismatic figure and leader for our time  but she helped those children grow up to be individuals with a sense of dignity  a sense of pride in their heritage  and their strong commitment to do something for someone else  I admire her for that  as well     So our prayers are with the family today SMITH  She suffered a stroke and a heart attack last August  was making a recovery  Actually appeared at an MLK celebration in Atlanta just two weeks ago  Senator  so many Americans believe because of King s legacy that the road to equality has been achieved  Is there work to be done KENNEDY  Well  there certainly is work to be done  The signs of bigotry and discrimination are still out there  They re much more sophisticated and they re much more subtle than when Dr  King was facing the police dogs and the beatings    that took place in Selma  in Montgomery    and imprisoned and threatened during that period of time  but they re still out there  But there s no question that we re a fairer nation  a better nation because of Dr  King  And I think what Coretta Scott King would want us to do is to continue this march toward progress and not retreat from it  I think that would be her hope  her desire  for those that respected her life and understand the inspiration of her message  We in Boston take a special affection for them  because that s where they met  Dr  King was trained at the Divinity School of Boston University  So they had so many friends in Boston and so many followers  And this is something that those that care about the King legacy should continue this march toward progress  And I think it s teetering now in the United States  We cannot go backward SMITH  Senator  I want to move on to some other issues this morning  including the confirmation of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court of the United States  You said on the Senate floor yesterday  if you are concerned and you want justice    that is  a justice that is going to stand for the working men and women in this country    it s not going to be Judge Alito     Is that a day late and a dollar short KENNEDY  Well  no  that s the fight  That s the battle  We weren t successful yesterday  It did seem to me that most Americans are working hard  They re paying attention to the corruption in Washington  the increase cost of Medicare  what s happened in Katrina  what s going on in Iraq  The importance of a Supreme Court nominee is going to be powerful  not just for our generation  but future generations  And it takes time for Americans to be able to understand it  I can remember the Friday before we voted on Iraq  we had eight senators that were going to vote against that  We got up to 23  If we had had another week  I think we would have had half the Senate  and if had had another week  that resolution wouldn t have passed  Now we are going to be voting today  and Judge Alito will be elevated to that court  And I just hope and I just pray that he will understand the kind of march toward progress that this nation has had under Dr  King and will reach out to make sure that the words equal justice under law  which are above the Supreme Court  are going to be in equal balance on any case that comes before him and that the little person is going to get as even a shake as the powerful and the strong  and that he ll be willing to stand up to abuses in executive power  which I think is going to be enormously important  the way Sandra Day O Connor did in the past SMITH  Early on in this administration  you found some common ground with this president  The president  it has been clear from all indications  is going to talk about some sort of reform in health care  Do you see in the future that there might be some common ground that you would find in this administration with regard to that KENNEDY     Well  I would hope so  I would hope so  I believe we re trying to get some things done  And we worked closely with the president on the No Child Left Behind  That was both reform and resources  We got some of the reform  but you needed the resources there to really implement the reform  and we really didn t get it  The last budget on education was absolutely a cut in education  and you re not going to be able to achieve the reforms of better trained teachers  smaller classrooms  supplementary services without it  Now  in the area of health care  I would hope that we could  This president hasn t really paid attention to the health care crisis for the last five years  We have 2 000 individuals every single day that are going to be uninsured  We don t want gimmicks  we want something of substance  And if we re just going to talk about health savings accounts  if we re just going to talk about association plans and increasing deductibility  those are gimmicks  Americans saw the fiasco of gimmicks last year in the president s efforts to privatize Social Security  and they don t want that in health care  We ought to reform our Medicare prescription drug system  That would be a basis for real cooperation in the future  and then get a Medicare for all  Americans trust Medicare  Let s have it apply to all Americans SMITH     Senator Kennedy  we thank you so much for your time this morning  Do appreciate it  Sir  Take care
