         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  KENNEDY  Mr  President  the real crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation crisis  it is an asbestos induced disease crisis  Asbestos is the most lethal substance ever widely used in the workplace  Between 1940 and 1980  there were 27 million workers in this country who were exposed to asbestos on the job  and nearly 19 million of them had high levels of exposure over long periods of time  That exposure changed many of their lives  Each year  more than 10 000 of them died from lung cancer and other diseases caused by asbestos  Each year hundreds of thousands of them suffer from lung conditions which make breathing so difficult that they cannot function at all  Even more have become unemployable due to their medical condition  and because of the long latency period of these diseases  all of them live with fear of premature death due to asbestos induced disease  These are the real victims  They deserve to be the first and foremost focus of our concern  As this chart indicates  asbestos mortality will likely peak around 2015  reflecting the heavy exposures in the 1970s  We are going to see this is not an issue that is going to diminish  in terms of the impact on the workers  workers lives  their families  and their communities  but is actually going to increase in terms of those who are going to be adversely impacted and affected  All too often the tragedy these workers and their families are enduring becomes lost in a complex debate about the economic impact of asbestos litigation  We cannot allow that to happen  The litigation did not create these costs  exposure to asbestos created them  They are the costs of medical care  the lost wages of incapacitated workers  and the cost of providing for the families of workers who died years before their time  Those costs are real  No legislative proposal can make them disappear  All legislation can do is shift those costs from one party to another  Any proposal which would shift more of the financial burden on to the backs of injured workers is unacceptable to me and should be unacceptable to every one of us  I have consistently said throughout the long debate on asbestos legislation that I would support a properly designed and adequately funded trust fund bill  That legislation would have to fairly compensate all the victims of asbestos induced disease in a timely way  It would put more money into the pockets of these injured workers than the current system of reducing transaction costs  This is not such a bill  Senators SPECTER and LEAHY have devoted an enormous amount of time and effort to this asbestos trust fund legislation  They deserve great credit for their work  But the bill before us contains fundamental flaws which make it both unfair and unworkable  It does not provide a reliable guarantee of just compensation to the enormous number of workers who are suffering from asbestos induced disease  The argument that there are serious inadequacies in the way asbestos cases are adjudicated today does not mean any legislation is better than the current system  Our first obligation is to do no harm  We should not be supporting legislation that excludes many seriously ill victims from receiving compensation and that fails to provide a guarantee of adequate funding to make sure injured workers will actually receive what the bill promises them  This bill will do harm  The problem is that powerful corporate interests responsible for the asbestos epidemic have fought throughout this process to escape full accountability for the harm they have inflicted and  as a result  the focus has shifted from what these companies should pay victims to what they are willing to pay victims  That is preventing the Senate from enacting trust fund legislation that will truly help the workers who have been seriously injured by this industrial plague  The Senate should not be proceeding to this asbestos bill at this time  Despite all the work Senators SPECTER and LEAHY and other supporters have done  S  852 is simply not ready for floor consideration  There are too many unanswered questions  and the numbers do not add up  This legislation does not provide sufficient funding to keep the promises of compensation it makes to those asbestos victims it purports to cover  Even if the entire  140 billion the sponsors anticipate raising is paid to the fund  it will not be sufficient to fully compensate the projected number of eligible victims  and it is extremely unlikely the full amount will ever be paid  The formula in the bill is based on highly questionable estimates of the number of companies that would be required to contribute and how much each one would pay  contained in a secret list known only to the asbestos study group  the key lobbyists for the bill  None of the relevant information has ever been made public  There is reason to believe far fewer companies would be contributing than the ASG projects  There will also be serious court challenges brought against the new law that are certain to at least significantly delay statutorily mandated payments and could result in the loss of substantial anticipated revenue  Because of these problems  seriously ill victims are likely to wait for years in legal limbo  unable to proceed in court and unable to obtain compensation from the trust fund if this bill passes  The legislation also fails to permit victims to quickly return to the court system should the trust fund become insolvent  Victims are the losers at both ends  Page S700  These problems are far too complex to be fixed on the Senate floor with a few last minute amendments  If they could not be resolved in the 3 years that the many Senators have worked on this bill  they cannot be corrected in a few days  S  852 is the legislative version of the famous Spruce Goosean ill conceived plan too complex and cumbersome to ever get off the ground  As designed  it simply will not work  It is not a reliable vehicle for compensating the victims of asbestos disease  It should be sent back to the drawing board     The list of serious flaws of S  852 is  unfortunately  a long one  I will focus my remarks on several of the most egregious  First  the financial inadequacy  Experts tell us that the asbestos trust fund created by this legislation is seriously underfunded  The funding plan in this bill relies on very substantial borrowing in the early years as the only way to pay the flood of claims  The result will be a huge debt service cost over the life of the trust that could reduce the  140 billion intended to pay claims by as much as  30 billion or  40 billion  The amount remaining would be far too little to pay claims to cover all those who are entitled to compensation under the terms  In addition  there is a strong constitutional argument that the existing bankruptcy trusts cannot be forced to turnover all their assets  which will place  7 6 billion of the projected funding in jeopardy  Many companies are also likely to challenge their obligation to finance the asbestos trust  It is not at all clear how much will actually be available to pay eligible victims what the legislation promises they will receive     CBOs analysis of S  852 raises serious concerns about the adequacy of funding  The report states  CBO expects that the value of valid claims likely to be submitted to the fund over the next 50 years could be between  120 and  150 billion  not including possible financing  debt services  costs and administrative expenses  The maximum actual revenues collected under the bill would be around  140 billion  but could be significantly less  Consequently  the fund may have sufficient resources to pay all asbestos claims over the next 50 years  but depending on claim rates  borrowing  and other factors  its resources may be insufficient to pay all such claims  There is likely to be a serious shortfall in the early years  when nearly 300 000 pending cases will be transferred to trust for payment  Studies show the trust will not have the resources to pay those claims in a timely manner  Payments to critically ill people may be delayed for years  One way to reduce the enormous financial burden on the fund in the early years would be to leave many of those cases in the tort system  especially cases which were close to resolution  That would be fair to the parties in those cases and it would greatly improve the financial viability of the fund  Unfortunately  that proposal has been repeatedly rejected by the sponsors of the bill  As a result  there will be a serious mismatch between the number of claims the trust fund will face when its doors open and the payments begin coming into the fund  That will force major borrowing in the first 5 years  The debt service resulting from that borrowing will financially cripple the trust     In its report  CBO recognizes the seriousness of this debt service problem  explaining  Because expenses would exceed revenues in many of the early years of the funds operations  the Administrator would need to borrow funds to make up the shortfall  The interest cost of this borrowing would add significantly to the long term costs faced by the fund and contributes to the possibility that the fund might become insolvent  This is only one of several major financing problems with S  852 that experts have identified  There are also major questions about the projections of pending and future claims that further cloud the trust funds financial viability  For example  there has been a significant increase in the number of mesothelioma cases in recent years  The only known cause of mesothelioma is asbestos exposure  This new information suggests that the CBO cost estimate may understate the cost of the mesothelioma claims that the trust fund will incur by more than  15 billion  This is by no means the only instance where there is strong evidence to suggest that the number of eligible claimants will substantially exceed CBO estimates  If S  852 is enacted  the United States Government will be making a commitment to compensate hundreds of thousands of seriously ill asbestos victims but will not have ensured that adequate dollars are available to honor its commitment  That will precipitate a genuine asbestos crisis  and this Congress will bear the responsibility for it  The legislation before us would close the courthouse doors to asbestos victims on the day it passes  long before the trust fund will be able to pay their claims  Their cases will be stayed immediately  Seriously ill workers will be forced into a legal limbo for up to 2 years  Their need for compensation to cover medical expenses and basic family necessities will remain  but they will have nowhere to turn for relief  Under the legislation  even exigent health claims currently pending in the courts will be automatically be stayed for 9 months as of the date of enactment  An exigent health claim is one in which the victim has been diagnosed as being terminally ill from an asbestos related illness and having a life expectancy of less than one year  By definition  these cases all involve people who have less than a year to live due to mesothelioma or some other disease caused by asbestos exposure  Their cases would all be stayed for 9 months  Nine months is an eternity for someone with less than a year to live  Many of them will die without receiving either their day in court or compensation from the trust fund  The stay language is written so broadly that it would even stop all forward movement of a case in the court system  A trial about to begin would be halted  An appellate ruling about to be issued would be barred  Even the deposition of a dying witness could not be taken to preserve his testimony  The stay would deprive victims of their last chance at justice  I cannot believe that the authors of this bill intended such a harsh result  but that is what the legislation does  The bill does contain language allowing an offer of judgment to be made during the period of the stay in the hope of producing a settlement  However  this provision is unlikely to resolve many cases because it requires the agreement of the defendants  There is no incentive for defendants to agree to a settlement when the case has been stayed  Those who have tried cases know that it is only the imminence of judicial action which produces a settlement in most cases  Delay is the defendants best ally  and under this bill  the case is at least delayed for 9 months and may never be allowed to resume if the fund becomes operational  If  however  these exigent cases were not stayed  and judicial proceedings could continue  there would be far more likelihood of cases settling under the offer of judgment process  I strongly believe that  at a minimum  all exigent cases should be exempted from the automatic stay in the legislation  Victims with less than a year to live certainly should be allowed to continue their cases in court uninterrupted until the trust fund became operational  Their ability to recover compensation in the court should not be halted until the trust fund is operational and they are able to receive compensation from that Fund  It is grossly unfair to leave these dying victims in a legal limbo  For them  the old adage is especially truejustice delayed is justice denied  Under the legislation  defendants would receive a credit against what they must contribute to the trust fund for whatever payments they make to these dying victims  so they would not be paying twice  as some have claimed  Allowing the exigent cases to go forward in the courts without interruption is a matter of simple fairness  Staying the cases of victims who have less than a year to live is bureaucratic insensitivity at its worst  Most of these victims will not live to see the doors of the trust fund open  We should not deprive them of their last chancetheir only chanceto receive some measure of justice before asbestos induced disease silences them  They should be allowed to receive compensation in their final months to ease their suffering  They should be allowed to die knowing that their families are financially provided for  S  852 in its current form takes that last chance away from them  Page S701  The way the legislation is written  victims will lose out at the back end of the process as well  should the trust fund run out of money after several years of operation  If the trust fund does become insolvent  a very real possibility  workers will not have an automatic right to immediately return to the court system  The process outlined in the current bill could take years  Workers could end up trapped in the trust with reduced benefits and long delays in receiving their payments  There needs to be a clear  objective triggerinability of the trust to pay a certain percentage of claims within a set period of timethat will automatically allow victims to pursue their claims in court if the trust runs out of money  The Judiciary Committees 2003 legislation contained such a provision  but this bill does not  We cannot allow seriously injured workers with valid claims who are not paid in a timely manner by the trust to be denied their day in court  That would be a shameful injustice  The asbestos trust is being presented as an alternative source of compensation for victims suffering from asbestos induced disease  If that alternative runs out of money and can no longer compensate those victims in a full and timely manner  their right to seek compensation through the judicial system should be immediately restored with no strings attached  No principle is more basic  Yet  this bill violates that principle  I am particularly upset by the way lung cancer victims are treated in this bill  Under the medical criteria adopted by the Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly 2 years ago  all lung cancer victims who had at least 15 years of weighted exposure to asbestos were eligible to receive compensation from the fund  However  that was changed in S  852  Under this bill  lung cancer victims who have had very substantial exposure to asbestos over long periods of time are denied any compensation unless they can show asbestos scarring on their lungs  The committee heard expert medical testimony that prolonged asbestos exposure dramatically increases the probability that a person will get lung cancer even if they do not have scarring on their lungs  Deleting this category will deny compensation to more than forty thousand victims suffering with asbestos related lung cancers  Under the legislation as now drafted  these victims are losing their right to go to court  but are receiving nothing from the fund  How can any of us support such an unconscionable provision  Since we began considering asbestos legislation  no aspect has concerned me more than the treatment of lung cancer victims  My top priority has been to make sure that these severely ill workers receive just and fair compensation  and I have not been alone  A number of other members have spoken out about the importance of adequately providing for lung cancer victims who have been exposed to substantial amounts of asbestos over long periods of time  Now we find that these victims  many of whom will have their lives cut short because of asbestos induced disease  will not receive one penny in compensation from the trust fund  They are losing their right to go to court  but are also being denied any right to compensation under the fund  They are  in essence  being told to suffer in a legally imposed silence with no recourse whatsoever  One of the arguments we hear most frequently in favor of creating an asbestos trust fund is that in the current system  too much money goes to people who are not really sick and too little goes to those who are seriously ill  Well  lung cancer victims who have years of exposure to asbestos are the ones who are seriously ill  They are the ones this legislation is supposed to be helping  Yet  they are being completely excluded  The committee heard extensive testimony from distinguished medical expertsDr  Laura Welsh and Dr  Philip Landriganthat prolonged exposure to asbestos can cause lung cancer even if the victim does not also have markers of nonmalignant asbestos disease  They cited numerous medical authorities supporting their position  They even described treating lung cancer victims whose disease was clearly caused by asbestos but who had neither pleural thickening or asbestosis  In a situation where people are undeniably severely ill and undeniably had 15 or more years of weighted exposure to asbestos  it is wrong to completely exclude them from compensation under the trust fund  Some of the proponents of S  852 have attempted to justify excluding them by claiming that smoking probably caused their lung cancers  But  the evidence refutes this contention  First  even those lung cancer victims with 15 or more weighted years of exposure to asbestos who had never smoked were removed from eligibility for compensation under the trust fund  So  this is about more than just the relationship between asbestos and smoking  Second  regarding the smoking issue  Dr  Landrigan testified that smokers who have substantial exposure to asbestos have 55 times the background risk of developing lung cancer  while smokers who were not exposed to asbestos have 10 times the background risk of developing lung cancer  Clearly  the asbestos exposure makes a huge difference  There is a powerful synergistic effect between asbestos and tobacco in the causation of lung cancer  Both are substantial contributing factors to the disease  The smoker with substantial asbestos exposure should receive less compensation from the trust fund than the nonsmoker with lung cancer  That principle appears throughout the bill  But smoking is not a reason to exclude the smoker from all compensation  Asbestos and tobacco are analogous to joint tortfeasors  Each is partly responsible and each should pay a proportionate share of the compensation  Without prolonged exposure to asbestos  the smoker would have been far less likely to contract lung cancer  It is a gross injustice to completely exclude these severely ill workers  This bill also tampers with the agreed upon medical criteria carefully negotiated between representatives of business and labor by raising the standard of proof for each disease category  The language in S  852 requires the workers to prove that asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to their disease  instead of just a contributing factor  This is a major increase in the burden workers must overcome to receive compensation  It is significantly higher than most states currently require in a court of law  Rather than having to show that asbestos exposure contributed to their illness  they will now have to address the relative impact of asbestos and other potential factors  This change is a serious step in the wrong direction  raising the bar even higher on injured workers  Another major shortcoming of this legislation is its failure to compensate the residents of areas that have experienced large scale asbestos contamination  S  852 simply pretends that this problem does not exist  It fails to compensate the victims of all asbestos induced diseases  other than mesothelioma  whose exposure was not directly tied to their work  There is very substantial scientific evidence showing that the men  women and children who lived in the vicinity of asbestos contaminated sites  such as mining operations and processing plants  can and do contract asbestos induced disease  The reason that this legislation needs a special provision to compensate the residents of Libby  MT  is because it does not compensate victims of community contamination generally  The residents of Libby are certainly entitled to compensation  but so are the residents who lived near the many processing plants from Massachusetts to California that received the lethal ore from the Libby mine  The deadly dust from Libby  MT was spread across America  W R  Grace shipped almost 10 billion pounds of Libby ore to its processing facilities between the 1960s and the mid 1990s  One of the places it was shipped was to the Town of Easthampton  MA  where the operations of an expanding plant spread the asbestos to the surrounding environment  into the air and onto the soil  I intend to discuss this problem in great detail as the debate moves forward  I raise it now as a dramatic example of one of the major injustices caused by the arbitrary exclusion of a large number of asbestos victims from compensation under the trust fund  Page S702  The red spots on this chart show where these other communities were contaminated  The larger the spot  the more shipments  We can see these spots all over the country  Yet these communities are not compensated for it  although one community is  other communities are not  The problem of  community contamination is not limited to the sites receiving ore from Libby  Community asbestos contamination can result from many different sources  For example  medical experts believe it may result from exposure to asbestos after the collapse of the WorId Trade Center  Because of the long latency period  we often do not learn about community asbestos contamination until long after it occurs  Certainly these victims of asbestos are entitled to fair treatment as well  They should not be arbitrarily excluded from compensation as if their suffering is somehow less worthy of recognition than the suffering of other asbestos victims  Yet  that is what S 852 does  This is a bill that shifts more of the financial burden of asbestos induced disease to injured workers by unfairly and arbitrarily limiting the liability of defendants  It does not establish a fair and reliable system that will compensate all those who are seriously ill due to asbestos  It lacks a dependable funding stream which can ensure that all who are entitled to compensation actually receive full and timely payment  These are very basic shortcomings  We cannot allow what justice requires to be limited by what the wrongdoers are willing to pay  I intend to vote no and I urge my colleagues to do the same     I yield the floor
