         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I applaud President Bush for enacting this landmark reauthorization of the Head Start program   By an overwhelming margin  Congress has elected to keep Head Start on its successful path  and to enable the program to thrive and improve        With this bill  were reaching out early to make greater opportunities available for thousands of our neediest children   Were providing a fairer chance for very young children to grow up healthy and safe   Were preparing them to enter school ready to learn  and to graduate from high school ready to go on to college and achieve the American dream      This reauthorization maintains the high standards and comprehensive services in Head Start   It upgrades the educational aspects and quality of the program   It dedicates greater resources to training Head Start teachers  and sets specific goals for their learning and development   And it expands the successful Early Head Start program to reach up to 8 000 additional infants and toddlers living in poverty      Two years ago  the Government Accountability Office confirmed many of my long standing concerns with this Administrations Head Start National Reporting System  concluding that their test of 4  and 5  year olds in the program is not a valid determinations about Head Starts quality or about the children it serves   That study also confirmed that the test was inconsistent with nationally recognized testing standards and unclear in its purpose      Im pleased that  on a bipartisan basis  Congress has terminated the flawed National Reporting System   This reauthorization will ensure that any assessment used from this point forward in Head Start programs will be valid and reliable  fair to children from all backgrounds  and measure the whole child   Head Start children and their families deserve nothing less      The focus on local neighborhoods and their children has always been at the heart of the Head Start program  which is why Congress also rejected the Bush Administrations flawed approach to block grant Head Start   This Administrations block grant for Head Start proposed to block out its guarantee of comprehensive services for children and families   Head Starts design enables it to tailor its services to meet local community needs  and this reauthorization will maintain a universal standard of quality across every Head Start center in the nation        Most importantly  this reauthorization signals a commitment to invest more in our youngest children  and to assist Head Start in responding to the changing and evolving needs of its children   I am disappointed that President Bush has distanced himself from the funding commitment this bill provides   While the President has asked Congress to approve spending  433 million per day in Iraq  he says the modest increase in this bill to help our neediest children prepare for school is too much  an increase that  over 3 years  is equivalent to the cost of only two days in Iraq   I hope the President will join Congress in providing the resources needed for Head Start to grow and succeed           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
