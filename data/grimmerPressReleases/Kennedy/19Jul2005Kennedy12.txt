         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     This is a critical moment for this countrys future  If John Roberts is confirmed  he will have a vital role in setting the direction of the country for generations to come    The Supreme Court is often the last line of defense for the freedoms and liberties for hundreds of millions of Americans  Few responsibilities of the Senate are more important than reviewing the qualifications of nominees for the Supreme Court  Every Senator  Republican or Democrats  has a responsibility to determine whether Mr  Roberts deserves to join the currently closely divided court when so much is at stake  Its wrong for any Senator to be a rubberstamp    All of us in the Senate who have been through this process know the importance of this process  Every American ought to be asking some tough questions right now about whether Mr  Roberts is fit to serve on the highest court in the land    Will he protect average Americans when their rights are abused by powerful corporations     Will he ensure that private companies arent allowed to pollute our rivers and lakes and our air    Will he protect and preserve the progress weve made on equal opportunity and fairness for all Americans    Will he separate his personal ideology from the rule of law and protect the rights and freedoms of all Americans  not just the powerful or the wealthy    Justice OConnor set a high standard  She tried to bring the nation together  and she respected the Constitution  She was a mainstream conservative who used her ability and respect for the rule of law to find solutions that would strengthen us as a nation  as the Constitution intended     Mr  Roberts must demonstrate that he meets that standard before the American people  and he will have an opportunity to do so before the Senate Judiciary Committee before the coming weeks    No nominee  especially a nominee who is well known to have argued ideological positions on issues important to the American people  should be confirmed without full and candid disclosure and discussion of those positions and their importance to him    I welcome the opportunity to question Mr  Roberts  and believe that the American people will know at the end of this process whether he should advance to the Supreme Court    We have a responsibility to the Constitution and to the American people and their children and grandchildren to get this right    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
