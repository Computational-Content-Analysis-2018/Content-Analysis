         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement   Republicans are playing politics with the lives of hardworking people who struggle each day to provide for their families   It may be a political game for Republicans  but its a hard reality for low wage workers who worry every day if they can pay the bills   Its political blackmail to say the only way that minimum wage workers can get a raise is to give tax giveaways to the wealthiest Americans   Members of Congress raised their own pay  no strings attached   Surely  common decency suggests that minimum wage workers deserve the same respect    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
