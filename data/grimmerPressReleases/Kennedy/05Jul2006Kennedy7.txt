         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                    Mr  Chairman  thank you for calling this important hearing on comprehensive immigration reform and temporary worker programs    Two hundred thirty years and one day ago  here in Philadelphia  we declared our independence and launched a nation of freedom and opportunity that is the envy of the world  So today  as we consider immigration reform  we have a solemn duty to uphold our one nation under God  with liberty and justice for all  and to preserve and strengthen it for future generations   The challenge before us is complex  We cannot solve it  as the House of Representatives has proposed  by simply building more fences at the border  demonizing the 12 million undocumented immigrants  declaring them and the priests and Good Samaritans who help them to be criminals  and naively hoping they just go home   Those on the far right who continue that enforcement only  anti immigrant drumbeat may think its good politics  But their pandering threatens real progress toward effective immigration reform that protects our security and reflects our values as a nation of immigrants    We have tried it their way by simply beefing up the border  Weve spent more than  20 billion on it over the past decade  and it has not worked   It is a formula for failure that will assure continued illegal immigration and leave us weak and less secure  It disparages good  hardworking immigrant families that have come here to improve their lives and to contribute to America  some of whom serve in our armed forces and are risking their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan today   They should instead listen to President Bush and to a bipartisan majority in the United States Senate when we came together to say that a complex problem such as immigration requires a comprehensive solution  They should listen to business leaders  religious leaders  and community leaders when we came together to pass effective reform  But most of all  they should listen to the American people who want immigration laws that not only will keep out those who would harm us  but welcome those who would help us   The reforms we passed in the United States Senate  under the leadership of Chairman Specter  Senator McCain and many others  started by modernizing and strengthening our enforcement  But to succeed  we knew that we must take other realistic and effective steps at the same time  Clearly we are not going to round up and deport millions of men  women  and children  or to expect that enforcement could be made so harsh  that five percent of our workforce would decide to self deport  So our reforms bring the 12 million undocumented immigrants who are here now out of the shadows so that they may earn the privilege of becoming taxpaying  fully contributing citizens and members of society  And for the future  we recognize that the demand for immigrants will continue    Therefore  we provide a way for qualified immigrants to come here legally to meet the needs of employers and our economy while protecting the wages and jobs of American citizens   Todays hearing focuses on several important issues  whether state and local law enforcement should be in the business of enforcing federal civil immigration laws and whether immigration reform should include a new temporary worker program   One of the most controversial and counterproductive policies the enforcement only proponents have proposed is the use of state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce federal civil immigration laws    I have heard strong objections from state and local officials around the country who believe such a policy will seriously hamper  and not enhance  their efforts to fight crime and protect us from future terrorist attacks  The concerns raised are shared by many conservatives and security experts   all say that this would unreasonably burden local law enforcement  irreparably damage community policing programs  impose heavy financial costs on state and local governments and jeopardize the safety our neighborhoods and diverse communities    Most importantly  this proposal undermines our national security  Since 9 11  security experts have repeatedly asserted that good intelligence is the key to ensuring national security  Ground truth comes from all sources  and often from immigrant communities  If communication shuts down because immigrants are afraid to approach local law enforcement for fear of being deported  then we lose important information and we jeopardize the security of our nation    Let me turn now to the issue of issue of immigrant workers  Some question whether immigrant workers make important contributions to the American economy  Economists tell us that the answer to that question is yes  A recent letter signed by 500 economists  including five Nobel laureates  states clearly that immigration has been a net gain for     American citizens  that immigrants do not take American jobs  and that the benefits of immigration outweigh its costs  I request unanimous consent that the entire letter be added to the record   The fact is immigrants bring job skills which complement those of US workers     Its true at the high end of the skills spectrum  where immigrants represent forty to fifty percent of US graduate students in strategic fields such as engineering and the physical sciences  High tech employers need the worlds best and brightest workers to remain competitive and to create more jobs for Americans here at home    Its also true at the low end of the skills spectrum  where employers in much of the country are unable to find U S  workers willing and able to do needed jobs in agriculture  building maintenance  health care  and food service  These are essential jobs as America shifts from an industrial to a post industrial economy  Eight of the fifteen occupations projected by the Labor Department to have the fastest growth in the next decade are in fields especially dependant on immigrant labor    The Senates guest worker program and green card reforms will ensure that the supply of visas meets the demands of our economy  Its the most realistic step we can take to fix our broken immigration system and create the conditions for successful enforcement  And it provides greater assurance that future immigration will be within the law  instead of underground  so that immigrants are less likely to be exploited  less likely to harm American wages and jobs  and are more likely to pay taxes    We must make sure that a temporary worker program avoids the brutal legacy of exploitation that tarnished past guest worker programs  Anything less will subject migrants to abuse and undermine the jobs  wages and working conditions of U S  workers    The Senate bill addresses these concerns by establishing the best temporary worker program in our nations history     Temporary workers will not replace US workers  Employers may hire an immigrant only after spending 60 days attempting to recruit US workers at the prevailing wage being offered    Prevailing wages will be high enough to protect American workers  relying on the Davis Bacon Act  the Service Contract Act  collective bargaining agreements  and Labor Department surveys   Foreign labor contractors will be tightly regulated  temporary workers will not be able to circumvent the law by working as independent contractors       Temporary workers will be able to change jobs  Employers must comply with the rules or risk losing their labor force      Temporary workers will be able to join unions  and cannot be hired if the company is involved in a labor dispute   Perhaps most important  temporary workers will have the right to adjust to permanent residence after one to four years  High skilled workers already have this opportunity  and the same standards should apply to other immigrant workers  too   Finally  the bill authorizes funding for 2 000 new Labor Department inspectors  History tells us that boots on the ground enforcement is essential to prevent workers from being victimized by bad apple employers who disrupt wages and working conditions   The Senate bill also incorporates the AgJOBS bill which will give farm workers and their families the dignity and justice they deserve  and give agricultural employees a legal workforce  The legislation provides a fair and reasonable way for undocumented agricultural workers to earn legal status  And it reforms the current visa program  so that employers unable to find American workers can hire needed foreign workers and workers receive the protections they deserve    The more we consider this issue  the clearer it becomes that immigrant workers are essential for our economic security and growth  and that the Senate temporary worker program is the right way to manage their contribution and prevent undocumented employment      30    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner
