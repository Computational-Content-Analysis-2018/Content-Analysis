         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C   Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   today introduced legislation to protect the jobs of highly skilled civil servants at the Internal Revenue Service whose positions are slated for elimination  Senator Kennedys bill will enable the employees to transfer their skills to other divisions within the agency rather than become unemployed   Senator Kennedy said  It doesnt make sense to lose professionals who have served the agency so well  particularly when they have transferable skills the agency can use in other areas  This bill will untie the agencys hands  so that it can retain these valuable employees  and not lose their expertise altogether    In August  the IRS announced the elimination of 157 estate and gift tax attorney positions  reducing the overall total by 46 percent  Twenty two of these attorneys  who perform complex audits on compliance with estate and gift tax laws  are in the Boston IRS office  The attorneys are targeted for separation between September 30  2006 and January 3  2007  The IRS considered reassigning the attorneys  but  the agency was advised that current law does not permit the agency to transfer these high skilled attorneys to other divisions within the agency  Kennedys bill will make such transfers possible     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
