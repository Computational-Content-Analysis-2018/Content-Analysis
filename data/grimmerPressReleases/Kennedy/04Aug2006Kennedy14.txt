         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner August 4  2006                                             202  224 2633          WASHINGTON  D C     The U S  Senate early Friday returned the nomination of Richard Stickler to head the federal mine safety agency to the White House       Americas coal miners need to have faith that the top man in the federal mine safety agency has their protections as priority one   In large respect  the lives of our coal miners are in the hands of the leader of the mine safety agency   That person must have the confidence of the miners and the ability to win Senate confirmation  Byrd said   Without Senate confirmation  doubts will continue to linger about the Administrations commitment to the safety of our coal miners       Senator Byrd and Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   the leading Democratic member of the Senate mine safety oversight committee  led the effort to reject the Stickler nomination on Friday morning   Byrd and Kennedy have expressed concerns with the nominees record  and hoped that the Senate action on Friday would provide the Bush Administration with the opportunity to nominate someone more focused on miner safety       I join Senator Byrd in insisting that the Stickler nomination be returned to the President   Its unconscionable in the midst of the current mine safety crisis  the President would send us such an unsuitable choice for this key position  Senator Kennedy added  Mr  Sticklers record demonstrates that throughout his career he has focused on profits and production  not worker safety   I urge the President to send the Senate a new nominee who will give Americas miners the protection they deserve       Byrd and Kennedy relied on a Senate Rule to send the nomination back to the White House   According to Senate Rule 31  whenever the Senate adjourns for more than 30 days  all nominations pending are  in essence  rejected and returned to the President   Normally  that rule is waived and the nominations remain open for further consideration   However  on Friday  Byrd and Kennedy objected to waiving that rule for the Stickler nomination  and the Senate followed their lead       We have a moral obligation to do everything we can to put an end to the safety crisis in our nations mines   To meet that obligation  we must insist that the agency supposed to be the safety watchdog has bite as well as bark   We need a strong leader at MSHA who will place miner safety above all other priorities at the agency  Byrd stated       This is an opportunity for the White House to step up and show that it is sincere when it tells coal miners that their safety is paramount  Byrd said       Byrd noted that  earlier this year in response to fatal coal mining tragedies in West Virginia and many other states  the Congress created new mine safety laws   But those laws  Byrd argued  mean little if the agency responsible for implementing them places increased production above better safety protections       The Bush Administration now has several options   It can nominate a different individual to lead the Mine Safety and Health Administration  it can renominate Mr  Stickler for the position  or it can use its Constitutional authority to appoint Mr  Stickler or another individual to the post while the Senate is in recess during August
