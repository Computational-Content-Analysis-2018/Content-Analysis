         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      SUMMARY OF BILL AND FACT SHEET INCLUDED  I am pleased to join my colleague  Senator Enzi  and all the Members of our Committee  in putting forth legislation to renew the Higher Education Act of 1965  Leading up to the creation of the Higher Education Act  my brother  President Kennedy  said this  Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education  Our requirements for world leadership  our hopes for economic growth  and the demands of citizenship itself in an era such as this all require the maximum development of every young American s capacity  The human mind is our fundamental resource  Those words rang true then and they ring true today  as our country is once again in a time of war and faces great economic challenge  Equal access to higher education touches every aspect of American life  In order to compete effectively in the global economy and ensure well qualified armed forces  we need to equip all of our citizens with a sound education from pre kindergarten to college  Each year  400 000 qualified students dont go to a 4 year college  simply because they cannot afford to do so  Equally devastating is the fact that only 47  of low income 8th graders will be academically prepared for college at the time of high school graduation in 2004  compared to 86  of their higher income peers  We are a better nation than that  we are a nation that believes in promise and opportunity for all of our citizens  This bill expired in 2003 and was last updated in 1998  We cant afford to wait any longer to reaffirm our commitment to higher education in this country and create a framework so that our students are prepared to meet the challenges of this new century I am pleased that we are able to swiftly move to this bill after passage of the Higher Education Access Act of 2007 last Thursday  Together they make up our comprehensive higher education package  I thank my colleagues and particularly the work of Senator Enzi for ensuring that these two parts are moving in tandem  There is no doubt that the student aid in the Access Act is the single most important thing we can do to increase access for college ready low income students  But it is also our responsibility to ensure that the multi billion dollar investment of taxpayer dollars weve made to student aid is delivered in the most equitable  effective  and simple way possible  This bill will take steps to ensure the greatest return on this investment by  addressing rising college costs  reforming the student loan system so it works for students  not banks  simplifying the federal aid application process  strengthening college preparation programs like GEAR UP and TRIO  and promoting high quality and effective teacher preparation programs  As we provide more aid to students  this bill recognizes that colleges need to do their part to keep college costs down  The cost of college has more than tripled over the last twenty years  Today  average tuition  fees  and room and board at public colleges are almost  13 000 a year and theyre more than  30 000 at private colleges  The Higher Education Amendments of 2007 will hold colleges accountable for skyrocketing college costs by creating a nationwide watch list of colleges whose costs are increasing at a rate greater than their peers  and by encouraging the Department of Education and colleges to publish more consumer friendly information about college costs and programs To ensure that this aid is directed to students    its intended beneficiaries    we must keep them informed about their choices and hold colleges and lenders accountable for getting students the best loan deal possible  As investigations by New York Attorney General Cuomo  other states  and our Committee have found  many lenders are entering into sweetheart deals with colleges  Some lenders offer gifts to college and university employees in order to secure their students loan business  Weve documented how lenders who participate in the federal student loan program offer educational conferences at luxury hotels  and offer free entertainment and free tickets to sporting events to college officials in order to entice those officials to recommend the lenders to their students  Our legislation makes these practices illegal  and protects students by ensuring that when a college recommends a lender  its based on the best interest of students and nothing else To ensure students have access to the federal financial aid they are eligible for  we must simplify the financial aid process for all students by reforming the Free Application for Federal Student Aid  As you can see here  the form is currently 10 pages long and includes over 100 questions  This acts as a barrier to low  and middle income students applying for the aid they need for college  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Reed and Senator Enzi  this bill will dramatically simplify the FAFSA and examine how we can streamline the federal financial aid process even more in the future  Our bill will make the financial aid application process more student friendly by immediately creating a new 2 page EZ FAFSA for low income students and phasing out the current long paper FAFSA within 5 years  It will also create a pilot program that lets students know that they have access to federal aid for college earlier  by allowing students to receive an aid determination or estimate in their junior year of high school  Ensuring access to adequate grant aid is one component of solving the college access crisis  but we must also ensure that more students are graduating from high school ready to succeed in college  In 2001  colleges required one third of all freshmen to take remedial courses in reading  writing  or math  Because so many high school students are not learning the basic skills to succeed in college or work  the nation loses more than  3 7 billion a year  This figure includes  1 4 billion to provide remedial education to students who have recently completed high school  In addition  this figure factors in the almost  2 3 billion that the economy loses because remedial reading students are more likely to drop out of college without a degree  thereby reducing their earning potential  This bill includes provisions championed by Senator Brown to maintain the strength of the TRIO and GEAR UP programs  which provide underprivileged students with the support they need to go to college and graduate from college  The Higher Education Act of 1965 established The National Teachers Corps  a federally funded Great Society program to develop our nations teaching force  This bill continues that tradition by promoting high quality and effective preparation programs for new and prospective teachers and recruiting and retaining high quality teachers in high need schools  Finally  this bill will create a new student safety grant program to help colleges and universities improve their campus safety and emergency response systems  As the nightmare at Virginia Tech made us all too aware  tragedy can strike anywhere  including on college campuses  This legislation received unanimous bipartisan support in Committee and I hope to see that same support demonstrated today  Our students cannot afford any alternative     SUMMARY OF S  1642  THE HIGHER EDUCATION
