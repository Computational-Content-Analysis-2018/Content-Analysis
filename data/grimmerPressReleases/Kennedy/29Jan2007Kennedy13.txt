         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I m saddened to learn of Father Drinan s death  All of us who knew him and served with him admired him for his deep faith  his profound commitment to public service  and the bold actions he constantly urged us to take to live up to our principles  especially in ending the Vietnam War  He was a profile in courage in every sense of the word  and the nation has lost one of the finest persons ever to serve in Congress    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
