the issues raised in todays hearing  The bill will seek to hold federal agencies responsible for protecting servicemembers employment rights  Kennedys legislation will also require that agencies collect veterans employment data in a uniform way so that problems can be identified and fixed      STATEMENT OF EDWARD M  KENNEDY  PROTECTING THE EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS  OF THOSE WHO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES  SENATE HELP COMMITTEE  NOVEMBER 8  2007     This Sunday  the nation will celebrate Veterans Day  On that solemn day we honor the generations of soldiers who have fought for our country in all the nations wars   We mourn for those who have lost their lives on the battlefield  And we express our immense gratitude  particularly to the members of our armed forces who have served so bravely in recent years in Iraq and Afghanistanboth those who have returned home and those still in harms way         Since September 11th  one and a half million of our servicemen and women have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan  and more than 630 000 members of the National Guard and Reserves have been mobilized   Our forces have now been in Iraq for four and one half yearslonger than our military was engaged in World War II       Our government has asked all of these brave men and women to make immense sacrifices for our country    Theyve been sent far from their homes for extended tours of duty   Weve asked them to leave their families and their jobs   Weve asked them to risk their lives  and more than 3 800 of them have made the ultimate sacrifice   In fact  this year  more soldiers have died in Iraq than in any other year of the war   Theyve put our national security first  and the nation owes them an immense debt of gratitude   When these heroes return home  we owe them more than kind words or prayers   We must do whatever we can to help them make the transition back to civilian life         Many veterans need to return quickly to their former jobs  to support their families   Our federal laws are meant to speed that transition  by requiring companies to quickly reemploy our nations veterans and ensure they dont lose out at work because they answered the call of duty             However  Department of Defense figures being released today show that tens of thousands of veterans returning home have faced the harsh reality that their service to our country has cost them the salary they deserve  their health care  and other benefits  and even their jobs   Among members of the Reserves and National Guard                  Nearly 11 000 were denied prompt reemployment                  More than 22 000 lost seniority and rightful pay                   Nearly 20 000 saw their pensions cut                  More than 15 000 did not receive the training they needed to resume their former jobs                 Nearly 11 000 did not get their health insurance back        Even more disturbing  veterans who seek help face a Walter Reed like nightmarea system that is crumbling and failing to serve them when they need it most   They have to negotiate a maze of bureaucracy   They can be shuffled among multiple agenciesonly to find after all the bureaucratic run around that they still may have to pay a lawyer to file their case in court        With a system like this  its no wonder that 77  of all veterans say they dont even bother to seek help when they face reemployment problems    A third say they have no idea where to turn  or dont believe that their problems would be fixed         Our laws require the federal government to defend veterans rights  but those who seek help must wait for months  even years  just to get a simple answer about whether the government will take their case to court                   The Department of Labor  where the vast majority of claims are referred  has taken years to resolve complaints   One case has even been open for 7 years   Federal employees seeking help waited an average of 8 months before their cases were referred to yet another agencythe Office of Special Counselfor help    Nearly half of all veterans who sought help from the Department of Labor last year said that they were dissatisfied with the assistance they received        Of the nearly 1 400 complaints the Department received in 2006  it referred only 24 casesless than 2 to other agencies for prosecution that year   As a result  the Attorney General filed only 4 federal cases on behalf of veterans in 2006  and the Office of Special Counsel litigated only a single case referred by the Department of Labor      In a situation where tens of thousands of our veterans are having reemployment problems  these numbers are appalling         Even worse  weve done little to help disabled veterans to meet the unique challenges they face    More than 28 000 soldiers have been wounded in action since 9 11  thousands of them seriously enough to need help to return to their former civilian jobs   Incredibly  the federal agencies tell us they dont even know what the scope of the problem isbecause they dont follow disability cases in a uniform manner        This gross abdication of responsibility to our veterans is unacceptable   These brave men and women have risked their lives to protect usyet we are failing to protect them      Today we will seek answers from the agencies about why more isnt being done   We also will hear from the Government Accountability Office  whose staff has produced several comprehensive reports about these problems  including two reports earlier this year   I look forward to hearing further about the in depth work they have done        Were also honored to have with us several veterans  Tammy Duckworth  Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs and an Iraq War veteran  Retired Lieutenant Colonel Steve Duarte  and Lieutenant General Dennis M  McCarthy  Executive Director of the Reserve Officers Association        I know there are a number of men and women in the audience here who have served our country  We commend them for their service  and for their strong commitment to seek fairness for all veterans and servicemembers        We know we can never truly repay our veterans for their immense sacrifices   They have fought hard overseas for our country  and it is up to us to fight just as hard for them when they return home to the heroes welcome they so justly deserve              Senator Kennedy on Needs of Returning Veterans and Flaws In The System   Watch the Video  Transcript   When these heroes return home  we owe them more than kind words or prayers

found there was 27  that were dissatisfied  now in 2006 it is up to 44   We find that the percentage  and these are the Department of Defense survey figures  as of Oct  17th  So the dissatisfaction is not going down  The number of the complaints has stabilized  gone up  somewhat  And that is something    Now lets take the total number the  veterans  that go  to the Department of Labor for help  now  almost half of them are dissatisfied  So we ask ourselves  How many go there  How many go there  And we find out its  about 77  that did not seek the assistance  This is again Department of Defense status component  So only about 25 to 30  actually sought assistance  Other ones that sought the assistance  almost 50  of those are dissatisfied    Iraq Veteran Tammy Duckworth Describes How Federal Agencies Dont Work Effectively With States    Watch the Video  Transcript   The other thing that we do is that we also recognize in the state that outreach is a major issue  So in Illinois  Governor Blagojevich has now increased the number of our veterans service officers  we now have 73 of them in 50 field offices  So our veterans service officers will actually go to a veterans home and sit at his kitchen table and talk to him about his USERRA rights  talk to him about his federal rights  and also all of the state benefits   Unfortunately  one of the downfalls that we have is that there is no communication between the federal and the state  DoD and U S   Veterans Affairs Department  will not tell me when someone is coming home so that I can send a service officer to help him  Oftentimes  the first time I hear about a veteran who has come home to the state of Illinois is when he gets in trouble  Hes homeless  and the homeless shelter calls us  or he has been self medicating  he gets a DUI  and now hes in trouble with the law  The local state troopers give us a call  hey  we have another one of yours  come help him   Wed like to intervene before he gets into trouble  but there is not agreement  In fact  DoD and USVA have been negotiating an information sharing agreement for the past three years and they cant come to an agreement between two federal agencies  let alone use us  I have a budget of  105M  I have over 1 000 employees  I am here to help  I ask you to consider urging the federal government  USERRA  all of these organizations  to look to the states and put us to work to help us reach our veterans     Lt  Col  Steve Duarte Describes How Departments of Defense and Labor Ignored His Employment Problems   Watch the Video  Transcript     The DOL  I contacted them from the number they gave me at ESGR and they were equally ineffective  The person that I spoke at the Department of Labor VETS  and I quote  she said  Unless you are termination was for military reasons  you have no case  And they  again  offered no guidance  mediation  investigational resource  or any referral of any process I should follow       Watch the Video  Transcript        Melissa
