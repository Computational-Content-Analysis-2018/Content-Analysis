         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Boston  MA   Senator Edward M  Kennedy today discussed the critical need to expand health insurance coverage across the country and the role that public hospitals and health systems play in that effort  Senator Kennedy will be honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award for his enduring commitment to the expansion of health coverage  and his belief that quality health care is a right for all Americans   The safety net has never been more important than it is today  said Senator Kennedy  The number of uninsured Americans continues to rise every year  Its now 47 million  with millions more under insured  More and more working families are finding themselves in poverty because their wages arent keeping up with inflation  Countless middle income families cant keep up with the rising costs and are easily forced into bankruptcy when faced with a serious illness   Senator Kennedy played a key role in the development and creation of the historic Massachusetts health care reform legislation that took effect this week  securing over  380 million in a federal Medicaid funding waiver  The National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems  NAPH  is an organization representing over 100 of the nations large public hospitals and health systems that is united in a mission to provide high quality health care to all  regardless of ability to pay  The Cambridge Health Alliance  a part of NAPH  is an academic health system based in Cambridge  Somerville and Bostons metro north region that serves over 400 000 residents whose mission is to improve the health of all in the community     REMARKS OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD OCTOBER 11  2006   As prepared for Delivery    Were blessed here in Massachusetts with a strong health care safety net  There have been many challenges in recent years  but with your strong leadership and dedicated providers  vulnerable patients in Massachusetts continue to have access to high quality health care    The safety net has never been more important than it is today  The number of uninsured Americans continues to rise every year  Its now 47 million  with millions more under insured  More and more working families are finding themselves in poverty because their wages arent keeping up with inflation  Countless middle income families cant keep up with the rising costs and are easily forced into bankruptcy when faced with a serious illness   Public hospitals have long provided health care for all patients  regardless of their ability to pay  Today  the overwhelming majority of your patients are uninsured or on Medicaid  and have low incomes or are members of minority groups  Astonishing as it is  the Association represents only 2  of all hospitals across the nation  but you provide almost a quarter of all uncompensated hospital care     In doing so  the challenges facing public hospitals have never been greater  Recent years have brought cuts in important programs such as Medicaid and the training of health professionals  You face new demands such as threats of bioterrorism and pandemic flu  and the ever increasing numbers of the uninsured    Despite these challenges  you continue to provide high quality care to all  Patients at public hospitals in Massachusetts are fortunate to have access to the latest technology  and to the kind of comprehensive care available to those who are better off    Public hospitals are outstanding members of the community  Here in Cambridge  the hospital is so essential to the community that the public health department is part of the Cambridge Health Alliance and your CEO Dennis Keefe also serves as public health commissioner  You know that health care is more than just caring for the acutely ill  It also involves effective community outreach  prevention  and patient education to address challenges such as obesity  asthma  and diabetes  At the same time  good health care provides good jobs for members of the community   Nevertheless  serious and unjustified health disparities continue to exist in our nation today  and some of the most shameful involve racial and ethnic minorities who now constitute about a third of the nations population and more than half of the uninsured  They suffer a greater burden of illness and death than the white population  African Americans have a lower life expectancy than whites  and are much more likely to die from stroke than their white counterparts  Asian and Pacific Islander women are fifty percent more likely to have cervical cancer compared to white women  and American Indian and Alaska Native men have a 30  higher chance of stomach and liver cancers    Many Americanseven physicianswant to believe such disparities dont exist  But ignoring them only contributes more to the widening gap between the haves and have nots  Its a scandal that people of color have greater difficulty obtaining good health care than other Americans  Peoples health should not depend on the color of their skin  the size of their bank account  or where they live  In a nation as advanced as ours  with its state of the art ability to prevent illness and care for the sick  its appalling that these disparities continue to proliferate   Thats why I introduced legislation earlier this month as part of an effort to eliminate these unacceptable disparities   Greater diversity in the health workforce is a key part of ending these disparities  African Americans  Hispanic Americans  and other minorities account for only 6 percent of the nation s doctors and 7 percent of nurses and dentists  even though they are almost one third of the U S  population  The disparity in the health workforce must be ended  not just to fulfill our commitment to equality of opportunity  but because of the impact it has on health care  since minority health professionals are more likely to care for minority patients  including those who are low income and uninsured   A diverse health workforce is essential for a healthy country  But  emphasizing workforce diversity does not mean that health care workers of all races should not be prepared to work with diverse patients  We must make a more serious effort to train culturally competent health professionals  We need to create a health care system that is accessible for the more than 46 million Americans who speak a language other than English at home   The bill Ive introduced creates an Internet clearinghouse to help increase cultural competency and improve communication between health providers and patients  It also supports the development of curricula on cultural competence in health professions schools   Language barriers in health care obviously contribute to reduced access and lesser care for those who have limited English proficiency or low health literacy  The issue is important for the overall quality of our health care system  and the bill provides funds to improve and encourage services for such patients    In addition  the proposal will strengthen research in health care quality  by establishing a grant program for healthcare delivery sites  and encourages public private partnerships to evaluate and identify the best practices in disease management strategies     You know all this is needed  because youre on the front lines every day  attempting to break down these barriers  Public hospitals know that cultural competency and a diverse workforce are necessary if we are to be successful  Immigrants need to know that theyll be safe if they come in for care  Only with this kind of comprehensive approach can we hope to reduce these unjust disparities and eliminate them once and for all   Its gratifying to know that here in Massachusetts  the business community  health providers  consumer advocates and the legislature decided enough was enough  Working together  we enacted health reform as a major step toward health care for all   The Cambridge Health Alliance  Boston Medical Center and UMass Memorial are all essential for the success of these reforms  especially in the first few years  and especially in providing care for persons with low incomes  immigrants  members of minority groups  and those with substance abuse or mental health conditions      I hope that our success in Massachusetts will serve as an example and a beacon to other states and the nation as a whole  All of us obviously need to work harder to achieve our goal of good health care for all Americans  Its a travesty that at the federal level  instead of supporting the health safety net and working towards our longstanding goal of good health coverage for all  recent years have brought cuts in the programs that are so important to you  especially Medicaid  Hopefully next year will see changes in Washington  and health care for all will become a higher priority than care for special interests     Thank you so much again for this honor  and for the outstanding work you do each and every day  All of us in the Commonwealth are proud of your dedication and the excellent care you provide to those who need our help the most  Thank you very much     Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
