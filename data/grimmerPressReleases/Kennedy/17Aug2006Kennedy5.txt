         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  For Immediate Release     Washington  DC  Senate Democratic Leader Reid and Senator Ted Kennedy released a letter to President Bush addressing reports that his administration is considering alternative forms of governments in Iraq besides democracy  The Democratic leaders called on the President to fulfill his commitment to the American people that his administration will continue to promote democracy in Iraq and change the course from his failed  stay the course strategy  Staying the course and allowing Iraq to slip further into civil war  and further away from democracy  is not in the interests of our troops  taxpayers  or national security  America and Iraq deserve a new direction   The text of the letter is below     August 17  2006   The President The White House Washington  D C   Dear President Bush  According to todays New York Times  it was reported that Administration officials are beginning to plan for the possibility that Iraqs democratically elected government might not survive and that senior administration officials have acknowledgedthey are considering alternatives other than democracy    If true  we are deeply concerned that your Administration would even consider abandoning democracy in Iraq  Spreading democracy to Iraq  and to the entire Middle East  became your justification for the war in Iraq  after it was clear that Saddam Husseins weapons of mass destruction would not be found  As you said in April 2005  The establishment of a free Iraq at the heart of the Middle East will be a crushing defeat for the forces of tyranny and terror  and a watershed event in the global democratic revolution   However  such rhetoric from the Administration about the importance of creating democracy in Iraq has never been sufficiently backed by a long term strategy or financial commitment to the many non military steps essential to achieve democracy in Iraq  In the past year  for example  Congress appropriated  160 million to support the key non governmental democracy building organizations serving in Iraq because the Administration failed to budget for their important work  Congress is now poised to set aside an additional  70 million for their work through September 2007    The Iraqi people need to know that your Administration is still genuinely committed to building  strengthening and consolidating democracy in their land  The Iraqi people have placed their hopes for the future on the promise of a democratic Iraq and are paying a high price waiting for fulfillment of that promise    We hope these reports are not accurate  and that you will publicly reiterate Americas support for democracy in Iraq    Respectfully     __________________ __________________  Edward M  Kennedy Harry Reid   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
