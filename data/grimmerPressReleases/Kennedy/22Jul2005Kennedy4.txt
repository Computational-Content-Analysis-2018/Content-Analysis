         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C  Today  Senators Edward M  Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein have offered an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill to halt funding for the creation of nuclear weapons in this country    A nuclear bunker buster could be just as deadly as a nuclear weapon detonated above ground  The National Academy of Sciences report released in April predicted that if a bunker buster was used against a hard and deeply buried target in a densely populated urban area  the number of casualties could rise above a million casualties    The Kennedy Feinstein amendment would redirect  4 million in funds from the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator  a new class of nuclear weapon which the National Academies has already proven not to work as intended  and make them available to the Washington D C  National Guard for training and communications equipment in the event of an attack in Washington  a highly symbolic target for terrorist    Several retired military flag officers have also sent a letter to the United States Senate in support of the Kennedy Feinstein amendment calling for the removal of nuclear bunker busting funding  citing new nuclear weapons would erode the unparalleled conventional military superiority that the United States currently enjoys  The retired military officials contend that the Administration needs to cut funding for nuclear weapon development in order to reduce the threshold for such weapons     Continuing with its misplaced priorities  last night the Administration strongly objected to an independent inquiry into its policies and practices related to the detention of prisoners in Iraq  Guantanamo and elsewhere  and threatened to veto the defense bill if Congress requires changes to those policies  Kennedy believes the nation was well served by the thoughtful inquiry and timely recommendations of the 9 11 Commission but that the same light and wisdom needs to be applied when it comes to getting to the bottom of the prisoner abuse and our detention policies    Kennedy said  It s appalling that this administration is so afraid of the truth that they are willing to veto the defense bill  with the pay raise for the troops  uparmored humvees to protect our people in Iraq  and  50 billion in funding for the war  all to prevent the truth from coming out  If they have done nothing wrong  and have nothing to hide  they should welcome this amendment    This Administration knows more about stonewalling than they do about accountability  Yesterday they submitted an overdue report on Iraq that fails to give the American people the facts behind our Iraq policy that they clearly deserve    It s long past time to level with the American people    on the detention of prisoners  on what s really going on in Iraq  and on what lies ahead for our troops and their families      30    Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator FY06 National Defense Authorization Bill   Last night  the Administration strongly objected to an independent inquiry into its policies and practices related to the detention of prisoners in Iraq  Guantanamo and elsewhere  and threatened to veto the defense bill if Congress requires changes to those policies  The nation was well served by the thoughtful inquiry and timely recommendations of the 9 11 Commission  We need the same light and wisdom when it comes to getting to the bottom of the prisoner abuse and our detention policies    Its appalling that this administration is so afraid of the truth that they are willing to veto the

nothing wrong  and have nothing to hide  they should welcome this amendment    This Administration knows more about stonewalling than they do about accountability  Yesterday they submitted an overdue report on Iraq that fails to give the American people the facts behind our Iraq policy that they clearly deserve    It s long past time to level with the American people    on the detention of prisoners  on what s really going on in Iraq  and on what lies ahead for our troops and their families     For the past 60 years  one of the principal tenets of American national security policy has been to limit the number of nuclear weapons in the world  and to limit the number of countries that possess them    In 1962  President Kennedy warned that if action weren t taken at that time  there could be 20 nuclear weapons nations by the end of the 1970s  Because of initiatives he and successive presidents took to prevent that  today there are only eight nuclear armed states    Through careful negotiations  we arrived at the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty  the foundation of all current global nuclear arms control  The Non Proliferation Treaty  signed in 1968  has long stood for the fundamental principle that the world will be safer if nuclear proliferation does not extend to other nations     In that compact  184 nations have voluntarily rejected nuclear weapons  These include 40 states like Japan  Germany  Sweden  and Singapore  that have the technical infrastructure to build nuclear arsenals if they chose to do so  In addition  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Belarus  South Africa  Argentina  Brazil  Taiwan  South Korea  and others turned away from nuclear weapons because of the NPT and our leadership  America led the way to a safer world by example  By adhering to these carefully crafted agreements ourselves  we were able to discourage the spread of dangerous nuclear weapons that would threaten our security  However  the Bush Administration has abandoned that course  Not only has this White House expressed disdain for decades of nuclear arms control  but it now threatens to launch a new nuclear arms race  Just as we are discouraging North Korea and Iran from producing nuclear arms    and just as we are trying to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists    the Bush Administration recklessly proposes for the United States to produce a new breed of nuclear weapon  President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld want to develop a new tactical nuclear weapon that can burrow deep into the earth and destroy bunkers and weapons caches  The new weapon they propose has the chilling title of Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator  They hold the dangerous and misguided belief that our nation s interests are served by developing what they consider a more easily usable nuclear bomb    Most Americans believe that is wrong  Therefore  the amendment that Senator Feinstein and I offer today will halt this dangerous new policy and redirect the  4 million in funds from the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator research program to the National Guard for the more urgent task of preventing another terrorist attack on our nation s capital    This action is especially warranted in light of the bombings in the London subway  Instead of developing new nukes  we should address the real world challenges of terrorism that we face right here  right now    In the end  the Administration would like us to buy something that we don t need  that endangers us by its mere existence  and that makes our important diplomatic goals much more difficult to achieve    Our challenge in addressing nuclear non proliferation issues is not that there are too few nuclear weapons in the world  but that there are too many    not that they are too difficult to use  but too easy     North Korea has acquired nuclear weapons  and does not hesitate to rattle them  Iran is widely thought to be moving forward on the development of its nuclear weapons capacity  The increasing availability of nuclear technology to other nations is an ominous development  especially when it is difficult to accept at face value their statements that the technology is intended only for peaceful purposes     What moral authority do we have to ask other nations to give up their desire for nuclear weapons of their own  when we re developing a new generation of such weapons of our own  How can we tell other nations not to sell their nuclear technology to others  when we are exporting our own technology    For the past two years  Congress has raised major doubts about the bunker buster program and significantly cut back on its funding  But the Administration still presses forward for their development  For fiscal year 2004  they requested  15 million for it  and Congress reluctantly provided half that amount  For 2005  they requested another  27 million and submitted a five year request for nearly  500 million  and Congress denied their request    This year  nothing has changed  The FY06 budget request from the President includes  4 million for the Department of Energy to study the bunker buster and  4 5 million to the Department of Defense for the same purpose  Thankfully  our colleagues in the House were wiser  and eliminated these funds    The Administration obviously is still committed to this reckless approach  Secretary Rumsfeld made his position clear in January  when he wrote to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham  I think we should request funds in FY06 and FY07 to complete the studyYou can count on my support for your efforts to revitalize the nuclear weapons infrastructure and to complete the RNEP study     The FY06 budget requests funds only to complete the feasibility study for these new nuclear weapons  But we already know what the next step is  In the budget they sent us last year  the Administration stated in plain language that they intend to develop it     Ambassador Linton Brooks  the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration  claims the future budget projection was merely a placeholder  in the event the President decides to proceed with development and Congress approves  But their FY05 budget clearly shows the Administration s unmistakable intention to develop  and ultimately produce  this weapon     They would like us to believe that this is a clean  surgical nuclear weapon  They say it will burrow into underground targets and destroy them with no adverse consequences for the environment  But science says such claims are false    A National Academy of Sciences April 2005 study confirms exactly what most of us thought    that these nuclear weapons  like other nuclear bombs  result in catastrophic nuclear fallout  That can poison tens of millions of people and create radioactive lands for many years to come    The study goes on to say  Current experience and empirical predictions indicate that earth penetrator weapons cannot penetrate to depths required for total containment of the effects of a nuclear explosion  To be fully contained  a 300 kiloton weapon would have to be detonated at the bottom of a carefully stemmed emplacement hole about 800 meters deep  Because the practical penetration depth for an  Earth Penetrating Weapon  is a few metersa small fraction of the depth for the full containmentthere will be blast  thermal  initial nuclear radiation  and fallout effects from use of the weapon     Even if we were willing to accept the catastrophic damage a nuclear explosion would cause  the bunker buster would still not be able to destroy all of the buried bunkers the intelligence community has identified     This chart  based on data from the National Academy  depicts the simulated maximum effect of a one megaton earth penetrating weapon  This massively destructive weapon cannot reach deeper than 400 meters  All an adversary would have to do is bury its bunker below that depth    Bunker busters also require pinpoint accuracy to hit deeply buried  hardened bunkers  But such accuracy requires precise intelligence about the location of the target  As the study emphasized  an attack by a nuclear weapon can be effective in destroying weapon or weapons materials  including nuclear materials and chemical or biological agents    but only if it s detonated in the actual chamber where the weapons or materials are located  Even more disturbing  if the bomb is even slightly off target  the detonation may cause the spread of deadly chemicals and germs  in addition to the radioactive fallout     If it were clear that this weapon is needed to protect our troops  then Congress would probably support it  But that s not the case  At the House Armed Services Committee hearing in March  program chief Linton Brooks once again was asked if there is a military requirement for the bunker buster  He stated categorically  No  there is not    Our military has no need for a nuclear bunker buster  Existing conventional weapons have the ability to neutralize this threat  These charts from the National Academy show the types of deeply buried and hardened bunkers the nuclear bunker buster is intended to destroy  All bunkers must have air intakes  energy sources and entries  If we can destroy them by conventional means  we ve accomplished our purpose    The Administration s effort to build a new class of nuclear weapon is only further evidence of their reckless nuclear policy      We ve studied this issue long enough  It s ridiculous for the Administration to try to keep this program going  and it could be suicidal for the nation and for our troops  While the Administration studies a weapon that will never work  and may never be used  it has taken its eye off of the true danger  terrorists with weapons of mass destruction here at home  in our subways and train stations    Protecting our nation should be the administration s number one priority  and sadly have not learned the lessons from 9 11  The alarm bell that went off on September 11  2001 is still ringing loudly     It rang in London earlier this month and again yesterday  It rang in Madrid last year  And it has been ringing in Turkey  Indonesia  Morocco  Kenya and elsewhere across the globe in the nearly four years since the tragedy of 9 11    Here in our nation s capital  the alarm bell continues to sound  but the Administration has been inexcusably slow in heeding its warning     Our amendment will better protect our nation s capital from a terrorist attack  It provides urgently needed funds to the Washington DC National Guard to make up for the shortfalls they face in equipment and training     U S  officials plainly state that Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups are determined to strike the United States again  And we all know that our nation s capital is a prime target    On July 10th  Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said that the desire and the capability are there for another terrorist attack in America     The former Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security  Admiral James Loy  told the Senate Intelligence Committee on February 16  We believe that attacking the homeland remains at the top of Al Qaeda s operational priority listWe believe that their intent remains strong for attempting another major operation here  He said  The probability of an attack in the United States is assessed to be high        FBI Director Robert Mueller told the Intelligence Committee on February 16  The threat posed by international terrorism  and in particular from Al Qaeda and related groups  continues to be the gravest we face Al Qaeda continues to adapt and move forward with its desire to attack the United States using any means at its disposal  Their intent to attack us at home remainsand their resolve to destroy America has never faltered     Despite these serious and terrifying threats  the DC National Guard  which provides an indispensable role in responding to a terrorist attack  has long received inadequate funding    In its FY06 funding request  the DC National Guard currently has unfunded requirements of over  1 5 million for radios  satellite communications equipment and other similar equipment  It will also need  2 5 million for training and exercises    In a terrorist attack  the DC National Guard will be mobilized to assist in evacuation efforts  provide security at the attack site  and assist in mass casualty care     The threat of a terrorist attack in Washington DC is very real and although many steps have been taken to increase security  too many vulnerabilities still exist     Mayor Anthony Williams and the DC City Council recognized one such vulnerability  They passed a ban  which was subsequently overruled  prohibiting the CSX Railroad Company from transporting hazardous materials through the city  Its rail tracks pass only a few blocks from the Capitol Building    Mayor Williams and the City Council realize the vulnerability to such attacks and the potentially catastrophic consequences if terrorists attack a train carrying hazardous material    According to a RAND analysis on terrorism and railroad security  forty percent of freight being carried from city to city  across the country  including half of the nation s hazardous material  is moved by rail  In 2003 alone  11 400 railroad cars containing hazardous material passed through Washington  DC     Transporting hazardous material is inherently dangerous  In January  a freight train with chlorine gas derailed in Graniteville  a small town in South Carolina and a leak of the gas killed nine people  injured more than 200  and caused the evacuation of more than 5 000  South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford declared a state of emergency for the area  What would have happened if this accident had been a terrorist attack in a densely populated urban area like Washington    Richard Falkenrath  the former Deputy Homeland Security Advisor and Deputy Assistant to the President  warned Congress in January that  since 9 11 we have done essentially nothing to reduce vulnerability in transporting chemicals materials  He said that chemicals  such as chlorine gas  are basically World War I era chemical weapons  which we move through our cities in extraordinarily large quantities and quite low security    According to the DC City Council  A terrorist attack on a large quantity hazardous material shipment near the United States Capitol would be expected to cause tens of thousands of deaths and a catastrophic economic impact of  5 billion or more    With so much at stake  we must ensure that the DC National Guard is fully prepared to react immediately in the event of an attack  Adequate equipment and proper training are essential  RAND s terrorism and rail security analysis stated that simulation exercises and gamescan be help in identifying weaknesses in response capacities and deepen our understanding of how to resume activities in the aftermath of an attack    President Bush says the terrorists will not win on his watch  but we are unprepared here in his own backyard     The President is once again taking his eye off the real threat to our national securityan Al Qaeda attack here in the United Statesand has instead chosen to study ways to build the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator  Instead of providing the DC National Guard with the needed funds  the Bush Administration wants to divert scarce funds into a new nuclear arms race  Let s put the focus back where it belongs    For the sake of our national security  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
