         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C  Yesterday  House and Senate negotiators struck a deal on the  82 billion Iraq supplemental bill and included three of Senator Edward M  Kennedy s measures  Senator Kennedy led the fight in the United States Senate to secure millions of additional dollars for lifesaving humvee armor and held the President accountable on progress being made to train the Iraqi security forces and the impact on our troop levels  On immigration  Senator Kennedy and Mikulski fought to raise the cap on seasonal workers for small businesses  All three measures were included in the final conference report     The Kennedy    Bayh humvee amendment will give an additional 150 million dollars on top of the supplemental spending bill for the war in Iraq to ensure that humvee production remains at its maximum level through the fiscal year  Kennedy s troop level amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to provide Congress with an updated assessment of the number of troops we will need in Iraq through the end of 2006 and report every three months on Iraqi security forces  The first report must be provided 60 days after the President signs the bill into law     The immigration measure  sponsored by Senators Kennedy and Mikulski  will enable an average of 30 000 seasonal workers to continue to support the small businesses that are the backbone of tourism in Massachusetts and states across the country     I m encouraged that the House and Senate Republican leadership recognized how critical all three of these provisions are and included them in the final funding package for the war in Iraq  Kennedy said  It is unconscionable that our troops are under fire and unprotected and now  long overdue  they will have more of the lifesaving support they deserve  And now  the Administration is finally being required to tell Congress how many U S  troops will be necessary in Iraq through the end of 2006  The American people    and especially our men and women in uniform and their families    deserve to know how much real progress is being made in training Iraqi troops and how long our forces will be in Iraq  Hopefully  the Administration will submit these reports in good faith  and not attempt to classify this vital information     On the increase in seasonal workers  Kennedy added  The visas are a lifeline for small family businesses on Cape Cod and many other firms that rely overwhelmingly on seasonal workers to meet their heavy summer needs      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
