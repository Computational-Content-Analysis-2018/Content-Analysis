         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Congress recently provided nearly 12 million dollars to remedy a crisis in off site judicial security for our federal judges  The bill was a small  but necessary step toward increasing security for the distinguished men and women of our country who have been appointed to the courts  In the wake of the recent murder of a husband and mother of a federal judge at her home in Chicago  and the courtroom killings in Atlanta  it is clear we must do more to protect our judges as a matter of the highest urgency    These tragic recent deaths demonstrate that judges may be safe inside the walls of our well guarded courthouses  but they are vulnerable to disgruntled litigants in other places  even in their own homes  In fact  security in the homes of judges has long been a concern of the Judicial Conference  the principal decision making group for the federal courts  Sadly  three judges had previously been killed at in their homes  one in Texas in 1979  one in New York in 1988  and one in Alabama in 1989    The vast majority of threats are made by people angry about the outcome of a case in court  In the ten years since the first world trade center bombing  the federal judiciary has handled an increasing number of high threat matters    Judge Lefkow was the victim of an act of domestic terrorism arising from what should have been a routine civil matter  The leader of a White Supremacist group known as the World Church of the Creator  was convicted in April 2004 of soliciting an undercover FBI informant to murder the judge in retaliation for her decision against him in a trademark dispute  This brutal crime demonstrates the unstable environment in which our federal judges decide cases everyday    Shockingly  the risks faced by the honorable men and women who fill our independent judiciary have dramatically increased in the past two months  The source of that increased risk has not been Al Qaeda  White Supremacists  drug gangs  or mentally ill litigants  Instead  judges are at greater risk of being victimized today than four weeks ago due to venomous incitement from Republican members of Congress and their right wing  extremist surrogates    The comments are deplorable  House Republican Leader Tom DeLay has threatened the judges who participated in the Terri Schiavo proceedings  saying  the time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior  His colleague  Republican Congressman Steve King said that he intends to introduce legislation to bring the courts back to heel  maybe by removing their feeding tubes    a grisly reference to the death of Terri Schiavo    A recent conference  Confronting the Judicial War on Faith  was attended by leaders of the Republican Party  Ominously  one of the speakers  Edwin Vieira  said that his bottom line for dealing with the Supreme Court comes from Joseph Stalin  Vieira said  He had a slogan  and it worked very well for him  whenever he ran into difficulty   no man  no problem   Of course  Stalin s full comment  which Vieira undoubtedly knew  was Death solves all problems  no man  no problem  Vieira s comments were made in reference to Reagan appointee Justice Anthony Kennedy    Reckless  irresponsible comments like these create a culture where threats of violence become acceptable  It is not merely a coarsening of discourse  it is a numbing of sensibility  The attacks on the judiciary and the veiled threats of violence can easily lead to further tragedy  and we need to do all we can to prevent it    Federal judges deserve to be secure in their homes  They need to know that concrete steps are being taken immediately to reduce the risk of violence to them and their families  We need to stand up for our independent judiciary and do a better job of providing for their security     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
