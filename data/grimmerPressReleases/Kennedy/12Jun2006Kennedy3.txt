         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE               EASTON  MA Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy addressed the 62nd annual convention of young men at the American Legion Boys State Program  Four hundred high school juniors from all across Massachusetts heard Senator Kennedy speak on the critical need for participation in all levels of government    We did not make the world we live in  but we have the chance to change it  said Senator Kennedy  Each of you has the power to send forth your own ripple of hope  and many of you are already doing so   Boys State allows prominent young men to meet  listen  and interact with current political leaders as part of a weeklong program focused on government processes and American history    The American Legion created the Boys State Program  which is based on the belief that young men  and women in the Girls State program  should be given the opportunity to learn leadership skills and gain practical experience of the structure of American government  The program was initiated by Hayes Kennedy  an instructor at the Loyola University School of Law in Chicago  and it is now present in 49 states   Below are Senator Kennedys remarks as prepared for delivery     Senator Edward M  Kennedy Remarks to Boys State June 12  2006   As prepared for delivery   Vicki and I are honored to be here with all of you  and were inspired by your interest in public service  Boys State graduates accomplish great things  and we know that many of you will go on to major positions in the nations life   Throughout our history  America has been blessed that men and women of conscience  ability  and vision have responded to the nations call in times of need    I think of Rosa Parks  who through her simple  brave  and eloquent act shamed a nation into finally confronting the vast discrimination that many chose to ignore for so long   Without her act of civil disobedience  how much longer might we have waited for the spark of conscience to ignite the determination of millions of others to call for change   We did not make the world we live in  but we have the chance to change it  As my brother Robert Kennedy told the students in South Africa in 1966   Each time a person stands up for an ideal  or acts to improve the lot of others  or strikes out against injustice  he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope  and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring  those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance   Each of you has the power to send forth your own ripple of hope  and many of you are already doing so   When I look back over my years in the Senate  Im amazed at the progress weve made on issues of social justice  economic opportunity  and basic fairness  and it gives me hope for our future    When I first came to the Senate in 1963  nearly half of our senior citizens lived in poverty and poor health  Women were not equal in the workplace  and we know too well how the ingrained system of segregation made African Americans second class citizens  under constant threat of violence   The Civil Rights Act of 1964  The Voting Rights Act of 1965  Medicare  Womens rights in the 1970s  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991  all helped our nation come closer to living up to its ideals   None of these successes was easy  They required the sustained commitment of private citizens and elected officials of both parties to overcome entrenched opposition   When the Senate was debating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to outlaw segregation in public accommodations  we faced an intense filibuster    Martin Luther King  Jr   fearing it would succeed  appealed to supporters to join protests of segregated restaurants   Two who responded were the elderly mother of Massachusetts Governor Endicott Peabody  and the elderly wife of the Episcopal Bishop in Massachusetts  The sight of these two women being arrested and jailed for sitting in at the Ponce De Leon restaurant in St  Augustine  Florida attracted enormous national attention  and the ripples of hope they sent out helped create a national current that swept away the filibuster   Time and again throughout our history  weve learned that citizens have great power to find solutions to our problems  All they have to do is try   Our Founders had no model for creating the worlds most enduring democracy  and President Lincoln had no formula to keep the Union together   President Roosevelt did not have a handbook for pulling our nation out of the Depression  Harry Truman did not have all the answers immediately after World War II for rebuilding Western Europe   But at each of these critical times  they did have Americans ready  willing and able to serve their fellow citizens and reach out to others  Americans like all of you   Theres no doubt that were in a similar time of extraordinary challenges today  and again we need to call on the American people to help guide us through them   We all need to be part of the debate   We cannot shrink from the public square and leave it to others   We must find our way out of the quagmire in Iraq  As you know  I favor an early timetable for withdrawal of our troops  and I hope that it can happen as soon as possible  We have already lost too many brave young men and women there in a war America never should have fought   Another great challenge we face is to make globalization work for the American people     For fifty years after the end of the cold war  America dominated the world economy  Europe and Japan were still struggling to rebuild after World War II  and much of humanity was trapped behind the walls of Communism    We made wise decisions that created this prosperity and enabled it to flourish  We educated a generation of returning veterans through the GI Bill of Rights  and created a vital and growing middle class    But today  our edge is slipping  other countries want their turn in the limelight    Just in time delivery  the Internet  and the emergence of a well educated and entrepreneurial class in India and in China are changing the world in profound ways   Were not living up to these challenges of education  America has fallen from 3rd to 15th in producing scientists and engineers  and now were 28th in math and science   The new world economy is taking its toll on millions of families  who see their American dream undermined by inadequate wages  job losses  the evaporation of their pensions  and the soaring costs of college   As in other times  we dont have all the answers  but we know a few prudent steps we can take immediately   One thing we need to do as soon as possible is to remove the financial barrier to college  Our economic security is at stake  and we cant permit the cost of college to be an obstacle any longer   We also need to create a new social contract with young college graduates  If theyll commit to teaching math and science in our public schools for several years  well release them from the staggering debt of college loans that too often dictates a graduates choice of career   We also need to give older workers the new skills they need to qualify for new types of employment when other skills are no longer in demand   We need to make good health care available to all Americans  The current system is failing more and more citizens every year  Its both a moral failure and an enormous drain on our competitive position in the world    In this new century of life sciences  extraordinary breakthroughs in medical research hold enormous promise  but far too few of our people are seeing the benefit   Among industrialized nations  the U S  ranks 22nd in average life expectancy and 25th in infant mortality  Over 46 million of our people have no health insurance   The consequences are severe  Every year  eight million uninsured Americans fail to take their prescription drugs  because they cant afford them  270 000 uninsured children with asthma never see a doctor  and 27 000 uninsured women are diagnosed with breast cancer   The high cost of health care also wreaks havoc on our competitive position in the world  Ford Motor Company spends more on health care than it does on steel for its cars  Medical bills cause nearly half of all personal bankruptcies in the country today    Its time for change   Sick children cant learn in school  and sick workers cant earn on the job   We need new ideas and a renewed commitment to solve this problem  Im proud of the steps Massachusetts has taken to provide good care for all our people  and Im going to push in Washington to make it a reality for all Americans  I call my plan Medicare for All  and it will be exactly that   But no current issue more clearly illustrates the difficult twin challenges of security in the post 9 11 world and the forces of globalization confronting us than the immigration debate now playing out in Congress and across this country   The history of America is the history of immigration  My own ancestors had to face the No Irish Need Apply signs when they first arrived in Boston   Generations of immigrants have performed difficult labor in exchange for unfair wages  but they earned their way into the American family through hard work and perseverance in the face of countless obstacles   They brought new vitality to the American dream and constant proof that in this land of opportunity  anyone can build a better life for themselves and their families   It is this belief  this powerful belief in Americas possibilities  that has made us the most dynamic  creative  and upwardly mobile society the world has ever known    Its an optimism stated movingly in the famous words inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty  Give me your tired  your poor  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free   As the debate on immigration unfolds  there is a strong pressure by some to adopt an enforcement only approach     They would build higher walls to keep aliens out  Theyd round up and deport anyone not here legally  even it means separating them from children who were born here and are U S  citizens   Thats the shortsighted approach adopted by the House of Representatives that has ignited growing opposition across the country  Its inhumane  and its also unworkable  because it requires people to come forward willingly to be deported    Would any terrorist do that     We need an immigration policy that protects our borders  and that also provides a fair path to citizenship   Thats the common sense  humane  and comprehensive approach that Senator John McCain and I are offering in this debate and that President Bush supports  Im very hopeful well have a final bill that protects America and makes us proud of America too   Many of you will be facing these similar major issues in the years ahead  I commend you for your interest in public service  and for your commitment to working to improve your communities  our state  and our country   In the years ahead  well need all your energy and determination to meet our great challenges  but I know we can   As my brother Jack said  and as Bobby was fond of saying  some see things as they are and say why  I dream things that never were and say why not   May you never stop asking that question as you work to make America  and each of our communities  all that they can be   Thank you all so much                     Melissa Wagoner  Keith Maley 617 565 4472
