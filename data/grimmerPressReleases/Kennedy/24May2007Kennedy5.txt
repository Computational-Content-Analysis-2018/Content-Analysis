         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to the passage of the minimum wage bill in the Iraq supplemental  While there are many aspects of this conference report that I cannot support  I am pleased that it will finally allow us to get a minimum wage bill to the Presidents desk  The minimum wage has been stuck at  5 15 an hour for more than 10 years  but now  finally  Americans across the country will get the raise they need and deserve  13 million Americans will see more money in their paychecks for the first time in a decade  6 million children will have better food  better health  and better opportunities for the future This increase is long overdue  The minimum wage bill passed the House and Senate in January and February of this year  Unfortunately  Republicans prevented the bill from going to conference until they could make sure it included a big enough tax giveaway for businesses  Weve overcome many obstacles  and faced every procedural trick in the book  to get this minimum wage increase across the finish line  Democrats stood together  and stood firm  to say that no one who works hard for a living should have to live in poverty This is a victory for the American people  After years of delay by Congress  the people took this fight into their own hands  They started a grassroots movement that spread across the nation  They pounded the pavements and prayed in their pews  We are here today because of their efforts  and they deserve our gratitude  Certainly  the increase weve passed today is only the first of many steps we must take to address the problems of poverty and inequality  There is no doubt that we need to do much more  But this raise is important  It will add dignity to the lives of millions of working families  It is one of the proudest achievements of this new Congress RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS AMATTER OF FAIRNESS A FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT FACT SHEETIncreasing the minimum wage will make an immediate and significant difference in the lives of millions of hard working Americans  The Kennedy bill would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps    5 85 60 days after enactment   6 55 one year later   7 25 one year after thatAn estimated 13 million Americans will benefit from an increase to  7 25 an hour  5 6 million directly  and another 7 4 million indirectly  More than sixty percent of these workers are women  and almost forty percent are people of color  Almost eighty percent of those who benefit are adult workers  not teenagers seeking pocket change  This raise means that minimum wage earners will almost immediately earn an additional  1 500 to help support their families  When the full increase takes effect in 2009  these workers will see a total increase of  4 400 per year  enough for a low income family of three to buy   15 months of groceries 19 months of utilities 8 months of rent Over two years of health care 20 months of child care 30 months of college tuition at a public  2 year collegeIncreasing the minimum wage will help combat poverty in our nation   The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office   37 million Americans currently live in poverty  including 13 million children   Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s  This increase to the minimum wage  combined with the federal Earned Income Tax Credit  EITC  and the food stamps program  will bring a family of four above the poverty line  It will benefit an estimated 6 4 million children of low income workers Britain has the second largest economy in Europe  after Germany   They implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty  They raised their minimum wage to about  9 58 per hour last year  and they are planning to raise this rate to about  9 96 in October of this year  The increase to the minimum wage restores lost value  Every day minimum wage workers waited for a raise  the minimum wage lost value  and workers have fallen farther and farther behind  This raise restores the purchasing power of minimum wage workers Since the minimum wage was last raised in 1997  its real value has eroded by 22 percent  Before this raise  minimum wage workers had lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase Even with this increase  the real value of the minimum wage will still be  2 25 below what it was at its peak in 1968  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be  9 50 an hour today  not  5 15      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
