owes an immense debt to each of you who are working day in and day out to help children obtain a better education  particularly children with the greatest needs    Our nations future depends on many things  but certainly one of the most important aspects of the strength of our democracy is the excellence of our public schools  As professionals in education  each of you is at the forefront of a movement to improve and invest in our public schools   Across the country  we face immense challenges in closing achievement gaps and guaranteeing educational opportunity that all children deserve in order to succeed  The reactionary forces of poverty are large and the lack of resources in too many of our schools is large as well  Yet each of you sets out to confront these challenges head on  and you are overcoming them through your leadership  hard work  tireless dedication  and abundant energy    You were implementing successful reforms and strategies for every one of your students  long before the No Child Left Behind Act became the law of the land  And you work to achieve that goal  one student at a time    Most important  you show us that teaching is not just a profession  Its a high calling  And you make the commitment to touch the lives of every child who enters your classroom   The AFT is a special place  For 90 years  youve given educators the support they need and the recognition they deserve  Youve given a strong voice to the thousands of para professionals  nurses  janitors  and college professors who make our education system great  With patience and diligence  youve built the coalitions needed to achieve smaller class sizes  worthwhile professional development  and greater resources for students to reach high standards   The AFT is a special place not only for all of these accomplishments in education  but for all you do to uphold Americas ideals of justice  fairness  and equal opportunity  Weve counted on you in so many fights that have been essential to those values    At the time of the Supreme Courts historic ruling in Brown versus Board of Education half a century ago  you were there when African American parents were struggling to integrate our nations schools    When it was time to march on Washington in support of civil rights  you were there   In the walkouts of the 1960s and in the battles for collective bargaining rights  you were there   In the 1970s  when nurses and healthcare professionals struggled for an independent union  you were with them    Your dedication to America continues to be strong and is felt throughout the country  The ideals of leaders like Al Shanker and Sandy Feldman helped transform AFT from a union of professionals into a nationwide movement  Day in and day out you dreamed things that never were  and asked  Why not    Its a special honor to be here with you this year as you embark upon a new chapter to organize  mobilize  make your voice heard  and make a difference for the nation   As my brother Bobby told the students in South Africa on a visit there in 1966   Each time a person stands up for an ideal  or acts to improve the lot of others  or strikes out against injustice  he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope  and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring  those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance   Each of us has the power to send forth those ripples too  and many of you send them every day  You do it each time you help a student learn to read  each time you speak out for increased resources for poor students  each time you organize with fellow union members to improve our education system and our nation    Throughout our history  weve been blessed that men and women of conscience  ability  and vision have responded to the nations call in times of need    Countless leaders have inspired us with their leadership and devotion to public service   In 1837  the father of public education in Massachusetts  Horace Mann  campaigned relentlessly for the support and improvement of public education  He reminded us that free and public schools were critical to our future  He brought intense public attention to inferior conditions in our schools  He fought to double the wages of teachers  improve textbooks  and build fifty new secondary schools across our Commonwealth    Its not only elected officials that hear and heed the call of service    As a young student  John Lewis began his fight for civil rights with sit ins to integrate lunch counters and freedom rides to desegregate interstate buses  As the world watched  he and other peaceful marchers were beaten at the Edmund Pettus Bridge  and his courage and leadership sparked the movement that led in 1965 to the enactment of the landmark Voting Rights Act   Last year  we lost Rosa Parks  who through her simple  brave  and eloquent act shamed a nation into seeing the vast discrimination ignored for so long in our society  Without her act of civil disobedience  how much longer might we have waited for the spark of conscience to ignite the determination of millions of Americans to begin demanding change   When I look back over my years in the Senate  Im amazed at the progress weve made on issues of social justice  economic opportunity  and basic fairness  and it gives me hope for our future    When I first came to the Senate in 1962  nearly half of our senior citizens lived in poverty and ill health  Ingrained systems of segregation and separate and unequal classrooms still left many relegated to second class citizenship  The idea that handicapped Americans could lead full and independent lives was little more than a fantasy    The Civil Rights Act of 1964  The Voting Rights Act of 1965  The Fair Housing Act of 1968  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965  The War on Poverty  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991  All helped our nation come closer to living up to its ideals   Not one of these accomplishments was easy  and each required the sustained commitment of private citizens and elected officials to overcome entrenched opposition    Time and again throughout our history  we see the lesson that individual citizens have great power to find solutions to our problems  All they have to do is try   Our Founders did not know exactly how to create the worlds most enduring democracy  and President Lincoln did not know how to keep the Union together   President Roosevelt did not have a handbook for pulling our nation out of the Depression  Harry Truman did not have all the answers immediately after World War II to rebuild Western Europe and keep it from spiraling into an abyss of hopelessness and communist domination   But at each of these critical times  what they did have was Americans ready  willing and able to serve their fellow citizens and reach out to others in troubled times   Theres no doubt were in a similar time of extraordinary challenge today  and again well need your help to guide us through these turbulent times   Today  our nation faces threats to our security unlike any others that weve faced before  Our world has been transformed after September 11th by the realization that we face many unpredictable dangers from many unseen forces  Our men and women in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan face mortal danger on a daily basis     Here at home  were faced with an equally daunting challenge of ensuring that each of our citizens has the opportunity to achieve the American dream  and to live that dream in the face of a new economy and global challenges    The fiercely new competitive world we find ourselves in is taking its toll on middle class Americans  Their dream of passing along a better future to their children is being undermined by depressed wages  job losses  evaporation of pensions  and soaring costs of higher education   Are we going to do what it takes to give our people the power to succeed in the skills intensive industries of the new global economy  or are we going to make them fend for themselves and watch Americas economic might wane   As in other challenges  we dont have all the answers  but we know a few prudent steps we can take immediately    We can begin by investing in and strengthening education  as a key strategy to advancing the American dream   We must set out to improve and strengthen early learning opportunities  starting at birth  for each of the nations children  We must remove the economic barrier to higher education  Our very security is at stake  and we cant permit the cost of college to be a barrier to achievement any longer   We must solve the festering crisis in teacher recruitment and retention  and improve opportunities for the nations teachers  The quality of our classrooms depends on the ability of our teachers  We need a new national effort to improve professional development  so that teachers can support one another by sharing the best practices and improving their knowledge and skills  Often the best strategies for enhancing teaching and learning are developed when teachers are given the time  resources  and support they need to collaborate with and learn from each other    We can also support better programs to provide for teacher mentoring  We can offer a contract to our young college graduates  telling them that if they commit to the proud profession of teaching in the nations schools  well release them from the staggering debt of college loans that too often dictates their choice of career   Clearly  we must also do more to truly leave no child behind  The reforms contained in the No Child Left Behind Act charted a sound course for the future of American education  But its time for us to reshape our commitment to that goal  to ensure that providing a quality education to every child is a national obligation that America lives up to   Sadly  the law has become an empty slogan for this Administration    For many of us in Congress  and I know for many of you  leaving no child behind was a moral commitment long before President Bush signed a law four years ago   Its an expression of our basic values that were willing to make the tough choices and the hard sacrifices to create excellent schools  because our schools are the gateways to opportunity and success for every child  No matter what your background  your country of origin  or the neighborhood in which you live  everyone counts and should have the best possible education  Our children are Americas future  and by investing in them  well be a stronger and better nation   This Administration has yet to learn these lessons  They continue to underfund the law by nearly  56 billion since its enactment  Time and time again  theyve proven theyre more interested in admonishing our public schools than improving them    Just this week  they joined Republicans in Congress to renew calls for a private school voucher program that would deny our public schools more of the resources they need to improve  The timing is especially outrageous  when that the Presidents Department of Education has just released new research showing that public schools are doing just as well at educating students as private schools     Nevertheless  3 7 million children are still being left behind in Americas classrooms  Class sizes are soaring  and three quarters of our schools are in need of resources for construction and improvements   In the nations high poverty schools  teacher turnover is one third higher than in other schools  and students are nearly twice as likely to receive instruction from a teacher who doesnt know the field   14 million children come to school hungry each day  and 13 million struggle with their families in poverty  Almost one third of high school students in America dont complete their courses and are left behind on graduation day    The nations founders understood the enduring truth behind the No Child Left Behind Act  John Adams emphasized that education of the people was necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties when he drafted the Massachusetts constitution in 1780   Its time to reclaim that right and rekindle that spirit  Every young American today should have the opportunity to learn in a good school  go on to college  and become an active and informed member of society   We must make greater progress  too  in providing good health care for all Americans  The current system is both a moral and economic failure  and its failing more and more children each year    Every year  270 000 children with asthma never see a doctor  Among the industrialized nations of the world  the U S  ranks 25th in infant mortality    Its time for change  Sick children cant learn in school  and sick workers cant do their best on the job   Another critical part of our commitment to Americas children is helping working families struggling to make ends meet  The fundamental promise of the American Dream is that hard work will allow you to succeed and build a better life for your family  Unfortunately  in the Bush economy  the American dream has become a false hope for far too many working families    Americans are working harder than ever  but they are not reaping the benefits of their hard work  Productivity has increased by 18 percent since Bush took office  but average wages for working families are stagnant  and the minimum wage remains stuck at just  5 15 an hour    At the same time  costs for essentials like gas  heat  and health care have climbed so high that families can no longer make ends meet  Gasoline prices are up 70 percent since the President took office  Housing costs are up 36 percent  Child care often costs up to  10 000 per year for one child  more than the cost of tuition at a public college  As a result  too many hardworking people are forced to make impossible choices  do I pay the rent  or pay the heating bill  Do I put gas in the car or pay for my childs college education    In the face of these difficult choices  the Republican leadership in Congress has stubbornly refused to help hardworking people by raising the minimum wage  A minimum wage worker who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year still makes just  10 700 a year     6 000 below the poverty line for a family of three    Americans understand fairness  and this simply isnt fair  In the richest and most powerful nation in the world  no one who works hard for a living should have to live in poverty    This Administrations policy of tax cuts for the wealthy and crumbs for everyone else has to end    I know the AFT has always been with me in this fight  Youve pounded the pavements and raised your voices to fight for a fair minimum wage  We need your help now more than ever to win this great battle for working families   On these  and so many other issues  its essential that you make your voices heard  The outcome of these issues will have far reaching consequences for the type of nation well become in the new Century    We know these battles are not easily won  But nothing worthwhile ever is   So you can count me in to call on America to show the world that we will stay true to our values of fairness    You can count me in to work to see that every American who works hard and plays by the rules will have a chance at the American Dream   You can count me in to work to see that the No Child Left Behind Act receives the funding it needs  and that the law is improved to help teachers succeed  thrive  and deliver on that promise    You can count me in to work to ensure that every family has health insurance   You can count me in to work to see that every worker gets the pension they deserve    Im committed to doing all I can to address these great national challenges in the years ahead  And now as an honorary member of the AFT family  I hope to have the chance to work side by side with each of you as part of this great movement to achieve our goals    Thank you all very much     Melissa Wagoner Keith Maley  617  565 4472
