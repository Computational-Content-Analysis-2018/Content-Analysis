         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The Bush Administration is mindlessly and heartlessly requiring low income seniors to choose between food and medicine  In the new HHS description of the Medicare prescription drug benefit  the Administration explains that it will reduce or even cut off food stamps for Medicare recipients who rely on Medicare to afford the prescriptions they need     The number of Americans who are hungry or on the verge of hunger has increased by 3 million since President Bush took office  and this action will raise that number even higher  In addition  the Administration s budget proposed to deny food stamps to 300 000 low income people in an average month over the next 5 years     It s the height of hypocrisy for the President to tout his Social Security plan as protecting low income Americans from benefit cuts  when he s slashing other benefits left and right for these Americans who need our help the most    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
