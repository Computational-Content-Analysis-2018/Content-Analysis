         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I commend my friend  Chairman Enzi  for his bipartisan leadership on this legislation and his effective work in bringing it before the full Senate today  One of our highest priorities in Congress is to expand educational opportunities for every American  Especially in this age of globalization  we want every one of our citizens to have the learning and the skills essential to the continuing strength of our modern economy  We want them to fulfill their hopes and dreams  to raise healthy families  and contribute to their communities  We will be a fairer and stronger America when every citizen takes part and contributes   We know that in today s global economy  every person counts more than ever  We cannot afford to leave out anyone  We must equip our citizens to compete in the global economy    not by lowering their pay and sending their jobs overseas  but by increasing their skills   The legislation before us today will strengthen our commitment to a vital aspect of that mission  by equipping millions of young Americans with the skills they need through career and technical education   There was a time in many schools when vocational education meant simply an extra class in shop  But today in Massachusetts  and many other states  we see the vital role that vocational education    now appropriately called career and technical education    can have in transforming the lives of students and workers  and in strengthening our economy   Career and technical students are high school students who want to link their learning to a career  They are students who want a real world application of their high school education  They are students who earn college credits or earn industry recognized credentials and pass state licensing exams while still in high school  Career and technical education today is designed to prepare and train students for 21st century jobs   Career and technical education students go on to higher education    almost two thirds of all high school graduates of career and technical programs enter college or another form of postsecondary education   In addition  through its educational programs at the postsecondary level  the Perkins Act also serves adults who are seeking critical training to be competitive in the job market  Whether we are talking about new immigrants  struggling adults  or women who are seeking employment outside the home for the first time  these are adults who need specially designed programs   In Massachusetts  career and technical education serves more than 70 000 students  Through Perkins funding  high school programs in partnership with community colleges and local businesses  to provide students with the academic and technical skills they need to continue their education or to compete for high skill  high wage jobs immediately  The outcomes of these programs are extraordinary  Last year  95  of career and technical education students in Massachusetts passed our state assessment    the MCAS exams   The Perkins program has worked to reduce the gender imbalance in earnings by emphasizing the importance of eliminating discrimination and actively recruiting students for non traditional employment  The segregation of certain demographic groups into low wage industries can and should be corrected as soon as possible through education  The program sets aside specific dollars for the collection and dissemination of occupational and employment information  Providing the most complete and up to date information is essential if counselors are to help their students make good decisions about course selection and career choice   To be competitive in today s economy  we need a renaissance in math  in science  and in technical skills  Technology and innovation are essential for America s economic strength and competitiveness in the future  The Tech Prep program in this bill addresses these needs by creating programs that integrate technology skills based on employer needs  At Springfield Technical Community College in Massachusetts  students can enroll in the Diagnostic Medical Imaging Program  They take rigorous math and science courses that prepare them to use today s newest technology   It has always been a priority for our Committee to see that all students have the opportunity for high quality educational opportunities  Ensuring strong career and technical programs is an essential part of reaching that goal  In the legislation before us today  we were able to address critical issues for the continued growth of this program    the integration of academic and technical education  the use of funds for secondary and post secondary programs  and the importance of the Tech Prep programs that form the bridge between the high school and college programs   Our bill also builds on existing provisions designed to ensure that students  parents and teachers have the information they need to select the courses that will give them the best options for obtaining a good job or continuing with their education after high school   This bill also addresses the unique professional development needs of Career and Technical Education teachers  Every day  we see rapid pace of change in industry  Cell phones and computers can become obsolete in a year  Teachers need to see the changing aspects of the industries that they teach about in the classroom  so that their students of all ages can receive the best possible training  Local schools and districts must provide opportunities for these teachers to spend time with the industries they are teaching about  They are preparing the next workforce generation  and their knowledge base must be state of the art   In Massachusetts  Perkins grants fund a wide variety of important programs  Students in Brockton have received onsite clinical training in health care facilities  In New Bedford  a city that has suffered tremendously with the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs  the regional technical school has begun an engineering program in partnership with 2 and 4 year colleges  Texas Instruments and Bose  Graduates will be able to earn  22 000 a year directly after high school  and far more when they go on to earn their college degree   At Shawsheen Technical High School  six hundred 8th grade students are vying for 320 seats in the program  A third of the students are special education  yet the school has a 100  pass rate on the statewide student assessment exams  Learning academic skills in an applied context is responsible for this success  97  of the graduates go on to immediate employment in their field or continue their education   Responding to the critical shortage in the nursing profession  Shawsheen has developed an intensive Licensed Practical Nurses program for adults  Classes are held for 10 months  four nights a week from 5 30 to 10 pm  Students serve in clinical rotations on alternate weekends at the Lahey Clinic  The program has become an entry to a good career for many low income adults  50  of those enrolled are minority students and 60  are Pell recipients  The first three classes of 40 students each have had a 90  retention rate  a 98  pass rate for program completers and a 100  placement rate in the Merrimack Valley and the graduates are in jobs with an average starting salary of  23 an hour   In addition  because of Perkins grants  all Massachusetts community colleges have instructional support staff and major funding for adaptive equipment for students with disabilities enrolled in technical education   None of this would be possible without Perkins dollars   Again  I commend Chairman Enzi and his staff for all their good work  Special thanks go to Scott Fleming and Beth
