         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   As a nation  were much stronger on national security when all of us stand together  Cooperation between the Administration and Congress is vital to our national security and  across party lines  many of us stand ready to find a compromise that serves the countrys best interests    Five years ago  Congress was united in efforts to combat terrorism  We agreed on the need for law enforcement and intelligence officers to have strong powers to investigate terrorism  prevent future attacks  and improve information sharing between federal  state and local law enforcement    This week  as we somberly recall the fifth anniversary of the tragic terrorist attacks  we need to join together to protect Americas national security  As we did with the PATRIOT Act  and recently with its reauthorization  we have an opportunity to work together to resolve our differences and establish tough laws to protect our national security  while adhering to our basic constitutional principles    No one is above the law  not even the President  We cant let fear of terrorism be misused as an excuse to give unchecked power to the President  Were in danger of discarding three decades of well established checks and balances  with very little understanding of the potential consequences    The process doesnt have to be this way  Nearly thirty years ago  we took a different approach  After lengthy hearings and consultations  Congress enacted FISA with broad bipartisan support  only one vote against the bill in the Senate  The purpose of the law was clear  to limit power of the President to use wiretaps in the name of national security  Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  we established the FISA court as the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance could be conducted in the United States for national security purposes  The law established a secret court to review wiretapping applications  and placed national security electronic surveillance under the rule of law    Until the Presidents current program was disclosed in the press  we all thought thats how the system still worked  Now  with scant information to support such a momentous change  we are considering a proposal that would turn back the clock and reject the entire framework that has governed the monitoring of communications of Americans for the last thirty years    With unnecessary haste and inadequate deliberation  we are heading down a path that could lead to many unintended consequences  Unfortunately  the Committees agenda reflects a continuing effort to proceed without necessary answers or essential oversight  At a minimum  there should be a sunset on this new proposal  so that we can come back and see how it has been implemented and whether it has truly achieved the intent of its supporters    Its true that we are at war and the terrorist threat is serious  I agree that we face a different threat today  But to provide the President with the means necessary to fight terrorism  we amended FISA in the 2001 Patriot Act to give the President even more ability to track terrorists  without undermining the liberties of the American people  We can improve our laws and our national security without handing the President a blank check    The pending compromise is in stark contrast to the balanced bill enacted in 1978 and would fail to impose essential safeguards on collecting intelligence  On its own  the National Security Agency is deciding who is the target  where it is  how the call or e mail will be intercepted and where the eavesdropping will take place    We wonder what General Hayden means when he says that global telecommunications have given our nation a tremendous home field advantage  the most important advantage that we have  How do we know that effective laws are in place to ensure that surveillance is properly limited  How can we ensure that there are adequate safeguards  with the sudden growth of new communications infrastructure  particularly in the United States  At a minimum  we should require the NSA to report to Congress on the legal standards for surveillance  such a requirement was imposed in 2000 with unanimous support from the House and Senate  and such a reporting requirement must be included in any new law    I regret that the Committee is going ahead without a fuller inquiry into the Administrations massive electronic surveillance program  Congressional oversight hasnt been effective in guaranteeing that the constitutional checks and balances on executive power are working  All weve received are after the fact legal rationalizations for the program    Weve failed to meet the standard set by the bipartisan 9 11 Commission  which made clear that the Executive Branch has the burden of proof to justify why a particular government power should be retained  and that Congress has the responsibility to see that adequate guidelines are created and oversight is exercised     There is a way to fight terrorism within the framework of the law  Nearly thirty years ago  the President and Congress worked together to create the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  Now  ignoring that law  the Administration took a path filled with legal uncertainty  putting NSA employees at risk of criminal penalties and jeopardizing prosecutions of terrorists who can challenge the lawfulness of the evidence against them    It is not too late for President Bush to choose a stronger and more certain course of cooperation with Congress  Its vital to our national security that he does  For the sake of the country  lets hope that he will       Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
