         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today Senator Edward M  Kennedy fought to stop the tax giveaways for the wealthy by offering a motion on the floor of the Senate to instruct the budget conferees to reject any House proposal to extend the capital gains and dividends tax cuts  Senator Kennedy believes that those funds would be better spent on Medicare  Medicaid and fixing the nation s healthcare crisis  The House version of the bill provides tax breaks on capital gains and dividend income that will take  50 billion over the next ten years and give it to people who are already wealthy  The President s budget cuts almost  50 billion from Medicare and Medicaid for the next five years  harming health care for our seniors  for the disabled  and for the poor Senator Kennedy said  Again and again and again  under this Republican President and this Republican Congress  we ve seen trillions of their tax dollars given away in tax breaks to the wealthy and to corporations while the rest of America is asked to sacrifice  It s wrong to give away  50 billion in tax breaks for the wealthy while cutting  50 billion from Medicare  Medicaid and other healthcare needs  Those are the wrong priorities for America  and the motion I offer today gives the Senate a chance to set things right A vote is expected tonight on Kennedy s motion  Below are his remarks  as prepared for delivery  and a fact sheet on the Presidents budget on healthcare Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy Budget and Tax Reconciliation February 13  2006  As Prepared for Delivery Americans are wondering what s happened to their government  They are working hard to raise strong families and to live the American dream  But with each passing day  they find the American dream farther and farther out of reach as they struggle just to make ends meet  Over the past five years  the cost of health insurance has jumped 73   Gasoline is up 74   College tuition 45   Housing 44   The list goes on and on and up and up Working families don t ask for much  Low and middle income families are doing their part  But they could use a little fair play from their government as they are facing such hard times But that s not what is going on in Washington today  Again and again and again  under this Republican President and this Republican Congress  they ve seen trillions of their tax dollars given away in tax breaks to the wealthy and to corporations while the rest of America is asked to sacrifice  And this bill and the budget that President Bush sent to Congress last week are yet another example The House version of the bill before us provides tax breaks on capital gains and dividend income that will take  50 billion over the next ten years and give it to people who are already wealthy  At the same time  the President s budget cuts almost  50 billion from Medicare and Medicaid for the next five years  harming health care for our seniors  for the disabled  and for the poor  And it robs key funds from other health priorities as well Those are the wrong priorities for America  and the motion I offer today gives the Senate a chance to set things right My motion says it s wrong to give away  50 billion in tax breaks for the wealthy while cutting  50 billion from Medicare  Medicaid and other healthcare needs If we are honest about reducing the deficit and strengthening the economy  we need to stop lavishing tax breaks on the rich  and start investing in the health and well being of all families Nowhere is the crisis facing working families more apparent than in health care  Overall costs are soaring  Families have been losing their health coverage at the rate of 4 000 people per day since President Bush was elected Close to 2 million Americans in 2001 were involved in medical bankruptcy  an increase of 2 200  from 1981  Around 50  of all bankruptcies are caused  at least in part  by illness or medical debts  and of those  60  were caused by high medical bills  High drug costs were responsible for half  Most involved had some health insurance  but suffered from coverage gaps  Out of pocket medical costs averaged  11 854  For cancer patients  out of pocket costs averaged  35 878 These are not people trying to game the system  In the two years before filing for medical bankruptcy  22  of filing families went without food  30  had a utility shut off  50  failed to fill a doctor s prescription  And 61  went without needed medical care Let s look especially at what Republicans are doing to Medicaid and Medicare The Medicaid program is key to promoting a real culture of life in America  A third of all mothers giving birth receive their care through Medicaid  The Medicaid program provides the prenatal and pediatric care their children need to be healthy  The Medicaid program is our statement that we will do everything we can to help women bring their babies to term and give them the health care they need as they grow up  That s the way it should be in a true culture of life But rather than stand by women in their time of need  Republicans are abandoning this culture of life program Mere hours after the President had declared in the State of the Union Address that the government would meet its responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly  the House of Representatives sent to the White House a bill to impose draconian cuts on the Medicaid program But did the President stand up for this culture of life program and veto that bill  No  He signed it into law According to the Congressional Budget Office  that bill will cause 45 000 poor Americans to lose coverage over the next five years  and 65 000 will lose coverage within 10 years  About 60 percent of those losing coverage will be children Don t let anyone try to tell you that these cuts won t have consequences  They re either trying to fool you or they re fooling themselves  When cost sharing increases in Medicaid  families suffer In Maryland  a quarter of families subject to increased premiums disenrolled  In Oregon  higher costs caused disenrollment  and 67 percent of those who disenrolled became uninsured  The list goes on and on  and each case shows that higher costs mean worse health for families Because of these Medicaid cuts  13 million Medicaid beneficiaries will have to pay more for their prescriptions over the next five years  and 20 million will have to pay more over the next ten years Not satisfied with the cuts in Medicaid already enacted  the President s budget proposes another  13 5 billion in reductions in the program that meets the health needs of the poorest Americans Some will try to say that this does not have an affect on families  health    but again the facts again say otherwise  When co payments rise for the poorest patients  health declines  A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that increased co payments for medications for poor families caused an 88 percent increase in adverse events  such as heart attacks and strokes  and caused a 78 percent increase in emergency room visits But this debate isn t about statistics    it s about the real harm that these severe cutbacks will do to the most vulnerable Americans  A single mother with two children  who makes  8 an hour  currently pays  3 when she visits the doctors and does not have any cost sharing when her children go to the pediatrician  Under the new law  when her child goes to the pediatrician with an ear infection  she may be charged  20  When she goes to a doctor for treatment and tests for diabetes  she will be charged  50  She will have to pay as much as  832 a year A single mother with 2 children earning  25 000 a year now pays no premiums or cost sharing for her children s medical care and pays  3 co payments for herself  Under the new law  she will now be charged monthly premiums for Medicaid coverage for herself and her children  Even if she manages to pay the premiums  she may now have to pay  40 for a pediatrician visit  and she will have to pay as much as  1 250 a year for Medicaid For a single mother of two earning minimum wage  the new Medicaid law imposes additional cost sharing on her children  They would now face co payments for certain prescription drugs    and these co payments would for the first time be indexed to the rate of medical inflation  which is higher than general inflation  And on minimum wage  her income won t even keep up with inflation since the minimum wage hasn t increased since 1997 The policies already enacted will cause serious hardship for the most vulnerable Americans  But the Administration s cuts to Medicaid are not the only assault on our health care  The botched Medicare drug plan and the President s Medicare cuts further harm working families When it comes to the new prescription drug benefit in Medicare  we had a good Medicare bill in the Senate  supported by a broad bipartisan majority  But that bill was hijacked once the White House entered the negotiations  Ideology triumphed over common sense  Instead of building on the Medicare program that seniors know and trust  the drug program was turned over to HMOs and other private insurance plans  enticed to participate by massive subsidies    funds that should have gone to strengthen benefits The result has been a disaster    but that s not how the Administration s spin machine sees it  According to the budget the President just submitted to Congress  the Medicare drug program is off to a good startHere are the facts  Across the country  seniors  the disabled  and individuals facing the challenge of mental illness have been denied the medications they need to maintain their health  or have been forced to pay massive fees for the drugs they count on  States  cities and many pharmacies have stepped into the breach and incurred millions of dollars in expenses filling the gaps left by the Administration s failure The reality is that 15 million seniors lose under the Republican Medicare law  3 million lose good retiree health coverage  6 million lose by having to pay more in premiums than they receive in benefits  and 6 million more    those poor seniors and the disabled who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid    lose by being forced to leave the Medicaid coverage they have counted on If all these seniors and disabled Americans are losing  we have to ask who wins from the Republican drug plan  The answer is clear    drug companies and the insurance industry  The Republicans turned Medicare into a sugar daddy for the insurance industry by doling out  67 billion in subsidies Let s look at where that money comes from   10 billion comes from a slush fund   22 billion is from overpayments  and  35 billion is the bonus that HMOs get for luring seniors out of traditional Medicare and into private plans The drug companies did even better than the insurance industry  They get  139 billion in windfall profits Why  Because the bill blocked Medicare from negotiating the same kind of discounts for seniors that the VA is able to get for veterans But does the Administration propose to make things right  Does President Bush propose to kick the insurance industry and the drug companies out of Medicare and provide a real benefit to seniors The answer is no  Instead of strengthening Medicare  his new budget proposes  36 billion in Medicare cuts over the next five years and  105 billion over the next ten years The Medicare cuts will mean higher premiums for seniors and the disabled  They will result in reductions in the quality of care at hospitals and home health agencies In my own state of Massachusetts  President Bush s Medicare cuts will mean that our hospitals will have to cut their budgets by  213 million  home health agencies by  50 million and nursing homes by  150 million  Cuts in public health programs mean that our state program to screen newborns as early as possible for hearing loss would be eliminated  17 rape crisis centers across the state would face significant financial hardship  and our programs on violence prevention and suicide would be eliminated  Over 35 programs that train health care providers that will deliver care in underserved areas and programs and support diversity in the health professions would be eliminated  Why should patients pay the price while this bill gives away billions in tax breaks to people who don t need them But of course  Republicans have never liked Medicare and Medicaid  Even though retirees and the poor were hurting  Republicans fought against Medicare and Medicaid tooth and nail when Democrats fought to create those two important programs in the 1960s  Republicans defeated Medicare when it was debated in Congress in 1964  When Republicans came under fire for their opposition in the 1964 election  enough crossed over to join Democrats in passing the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 1965 Republicans never gave up their opposition  however  When they gained control of the White House and Senate in the 1980s  they tried to break Medicaid s promise of health care to poor families  They proposed to convert the program into a block grant  and Democrats in Congress stopped them only after a pitched battle Once again  in the 1990s  House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his Contract with America wanted to eliminate Medicare  Even though seniors and Americans with disabilities relied on the program and Americans respected it  Gingrich said that Medicare should just wither on the vine  Democrats stopped them again More recently  Glenn Hubbard  who was President Bush s Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in his first term  said that Medicare and Medicaid should be replaced by so called health savings accounts  which would benefit primarily the healthy and the wealthy Meanwhile  the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress continue steadily to chip away at Medicare and Medicaid And now  they are at it again In the budget the President just submitted to Congress  no health priority is safe  Medicare  Medicaid  cancer research  newborn screening  trauma services for children  and many other essential programs will be severely reduced or even eliminated The money lavished on tax breaks for the wealthy in the bill before us would be better spent restoring the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid Under the President s budget  NIH will receive  1 billion less than is needed to keep up with inflation  Its budget will be flat for two years running  That has not been allowed to happen in more than half a century  18 of the 19 NIH institutes will lose funding  which means that NIH will fall behind in the race for new cures  Research on cancer  heart disease  mental health  diabetes will all be cut  squandering the promise of this century of the life sciences  That s the wrong priority for the nation  The amount saved by these dangerous reductions is dwarfed by the payouts that the tax bill the Senate is now considering gives to the wealthy This tax break is particularly unfair  because more than 75 percent of the tax benefits will go to people with incomes above  200 000 a year  Over half the benefits    53 percent    will go to people with incomes over  1 million a year This amounts to a  35 000 gift each year from Uncle Sam to the average millionaire  but it s highway robbery for the millions of seniors  disabled Americans  and poor families who will see a cut in Medicare and Medicaid services The Republicans cynically claim that capital gains and dividend income deserve special treatment  because they will stimulate investment  The facts do not substantiate that claim  The stock market grew much more rapidly in the early and mid 1990s when investors  income was taxed at the same rate as wages  Since then  President Bush cut taxes on capital gains and dividend income in 2003  More tax cuts that America cannot afford will hurt the economy  not help it There are some provisions in the Senate bill that we do need to address  The Alternative Minimum Tax was never intended to apply to middle class families  and they deserve tax relief  In a truly outrageous move  the House Republicans took AMT relief for the middle class out of their reconciliation bill so they could fit in more tax breaks for the rich  The research and development tax credit is important to our international competitiveness and should be retained  However  those worthwhile tax cuts should be paid for by rolling back some of the extravagant tax breaks that this Republican Congress has already given to the nation s wealthiest taxpayers  We simply cannot afford more tax cuts at a time when we are facing record deficits If we are honest about reducing the deficit and strengthening the economy  we need to stop lavishing tax breaks on the rich  and start investing in the health and well being of all families The economic trends are very disturbing for any who are willing to look at them objectively  The gap between rich and poor has been widening in recent years  37 million Americans now live in poverty  up 19  during the Bush Administration  One in five American children lives in poverty  14 million children go to bed hungry each night  Wages remain stagnant while inflation drags more and more families below the poverty line  2 8 million manufacturing jobs have been lost  Long term unemployment is at historic highs The bill before us has the wrong priorities for the nation  The Senate should instruct our conferees to reject any House proposal to extend the capital gains and dividend tax cuts  The funds that those cuts would consume would be much better spent on Medicare  Medicaid  and the nation s other health needs  That s the right priority for the nation  and that s the right course for the Senate to instruct our conferees to follow I urge my colleagues to support this motion   REAL REFORM IS NEEDED TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THE CENTURY OF THE LIFE SCIENCESWe are in the century of the life sciences    a time of extraordinary promise for new medical miracles  But for too many Americans  quality affordable health care is a distant dream  It should be a right  not a privilege  America faces a health care crisis  Too many Americans are uninsured  and the number of the uninsured is increasing at an accelerating rate  No American family is more than one pink slip or one employer decision to drop coverage away from being uninsured  Health care costs are too high and are rising at double digit rates  America can do better  but the budget makes the health care crisis worse A Track Record of FailureThe Bush Administration has fanned the flames of America s health care crisis  by failing to offer real solutions and pandering to special interests  The Medicare drug plan was turned over to the insurance industry  denying seniors the choice of remaining with the Medicare program they know and trust  The results were so disastrous that the President did not even mention the program in the State of the Union address  46 million Americans have no health insurance  Since 2000  nearly six million more Americans have become uninsured    that s an increase of 4 000 people every day  The large and growing number of the uninsured is only part of the health care crisis  Costs are rising out of control  making health care coverage less affordable  and undercutting American industry in the global marketplace  Insurance premiums have increased a whopping 73  in the last five years  That rate is more than five times higher than the growth in earnings    putting quality health care out of reach of millions of Americans  The Administration has put ideology over progress in medical research  by imposing the worst budget cuts in 35 years on NIH  and blocking lifesaving stem cell research The President s BudgetThe President has said that he wants to achieve bipartisan progress in health care  The budget is the true test of whether that desire is real  or simply election year rhetoric  Here are the questions to ask to see if the budget that the President will propose has adopted the path of cooperation or confrontation  Medicare  The path of cooperation would be to fix the disastrous Medicare drug benefit  The path of cooperation would be to reduce Medicare spending only by cutting overpayments to HMOs and drug companies  This partisan budget chooses confrontation by cutting more than  105 billion over the next ten years from Medicare payments to hospitals and nursing homes that will erode the quality of care that seniors receive  The budget proposes the unprecedented step of proposing massive across the board cuts on Medicare  regardless of Congressional action The budget cuts funding for Massachusetts hospitals by  14 million in 2007    over  11 million for inpatient care and almost  3 million for outpatient care  These cuts come as hospitals are being asked to improve quality  invest in health IT  prepare for public disasters and provide care for increasing numbers of uninsured and underinsured patients  The budget cuts funding for Massachusetts home health agencies by an additional  10 million in 2007  Massachusetts home health agencies already were cut  10 million per year in the recent budget reconciliation bill  Health care coverage  costs  A bipartisan approach to reducing costs and improving coverage would improve health care coverage through measures with broad support  such as expanding CHIP or restoring the cuts in Medicaid  and would address the soaring cost of drugs by allowing importation of safe medicines from Canada and other industrialized nations  Instead  this partisan budget proposes only gimmicks  like HSAs  that will worsen the health care crisis  In fact  the budget proposes increasing the amount of the tax giveaway to make these tax shelters more attractive to wealthy investors  The budget also proposes taking the first step to privatizing Medicare and replacing it with chancy private accounts that give no guarantee of quality health care On the heels of major cuts in Medicaid  the budget proposes further cuts of over  17 billion in the next ten years  These measures mean reduced care and worse health for millions of poor and disabled Americans   Public Health Priorities  A bipartisan budget would respect the nation s commitment to medical research by providing a meaningful increase in the NIH budget and restoring funds to essential health programs slashed in prior years  This partisan budget imposes draconian cuts on NIH  Of the 19 NIH institutes  18 will lose funding  That means less research into cancer  diabetes  stroke  spinal injuries  and many other serious illnesses  As a result of these cuts  NIH will cut the number of grants it funds by over 600  resulting in a loss of over 60 new grants to Massachusetts alone  The budget also decimates funding for critical health programs  such as preventive health  training medical professionals  emergency medical services for children  and hearing screening for newborns  The budget slashes funds for children s hospitals to train pediatricians  pediatric specialists and pediatric researchers by more than 66   Boston Children s Hospital would be cut by  14 million in 2007 Although the President s budget adds an additional  188 million for HIV AIDS drugs and testing  the budget continues to level fund the health programs in Ryan White that actually provide the care and treatment people need once they are identified as having HIV AIDS  A program for aggressive testing is only as good as the services an individual receives once they have been identified Medicare for AllThe real solution to the health care crisis is to make Medicare available to every American who wants to enroll in it  Administrative costs are low  patient satisfaction is high  and patients have the right to choose any doctor and hospital they think is best  Senator Kennedy has introduced legislation  S  2229  the Medicare for All Act  to extend Medicare to all Americans  Those who prefer private insurance can choose any plan offered to members of Congress and the President  To ease the transition  Medicare for All will be phased in by age group  starting with those 55 65 years old and children up to age 20  Our budget priorities should also respect America s commitment to finding new cures for serious illnesses  and to aiding those affected by the challenge of disease by supporting health programs   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
