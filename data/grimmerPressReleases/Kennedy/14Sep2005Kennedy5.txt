         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     PDF of related documents available upon request    Senator Kennedy is expected to ask Judge Roberts further questions on the Voting Rights Act today  Below is background information on the 1982 Reauthorization of the Act and Roberts  record of opposing the amendment to Section 2  Also included is yesterday s transcript of the exchange between Kennedy and Roberts on the Voting Rights Act    Background  The Voting Rights Act is particularly relevant today given all the voter disenfranchisement we ve seen in recent years and because key provisions of the Act are up for reauthorization in 2007  Senators Kennedy and Specter are sponsoring the reauthorization in the Senate     Section 2 was amended in 1982  under Kennedy s leadership  to make clear voting rights were violated by any voting practices that discriminated based on race  regardless or whether it was possible to prove that they had been adopted with the intent to discriminate  Roberts aggressively opposed the amendment of Section 2  stating in 1981 that my own view is that something must be done to prevent passage of the provision    If Roberts had his way and the  intent test  had prevailed  the Act would have been eviscerated  His view was to the right of Newt Gingrich  Dan Quayle  and James Sensenbrenner  all of whom supported the change  The Amendment to Section 2 was so clearly needed to protect voting rights that it passed overwhelmingly in both Houses  and earned the support of staunch conservatives like Strom Thurmond  The 1982 Amendment of Section 2 Had a Tremendous Impact on Minority Representation in Congress   In 1982  there were only 19 African American and 6 Latino members of Congress  Today  there are 43 African American and 28 Latino members of Congress   Before Congress acted in 1982 to amend Section 2  there had not been a single African American elected to Congress since Reconstruction from Mississippi  Florida  Alabama  North Carolina  South Carolina  Virginia  or Louisiana  yet these were states in which African Americans were almost a third or more of the population  Today  all of these states have an African American representatives in Congress  In opposing the  effects test   Roberts was acting on his own beliefs    dozens of memos Roberts wrote on this subject make that clear  In fact  when Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Brad Reynolds raised concerns about sending the Senate a letter on this issue  Roberts pushed the Attorney General to do so  stating that my own view is that something must be done to educate the Senators on the seriousness of this problem         In a January 1982 memo  he also urged the Attorney General to take a positive and aggressive approach to convince White House officials not to support the amendment to Section 2  This was one time in Roberts  career in which he had the opportunity to stand for justice in the area of voting rights  He was not acting as a judge or a litigator  who is constrained by precedent  but as a senior policy advisor with a free hand to promote whatever position he saw fit  Roberts chose to recommend a policy that would make it harder to end Jim Crow voting practices that systematically excluded minorities from equal participation in our democracy    Yesterday  more than two decades later  Roberts refused to distance himself from that extreme position  even after having the benefit of history and maturity on his side  If he was taking a staff position in arguing to narrow the Voting Rights Act  then why can t he express his own opinion in support of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act today        In his exchange with Feingold on Tuesday  Roberts said that he didn t really have an opinion as to whether the intent test    in retrospect    was correct and right and would ve had the effect of fewer African American electeds  Anyone with an understanding of civil rights law and the historical struggle to ensure every American can vote free of intimidation or discrimination knows that the VRA  with the 1982 amendments  has been tremendously successful in ensuring equal representation and the free exercise of democratic rights     Below is yesterday s exchange between Senator Kennedy and John Roberts    KENNEDY        I m deeply troubled by a narrow and cramped and perhaps even a mean spirited view of the law that appears in some of your writings        In the only documents that have been made available to us  it appears that you did not fully appreciate the problem of discrimination in our society  It also seems that you were trying to undo the progress that so many people had fought for and died for in this country        At the outset  I want to be clear that I do not think nor am I suggesting that you re a person who s in favor of discrimination  I don t believe that        I am concerned  however  that at the time you were writing these laws and memoranda and notes  you simply did not grasp the seriousness of the impact of discrimination on our country as a whole        Let s start with the Voting Rights Act        Most Americans think that the right to vote is among the most important tools that they have to participate in our democracy  You do agree  don t you  don t you  Judge Roberts  that the right to vote is a fundamental constitutional right    ROBERTS        It is preservative  I think  of all the other rights        Without access to the ballot box  people are not in the position to protect any other rights that are important to them  And so I think it s one of  as you said  the most precious rights we have as Americans    KENNEDY        And you will recall that in the  60s  millions of our fellow citizens denied access to voting booths because of race  And to remedy that injustice  Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of  65 that outlawed discrimination in voting        Section 2 of that act is widely believed to be the most effective civil rights statute enacted by Congress        In 1982  Congress took action to extend the Voting Rights Act and to make it clear that discriminatory voting practices and procedures are illegal if they are intended to be racially discriminatory or if they are shown to have a racially discriminatory impact        It was this latter provision  the prohibition against voting practices that have a discriminatory impact  that provoked your heated opposition  Judge Roberts        In our earlier discussion of Brown v  Board of Education  you agreed that the actual impact of racial segregation on public education and school children was perfectly valid for the court to consider    KENNEDY        But when it came to voting rights  you rejected the consideration of actual impact        You wrote that violations of Section II of the Voting Rights Act  and I quote  should not be made too easy to prove since they provide a basis for the most intrusive interference imaginable by federal courts  interstate and local processors        You also wrote  and I quote  It would be difficult to conceive of a more drastic alteration of local government affairs  And  under our federal system  such an intrusion should not be too readily permitted        And you didn t stop there  You concluded that Section II of the Voting Rights Act was  quote  constitutionally suspect and contrary to the most fundamental tenets of the legislative process on which the laws of this country are based        So I am deeply troubled by another statement that you made at the time        And I quote  There is no evidence of voting abuses nationwide supporting the need for such a change        No evidence  I was there  Judge Roberts  in both the House and the Senate  had the extensive hearings  We considered details  specific testimony from affected voters throughout the country  But you dismissed the work of Congress out of hand        Don t be fooled  you wrote  by the House vote or the 61 Senate sponsors of the bill  Many members of the House did not know that they were doing more than simply extending the act and several of the 61 senators have already indicated they only intended to support a simple extension        Judge Roberts  Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly supported this legislation  But you thought we didn t really know what we were doing        Newt Gingrich  James Sensenbrenner voted for the House bill    KENNEDY        Dan Quayle was an original Senate co sponsor of the bill  We held extensive hearings  created a lengthy record  Yet  you thought there was no evidence of voting abuses that would justify the legislation    your comment        Do you believe today that we need the federal laws to assure that all our citizens have the equal access to the voting booth and do you basically support the 1982 Voting Rights Act that was signed by      ROBERTS        Senator  you will recall  at the time    this was 23 years ago    I was the staff lawyer in the Justice Department  It was the position of the Reagan administration for whom I worked  the position of the attorney general for whom I worked  that the Voting Rights Act should be extended for the longest period of its extension in history without change        The Supreme Court had interpreted in the Mobile v  Bolden case  Section 2  to have an intent test  not an effects test        Keep in mind  of course  as you know very well  Section 5  the preclearance provision  had always had an effects test and that would be continued        The reference to discrimination nationwide was addressing the particular point that effects test had been applied in particular jurisdictions that had a history of discrimination  And the question is whether or not there was a similar history of discrimination that supported extending the effects test in Section 2        It was the position of the administration for which I worked that the proposal was to extend the Voting Rights Act without change  Your position at the time was that the intent test that the Supreme Court had determined was in Section 2 should be changed to the effects test  and that was the position that eventually prevailed        There was no disagreement      KENNEDY        Judge Roberts  the effects test was the law of the land from the Zimmer case to the Mobile case  It was the law of the land  That was the law of the land that court after court decided about the impact of the effects test  The Mobile case changed the Zimmer case    ROBERTS        Well  Senator  you disagree      KENNEDY        And what we were      SPECTER        Let him finish his answer    KENNEDY        OK  Well  I d just like to get his    whether the Zimmer case was not the holding on the rule of the law of the land prior to the Mobile case    ROBERTS        Well  this is the same debate that took place 23 years ago on this very same issue  And the administration s position    you think the Supreme Court got it wrong in Mobile against Bolden    KENNEDY        No  that s not what    I think it was wrong  but I also think the law of the land  decided by the Supreme Court in the Zimmer case  upheld in court after court after court after court  was the effects test    ROBERTS        Well  the Supreme Court      KENNEDY        That s      SPECTER        Let him finish his answer  Senator Kennedy    ROBERTS        The point is    and  again  this is revisiting a debate that took place 23 years ago      KENNEDY        Well  I m interested today of your view  Do you support the law that Ronald Reagan signed into law and that was co  sponsored      ROBERTS        Certainly    KENNEDY            overwhelmingly      ROBERTS        Certainly  and the only point I would make    this was the same disagreement and the same debate that took place then over whether the court was right or wrong in Mobile v  Bolden        And the point I would make is twofold  that those  like President Reagan  like Attorney General Smith  who are advocating an extension of the Voting Rights Act without change  were as fully committed to protecting the right to vote as anyone    KENNEDY        Right  Could I      SPECTER        Let him finish his answer  Senator Kennedy    ROBERTS        And the articulation of views that you read from represented my effort to articulate the views of the administration and the position of the administration for whom I worked  for which I worked 23 years ago    KENNEDY        Well  after President Reagan signed it into law  did you agree with that position of the administration    ROBERTS        I certainly agreed that the Voting Rights Act should be extended  I certainly agreed that the effects test in Section 5 should be extended        We had argued that the intent test  that the Supreme Court recognized in Mobile against Bolden    I know you think it was wrong  but that was the Supreme Court s interpretation    should have been extended    ROBERTS        Again  as you said  the compromise that you and Senator Dole worked out was enacted into law and signed into law by President Reagan  And the Voting Rights Act has continued to be an important legislative tool to ensure that most precious of rights  which is preservative of all other rights  There was never any dispute about that basic proposition    KENNEDY        Well  what I m getting to is  after it was signed into law  overwhelmingly    overwhelmingly by the House and the Senate    we have the memoranda that you said the fact we were burned last year    this is the following year    we did not    the fact we were burned last year because we did not sail in with the new voting rights legislation does not mean we ll be hurt this year if we go slowly on housing legislation        What did you mean when you said that we were burned last year by not getting the Voting Rights Act    ROBERTS        I think the legislative debate between those who favored extending the Voting Rights Act as is and those who favored changing the act because they disagreed with the Supreme Court decisions  the legislative judgment was that the administration s proposal didn t succeed because they had waited  Rather than coming out in favor of an extension right away  they waited for the Congress to come up with its proposals which turned out to be different than the administration proposals        On the housing discrimination  I would note that the administration did get its ducks in a row and  in a matter of months after the date of the memo that you just read from  had its housing proposal there and submitted to Congress and it was enacted
