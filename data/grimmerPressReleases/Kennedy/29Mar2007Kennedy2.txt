Senator Kennedys full statement is below Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy on the Senate Passage of S 682  the Edward William Brooke III Congressional Gold Medal ActMr  President  the award of a Congressional Gold Medal to our former colleague  Senator Ed Brooke  is eminently well deserved  and I urge the Senate to approve this legislation To all of us who know Ed Brooke  he was an outstanding Senator  a true statesman  a champion of equal justice and opportunity for all  and a man of great conscience and compassion  Senator Brooke was born in Washington DC  not far from these chambers on Capitol Hill  and he graduated from Howard University  He had studied medicine  intending to become a physician  but realized that he was more at home in the fields of literature  political science and history After finishing his degree at Howard  he served our country in World War II as a captain in the Armys segregated 366th Infantry Regiment  which fought with great courage in the Italian theater  During his service  he distinguished himself not only as a gifted leader  but as a skilled defense counsel in court marshal proceedings Returning from the war  he enrolled in Boston University Law School and became editor of the Law Review  After graduating  he began a successful law practice in Massachusetts and continued his commitment to public service as well  He chaired the Finance Commission of Boston  and specialized in rooting out public corruption  His ability  energy and dedication won him renown  and he was elected attorney general of Massachusetts  becoming the first African American in the nation to hold such a position  In his two terms as attorney general  he became a leader in the battle against organized crimeIn 1966  he was elected to the Senate from Massachusetts  the first African American Senator since Reconstruction  I vividly remember escorting him down the center aisle of this chamber for his swearing in  At that time the Senate was deeply involved in enacting the historic civil rights legislation of the 1960s and I was touched by the magnitude and immense symbolism of that moment for Ed and his family  for African Americans  for The Commonwealth of Massachusetts  and for the nation as a whole  When people question Ed about his significant place in history  his response is always spirited and unchanging  He didnt want to be remembered only as the Senates African American member  During his campaign for Attorney General  he had said  Im not running as a Negro  I never have  Im trying to show that people can be elected on the basis of their qualifications and not their race Ed always saw himself in this light  Despite his other firsts  he was first and foremost an American and a son of Massachusetts  and it was important to him that his accomplishments and talents speak louder than the color of his skin Needless to say  his heritage uniquely qualified him to combat social injustice and stand as an eloquent voice for Americas oppressed  He served on President Johnsons Commission on Civil Disorders  which investigated the causes of the race riots in American cities at the time  and the committees recommendations became a central part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 When he spoke on the Senate floor in support of the extending the Voting Rights Act in 1975  he addressed this body with inspiring candor and sincerity  In a time of great turmoil and division  he was a symbol of hope for Americans of color throughout our nationhope that our country was changing  hope that the American dream was still alive  Those who were intent on defeating the Voting Rights Act could not avoid pangs of conscience as Ed declared  I cannot believe that in 1975  on the floor of the United States Senate  we are ready to say to the American people  black and white  red and brown  that they cannot be assured of the basic right to vote  His point was irresistible  and the very next day  the Senate passed the bill Ed was passionate about opportunity for all  In his two terms with us  he set a high standard for public service and was a model of senatorial independence  supporting measures on both sides of the aisle that he felt strengthened our country  and improved the lives of all Americans  He was a champion of the minimum wage  a strong voice for Medicare and Social Security  and an effective defender of womens rights  The title of his autobiography Bridging the Divide  published earlier this year  says it all  He bridged race  he bridged parties  and defied any conventional categorization I remember Ed discussing the difficulty of providing a home for his family after his return from World War II  at a time when race disqualified him from considering certain properties  His plight was characteristic of the struggle experienced by millions of Americans at that time  The Fair Housing Act of 1968 is a tribute to his leadership as a Senator  and long after he left the senate  he continued the battle for fair housing and opportunity as leader of the National Low Income Housing Coalition As Martin Luther King Jr  once said We must come to see that the end we seek is a society of peace  That will be the day not of the white man  not the black man  That will be the day of man as man  Edward Brooke is the embodiment of Dr  Kings vision  He was a great Senator among us  he is still a caring public servant  He is a great American  and he certainly deserves this very special tribute from Congress  I urge my colleagues to approve this award of The Congressional Gold Medal to our former colleague  Ed Brooke   30
