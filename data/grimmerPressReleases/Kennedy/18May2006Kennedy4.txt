         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633 TRANSCRIPT OF FLOOR SPEECH Now  under the current immigration law  if you have an H1B visa that means you you re highly skilled  So if you re highly skilled  your employer can get the green card for you  But under the Cornyn amendment  if you re low skill  you re out One set of treatment for the very highly educated  highly skilled that are working on the computers  but if you re cleaning a building in America  if you re working in menial jobs  if you re looking after children  if you have one of the lower paid jobs  you re out of luck  Really  a nice    a nice  fair standard  nice  fair standard  The Statue of Liberty has turned around tonight listening to the argument of our friends over here  Turned around One standard for high skilled and  boy  if you re doing the more menial work  which we know other Americans are not prepared to do  you re out  you re finished  you re gone  No chance at all  Work for six years  And then maybe they ll go out  leave the country or maybe they ll stay in  If they stay in  they ll be part of a subclass  Do you hear me  A sub class here in the United States of America  That is what we are trying to avoid in the basic immigration bill We emphasize legality  Legality in coming in as guest workers  part of the legal system  Legality in terms of employment  You can only employ those that come in here in which there s not an American job  But there s also opportunity  We respect those individuals that do menial jobs because after the four years that they are here  they re able  if there isn t going to be an American to do a job  they could petition  And if they meet all the other requirements  they learn English  they obey the laws  they can be part of the American dream If the Cornyn amendment applied to our immigration laws 150 years ago  no Irish need apply  no Polish need apply  no Italians need apply  no Jews need apply  But tonight we re saying no Hispanics primarily need apply  because those are the ones  Sure  it s 85   the rest 5  or 6  Asian  You can figure out  the others in Central America  But that is what the Senate tonight is confronted with This undermines the whole purpose of the bill  It brings in illegality again  It says that your employer hires this person  they work for six years  the employer might have trained him  given him decent skills and  bang  you re either part of the subclass or you re reporting to deport  Those were wonderful words report to deport  We ll know who those individuals are  the homeland security and then as soon as that time is up six times  they ll get picked up and either pushed over or    and pushed out of the country or they ll be in an spurned class    a permanent underclass    in an underclass  a permanent underclass Mr  president  this is probably a very nice amendment that goes over in some circles  But I will tell you  if we re talking about fairness in this country  if you re talking about fairness in the immigration bill  you re talking about fairness in the standards  you re talking about the history    fairness in the standards  you re talking about the history and the fairness in this country about welcoming the poor and the unwashed in our country  you re changing that with the Cornyn amendment  Make no mistake about it  you re changing that  I was around here during the Bresaro period and the exploitation of humanity was    was extraordinary  And we are returning to it if we accept the Cornyn amendment  We re saying because you do more menial jobs  your life  your worth  your being is not as    not worth as much as somebody who s a highly skilled person  That s a wonderful statement for the United States of America to make  And do you know what s going to happen  Those individuals are going to be exploited  If they re women  they re going to be abused  You can have sexual harassment and abuse for them  That s the record  That    read the history of the Bresaro  I went to the hearings  I attended the hearings all during the Southwest and into California    one of the most shameful  shameful periods in American history  Go back to it tonight That s what this amendment is all about  It strikes a dagger at the heart of what this legislation is about  strict enforcement  strict accountability  strict legality if people are going to play by the rules and earn their way and be a part of the American dream   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
