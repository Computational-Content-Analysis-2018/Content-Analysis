         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Mr  President  there is no breakdown in the judicial confirmation process  Democrats in this closely divided Senate have cooperated with the President on almost all his nominations  The Senate has confirmed 208 of President Bush s 218 nominees in the past four years  most of whom are not people we would have chosen ourselves  95  have been confirmed     Only a handful did not receive the broad bi partisan support needed for confirmation  Their records showed they would roll back basic rights and protections  Janice Rogers Brown  William Pryor  Priscilla Owen  and William Myers would erase much of the country s hard fought progress toward equality and opportunity  Their stated values    subordinating the needs of families to the will of big business  destroying environmental protections  and turning back the clock on civil rights    are not mainstream values  Democrats have  under the Senate s Rules  declined to proceed on those nominees to protect America from their radical views    The President has re nominated William Pryor for the Eleventh Circuit  which includes the states of Florida  Alabama  and Georgia  Mr  Pryor s record makes clear that his views are far outside the legal mainstream  Mr  Pryor is no conservative  Instead  he has pushed a radical agenda contrary to much of the Supreme Court s jurisprudence over the last forty years    Mr  Pryor has fought aggressively to undermine Congress s power to protect individual rights  He s tried to cut back on the Family and Medical Leave Act  the Americans with Disabilities Act  and the Clean Water Act  He s criticized the Voting Rights Act  He s been contemptuously dismissive of claims of racial bias in the application of the death penalty  He s relentlessly advocated its use  even for persons with mental retardation  He s even ridiculed the Supreme Court justices  calling them nine octogenarian lawyers who happen to sit on the Supreme Court   He can t even get his facts right  Only two of the nine justices are 80 or older     Mr  Pryor s opposition to basic protections for the rights of the disabled is particularly troubling  In one case  Justice Scalia  for a unanimous Court  rejected his position that the Americans with Disabilities Act doesn t apply to state prisons     In another case  the Supreme Court rejected his view that provisions of the Act ensuring that those with disabilities have access to public services is unconstitutional  In that case  a plaintiff who uses a wheelchair challenged the denial of access to a courthouse  where he had to crawl up the stairs to reach the courtroom  Mr  Pryor claimed that Congress could not require states to make public facilities accessible to the disabled  He said that because the disabled have no absolute right to attend legal proceedings affecting their rights  denying them access to courthouses does not violate the principle of equal protection     The Supreme Court also rejected his radical view that executing retarded persons is not cruel and unusual punishment  And later  the Eleventh Circuit  a court dominated by conservative  Republican appointees  unanimously rejected Mr  Pryor s attempt to evade that Supreme Court decision  He had tried to prevent a prisoner with an IQ of 65    who even the prosecution agreed was mentally retarded    from claiming that he should not be executed     On women s rights  Mr  Pryor has criticized constitutional protections against gender discrimination  He dismissed as political correctness the Supreme Court s decision that a state run military academy could not deny admission to women because of stereotypes about how women learn     Mr  Pryor also has an especially troubling record on voting rights  In a 1997 statement to Congress  he opposed Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act  an indispensable tool for ensuring that all Americans have the right to vote  regardless of race or ethnic background  He called this important law an affront to federalism and an expensive burden that has far outlived its usefulness     In March  we commemorated the fortieth anniversary of Bloody Sunday  when Martin Luther King  Congressman John Lewis  and others were brutally attacked on a peaceful march in Mr  Pryor s home state of Alabama in support of voting rights for all  regardless of race  Yet now the Administration wants our consent to a nominee who opposes the Voting Rights Act  There s too much at stake to risk confirming a judge who would turn back progress on protecting the right to vote    It s no surprise that civil rights leaders oppose Mr  Pryor s nomination  including Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth  a leader in the Alabama movement for voting rights  Reverend C T  Vivian  and many of Dr  King s other close advisors and associates     There can be no doubt that Mr  Pryor sees the federal courts as a place to advance his political agenda  When President Bush was elected in 2000  Mr  Pryor gave a speech praising his election as the last best hope for federalism  He ended his speech with these words    a prayer for the next administration  Please God  no more Souters     In another speech  he said he was thankful for the Bush v  Gore decision  I wanted Governor Bush to have a full appreciation of the judiciary and judicial selection so we can have no more appointments like Justice Souter  His call to politicize the Supreme Court shows that he views the courts as places to make law  not interpret it    The real question is why  when there are so many qualified Republican attorneys in Alabama  the President would choose such a divisive nominee  Why pick one whose record raises so much doubt as to whether he will be fair  Why pick one who can muster only a rating of partially unqualified from the American Bar Association  The Administration has given us no good answers to these questions  because there are none  Mr  Pryor is clearly on the far fringe of legal thinking  and not someone who should be given a life time appointment to the courts of appeals  Of course we oppose the attempt to break Senate rules to put Mr  Pryor on the court  That is what our founding fathers would have wanted us to do  not to act as a rubber stamp for the Administration     Priscilla Owen    whose nomination the Senate is debating today    is another candidate on the far fringes of legal thinking  Her record raises equally grave concerns that she would try to remake the law  Four times  the Senate has declined to confirm her  because of concerns that she won t deal fairly with the wide range of cases that come before the Fifth Circuit  especially on issues of major concern to workers  consumers  victims of discrimination  and women exercising their constitutional right to choose     Yet the President chose to provoke a fight in the Senate by renominating her  among other plainly unacceptable nominees whom the Senate declined to confirm in the last Congress  Nothing has changed since we last reviewed her record to make Justice Owen worthy of confirmation now     Her supporters argue that she is being opposed solely because of her hostility to women s constitutionally protected right to choose  In fact  her nomination raises a wide range of major concerns  because she so obviously fails to approach cases fairly and with an open mind  As the San Antonio Express News has stated  her record demonstrates a results oriented streak that belies supporters  claims that she strictly follows the law     It s not just Senate Democrats who question her judicial activism and willingness to ignore the law  Even newspapers that endorsed her for the Texas Supreme Court now oppose her confirmation after seeing how poorly she served as a judge  The Houston Chronicle wrote that her record shows less interest in impartially interpreting the law than in pushing an agenda  and that she too often contorts rulings to conform to her particular conservative outlook  It noted that It s saying something that Owen is a regular dissenter on a Texas Supreme Court made up mostly of other conservative Republicans     The Austin American Statesman wrote that Priscilla Owen is so conservative  she places herself outside of the broad mainstream of jurisprudence  and that she seems all too willing to bend the law to fit her views     The San Antonio Express News said that  w hen a nominee has demonstrated a propensity to spin the law to fit philosophical beliefs  it is the Senate s right    and duty    to reject that nominee     Her colleagues on the conservative Texas Supreme Court have repeatedly described her in the same way  They state that Justice Owen puts her own views above the law  even when the law is crystal clear  Her former colleague on the Texas Supreme Court  our Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  has said she was guilty of an unconscionable act of judicial activism     Some claim that Attorney General Gonzales didn t mean what he said  But in fact  Justice Gonzales  separate opinion specifically rejected the dissenting position subscribed to by Justice Owen  He emphasized that the majority opinion was based on the text of a law written by the Texas Legislature  He said   o ur role as judges requires that we put aside our own personal views of what we might like to see enacted  and instead do our best to discern what the Legislature actually intended     Justice Gonzales went on to say that the opinion she subscribed to  set forth narrow standards contrary to the intent of the legislature  I respectfully submit that these are policy decisions for the Legislature  he said  And this is what he clearly criticized as unconscionable  activism     Justice Gonzales  statement that her position in this case was an unconscionable act of judicial activism was not a random remark  Not once  not twice  but numerous times  Justice Gonzales and his other colleagues on the Texas Supreme Court have noted that Priscilla Owen ignores the law to reach her desired result    In one case  Justice Gonzales held that Texas law clearly required manufacturers to be responsible to retailers that sell their products if those products are defective  He wrote that Justice Owen s dissenting opinion would judicially amend the statute to let manufacturers off the hook    In 2000  Justice Gonzales and a majority of the Texas Supreme Court upheld a jury award holding the Texas Department of Transportation and the local transit authority responsible for a deadly auto accident  He explained that the result was required by the plain meaning of Texas law  Justice Owen dissented  claiming that Texas should be immune from these suits  Justice Gonzales wrote that she misread the law  which he said was clear and unequivocal    In another case  Justice Gonzales joined a majority that criticized Justice Owen for disregarding the procedural limitations in the statute  and taking a position even more extreme than had been argued by the defendant     In another case in 2000  landowners claimed a Texas law exempted them from local water quality regulations  The court s majority ruled that the law was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to private individuals  Justice Owen dissented and sided with the large landowners including contributors to her campaign  Justice Gonzales joined a majority opinion criticizing her view  stating that most of her opinion was nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric which merits no response     Justice Gonzales also wrote an opinion holding that an innocent spouse could recover insurance proceeds when her co insured spouse intentionally set fire to their insured home  Justice Owen joined a dissent that would have denied coverage of the spouse  on the theory that the arsonist might somehow benefit from the court s decision  Justice Gonzales  majority opinion stated that her argument was based on a theoretical possibility that would never happen in the real world  and that violated the plain language of the insurance policy     In still another case  Justice Owen joined a partial dissent that would have limited the basic right to jury trials  The dissent was criticized by the other judges as a judicial sleight of hand to bypass the Texas Constitution     Priscilla Owen is one of the most frequent dissenters on the conservative Texas Supreme Court in cases involving basic protections for workers  consumers  and victims of discrimination  That court is dominated by Republican appointees  and is known for frequently ruling against plaintiffs  Yet  when the Court rules in favor of plaintiffs  Justice Owen usually dissents  taking the side of the powerful over individual rights    She has limited the rights of minors in medical malpractice cases  She has tried to cut back on people s right to relief when insurance company claims are unreasonably denied  even in cases of bad faith  Her frequent dissents show a pattern of limiting remedies for workers  consumers  and victims of discrimination or personal injury    She dissented in a case interpreting a key Texas civil rights law that protects against discrimination based on age  race  gender  religion  ethnic background  and disability  Justice Owen s opinion would have required employees to prove discrimination was the only reason for the actions taken against them    even though the law clearly states that workers need only prove that discrimination was one of the motivating factors  Justice Owen s view would have changed the plain meaning of the law to make it nearly impossible for victims of discrimination to prevail in civil rights cases    She joined an opinion that would have reversed a jury award to a woman whose insurance company had denied her claim for coverage of heart surgery bills  Many other such cases could be cited     Justice Owen also dissented in a case involving three women who sought relief for intentional infliction of emotional distress on the job because of constant humiliating and abusive behavior by their supervisor     The supervisor harassed and intimidated employees by the daily use of profanity  by screaming and cursing at employees  by charging at employees and physically threatening them  and by humiliating employees  including making an employee stand in front of him in his office for as long as thirty minutes while he stared at her  The employees he harassed suffered from severe emotional distress  tension  nervousness  anxiety  depression  loss of appetite  inability to sleep  crying spells and uncontrollable emotional outbursts as a result of his so called supervision  They sought medical and psychological help because of their distress     Eight Justices on the Texas Court agreed that the actions  viewed as a whole  were extreme and outrageous enough to justify the jury s verdict of intentional infliction of emotional distress  Justice Owen wrote a separate opinion  stating that while she agreed that there was evidence to support the women s case  she thought most of it was legally insufficient to support the verdict     Justice Owen s record is particularly troubling in light of the important issues that come before the Fifth Circuit  which is also one of the most racially and ethnically diverse Circuits  with a large number of low income workers  Latinos  and African Americans  It is particularly vital that judges on the court are fair to workers  victims of discrimination  and those who suffer personal injuries     Some have said that those who raise questions about Justice Owen s record are somehow smearing her personally  That s untrue and unfair  Each of us has a responsibility to review her record and to take seriously the problems we find     That means taking seriously the rights of persons like Ralf Toennies  who was fired at age 55  and found that Justice Owen wanted to impose obstacles to his age discrimination claim that were nowhere in the statute  We must take seriously the rights of the women employees criticized by Justice Owen for their testimony on workplace harassment in the emotional distress case  We can t ignore the rights of the millions of families who live in the Fifth Circuit states of Texas  Louisiana  and Mississippi  Finally  Justice Owen s supporters have also suggested that she should be confirmed to the Court of Appeals because Texas voters elected her to their Supreme Court     Obviously  there is a huge difference between state judges who must submit to local elections to keep their positions and federal judges who are lifetime appointees  and are not meant to respond to popular opinion  If we confirm Justice Owen to the Fifth Circuit  she will serve for life  So our responsibility as Senators is very different  The record of each nominee for a federal judgeship is carefully considered by Senators from all 50 states    Likewise  the fact that she received a high rating from the American Bar Association or did well on the bar exam does not erase her disturbing record  Priscilla Owen s record raises major questions about her commitment to the basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution to all our citizens     The majority leader has indicated that he will soon begin debate on yet another extreme  right wing nominee  Janice Rogers Brown  whom the President has nominated for the very important D C  Circuit  Janice Rogers Brown s record on the California Supreme Court makes clear that    like Priscilla Owen    she s a judicial activist who will roll back basic rights  When she joined the California Supreme Court  the California State Bar Judicial Nominees Evaluation Commission had rated her not qualified  and insensitive to established legal precedent as a member of the state court of appeals     All Americans  wherever they live  should be concerned about her nomination to the D C  Circuit  which interprets federal laws that protect our civil liberties  workers  safety  and our ability to breathe clean air and drink clean water in our communities  Only the D C  Circuit can review the national air quality standards under the Clean Air Act and national drinking water standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act  This court also hears the lion s share of cases involving rights of employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the National Labor Relations Act     Yet Janice Rogers Brown s record shows a deep hostility to civil rights  to workers  rights  to consumer protection  and to a wide variety of governmental actions in many other areas    the very issues that predominate in the D C  Circuit    Perhaps most disturbing is the contempt she has repeatedly expressed for the very idea of democratic self government  She has stated that where government moves in  community retreats  and  civil society disintegrates  She has said that government leads to families under siege  war in the streets  In her view  when government advances       freedom is imperiled  and  civilization itself jeopardized    She has criticized the New Deal  which gave us Social Security  the minimum wage  and fair labor laws  She s questioned whether age discrimination laws benefit the public interest  She s even said that Today s senior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren because they have a right to get as much  free  stuff as the political system will permit them to extract     No one with these views should be confirmed to a federal court and certainly not to the federal court most responsible for cases affecting government action  It s no wonder that an organization seeking to dismantle Social Security is running ads supporting her nomination to the second most powerful court in the country    Janice Rogers Brown has also written opinions that would undermine civil rights  She has held  for example  that the First Amendment prevents courts from granting injunctions against racial slurs in the workplace  even when those slurs are so pervasive that they create a hostile work environment in violation of federal job discrimination laws  In other opinions  she has argued against allowing victims of discrimination to obtain relief in state courts  or to obtain damages from administrative agencies for their pain and suffering  She has rejected binding precedent on the constitutional limits on an employer s ability to require employees to submit to drug tests     Americans should be concerned that President Bush has selected William Myers for the important Ninth Circuit court of appeals  Mr  Myers is a long time mining and cattle industry lobbyist  He has compared federal laws protecting the environment to the tyrannical actions of King George over the American colonies  He has denounced our environmental laws as regulatory excesses     In the Interior Department  he served his corporate clients instead of the public interest  As Solicitor of Interior  he tried to give public land worth millions of dollars to corporate interests  He issued an opinion clearing the way for mining on land sacred to Native Americans  without consulting the tribes affected by his decision    although he took the time to meet personally with the mining company that stood to profit from his opinion     William Myers is a particularly inappropriate choice for the Ninth Circuit  which contains many of America s most precious natural resources and national parks  including the Grand Canyon and Yosemite National Park  and which is home to many Native American tribes  The Ninth Circuit decides many of the most important environmental disputes affecting America s natural heritage     It has a special role in safeguarding the cultural and religious heritage of the first Americans  It deserves an impartial judge who will deal fairly with environmental claims  not a mining company lobbyist clearly opposed to environmental protections  The Ninth Circuit needs judges who will respect Native American rights  not a judge whom the head of the National Congress of American Indians has called the worst possible choice for Native Americans    Yesterday we celebrated the 51st anniversary of the Supreme Court s historic decision in Brown v  Board of Education  It is a timely reminder of the important role that courts play in upholding the rights of the most vulnerable persons in our society     On May 17  1957  the third anniversary of Brown  Martin Luther King hailed the decision as a great beacon light of hope to millions       who had dared only to dream of freedom  He reminded us of the need to place judges on the benches       who will  do justly and love mercy   That is what we must remember when we decide whether to confirm judges to the lifetime appointments on the federal courts  We must ensure that we confirm judges who will uphold individual rights  even against powerful corporate or governmental interests     The nation s founders understood that those in power might believe that the rules that most Americans live by don t apply to them  That s why they put in place a democracy that preserves our rights and freedoms through checks and balances  These checks and balances protect our mainstream values by preventing one party from arrogantly imposing its extreme views on the nation  Without these checks and balances    without the right to debate    the Senate will be nothing more than a rubber stamp for a President s nominees    History will judge us harshly if we don t stand tall against the brazen abuses of power demonstrated by these nominees  The issues at stake in these nominations go well beyond partisan division  The basic values of our society    whether we will continue to be committed to fairness and opportunity and justice for all    are at issue     Many well qualified  fair minded nominees could be quickly confirmed if the Bush Administration would give up the right wing litmus test it applied to these nominees  Why  when there are so many qualified Republican attorneys  would the President choose nominees whose records raise so much doubt about whether they will follow the law  Why force an all out battle over a few right wing nominees  when the nation has so many more pressing problems  such as national security  the economy  education  and health care     President Bush knows how to pick mainstream judges when he wants to  As I said at the outset  208 of his 218 picks have made it through the Senate  But when a nominee gets strong opposition from 41 or more Senators  that s a very reliable indication that the nomination is a non starter  and the President is well advised to re think it    The idea that we have abused the filibuster is nonsense  We have used it as a last resort when the President has ignored our advice  And our advice is  Pick mainstream  moderate judges who will uphold the individual rights of all Americans    not radical ideologues like Priscilla Owen  William Myers  Janice Rogers Brown  and William Pryor     Of all the qualified Republican attorneys  why chose Priscilla Owen  whose own colleagues on the conservative Texas Supreme Court say bends the law to reach a desired result    Why pick William Pryor  who opposes rights for the disabled  voting rights  and the Family Medial Leave Act  and who contemptuously calls the Supreme Court nine octogenarian lawyers     Why pick William Myers who opposes environmental protections and tried to give away valuable public lands     And why pick Janice Rogers Brown    who thinks senior citizens cannibalize their grandchildren by seeking support from society in their old age     Neither the Constitution  nor Senate Rules  nor Senate precedents  nor American history  provide any justification for the Majority Leader s attempt to selectively nullify the use of the filibuster to push through these radical nominees  Equally important  neither the Constitution nor the Rules nor the precedents nor history provide any permissible means for a bare majority of the Senate to take that radical step without breaking or ignoring clear provisions of applicable Senate Rules and unquestioned precedents  Here are some of the rules and precedents that the executive will have to ask its allies in the Senate to break or ignore  in order to turn the Senate into a rubber stamp for nominations       First  they will have to see that the Vice President himself is presiding over the Senate  so that no real Senator needs to endure the embarrassment of publicly violating the Senate s rules and precedents and overriding the Senate Parliamentarian  the way our presiding officer will have to do    Next  they will have to break Paragraph 1 of Rule V  which requires 1 day s specific written notice if a Senator intends to try to suspend or change any rule    Then they will have to break paragraph 2 of Rule V  which provides that the Senate Rules remain in force from Congress to Congress  unless they are changed in accordance with the existing rules    Then they will have to break paragraph 2 of Rule XXII  which requires a motion signed by 16 Senators  a two day wait and a 3 5 vote to close debate on the nomination itself    They will also have to break Rule XXII s requirement of a petition  a wait  and a 2 3 vote to stop debate on a Rules change    Then  since they pretend to be proceeding on a constitutional basis  they will have to break the invariable rule of practice that constitutional issues must not be decided by the presiding officer but must be referred by the Presiding officer to the entire Senate for full debate and decision    Throughout the process they will have to ignore  or intentionally give incorrect answers to  proper parliamentary inquiries which  if answered in good faith and in accordance with the expert advice of the parliamentarian  would make clear that they are breaking the rules    Eventually  when their repeated rule breaking is called into question  they will blatantly  and in dire violation of the norms and mutuality of the Senate  try to ignore the Minority Leader and other Senators who are seeking recognition to make lawful motions or pose legitimate inquiries or make proper objections     By this time  all pretense of comity  all sense of mutual respect and fairness  all of the normal courtesies that allow the Senate to proceed expeditiously on any business at all will have been destroyed by the pre emptive Republican nuclear strike on the Senate floor    To accomplish their goal of using a bare majority vote to escape the rule requiring 60 votes to cut off debate  those participating in this charade will  even before the vote  already have terminated the normal functioning of the Senate  They will have broken the Senate compact of comity  and will have launched a preemptive nuclear war  The battle begins when the perpetrators openly  intentionally and repeatedly  break clear rules and precedents of the Senate  refuse to follow the advice of the Parliamentarian  and commit the unpardonable sin of refusing to recognize the minority leader     Their hollow defenses to all these points demonstrate the weakness of their case    They claim  We are only breaking the rules with respect to judicial nominations  we promise not to do so on other nominations or on legislation  No one seriously believes that  Having used the nuclear option to salvage a handful of activist judges  they will not hesitate to use it to salvage some bill vital to the credit card industry  or the oil industry or the pharmaceutical industry  or Wall Street  or any other special interest  In other words  the Senate majority will always be able to get its way  and the Senate our founders created will no longer exist  It will be an echo chamber to the House  where the tyranny of the majority is so rampant today     One of the greatest privileges of my life is serving the people of Massachusetts in the United States Senate  And I am reminded every day of my obligation to speak up for them and to fight for their concerns  their hopes  and their values in this chamber     Many brave leaders from Massachusetts held the seat that I hold today in the United States Senate    This seat was held by John Quincy Adams  who went on to become our sixth president  and was a great champion of free speech  He refused to be silenced    Charles Sumner was the Senate s leading opponent of slavery  He was beaten to within an inch of his life for speaking up for his convictions  It took him three years to recover from his injuries and return to the Senate to speak out against slavery once again  He refused to be silenced    Daniel Webster  one of our nation s greatest orators and the architect of the Great Compromise of 1850  He spoke up for a united America with the words liberty and union  now and forever  one and inseparable  You can hear his words ringing through these halls even now  He refused to be silenced    Henry Cabot Lodge  the Republican  opposed President Wilson s efforts to join the League of Nations  He was the leading Republican voice on foreign policy in his time  He refused to be silenced     John F  Kennedy not only was a champion of working people in Massachusetts  but he also battled intolerance  injustice  and poverty during his time in the Senate  He  too  refused to be silenced     These great Senators are remembered and respected in our history because they spoke up for their convictions  They were not intimidated  They did not back down from their beliefs  They would not be muzzled  They would not be gagged  They would not be silenced     And it will be a sad day for our democracy if the voices of our nation s elected representatives can no longer be heard   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224
