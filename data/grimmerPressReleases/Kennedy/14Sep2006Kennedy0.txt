         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the House vote on the border fence   Year after year  House Republicans have ignored our broken immigration system and made cut after cut in the funds needed to protect our borders  Today s vote for a fence is a blatant political band aid they hope will provide cover for their stunning failure to produce comprehensive immigration reform  But Americans arent fooled by these cynical election year actions  Americans want us to truly secure our borders by following the advice of Secretary Chertoff  former Secretary Ridge  and every border security expert by dealing with the millions of undocumented immigrants who are already here  This Congress had a historic opportunity to pass a tough but fair immigration reform plan this year  but instead that chance was squandered by those Republicans who are more concerned about the ballot box than actually providing real solutions     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
