         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I want to start by thanking my colleagues  Senator Domenici and Senator Enzi  for their tireless efforts    And I want to recognize the late Senator Paul Wellstone  who championed this fight for so many years  Without the leadership of Senators Wellstone and Domenici  we wouldnt be here on this historic day    Eleven years ago  Congress passed the first Mental Health Parity Act  While that legislation was an important first step in bringing attention to discriminatory practices against the mentally ill  and improving insurance coverage for them    But more steps were clearly needed to guarantee that Americans suffering from mental illnesses were not forced to pay more for the services they need  face harsher limitations on treatment  or be denied access to care    Americans believe that we are all created equal  This bill brings us closer to that ideal by ending health insurance discrimination for mental illnesses for 113 million Americans   One in five Americans will face mental illness this year  Today the United States Senate says to them loud and clear  you will no longer suffer in the shadows   With modern medicine  mental illnesses are just as treatable as physical illnesses    In American medicine today  patients with biochemical problems in their livers are treated with compassion  but those with biochemical problems in their brains are treated harshly    That discrepancy is simply unacceptable    it makes no sense for health insurance to charge patients more for mental health services than they do for physical health services    It is tragic when a family member is diagnosed with any illness  it is heart wrenching for a parent to watch their child suffer    The tragedy is even greater when an insurance company denies treatment for their child solely because the illness is a mental illness   These events tear families apart  exactly when they should be coming together to support their loved one    The stigma against the mentally ill is a blatant form of discrimination and one that is clear in the higher rates some insurance plans charge for mental health treatments  When youre battling depression and other mental illnesses  the last thing you should have to worry about is whether your insurance will cover your treatment and care   In treating the mental illnesses of our fellow citizens  they get their health back    but we get back our friends  our families and our coworkers  This is the right thing to help them live fuller lives   But its also the right thing to do for our nation and our economy  Currently  mental illnesses cost over  324 billion in treatment expenses  lost worker productivity  and crime    The bill we passed represents an agreement  after ten long years of stalemate  not only between Democrats and Republicans  but also with the mental health community  businesses and the insurance industry   We came together and decided that for too long  persons living with mental health disorders have suffered discrimination at all levels of society    They have faced stigma in their communities and prejudice on the job  They have been forced to pay more for the services they need than those with other kinds of illnesses    Together  we have worked to end that discrimination  And the bill we passed yesterday will begin to right these wrongs    In the end  the costs of responsible actions will be small    but the benefits will be immense           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
