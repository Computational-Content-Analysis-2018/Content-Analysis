         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro joined America s working families in the fight for paid sick leave with the introduction of the Healthy Families Act  Kennedy and DeLauro  together with Debra Ness  the President of the National Partnership for Women and Children and Heidi Hartmann  President and CEO for the Institute for Women s Policy Research  rallied with workers who understand what it means to have to choose between a sick loved one at home  or keeping a job    The legislation would allow America s working families to have seven paid days of sick leave a yearfor themselves when they re sick  to take care of their children  parents or loved ones  and to also seek preventative care before illness strikes  Healthy Families also guarantees employers the ability to track paid sick leave and mandates a GAO study on how paid sick leave policies are implemented and the costs and benefits to employers     Paid sick days will help prevent the spread of illness like that  Taking time off to treat illness and injuries will save health costs in the long run  It will make an important difference for insurers  for hospitals and for the health of millions of Americans  It s long past time to provide paid sick days for workers  Kennedy said  This bill is a first step to guarantee that every worker who needs sick leave has it and can afford to take it    Paid sick leave is a necessity to ensure that workers have the right to take time off to deal with their own medical needs  or those of their families  said DeLauro  It is appalling that no federal law in the United States guarantees a single day of paid sick leave to employees particularly when middle class families are trying so hard to make ends meet    Baltimore public school teacher Karen Ingarman spoke to the crowd about the difficulties she faces everyday in her classroom when parents can t afford to take the day off of work to care for their sick children  She urged members of Congress to allow her to focus her attention on teaching her students  instead of caring for sick students who should be recuperating at home under the care of their parents    Kennedy  a champion of worker s rights  argued that paid sick leave for America s working families should be a priority for this Congress  assuring the crowd that he and his fellow Democrats understand the real issues facing working Americans and will fight to see that those issues are addressed           STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON INTRODUCTION OF THE HEALTHY FAMILIES ACT    The ability of American families to live the American dream is becoming harder and harder  With each passing month  it s more difficult for families to earn a living    to pay the mortgage and the doctor bills  and send their sons and daughters to college     In the Bush economy  families are worried about their job security  their income  and the cost of living  They re working longer and harder and finding it more and more difficult to balance their work and their family responsibilities    Most Americans assume that paid sick days are a right  They re not  Half of all American workers are not guaranteed the right to time off when they re ill  without losing their pay  or even their job     In 1993  Congress and the Administration guaranteed unpaid leave for millions of working men and women to deal with serious medical problems     It s time to build on this success  and ensure that millions of workers can also take time off when they need an annual check up  when their children are sick with a cold  and when their ailing elderly parents need to be taken to the doctor     Hard working men and women deserve better  That s why Congresswoman DeLauro and I are introducing legislation to guarantee workers seven days of paid sick leave a year to care for their own medical needs and those of their family members  This proposal covers workers at all businesses  except small businesses with fewer than 15 employees    This is a family issue  When my son was diagnosed with cancer in his leg as a child  and had to undergo surgery  I was able to take the time I needed to be there for him  But year after year  countless employees have to choose between the job they need and the family they love  Families deserve the flexibility to care for each other when they get sick     It s an economic issue   Paid sick days actually save businesses money through reduced turnover and increased productivity      A recent study by Cornell University examined the problem of employees coming to work despite medical problems  They found it costs business  180 billion annually in lost productivity     It s also a public health issue  Too often  employees come to work sick and co workers and many others can easily be infected  Recently  a court ruled that because of the lack of paid sick leave  a stomach virus in one worker infected 600 guests and 300 employees at the Reno Hilton Hotel in Nevada     Paid sick days will help prevent the spread of illnesses like that  Taking time off to treat illnesses and injuries will save health costs in the long run  It will make an important difference for insurers  for hospitals  and for the health of millions of Americans    It s long past time to provide paid sick days for workers  This bill is a first step to guarantee that every worker who needs sick leave has it and can afford to take it           Summary of the Healthy Families Act   The Healthy Families Act will guarantee seven days of annual paid leave for workers to address medical needs and care for family members  It will     o Guarantee paid sick days for an employee s medical condition  an employee s doctor s appointment  or other preventive or diagnostic treatment  and to care for a family member with comparable needs    o Provide prorated leave for part time employees working between 20 and 30 hours a week or between 1 000 and 1 500 hours a year  seven days for workers with more than 30 hours a week     o Apply to all employers with at least 15 or more employees    o Place no new burden on employers that already meet the minimum standards    o Encourage employers to provide greater benefits    o Allow employers to request certification for leave for employees who request 3 or more consecutive days  Employers must keep health information confidential and separate from personnel files     o Require employers to post notice of the availability of paid sick leave and how to file an enforcement action    o Allow an employee or the Secretary of Labor to bring civil action in federal or state court for equitable relief or to recover damages     o Require a GAO study of how these paid sick leave policies are implemented and the benefits and costs of the leave to employers and employees   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202
