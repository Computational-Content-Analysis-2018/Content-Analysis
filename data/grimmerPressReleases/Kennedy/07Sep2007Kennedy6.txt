         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC Today  Senators Edward M  Kennedy and Patty Murray sent the following letters to Centers for Disease Control  the Food and Drug Administration  and the Department of Labor expressing concern over the public health risks of diacetyl  a chemical found in artificial flavorings  Senator Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  said  Recent reports that both manufacturing workers and consumers are suffering from popcorn lung disease make clear that exposure to the chemical diacetyl in artificial flavoring is a serious health risk  It is shocking that the federal agencies charged with safeguarding American workers and consumers have failed to act  despite the growing evidence that this chemical is a serious threat  Prompt action is clearly needed to protect both workers and consumers from this harmful substance  I urge the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Food and Drug Administration to take immediate steps to do their job and protect the workforce and the public  If the Bush Administration wont act  then Congress must I am deeply concerned that we are not doing enough to protect workers and consumers from the serious health risks posed by exposure to diacetyl  said Senator Patty Murray  Chair of the Senate HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety  We can t continue to allow Americans to risk exposure to this deadly chemical with no safety standard  no protection  and little information from the federal agencies charged with protecting consumers and assuring a safe workplace The letters appear below  PDFs of the signed letters are available upon request       September 7  2007Julie Louise GerberdingDirectorCenters for Disease Control and Prevention1600 Clifton Road  NEAtlanta  GA 30333Andrew von EschenbachCommissionerFood and Drug Administration5600 Fishers Lane  Room 1555Rockville  MD 20857Dear Dr  Gerberding and Dr  von Eschenbach We write because we are concerned about the public health risks of diacetyl  the synthetic butter flavoring commonly used in microwavable popcorn and other foods  As recent reports have made clear  the chemical has been associated with bronchiolitis obliterans  often referred to as popcorn lung  a lung disease that can cause serious breathing impairment and even death in severe cases  We were already aware of the serious effects of diacetyl on workers in food manufacturing facilities  where exposure to it has been associated with abnormal lung function and can have swift and debilitating effects  with workers exposed to it becoming ill very quickly  Exposure may also result in a broader range of adverse health effects  such as asthma  pneumonia  granulomatous pneumonitis  tracheo  and bronchiomalacia  fibrosis and other symptoms that have been reported in workers exposed to it Recent studies have now brought to light potential risks to consumers and the public  Media reports this week revealed that a consumer repeatedly exposed by making microwavable popcorn at home has suffered symptoms similar to those of workers exposed to diacetyl  A case has also been reported of bronchiolitis obliterans in a popcorn plant employees child exposed to diacetyl fumes at home where butter flavored oil was regularly used for frying foods The potential health effects are so serious that in recent weeks  manufacturers accounting for 80 percent of sales of microwavable popcorn have announced their intention to reformulate their products to eliminate the use of diacetyl  Because of the wide use of products flavored with diacetyl and the potentially harmful health effects of exposure to the chemical  we urge you to examine immediately the risks of consumer exposure to diacetyl  and the safety of proposed substitutes for this flavoring  We respectfully request that you examine this matter and inform us within 90 days of the date of this letter of any actions your agencies have taken to investigate the potential public health effects of the use of diacetyl as an additive in food products  and any steps that can be taken to mitigate identified health risks associated with consumer exposure to diacetyl  With respect and admiration  we look forward to your response Sincerely _______________________ _______________________  Edward M  Kennedy      Patty

United States Department of Labor200 Constitution Avenue  NWWashington  DC 20210Dear Secretary Chao and Assistant Secretary Foulke  We are writing to urge you to grant the pending petition for an Emergency Temporary Standard for manufacturing workers exposed to diacetyl used in microwave popcorn and flavoring manufacturing workers  Diacetyl  an artificial butter flavoring  has caused death and serious injury in many workers  Numerous studies  including a recent study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine  have established that diacetyl can cause a severe lung disease  bronchiolitis obliterans  in workers at food and flavor manufacturing facilities  Dr  Kathleen Kreiss at the National Institute of Occupational Safety Health  which is responsible for conducting research and making recommendations for the prevention of work related illness  has concluded that diacetyl poses a serious hazard to workers  Her work has also shown that controlling workers exposure to diacetyl  such as by the use of personal protective equipment and improved engineering controls  is effective in preventing illness  The potential danger of exposure to diacetyl clearly calls for a national standard to protect workers and provide guidelines for employers  Were concerned that OSHAs failure to act effectively has created confusion in the industry and delayed effective help for workers  OSHAs National Emphasis Program is an inadequate response to the threats posed by diacetyl  Its scope is insufficient and such a limited program cannot substitute for a standard  More workers will become ill and possibly die as long as the National Emphasis Program remains in place  An emergency temporary standard is needed to protect the lives and health of the workers who need such protection the most  Recent reports that diacetyl also causes harm to consumers confirm the hazards to workers and the need for strong protections  Although some manufacturers have pledged to cease using diacetyl  only an OSHA standard can ensure that all workers are protected  It is time for prompt decisive action  These hardworking Americans deserve no less With respect and appreciation _______________________ _______________________  Edward M  Kennedy      Patty Murray      Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
