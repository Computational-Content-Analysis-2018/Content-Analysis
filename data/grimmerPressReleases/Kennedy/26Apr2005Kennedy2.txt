         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C   Today  Senator Kennedy released the following statement on the completion of President Bush s Social Security tour    This week President Bush finishes his unsuccessful tour to privatize Social Security while Republicans accuse Democrats of being against people of faith  I am reminded of what Jesus said in Matthew 25  As you have done to the least of these  you have done to me  We made a promise to care for the least among us  For nearly two out of every three seniors  Social Security s guaranteed benefit is the only thing standing between them and a life of poverty  I believe we need to keep the promise we made and strengthen  not weaken  the safety net that millions of seniors and disabled Americans rely on   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
