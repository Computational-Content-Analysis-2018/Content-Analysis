         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     As Congress meets for a final session before we adjourn for the holidays  we should be focused on the true meaning of Christmas and the special thoughts that Americans of many faiths have at this time of year regarding their families  their friends and neighbors  and the rest of humanity    Christmas is a season of great hope    a time of goodwill and special caring for others  That s what we should remember as we celebrate the birth of Christ  and the glad tidings of great joy that came to us that day    There are those in America who urge the return of the word Christmas to this holiday season  I believe that while it is an important one  Christmas is more than a word  It is a belief in a power far greater than ourselves  It is a belief in the possibility of lives full of hope and fulfillment  It is a belief that each of us has a sacred obligation to care for one another and to help those in need    to lend a hand to the least of those in our midst  As the Bible teaches us  we should Love thy neighbor as thy self    But I m sad to report  that s not what we re seeing in Congress with this week  and especially with this bill      This bill affects the lives of every single American  It fails our commitments to the education of our children  to our health care  to the poor  and to our jobs  This bill makes life harder for millions and millions of Americans  and that s wrong  Here is just a sample of the intended cuts     EDUCATION   Education cuts will put American students even farther behind  Our promise to leave no child left behind should not be a political slogan    it should be a solemn promise     This bill does nothing to ensure that young children in need begin school ready to succeed    Head Start will increase only  11 million  leaving over 750 000 eligible preschool children without services  In Massachusetts  15 000 eligible children will not be served    Even Start funding is slashed by more than half  30 250 children will be left behind     This bill also fails millions of elementary and secondary school students struggling to succeed    As requirements under the No Child Left Behind Act are more demanding than ever on our states  the Republican proposed bill cuts  780 million in funds for these programs    Title I funding for disadvantaged students  the law s key program  is  9 9 billion lower than the amount President Bush promised  leaving 3 1 million children left behind    Pell Grants are frozen for the fourth year in a row  despite tuition rising 45  at four year public colleges since 2001    So it is not surprising that 170 000 students each year are denied the opportunity to go to college because of cost      LABOR   It cuts job training  even as many jobs go unfilled  In my state  over 70 000 jobs are vacant  yet Massachusetts will receive millions less for training programs to help fill these jobs and put America back to work     At a time when hundreds of thousands of workers continue to struggle to find work in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  and almost 8 million Americans are unemployed  the bill cuts funding for Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services offices that help jobless workers    HEALTH   Perhaps most important  the bill fails to protect America from the serious threat of avian flu  At a time when the lethal flu virus is spreading from country to country and coming ever closer to our shores  it s inconceivable to cut programs to strengthen public health agencies  and help hospitals treat patients with deadly infections    but that s just what this bill does  Worse yet  the Republican leadership rejected the  8 billion amendment that Senator Harkin offered and the Senate approved to enhance vaccine production  stockpile flu medicine  accelerate research  and take other measures needed to prepare for the growing threat  Because the Bush Administration was asleep at the switch  America lags dangerously behind other nations in preparing for flu  This bill compounds those failures  just when action is needed most    Page after page of this Budget tells a different sorry story of distorted priorities of a party that has lost touch with the needs of American families  Congress should reject this proposal and go back to the drawing board to come up with a budget that does not fail to meet our basic responsibilities    The tragic irony is that these cuts come at a time when the Republicans are scrambling to complete a Reconciliation process that would double the deficit and cut programs for the poor in order to secure additional tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans  These actions are unconscionable    America deserves better   We can do better      House Reconciliation Bill Cuts Important Low Income Programs   Food Stamps  The House bill cuts food stamps by  700 million  and cuts 255 000 people from the program    185 000 people will be cut from the Food Stamp Program as a result of the House provision to limit categorical eligibility  Under current law  households who receive any type of benefit under the welfare  TANF  program are categorically eligible for the Food Stamp Program and aren t subject to the same income and asset  The House bill limits categorical eligibility and essentially punishes states that have created new and innovative methods of increasing food stamp eligibility    70 000 legal immigrants will be cut from the Food Stamp Program  The House bill extends the waiting period for eligibility of adult legal immigrants from 5 to 7 years  Massachusetts currently serves 190 000 households through the Food Stamp program  This provision will force 2 060 legal immigrants out of the program in Massachusetts    These cuts are coming just as the USDA release new hunger numbers that indicate 38 million Americans are food insecure an increase of 5 million since President Bush took office    Child Support  The House bill cuts funding for child support enforcement activities by a total of about  5 billion over the next five years  CBO projects the cuts will reduce child support collections by  24 1 billion over the next 10 years    The House bill will harm children in Massachusetts  The cuts will result in a  140 million reduction in the amount of child support collected over the next five years  and a  428 million loss over the next ten years  In addition  CSE has played a vital role in the success of welfare reform in Massachusetts    Child support makes up more than one third of the income of poor families who are not on welfare their second largest source of income  Families who receive child support are three times less likely to return to welfare than families who do not receive child support    Child Care  This House bill increases work requirements on states and families receiving welfare benefits but fails to provide the adequate resources to meet those requirements    The House bill provides only  500 million for child care assistance  This is just half of the amount included in prior House welfare reauthorization bills  This funding is far less than what is needed to keep pace with inflation   4 2 billion  and the new work requirements on families   8 3 billion     The number of child care subsidies to low income working families could fall by 330 000 over the next 5 years     The Senate Reconciliation bill does not include these cuts  However  it is like that many of the cuts will be maintained during conference    Medicaid  The House bill cuts Medicaid by  12 billion over the next five years and  48 billion over 10 years  Massachusetts would be cut by about  336 million and  1 35 billion over 10 years       17 million people would face higher Medicaid cost sharing  The House bill lets states require co payments and deductibles on many Medicaid beneficiaries who do not pay cost sharing under current law  and increase cost sharing for beneficiaries who currently pay some cost sharing  Seven million beneficiaries who currently have no cost sharing would be impacted in the first 5 years  rising to 11 million by 2015  Six million beneficiaries who currently pay some cost sharing would see their costs increase       Most of the  10 billion in savings from higher cost sharing would result because enrollees wouldn t access needed health care  CBO estimates that 80  of the projected savings results from decreased use of services  Health providers would be allowed to deny services if the enrollee doesn t pay the required cost sharing    resulting in higher spending in other areas like emergency room visits       2 million people would have to pay Medicaid premiums  The House bill would allow states to impose premiums on Medicaid enrollees  One million people would face premiums by 2010 and 2 million would face premiums by 2015       110 000 enrollees would lose Medicaid coverage because they can t afford their premiums  70 000 current Medicaid enrollees would lose coverage by 2010 and 110 000 by 2015 because they couldn t afford newly imposed Medicaid premiums allowed under the House bill      5 million Medicaid enrollees    including 2 5 million children    would have their benefits cut  The House bill allows states to cut benefits packages for their enrollees  Benefit cuts would impact 2 5 million enrollees in 2010 and 5 million enrollees by 2015  About half of those impacted would be children       130 000 nursing home residents would be cut from Medicaid  The House bill puts new restrictions on nursing home residents  ability to qualify for Medicaid  This would delay Medicaid eligibility for 120 000 nursing home residents in 2010  and 130 000 residents by 2015      All of these numbers are CBO s conservative estimates  Many believe many more will be impacted  CBO estimates that many states will not increase cost sharing or cut benefits as allowed under the House bill  If all states do cut benefits and increase cost sharing as allowed under the House bill  as many as 30 million Medicaid beneficiaries would face higher costs due to increased cost sharing  Thirty million Medicaid beneficiaries would face new or higher premiums  Two million Medicaid beneficiaries would lose health coverage because they can t afford their premiums  And 26 million Medicaid beneficiaries would have their Medicaid benefits cut    Education      The House proposed Reconciliation bill would also impose new fees on students and fails to provide any increase for student aid at a time when tuition costs are increasing and need based student aid is stagnant      The Senate proposal authored by Senators Enzi and Kennedy included  8 25 billion in new need based student aid funding through the Pell grant formula      Nearly 80 000 students at Massachusetts colleges and universities received over  180 million in Pell grants last year        The Senate proposal would mean an estimated  120 million in additional aid for Pell eligible students in Massachusetts over the next five years    LABOR HHS APPROPRIATIONS BILL  AMERICANS DESERVE BETTER   Education     Smallest increase in Head Start funding since 1986  o Head Start will increase only  11 million  leaving over 750 000 eligible preschool children without services  o In Massachusetts  15 000 eligible children will not be served      Even Start funding is slashed by more than half  from  225 million to  99 million  o Over 30 250 children will be dropped from the program      As requirements under the No Child Left Behind Act are more demanding than ever  the Republican proposed bill cuts  780 million in funds for these programs       Title I funding for disadvantaged students  the law s key program  is  9 9 billion lower than the amount promised in the law  o Nationally  3 1 million children would be left behind  o Over 52 000 Massachusetts children would be left behind  o If enacted  Massachusetts schools would see cuts of over  4 million in Title I funding       Includes no new funding for after school programs  o Funding in the bill   991 million  is less than half the amount promised under NCLB  o At this funding level  1 65 million children would be left out of afterschool programs      Cuts funding to keep our schools safe and drug free  o Funding for Massachusetts schools will be cut from  6 1 million to  4 9 million      Minimal increases in math and science funding while our students fall farther and farther behind  o The bill increases funding for Math and Science Partnerships by only  5 million       Pell Grants are frozen for the fourth year in a row  o The maximum Pell grant remains at  4 050 despite tuition rising 45  at four year public colleges since 2001     Labor     Job training programs cut     o The bill cuts funding for adult and youth training programs by more than  60 million  This would mean a cut of  3 million in Massachusetts       Funding cuts for Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services  even in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and with 8 million Americans unemployed      This bill prohibits OSHA from enforcing respiratory safety standards to protect health care workers from deadly infectious diseases      Workplace safety programs failed to receive adequate funding as workplace deaths rise    Health     NIH received the lowest funding in 35 years       8 billion dollars needed to prepare the U S  for an avian flu outbreak was cut  leaving Americans unprepared    TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST      Ironically    and sadly    these cuts to the budget come as Republicans will try this week to secure over  90 billion in new tax breaks for the wealthiest       Bush and House Republicans want a  90 billion package that will extend the president s dividend and capital gains tax cuts for investors   The Senate Republicans approved a  58 billion alternative  without Bush s priority of extending capital gains and dividend cuts past their 2008 expiration date        According to the Tax Policy Center  the capital gains and dividend tax cuts in the House Republican bill alone will save the average millionaire over  32 000 per year   above and beyond the enormous cuts they ve gotten already from this Administration       Most of the benefits of this extension would flow to taxpayers who make more than  1 million per year  which the New York Times calls morally reprehensible at a time when so much is being cut from domestic programs       Estimates based on data from the Urban Institute    Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center show that if all of the Bush tax cuts are made permanent  the richest 1  of taxpayers will receive an average tax benefit of  58 200 each year  This represents a 7 3  change in their after tax income  By contrast  middle income taxpayers will receive an average annual tax cut of just  655  This would represent only a 2 5  change in their after tax income      The Bush tax cuts already enacted cost nearly two trillion dollars  plus additional interest on the higher national debt        On top of those tax cuts already in place  the President is proposing another  1 5 trillion dollars of extended tax cuts between FY 2006 and 2015  with another  300 billion in additional interest   Even this understates the real cost of making the tax cuts permanent  because nearly all the cost occurs in the five years after 2010  Thus  the real ten year cost  FY 2011    2020  would be nearly  3 0 trillion dollars       In January 2002  Senator Kennedy was the first major Democratic official to call for a rollback of those Bush tax cuts that benefited only wealthy taxpayers  specifically    1  restoring the rates of the top three brackets    39 6   36   and 31  to their 2001 levels    2  maintaining the partial phase out of exemptions and deductions for high income taxpayers contained in the 2001 tax code    3  maintaining the estate tax on estates over  3 5 million   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
