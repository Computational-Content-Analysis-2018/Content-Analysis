         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Administration secrecy doesn t stop with their interrogation policy  This administration has a systematic disregard for oversight and openness  Government is intended to be of the people  by the people  and for the people  Democracy requires informed citizens  and to be informed  citizens need to have information about the government  Congress and the Executive Branch are supposed to be open and accountable  so the American people know what is being done in their name  But under the Bush Administration  openness and accountability have been replaced by secrecy and evasion of responsibility  They abuse their power  conceal their actions from the American people  and refuse to hold officials accountable    No one disputes the necessity of classifying information critical to protecting our national security    military operations  weapon designs  intelligence sources  and similar information  But in the post  9 11 world  the Administration is making secrecy the norm and openness the exception  It has used the tragedy of 9 11 to classify unprecedented amounts of information  Material off limits to the public has become so extensive that no other conclusion is possible  The Bush Administration has a pervasive strategy to limit access to information in order to avoid independent evaluation of its actions by Americans whose job it is to observe and critique their government  When even Congressmen  journalists  and public interest groups complain about limits on access to information  we know the difficulties faced by ordinary Americans seeking information from their government    At a hearing last August in the House Subcommittee on National Security  the Director of the Government s Information Security Oversight Office  J  William Leonard  testified that it is no secret that the government classifies too much information  Too much classification unnecessarily impedes effective information sharing    The deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security  Carol A  Haave  said that as much as half of all classified information doesn t need to be classified    Last year  a record 15 6 million documents were classified by the Bush Administration at a cost of 7 2 billion dollars  many under newly invented categories with fewer requirements for classification     The Administration argues that all this secrecy is necessary to win the war on terrorism  But the 9 11 Commission Report said that too much government secrecy had hurt U S  intelligence capability even before 9 11  Secrecy stifles oversight  accountability  and information sharing  says the report  They know from their own experience     In July 2003  the 9 11 Commission s co chairmen  Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton  complained publicly that the Administration was failing to provide requested information   In October 2003  the Commission had no choice  after repeated requests  but to subpoena records from the FAA   In November 2003  after multiple requests  the Commission again had to subpoena information  this time from the Department of Defense     For the rest of that fall and spring  the Administration repeatedly tried to deny access to presidential documents important to the Commission s investigation  until public outcry grew loud enough to convince the administration otherwise   Key members of the administration balked at testifying  until public opinion again swayed their stance    And then  in an ironic twist  28 pages of the 9 11 Commission Report itself was classified  So  is all this secrecy really about protecting us from the terrorists  Or is it just to avoid accountability    This Administration  once in office  wasted no time challenging those who would hold them accountable  In May 2001  Vice President Cheney s energy task force issued its report recommending more oil and gas drilling to solve our energy problems  In light of his former employment at Halliburton  the recommendation was hardly astonishing  What was astonishing was the Vice President s refusal to identify the people and groups who helped write the policy  In June 2001  the GAO  the nonpartisan  investigative arm of Congress  requested information on the energy task force  following reports that campaign contributors had special access while the public was shut out  GAO s request was simple  It asked  Who serves on this task force  what information is being presented to the task force and by whom is it being given  andthe costs involved in the gathering of the facts  Considering that the task force wrote the nation s energy policy  it was not an unreasonable request    The Administration refused to comply  even though GAO s request was not out of the ordinary  President Clinton s task forces on health care and on China trade relations were both investigated by GAO  The Clinton administration turned over detailed information on the participants and proceedings of the task forces    But the Bush Administration argued that GAO did not have the authority to conduct the investigation  For the first time in its 80 year history  GAO was forced to file suit against an administration to obtain requested information  But the court sided with the Administration in Walker v  Cheney  and GAO s investigative oversight authority was effectively reduced  Independent oversight is critically important when one party controls both Congress and the White House  and GAO is critical to that oversight    On October 12  2001  John Ashcroft wrote a memo outlining the Justice Department s views on Freedom of Information Act requests  The memo set the tone for an Administration hostile to such requests  It discouraged executive branch agencies from responding to Freedom of Information Act requests  even when the agencies had the option to respond  He basically reversed the long standing policy of prior administrations    The Clinton Administration policy  set forth by Attorney General Janet Reno  was that if a document could be released without harm  an agency should do so  even if there were technical grounds for withholding it  They knew that government openness was essential to an informed public    When the Bush Administration came to office  Attorney General Ashcroft disagreed    he wrote that if there is any technical ground for withholding a document under the Freedom of Information Act  an agency should withhold it  The Clinton policy had been release if at all possible  The Bush policy was keep secret if at all possible    Why should the public know what the administration is doing  Why release documents that might be embarrassing to the White House or its friends in business    Some organizations claim  based on their experience  that this obsession with secrecy goes even farther  and that executive branch agencies are being told to withhold information until it is subpoenaed  Sean Moulton  a senior policy analyst at OMB Watch  argued that if there are documents the government doesn t want to release but doesn t have any legal basis for withholding  unless you re willing to go to court  you re not getting those documents     Since the tragedy of September 11  this Administration has effectively shut down inquiry after inquiry     In November 2001  energy companies were planning a natural gas pipeline through the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia  Local citizens  led by former U S  Army Ranger Joseph McCormick  asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a map of the planned pipeline  These citizens weren t being nosy    they wanted to know if a large new pipeline for natural gas would be going through their backyards  FERC denied the citizens  request in the name of national security  even though this type of information had been public before 9 11  Clearly  national security concerns are legitimate  But without knowledge of the pipeline s location  how could these citizens defend their property  Joseph McCormick put it bluntly  There certainly is a balance  he said  It s about people s right to use the information of an open society to protect their rights      In the fall of 2002  the chemical compound perchlorate was found in the water supply of Aberdeen  Maryland    near the Army s famous Aberdeen Proving Ground  Perchlorate is a main ingredient of rocket fuel  It also stunts the metabolism and brain growth of newborns  A group of citizens organized  and worked with the Army to protect their drinking water from further contamination  But a few months later  the Army began censoring maps and information that would help determine which areas were contaminated  supposedly in the interest of national security    if citizens could find out where the water was contaminated  then terrorists could find it too  The head of the citizens  group was a 20 year army veteran  His water well was only a mile and a half away from the proving ground  It s an abuse of power  he said  The government has to be transparent     Even Members of Congress have had to subpoena information in order to do their work  Last October  Congressmen Christopher Shays and Henry Waxman  the Chairman and Ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security  Emerging Threats and International Relations  asked for an audit of the Development Fund for Iraq  The copy they received had over 400 items blacked out  They had so much difficulty obtaining an unredacted report from the Defense Department that they had to prepare a subpoena  Once they finally received an unredacted copy  guess what had been blacked out  More than  218 million in charges from Halliburton  So far  no one has been held accountable     It s now been 744 days without a White House investigation into the CIA leak case  It took 85 days for the Administration even to require its staff to turn over evidence relating to the leak  Senate Republicans held 20 hearings on accusations against President Clinton and the Whitewater case  but they ve held zero hearings on the leak of the covert identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame  So far  no one has been held accountable     Last week  the Defense Department refused to cooperate with a federal judge s order to release secret photographs and videotapes of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib  The ACLU had sued to obtain release of 87 photographs and 4 videotapes  but the Administration filed sealed documents resisting the order  They are so obsessed with secrecy that they even make secret arguments to keep their secrets  So far  no one has been held accountable     Also last week  the Administration submitted an initial report on progress in training Iraqi security forces  It s been more than two years since the fall of Baghdad  and a reliable assessment of our progress in training those forces was long overdue  The key questions that the American people want to know are how many Iraqi security forces are capable of fighting on their own and what our military requirements will be the months ahead  But the answers remain classified  The American people deserve to know the facts about our policy  They want to know how long it will take to fully train the Iraqis and when our military mission will be completed  They can deal with the truth  and they deserve it     No one wants to do anything that would help the insurgents  But the Administration must do a better job of responding to the legitimate concerns of the American people  The Administration still isn t willing to be candid  It needs to find a way to shed some of the secrecy and answer these questions in good faith for the American people  The silence is deafening     There s also a pattern of withholding information from members of Congress on the Administration s nominations  In 2003  Miguel Estrada was nominated for a federal judgeship  We requested legal memos he wrote as Assistant Solicitor General  and we were repeatedly denied  In 2004  Alberto Gonzales was nominated to be Attorney General  We requested various memoranda he authorized on administration torture policy  and we were repeatedly denied  Earlier this year  John Bolton was nominated to be Ambassador to the United Nations  We requested documents to determine if he acted appropriately in his previous job  and we have been repeatedly denied    Instead of coming clean and providing the information to the Congress  weve been stonewalled  Our questions have gone unanswered  And now  the President appears to be poised to abuse his power further  rub salt in the wound  and send John Bolton to the United Nations anyway with a recess appointment of dubious constitutionality     Now John Roberts has been nominated to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court  We hope this nomination will be different  but press accounts suggest otherwise  The Administration announced it would not release many of the memos written by John Roberts while he served in the Reagan and first Bush Administrations  They say they will claim attorney client privilege  but many of the memos vital to our consideration of Judge Roberts for the Supreme Court were written while he worked in the Solicitor General s office  That office works for all the American people    not just the President  They know Attorney client privilege clearly does not prevent them from providing or the Senate from receiving these vital materials     Yes  the Administration has consistently used the horror of 9 11 and its disdain of Congressional oversight to get its way and avoid accountability  It consistently uses this secrecy to roll back the rights of average Americans  But even its best spin doctors can t conceal some of the Administration s most flagrant abuses of power    Last August  the New York Times reported that health rules  environmental regulations  energy initiatives  worker safety standards and product safety disclosure policies have been modified in ways that often please business and industry leaders while dismaying interest groups representing consumers  workers  drivers  medical patients  the elderly and many others  Often  this has been done in silence and near secrecy     In 2000  Congress responded to the disclosure of defects in Firestone tires  which may have been responsible for as many as 270 deaths  by passing legislation which would make information on auto safety and related defects readily available  But in July 2003  the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration decided that reports of defects would cause substantial competitive harm to the auto industry  and exempted warranty claims and consumer complaints from the Freedom of Information Act  Clearly  that was another abuse of power that protects big business while putting the American public at greater risk      In 2003  the Administration knowingly withheld cost estimates of its Medicare prescription drug bill    one of the most important pieces of legislation that year  The estimates showed costs over  100 billion more than the Administration claimed  but the information was withheld because of fears that the actual numbers would persuade Members of Congress to vote no  Administration officials threatened to fire Chief Actuary Richard Foster so fast his head would spin  if he informed Congress of the real cost estimate  I wrote a letter to the Administration on this subject  but they never responded to my questions     In 2003  the Food and Drug Administration kept secret a report that children on antidepressants were twice as likely to be involved in suicide related behavior  The FDA also prevented the author of the study    their expert on the issue    from presenting his findings to an FDA advisory committee  Dr  Joseph Glenmullen  a Harvard psychiatrist  said Evidence that they re suppressing a report like this is an outrage  given the public health and safety issues at stake For the FDA to issue an ambiguous warning when they had unambiguous data like this is an outrage     In November 2003  the White House told the Appropriations Committees in both houses of Congress that it would only respond to requests for information if they were signed by the committee chairman  In a time of one party rule  this tactic made Congressional oversight almost completely impossible     In April 2004  the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  Senator Jeffords  was forced to place holds on several EPA nominees after the Administration refused to respond to twelve outstanding information requests  including information on air pollution     In August 2004  under pressure from the Department of Homeland Security  the FCC decided to make telephone service outage reports confidential  and exempt them from Freedom of Information Act requests  The FCC argued it was because companies could use competitors  service outages in ad campaigns  You may not be able to make informed decisions on your phone company  but at least the company will be protected from nasty advertising     Last month  we discovered that the administration had blocked studies criticizing the Central American Free Trade Agreement    after it had already paid for them  In 2002  the Department of Labor hired the International Labor Rights Fund to back up its argument that Central American countries had improved on labor issues  The contractor found the opposite  and posted its results on its website in March 2004  The Labor Department ordered its removal from the website  banned its release  and barred the contractor s employees from discussing the report  The Department of Labor denied a Congressman s request for the report under the Freedom of Information Act  These are the American people s tax dollars  But when the administration didn t like an answer  it abused its power to avoid accountability    at their expense     Yesterday  the Wall Street Journal disclosed yet another list of abuses in Iraq reconstruction  10 billion dollars of no bid contracts were awarded  89 million dollars was doled out without contracts at all  9 billion dollars is unaccounted for  and may have been embezzled  An official fired for incompetence was still giving out millions of dollars in aid  weeks after his termination  A contractor was paid twice for the same job  A third of all U S  vehicles that Halliburton was paid to manage are missing  It s a staggering display of incompetence and cover up  so that no one will be held accountable    Americans deserve better  They deserve the information necessary to become informed  effective citizens  We as lawmakers are better able to represent our constituents when we have access to the critical information held by the executive branch  We must never forget who we work for    the American people  Congress is a co equal branch of government  and we have a duty to hold the administration accountable for its actions   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
