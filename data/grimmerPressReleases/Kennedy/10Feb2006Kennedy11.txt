         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The asbestos legislation before the Senate is both unfair and unworkable  It is unfair because many seriously ill victims of asbestos disease are completely excluded from compensation under the Trust Fund  And it is unworkable because the bill does not have adequate funding to ensure that all the victims who are eligible for compensation under the Trust Fund will actually receive what the legislation promises them  These are fundamental flaws that cannot be corrected by a few last minute amendments  They go to the heart of the bill  This bill will end up hurting the seriously ill victims of asbestos disease who we are trying help    S  852 fails the test of fairness for many of those most in need of assistance  Now is the time to take a serious look at how the proposed Trust Fund would operate  Now  before it is too late  Who would be excluded from receiving compensation even though they are seriously ill from asbestos exposure  Who would be left in legal limbo    ineligible for the Trust Fund but unable to pursue their claims in court     I have said many times that the real crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation crisis  it is an asbestos induced disease crisis  We cannot allow the tragedy these workers and their families are enduring to become lost in a complex debate about the economic impact of asbestos litigation  The litigation did not create these costs  Exposure to asbestos created them  They are the cost of medical care  the cost of lost wages of incapacitated workers  and the cost of providing for the families of workers who died years before their time  Those costs are real  No legislative proposal can make them disappear  All legislation can do is shift those costs from one party to another  Unfortunately  S 852 would shift more of the financial burden onto the backs of injured workers  That is unacceptable     Let s look at what this legislation would really do to victims    Start Up It would close the courthouse doors to asbestos victims on the day it passes  long before the Trust Fund will be able to pay their claims  Their cases will be stayed immediately  Seriously ill workers will be forced into a legal limbo for up to two years  Their need for compensation to cover medical expenses and basic family necessities will remain  but they will have nowhere to turn for relief     Under the legislation  even exigent health claims currently pending in the courts will be automatically stayed for nine months as of the date of enactment  These cases all involve people who have less than a year to live due to mesothelioma or some other disease caused by asbestos exposure  Nine months is an eternity for someone with less than a year to live  Many of them will die without receiving either their day in court or compensation from the Trust Fund    The stay language is written so broadly that it would stop all forward movement of a case in the court system  A trial about to begin would be halted  An appellate ruling about to be issued would be barred  Even the deposition of a dying witness could not be taken to preserve his testimony  The stay would deprive victims of their last chance at justice  I cannot believe that the authors of this bill intended such a harsh result  but that is what the legislation does    I strongly believe that  at a minimum  all exigent cases should be exempted from the automatic stay in the legislation  Victims with less than a year to live certainly should be allowed to continue their cases in court uninterrupted until the Trust Fund became operational  Their ability to recover compensation in the court should not be halted until the Trust Fund is open for business and they are able to receive compensation from that Fund  It is grossly unfair to leave these dying victims in a legal limbo  For them  the old adage is especially true    justice delayed is justice denied    We should not deprive them of their last chance    their only chance    to receive some measure of justice before asbestos induced disease silences them  They should be allowed to receive compensation in their final months to ease their suffering  They should be allowed to die knowing that their families are financially provided for  S 852 in its current form takes that last chance away from them    I intend to offer an amendment that will allow these severely ill victims to have their day in court    Lung Cancer Victims I am particularly upset by the way lung cancer victims are treated in this bill  Under the medical criteria adopted by the Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly two years ago  all lung cancer victims who had at least 15 years of weighted exposure to asbestos were eligible to receive compensation from the Fund  However  that was changed in S 852  Under this bill  lung cancer victims who have had very substantial exposure to asbestos over long periods of time are denied any compensation unless they can show asbestos scarring on their lungs  The Committee heard expert medical testimony that prolonged asbestos exposure dramatically increases the probability that a person will get lung cancer even if they do not have scarring on their lungs  Deleting this category will deny compensation to more than forty thousand victims suffering with asbestos related lung cancers     These victims  many of whom will have their lives cut short because of asbestos induced disease  will not receive one penny in compensation from the Trust Fund  They are losing their right to go to court  but being denied any right to compensation under the Fund  They are  in essence  being told to suffer in a legally imposed silence with no recourse whatsoever    One of the arguments we hear most frequently in favor of creating an Asbestos Trust Fund is that in the current system  too much money goes to people who are not really sick and too little goes to those who are seriously ill  Well  lung cancer victims who have years of exposure to asbestos are the ones who are seriously ill  They are the ones this legislation is supposed to be helping  Yet  they are being completely excluded    Any person who was exposed to asbestos for 15 or more weighted years and now has lung cancer should be eligible for compensation from the Trust Fund  Their cases would be reviewed individually by a panel of physicians to determine whether asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to their lung cancer  These 40 000 victims of asbestos should not be arbitrarily excluded from receiving compensation  They were included in the original legislation  it was agreed to by medical experts for both business and labor  and that provision should be restored to the bill  I will be proposing an amendment to rectify this serious injustice    Community Contamination Another major shortcoming of this legislation is its failure to compensate the residents of areas that have experienced large scale asbestos contamination  S 852 simply pretends that this problem does not exist  It fails to compensate the victims of all asbestos induced diseases  other than mesothelioma  whose exposure was not directly tied to their work  There is very substantial scientific evidence showing that the men  women and children who lived in the vicinity of asbestos contaminated sites  such mining operations and processing plants  can and do contract asbestos induced disease    The reason that this legislation needs a special provision to compensate the residents of Libby  Montana  is because it does not compensate victims of community contamination generally  The residents of Libby are certainly entitled to compensation  but so are the residents who lived near the many processing plants from Massachusetts to California that received the lethal ore from the Libby mine  The deadly dust from Libby  Montana was spread across America  W R  Grace shipped almost 10 billion pounds of Libby ore to its processing facilities between the 1960s and the mid 1990s  One of the places it was shipped was to the Town of Easthampton  Massachusetts  where the operations of an expanding plant spread the asbestos to the surrounding environment  into the air and onto the soil  I intend to discuss this problem in great detail as the debate moves forward    I raise it now as a dramatic example of the unfairness caused by the arbitrary exclusion of a large number of asbestos victims from compensation under the Trust Fund  Nor is the problem of community contamination limited to the sites receiving ore from Libby  Community asbestos contamination can result from many different sources  For example  medical experts believe it may result from exposure to asbestos after the collapse of the World Trade Center  Because of the long latency period  we often do not learn about community asbestos contamination until long after it occurs  Certainly these victims of asbestos are entitled to fair treatment as well  They should not be arbitrarily excluded from compensation as if their suffering is somehow less worthy of recognition than the suffering of other asbestos victims  Yet  that is what S 852 does    Sunset The way the legislation is written  victims will lose out at the back end of the process as well  should the Trust Fund run out of money after several years of operation    If the Trust Fund does become insolvent  a very real possibility  workers will not have an automatic right to immediately return to the court system  The process outlined in the current bill could take years  Workers could end up trapped in the Trust with reduced benefits and long delays in receiving their payments  There needs to be a clear  objective trigger    inability of the Trust to pay a certain percentage of claims within a set period of time    that will automatically allow victims to pursue their claims in court if the Trust runs out of money  The Judiciary Committee s 2003 legislation contained such a provision  but this bill does not  We cannot allow seriously injured workers with valid claims who are not paid in a timely manner by the Trust to be denied their day in court  That would be a shameful injustice    The Asbestos Trust is being presented as an alternative source of compensation for victims suffering from asbestos induced disease  If that alternative runs out of money and can no longer compensate those victims in a full and timely manner  their right to seek compensation through the judicial system should be immediately restored with no strings attached  No principle is more basic  Yet  this bill violates that principle    Financial Inadequacy   The second major flaw in this legislation is that it lacks adequate funding  Putting it bluntly   S 852 does not provide sufficient money to compensate those victims of asbestos disease that it promises to cover  That is the essence of the budget debate we are having about the bill  The sponsors claim that the Budget Point of Order against S  852 is technical  but the financial inadequacy of the Trust Fund to meet its obligations is very real  Should the Trust Fund fail  both asbestos victims and taxpayers will pay a heavy price     A broad range of experts have analyzed S  852 and concluded that the Asbestos Trust created by this legislation is seriously underfunded  The funding plan in this bill relies on very substantial borrowing in the early years as the only way to pay the flood of claims  The result will be huge debt service costs over the life of the Trust that could reduce the  140 billion intended to pay claims by as much as 40 percent  The amount remaining would be far too little to pay the claims of all of those who are entitled to compensation under the terms of the bill  The Trust Fund will become insolvent  leaving the victims destitute     There is likely to be a serious shortfall in the early years  when nearly 300 000 pending cases will be transferred to the Trust for payment  Studies show the Trust will not have the resources to pay those claims in a timely manner  Payments to critically ill people may be delayed for years    In its August 2005 report  CBO recognizes the seriousness of this debt service problem  explaining    Because expenses would exceed revenues in many of the early years of the fund s operations  the Administrator would need to borrow funds to make up the shortfall  The interest cost of this borrowing would add significantly to the long term costs faced by the fund and contributes to the possibility that the fund might become insolvent   Emphasis added    In a response to inquiries from Judiciary Committee members  last week CBO issued an even more dire warning about the likelihood of insolvency    There is a significant likelihood that the fund s revenues would fall short of the amount needed to pay valid claims  as well as debt service and administrative costs  There is also some likelihood that the fund s revenues would be sufficient to meet those needs  The final outcome cannot be predicted with great certainty  Without a substantial increase in the resources available to the fund  there is no way to guarantee that the fund will not either revert to the court system or require additional funding    That statement should trouble every Senator on both sides of the aisle  There is a significant likelihood that the fund s revenues would fall short  While we may disagree on other issues regarding compensation for asbestos victims  each of us knows that it would be disastrous    for victims and businesses alike    to create a Trust Fund that cannot meet its financial commitment to victims and is destined for insolvency  None of us want to see that result  We cannot in good conscience ignore the warnings from the Congressional Budget Office and from other experts    In addition to the concerns CBO has identified  there are other major problems with S 852 related to the projections of pending and future claims that could push the Trust Fund even further out of balance     For example  there has been a significant increase in the number of mesothelioma cases in recent years  The only known cause of mesothelioma is asbestos exposure  This new information suggests that the CBO cost estimate may understate the cost of the mesothelioma claims that the Trust Fund will incur by more than  15 billion  This is by no means the only instance where there is strong evidence to suggest that the number of eligible claimants will substantially exceed CBO estimates    If S  852 is enacted  the United States Government will be making a commitment that hundreds of thousands of seriously ill asbestos victims will be compensated  but will not have ensured that adequate dollars are available to honor its commitment  That will precipitate a genuine asbestos crisis  and this Congress will bear the responsibility for it  Since the Trust Fund will be borrowing extensively from the United States Treasury in its first few years of operation  if it does become insolvent  there will be a direct impact on American taxpayers    Conclusion The argument that there are serious inadequacies in the way asbestos cases are adjudicated today does not mean that any legislation is better than the current system  Our first obligation is to do no harm  We should not be supporting legislation that excludes many seriously ill victims from receiving compensation and that fails to provide a guarantee of adequate funding to make sure that these injured workers covered by the Trust Fund will actually receive what the bill promises them  This bill will do harm to these asbestos victims  I intend to vote no and I urge my colleagues to do the same    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner
