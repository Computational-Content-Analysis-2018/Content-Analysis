         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   We face a clear choice on this bill between two fundamentally different approaches to immigration  There is no debate that our immigration system is broken and needs repair  All of us agree on this point  and reform is essential  The choice we confront today is whether we will answer that call with a decisive vote in favor comprehensive reform  or whether by failing to do so  we will defer to the House of Representatives  which want an enforcement only approach    The recent report of the Independent Task Force on Immigration calls immigration the oldest and newest story of the American experience    Immigration has always been a part of our history  Its in our blood and our genes  From the beginning  immigrants have helped to build our country and make us strong  They have worked in our factories and labored in our fields  They built the railroads that took America to the West  Immigrants have loved America and fought under our flag and with great courage    Generations of immigrants who have settled here found a nation that rewarded their hard work  respected their religious beliefs and enabled them to raise their families  They suffered discrimination  fought against it  overcame it  And this generation of immigrants will overcome it too    Immigrants today are not different  They work hard  They practice their faith  They love their families  And they love America  Today  more than 60 000 immigrants serve in the US military  Many of them have made the ultimate sacrifice  giving their lives for America on the battlefields of Iraq or Afghanistan    That has always been America s story  It s a story we live anew in each new generation  Its what makes us a land of liberty  progress and opportunity  Immigration is not just our heritage but our present and future    Thats why reform is such a pressing issue today   a security issue  an economic issue  a moral issue    The question is  how do we secure our borders effectively to keep out the few criminals and terrorists who want to harm us  and not obstruct the entry of the many others who will continue to benefit our country    How do we deal with the 12 million law abiding  tax paying undocumented immigrants and their families in this country  Its indisputable that their hard work has enhanced our economic prosperity and their skills complemented those of American workers  They live beside us  worship in our churches  attend our schools  and are part of our communities  They deserve a fair chance to come out of the shadows and contribute fully and legally to our country   U S  businesses that are unable to find the American workers they need here must be able to draw upon workers from other nations  Both native born and immigrant workers deserve to be free from exploitation  be paid fair wages  and receive the protections of our labor and health and safety laws   In May  the Senate met this challenge and passed a comprehensive immigration bill with effective enforcement measures  Enforcement alone and fences alone wont work  Those who support an enforcement only  anti immigrant approach may think it is good politics  But security experts agree that cracking down harder on illegal immigrants wont result in our regaining control of our borders  Instead  they believe that the Senate has the right approach  As Tom Ridge  the former Secretary of Homeland Security  recently noted   t rying to gain operational control of the borders is impossible unless our enhanced enforcement efforts are coupled with a robust Temporary Guest Worker program and a means to entice those now working illegally out of the shadows into some type of legal status   Instead of following the sound advice of these experts and focusing on solving real problems  the Senate in considering a House bill to order the Department of Homeland Security to build hundreds of miles of fences along our border with Mexico  a country that is not our enemy  but a close friend and our second largest trading partner  Estimates on the length of this fence range from 700 miles to almost 850 miles  It would be constructed  not only in urban areas  but across deserts and rivers    The House bill is unnecessary  In the Immigration Act of 1996  Congress has already given the executive branch broad authority to install physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border to deter illegal crossings  Earlier this year  Secretary Chertoff told Judiciary Committee Members that he needed about 370 miles of fencing and 461 miles of vehicle barriers in targeted urban areas along the southwest border  The Senate included a provision in our immigrations reform bill to do that  On August 2nd   we agreed by a vote of 94 2 to appropriate  1 8 billion for that purpose    The much longer fence in the pending bill would be a waste of tax payers money  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would cost roughly  3 2 million a mile  which may be on the low end    the first 11 miles of the San Diego fence cost  3 8 million a mile and the final 3 5 mile section cost approximately  10 million a mile  Under more recent estimates  which take into account the cost of roads  lighting  infrastructure  terrain  and other factors  the costs are even higher since the current estimates ignore annual maintenance costs which could be as high as  1 billion a year  The more than 700 miles in fencing that the House proposes  but that Secretary Chertoff does not need  will result in at least a billion dollars in unnecessary spending       In addition  fences dont work  Undocumented inflows have increased by a factor of ten since the continuing strategy of fencing was introduced  San Diegos wall has benefited the smuggling industry and increased the loss of immigrant lives by shifting entry to the desert  The track record of the four concentrated border enforcement operations in California  Arizona  and Texas since 1993 shows that tougher border controls only enrich smugglers  endanger the lives of migrants  and encourage those who overcome the obstacles to settle permanently in the United States    Recent testimony from the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded that the sharp increases in border security funding over the past decade and the nearly doubling of the number of border patrol agents over that time have not kept sizable numbers of illegal migrants from entering the country illegally  For example  the Border Patrol budget increased from  263 million in 1990 to  1 6 billion today  a six fold increase  Yet  during this period  more than 500 000 undocumented immigrants entered the U S  each year  In all  nearly 9 million have arrived since 1990  During the same time  the probability that an unauthorized border crosser would be apprehended fell from 20 percent to 5 percent  And the United States now spends  1700 per border apprehension  up from  300 in 1992    Nor will fences keep out criminals or terrorists  The 9 11 terrorists didnt come across the Mexican border illegally   they entered the U S  with visas  Fences wont stop immigrant workers from coming here to work  As Governor Janet Napolitano of Arizona  who knows a lot about borders  recently said  You show me a 50 foot wall and I ll show you a 51 foot ladder at the border to get over it    Fences can be outflanked   and not only over land or through underground tunnels  Increased fences prompt smugglers to move migrants in boats to the Pacific and Gulf coasts and transport them by plane to Canada  with its 4100 mile  largely open border  A recent study by the Pew Hispanic Center found that roughly 40 50 percent of the people currently in the United States illegally entered the country legally  More fences would do nothing to address this issue  They would do nothing about immigrants who come here legally  and then overstay their visas    Unnecessary enforcement measures also harm U S  relations with Mexico and other countries  A fortress America mentality alienates other nations  and makes it harder to work with them on other counter terrorism priorities  Already  the muro de muerte  wall of death  is a rallying call for opponents of free trade and other aspects of the US economic agenda in Latin America    As Cardinal Mahoney has pointed out  as the worlds lone superpower and greatest democracy  we possess the resources and ingenuity to solve our immigration problems humanely and without resorting to the construction of barriers and walls   The United States is facing a delicate period in its current relations with Mexico  Felipe Calderon will become President of Mexico on December 1 after a very close election that tested Mexicos political institutions and challenged its democracy  Mr  Calderon has stated that fencing will increase tension and insecurity at the border  and he has called instead for solutions that create jobs and promote development in Mexico   President Bush got it right in May when he declared that an immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive  because all elements of this problem must be addressed together  or none of them will be solved at all  He got it wrong last week when he indicated that the House fence bill is an acceptable interim measure  The House border fence bill would spend a huge amount of taxpayers money to accomplish nothing at all  The Senate has already agreed to appropriate sufficient money for a sufficient fence  Taking up the House proposal now wastes the precious time of the U S  Senate    BACKGROUND ON FENCE  SENATE HAS ALREADY PASSED FENCE PROVISIONS AND HAS APPROPRIATED FUNDING FOR THE FENCE    S  2611  the Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform bill  already authorizes construction of at least 370 miles of fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers along the southwest border of the United States  This authorization is based on Secretary Chertoffs statement that this is necessary as a component of an effective border enforcement system  This year  the Senate has also appropriated funding for the construction of this fence in the 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations bill which is currently in conference    THE FENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM    As the Attorney General has noted Some believe we should be focusing solely on border securityI don t think you can have true security without taking into account the 11 to 12 million who are here already  We need to know who they are     and take them out of the shadows      Similarly  former Secretary Ridge recently wrote that trying to gain operational control of the borders is impossible unless our enhanced enforcement efforts are coupled with a robust Temporary Guest Worker program and a means to entice those now working illegally out of the shadows into some type of legal status      The 370 miles of fencing agreed by the Senate makes sense only in the context of comprehensive immigration reform  Unnecessary fencing does not make sense at all    FENCING IS EXPENSIVE    Fencing is expensive  The cost of constructing a fence similar to the House bill has been estimated at roughly  3    3 2 million per mile for a total of over  2 billion   see CBO cost estimate for S 2611   These estimates may be low as we have seen in the case of the 14 mile San Diego fence  According to the DHS CBP Budget Justification for FY 2007  the total project cost for the 14 mile San Diego fence system is  126 5 million  Annual maintenance costs are not included    FENCING DOES NOT STOP UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRATION    A recent study by the Pew Hispanic Center found that roughly 40 50 percent of the people currently in the United States illegally entered the country legally and overstay their visas  More fences would do nothing to address this issue      Fixed barriers dont stop undocumented immigrants  The track record of the four concentrated border enforcement operations in California  Arizona  and Texas since 1993 shows that tougher border controls only enrich people smugglers  endanger the lives of migrants  and encourage those who overcome the obstacles to settle permanently in the United States  Recent testimony from the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office pointed out that in recent years funding for border security has risen sharply and over the past decade the number of border patrol agents nearly doubled but these measures have not kept sizable numbers of illegal migrants from entering the country illegally      The probability that an unauthorized border crosser will be apprehended has fallen from 20 percent to 5 percent since 1994  And the United States now spends  1700 per border apprehension  up from  300 in 1992  These statistics clearly show that our immigration system broken and enforcement alone will not fix it       There is no evidence that the border enforcement policies of the last decade have had any deterrent effect  Undocumented inflows have increased by a factor of ten since fencing and prevention through deterrence strategy introduced  San Diegos wall has bolstered the smuggling industry and increased the loss of immigrant lives by shifting immigration to the desert  Last year  at least 460 people died crossing the southern border    FENCING AND FOREIGN RELATIONS    The United States is facing a delicate period in its relations with Mexico  Felipe Calderon will take over the Mexican presidency on December 1 after an election that tested Mexicos political institutions and challenged its democracy  The United States will have to work with Calderon in the years to come  Calderon has stated that fencing will increase tension and insecurity at the border and called instead for solutions that create jobs and promoted development in Mexico      Fence and excessive border enforcement have great symbolic importance in Mexico and other countries of origin  It harms US interests to alienate these states in general  and makes it less feasible to collaborate with them on other migration control and counter terrorism priorities  Already  the muro de muerte  wall of death  is rallying call for opponents of free trade and other aspects of the US economic agenda in Latin America      strategies increase the likelihood of violence between border agents and innocent civilians and or undocumented immigrants  Such incidents are very damaging to US relations with countries of origin       Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
