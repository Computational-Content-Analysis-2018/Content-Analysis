Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy Minimum Wage Press Event July 12  2006  President Bushs recent claims about the strength of the US economy reveal how out of touch the Administration is with the lives of working Americans    Yesterday  he crowed that when the economy grows  businesses grow  people earn more money   and  profits are higher   That may be true on Wall Street  but its certainly not the case on Main Street where American families are struggling every day to make ends meet   Only this President and this Republican Congress would think that soaring gas prices  skyrocketing health care and education costs  stagnant wages  and a  300 billion deficit add up to good economic news     Americans are working harder than ever  and our nations productivity is rising  but millions of hard working men and women across the country arent getting their fair share   Were not rewarding work fairly anymore  and working families are falling behind   The Bush economy has been particularly harsh on families working for the very lowest wages   Minimum wage workers do many of the most difficult  and most important  jobs in our society   They care for children in day care centers and for the elderly in nursing homes   They clean office buildings  hotel rooms  and restaurants across the country   But the pay they receive doesnt cover their bills    A minimum wage employee who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  makes just  10 700 a year  almost  6 000 below the poverty line for a family of three    Their lives are becoming more difficult each and every day   In the nine years since Congress last raised the minimum wage  minimum wage workers have steadily fallen farther and farther behind the rest of the country     Im releasing a report today comparing the plight of minimum wage workers with the progress of the rest of the nation and the results are deeply troubling     The hypocrisy of this Republican Congress is especially alarming  In the nine years since the minimum wage was last increased in 1997  Congress has voted itself eight pay raises totaling more than  31 000 a year   Congressional pay has increased by more than 24 percent  but minimum wage workers havent seen another dime in their pockets     But that hasnt stopped Republicans in Congress from voting to raise their own salaries while routinely voting down increases in the minimum wage   Last October  Republicans rejected an amendment to increase the minimum wage by  2 10 on the very same bill where they gave themselves a raise of more than  3000   Now were poised to give ourselves another  3 300 raise this year   Its appalling that Congress would raise its own pay yet again  yet continue to ignore the most vulnerable workers in our society  Democrats dont intend to let that happen again this year  The report also shows who Bush economy has been working for  those at the very top of the economic ladder   Executive pay is up 73 percent  the average CEO makes more before lunch on the first day of the year than a minimum wage worker makes in an entire year   If were serious about putting our economy back on the right track  we must start by guaranteeing that everyone who works hard is getting their fair share    We need to reward work and hardworking men and women by ensuring that a job will lift you out of poverty   My bill  the Fair Minimum Wage Act  will raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps over the next two years   It will directly benefit 6 6 million workers  and indirectly benefit 8 3 million more   It gives a family with one minimum wage earner another  4 400 a year to spend on education  child care  paying the rent  or putting decent food on the table    Such an increase will make a significant difference in the lives of working families across the country   It will give hardworking people real security for their families and their futures     Last month  we had a great victory  for the first time  a majority of United States Senators agreed that a fair increase in the minimum wage is long overdue     I am going to keep offering my amendment again and again until we get this done   Congress plans to raise its own pay again on the Transportation Appropriations bill  I wont miss this chance to hold Republicans accountable for lining their own pockets while ignoring working people   We will never give up this fight until weve raised the minimum wage for all Americans   No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty       Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
