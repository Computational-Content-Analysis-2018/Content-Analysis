         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I welcome the Administration s action today in releasing  1 3 billion in federal funds to help low income families pay their heating bills this winter  These funds are urgently needed and will go to states  tribes  and territories to be administered through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  But they are far from enough    Senator Kerry and I offered an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations last week to provide  3 1 billion in LIHEAP emergency funds  50 Senators supported this proposal  but it was blocked procedurally by the Republican leadership  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have strained already tight oil and natural gas production  As of October 11th  three refineries are still shut down after Hurricane Katrina  and 4 after Hurricane Rita  reducing the nation s energy capacity by 11 percent or 1 9 million barrels a day    As a result  families throughout the nation are likely to face higher heating bills this winter  On average  households heating primarily with natural gas will pay about  350  48 percent  more this winter for heat  and those relying primarily on oil will pay about  378  32 percent  more  Forecasts of a cold winter and high fuel costs mean that the elderly  the disabled  and many others will be forced to make painful choices between heating their homes and paying for food  health care  and rent    unless we act now     In response to Hurricane Katrina  the President initially released  27 25 million in emergency LIHEAP funds to the states hardest hit by the disaster  LIHEAP is a highly successful federal program that prevents the poorest of the poor from being forced to make impossible tradeoffs    The number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance has increased from over 4 million in 2002 to 5 million this year  the highest level in ten years     The additional funds announced today will provide Massachusetts with almost  39 million in emergency funds  However  in order to prevent an energy crisis  the President must also increase emergency funds for FY06  Current funding does not go far enough  Only 18 percent of the eligible population receives funds  which will run out before the winter ends  In Massachusetts  the participation rate is 22 percent  which is still unacceptably low  Applications for fuel assistance have been increasing  8 000 of the 12 000 fuel assistance applications sent out in Massachusetts have already been returnedthat s 1 500 more than this time last year     The Administration and the House of Representatives have largely closed their eyes to the needs of the poor  The House sent the Senate a Continuing Resolution which froze funding for the LIHEAP program  The current funding obviously isn t enough  19 percent of current LIHEAP recipients say they keep their home at a temperature they feel is unsafe or unhealthy  8 percent of recipients report that their electricity or gas was shut off in the past year for nonpayment  The Continuing Resolution also made a cut of 50 percent in the Community Services Block Grant which is used by many community action agencies to administer LIHEAP     Earlier this week  President Bush s energy secretary was asked about LIHEAP funding  He replied  At least at this point in time  that s not on the agenda    The needs of the poor deserve to be on the Administration s agenda  We need to stand up for the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet  We have to tell the elderly  the disabled  and many others that we hear them  and that we won t leave them shivering in the cold this winter  Until every senior citizen has a warm place to come home to every day  and every child has a warm bed to sleep in every night  our job is not done   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
