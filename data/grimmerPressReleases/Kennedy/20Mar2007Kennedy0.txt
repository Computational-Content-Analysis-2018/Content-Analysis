         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C   Today  The Institute for College Access and Success  TICAS   released a new report urging Congress to make the application process for  federal student aid simpler by permitting the U S  Department of Education to  receive tax related information on the Free Application for Federal Student  Assistance  FAFSA  directly from the Internal Revenue Service  According to  TICAS  this step would allow the Department of Education to eliminate  approximately two thirds of the income related questions on the FAFSA form   making the financial aid application process much easier for students and  families  Senator Edward M  Kennedy issued the following  statement I applaud the Institute for College Access and Success for  its timely contribution on ways to simplify the FAFSA  Its obvious that the  form is too complicated  and Im very concerned that its creating needless  barriers that prevent students from receiving the college aid to which theyre  entitled  Today  1 5 million lower income students who are likely eligible for  Pell Grants are not receiving them because these students dont apply for  federal student aid  Its clear that the difficulty of filling out the FAFSA is  a major cause As Congress moves forward with reauthorization of the  Higher Education Act this year  well be considering a number of proposals to  make the federal financial aid application process easier for students and  families  Im very confident that we can work in a bipartisan manner to achieve  that goal   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
