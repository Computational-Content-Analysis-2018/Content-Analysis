         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  DC  In a letter spearheaded by U S  Senator Bob Casey  D PA   Senators Robert Byrd  D WV   Ted Kennedy  D MA   Carl Levin  D MI   Hillary Clinton  D NY  and Jim Webb  D VA  today joined Casey in warning President Bush against rushing the United States into long term security commitments to Iraq without the full participation and consent of Congress  The letter follows a preliminary agreement reached last week between the U S  and Iraqi governments on long term bilateral cooperation on political  security and economic matters  with a final agreement to be concluded by next summer     Senator Casey said  We cannot allow the President to artificially lock in his successor when it comes to U S  policy on Iraq  including such sensitive matters as future U S  troop levels and the potential establishment of permanent U S  military bases there  The President may be in legacy building mode  but any such commitment of future American credibility must involve the Congress as a full partner      If this Administration wishes to make binding commitments to the government of Iraq    commitments that will define the future of the relationship between our two countries  regarding permanent bases and security guarantees    it must do so with the full advice and consent of the United States Congress  in accordance with our Constitutional mandate  said Senator Byrd      Senator Kennedy said  The President ought to read the Constitution  He apparently thinks he can negotiate an agreement with the Iraqi Government  without the advice and consent of the Senate  that would commit our troops if it is attacked  As the Constitution makes clear  the president has no authority to make such a unilateral commitment  and he should not attempt to do so      The Presidents unilateral approach to our Nations foreign policy needs to end  Levin said  A commitment of the United   States to defend another country requires the advice and consent of the U S  Senate      The Bush Administration must not circumvent Congress on the critical issue of the future U S  presence in Iraq  The Administration must not be permitted to enter into agreements that could lead to permanent bases in Iraq which would damage U S  interests in Iraq and the broader region without Congressional approval  said Senator Clinton      For more than six years  the administration has failed to be open and honest with the American public about its long term intentions in Iraq  Just last week  the White House announced a pact with the Iraqi government that paves the way for permanent bases in the country without congressional consultation  said Senator Webb  It is the constitutional responsibility of our Senate body to ensure that such a far reaching strategic commitment as long term bases in Iraq be entered into only after full debate  consideration and congressional consent     Administration officials have acknowledged that this agreement may address future U S  troop levels and long term military bases in Iraq  as well as U S  security assurances to protect the government of Iraq against foreign aggression     Full text of the letter is included     Dear Mr  President     We write you today regarding the Declaration of Principles agreed upon last week between the United States and Iraq outlining the broad scope of discussions to be held over the next six months to institutionalize long term U S  Iraqi cooperation in the political  economic  and security realms  It is our understanding that these discussions seek to produce a strategic framework agreement  no later than July 31  2008  to help define a long term relationship of cooperation and friendship as two fully sovereign and independent states with common interests      The future of American policy towards Iraq  especially in regard to the issues of U S  troop levels  permanent U S  military bases  and future security commitments  has generated strong debate among the American people and their elected representatives  Agreements between our two countries relating to these issues must involve the full participation and consent of the Congress as a co equal branch of the U S  government  Furthermore  the future U S  presence in Iraq is a central issue in the current Presidential campaign  We believe a security commitment that obligates the United  States to go to war on behalf of the Government of Iraq at this time is not in Americas long term national security interest and does not reflect the will of the American people  Commitments made during the final year of your Presidency should not unduly or artificially constrain your successor when it comes to Iraq     In particular  we want to convey our strong concern regarding any commitments made by the United States with respect to American security assurances to Iraq to help deter and defend against foreign aggression or other violations of Iraqs territorial integrity  Security assurances  once made  cannot be easily rolled back without incurring a great cost to Americas strategic credibility and imperiling the stability of our nations other alliances around the world  Accordingly  security assurances must be extended with great care and only in the context of broad bipartisan agreement that such assurances serve our abiding national interest  Such assurances  if legally binding  are generally made in the context of a formal treaty subject to the advice and consent of the U S  Senate but in any case cannot be made without Congressional authorization     Our unease is heightened by remarks made on November 26th by General Douglas Lute  the Assistant to the President for Iraq and Afghanistan  that Congressional input is not foreseen  General Lute was quoted as asserting at a White House press briefing  We don t anticipate now that these negotiations will lead to the status of a formal treaty which would then bring us to formal negotiations or formal inputs from the Congress  It is unacceptable for your Administration to unilaterally fashion a long term relationship with Iraq without the full and comprehensive participation of Congress from the very start of such negotiations      We look forward to learning more details as the Administration commences negotiations with the Iraqi government on the contours of long term political  economic  and security ties between our two nations  We trust you agree that the proposed extension of long term U S  security commitments to a nation in a critical region of the world requires the full participation and consent of the Congress as a co equal branch of our government     Sincerely      Robert P  Casey  Jr   U S  Senator  Robert Byrd  U S  Senator  Ted Kennedy  U S  Senator  Carl Levin  U S  Senator  Hillary Clinton  U S  Senator  and Jim Webb  U S  Senator            Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
