         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    A decade  ago  I stood here and asked the Senate to vote to raise the minimum wage   At  that moment  I had no idea it would take us so long to do so again   Ten long  years have now passed with no increase   Countless minimum wage workers have  been working hard all that time  performing some of the most difficult and  important jobs in our society  They work 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  year  in and year out   Yet  they have had no raise in pay all that time  not a single  additional penny in their paychecks   Never in the long history of the minimum  wage has Congress been so hard hearted toward these hard working men and women     Yesterday  we heard from the President that the economy is thriving    He said that growth is increasing  that investors are optimistic  consumers  are spending  inflation is low   It is no surprise that the forum he  chose for those words was Federal Hall  on Wall Street   The view from there of  the economy looks encouraging  But if you look at the economy from another  perspective  if you stand in the shoes of the middle class and the lowest paid  employees in our society  you see an entirely different picture  We have an  economy that works for Wall Street  but not for Main Street    Prices  for everyday needs  from gasoline to healthcare to milk  are rising  dramatically   Americans are saving less than ever  and falling deeper and  deeper into debt   The gap between the haves and the have nots is greater than  at any time since the Depression   In fact  we are experiencing a time  not unlike the days immediately before we passed the first minimum wage back in  1938   As our nation emerged from the Depression  the recovery was not trickling  down the economic ladder  Those at the top thought the hard times were over   while those on the bottom rungs were still struggling to get by  When  President Roosevelt signed the first minimum wage law  he said  the  overwhelming majority of this Nation has little patience with that small  minority which  says  today that prosperity has returned  that wages are good        and that government should take a holiday    Weve seen that same  hostility far too often in this Administration   Many of our colleagues are all  too ready to ignore the plight of working families  sit back  do nothing  and  declare that happy days are here again    Fortunately  an overwhelming  majority of our people have no patience with that attitude   Americans see their  loved ones  friends and neighbors struggling to survive on poverty wages  and  theyve raised their voices to demand change   The minimum wage has been  stuck at  5 15 an hour for a decade   A minimum wage worker who works 40 hours a  week  52 weeks a year still makes just  10 700 a year more than  6 000 below  the poverty line for a family of three   Americans understand fairness   and they know that this is unfair   After years of delay and inexcusable  inaction by Congress  the American people finally declared enough is enough    They took the battle into their own hands  and launched a grassroots movement  that spread across the nation like wildfire   They pounded their pavements    They prayed in their pews   And they went to the ballot box and held their  elected officials accountable for failing to raise the minimum wage     We are here today because of their efforts  Todays vote will not be a  victory for a bill  it will be a victory for the American people    The  minimum wage is one of the great achievements of our democracy   Its a clear  reflection of our values  and a solid cornerstone of the American dream   Its  about the kind of country we want to be    Americans want a country  where everyone has an opportunity to succeed   Where anyone who works hard and  plays by the rules can build a better life for their children   Where there is  no permanent underclass  and everyone has hope for a brighter future     When President Kennedy was debating the minimum wage during his years  in the Senate  he said the test of our belief in human dignity is the manner in  which we treat those at the bottom of the economic ladder   Martin Luther King  said  Dignity demands a job  and a paycheck that lasts through the  week  If we pass this bill  we will add dignity to the lives of  millions of working families   13 million Americans will see more in their  paychecks for the first time in a decade   They will have more dollars to spend  on the essentials of life  and more hours to spend with their families   Six  million children will have better food  better health  and better opportunities  for the future    After 10 years of stalling and 9 days of  debate  the time has finally come to vote on an increase in the minimum wage  We  will finally have the opportunity to take one step closer to the kind of country  we want to be  where no one who works for a living has to live in poverty    I hope that each and every one of my colleagues  will heed their conscience  do the right thing  and join in voting now at long  last to raise the minimum wage           Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
