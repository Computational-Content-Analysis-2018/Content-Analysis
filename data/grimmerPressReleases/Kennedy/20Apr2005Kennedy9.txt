         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today it was made known that the Durbin Kennedy Levin Byrd amendment would be accepted into the final package of the Iraq supplemental bill  The amendment holds the President accountable for making sure that the American people  and our soldiers    know the impact of training Iraqis and our ability to hand complete responsibility for security over to Iraqis     Senator Kennedy issued the following statement following the acceptance of the amendment      It s gratifying that our amendment was accepted  The Administration owes it to our troops and the American people to be more candid about real progress in training Iraqi security forces and its plans for our future military presence in Iraq  Under our amendment  the Administration must provide a new report every three months to Congress with details about our progress in such training  and an estimate of the number of our troops who will still be needed in Iraq at the end of the next 6  12  and 18 months    Specifically  the amendment requires a report within 60 days  and every 90 days thereafter  assessing the extent to which funding appropriated by this Act will be used to train and equip capable and effectively led Iraqi security services and promote stability and security in Iraq  It contains a number of specific criteria measuring progress in training and equipping military and police forces and estimating projected Iraqi training progress and needed American force levels in 2005 and 2006    In a March 14  2005 report on Rebuilding Iraq  the GAO found that U S  government agencies do not report reliable data on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped  The report also states that without reliable reporting data  a more capable Iraqi force  and stronger Iraqi leadership  the Department of Defense faces difficulties in implementing its strategy to draw down U S  forces from Iraq    Below are facts on the impact of the war    IRAQ WAR STRAIN ON THE MILITARY   WAR BREAKING THE MILITARY The war in Iraq is putting a very high demand on the military  Soldiers are being forced to overstay their initial deployments to Iraq and many are coming home  only to be sent right back  The reserves  which comprises 40 percent of the troops in Iraq  is rapidly running out of available soldiers who can be deployed     On December 20  2004  in a memo to General Schoomaker  General James Helmly  the head of the Army Reserves  warned that  1  The Army Reserve is rapidly degenerating into a  broken  force 2  It is in grave danger of being unable to meet other operational requirements     The Department of Defense has had to utilize its stop loss policy  which prevents servicemembers from leaving the military even though they have fulfilled their service commitment     32 percent  almost 304 000  of the US military have served two or more tours of duty in Iraq or Afghanistan    WAR UNDERMINING RECRUITMENT  RETENTION   The war in Iraq has undermined the Pentagon s ability to attract new recruits and retain service members already serving       The active duty Army fell short of its recruiting goal by 32 percent  2 150 soldiers  in March and by 27 percent in February  On April 1  Douglas Smith  spokesman for the U S  Army Recruiting Command at Fort Knox  KY  bluntly stated that  It is becoming more and more apparent that the ongoing war on terrorism is having an effect on our ability to recruit     The Army reserves are being hit even worse  It missed its recruiting goal by almost half in March  falling short by 46 percent  739 soldiers  and missed its goal by 25 percent  330 soldiers  in February  Francis Harvey  Secretary of the Army  expressed concern about this real problem  On March 23rd  he said  Are we concerned  Absolutely  I m very concerned and I give it a lot of thought     The Army National Guard fell short of their recruitment goal by almost 6 800 soldiers in 2004  In the first quarter of 2005 alone  they missed their goal by nearly that amount  falling almost 6 500 soldiers short  In order to recruit and retain more soldiers the National Guard increased retention bonuses from  5 000 to  15 000 and first time signing bonuses from  6 000 to  10 000  General H  Steven Blum  Chief of the Army National Guard  said  Otherwise  the Guard will be broken and not ready the next time it s needed  either here at home or for war     In March  the Pentagon announced that it was raising the maximum age for Army National Guard recruits from 34 to 39  as well as offering generous new health benefits for Guard and reserve members activated after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks     Every month this year  the Marines missed their recruiting goal   Jan84 short  Feb191 short  Mar56 short  The last time they missed one month s goal was July 1995    CASUALTIES MOUNT  THE VIOLENCE CONTINUES   The violence persists     On March 17th  in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee  Vice Admiral Lowell E  Jacoby  Director of the Defense Intelligence agency stated  The insurgency in Iraq has grown in size and complexity over the past year  Attacks numbered approximately 25 per day one year ago  Today  the average number of attacks is around 40 per day     Since the outset of the war in Iraq  we have lost more than 1 500 servicemen and women     More than 11 500 servicemen and women have been wounded in Iraq  That is more than the equivalent of a full Army division  and we only have 10 Active divisions in the Army     For the past two years  the U S  has lost military personnel at the rate of 2 people per day in Iraq     Since the election  we have lost more than 1 soldier a day     COST   The war in Iraq is placing a huge financial burden on the taxpayers as well     If the FY05 emergency supplemental funds are provided  the Pentagon will have spent at least  192 billion on the war in Iraq    IRAQI SECURITY FORCES   The Administration has never really given us a straight answer about how many Iraqi security forces are really trained and equipped  Its numbers continue to change  Our men and women in uniform    and the American people   deserve a straight answer  We need accountability    According to a GAO report released in March  U S  government agencies do not report reliable data on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped  It goes on to say  The departments of State and Defense no longer report on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are equipped with their required weapons  vehicles  communications  equipment  and body armor    On February 4  2004  Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said  We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces  now more than 200 000 strong     Then  a year later  On January 19  2005  Secretary Condoleezza Rice said that We think the number right now is somewhere over 120 000     On February 3  2005  in response to questions from Senator Levin at a Senate Armed Services Hearing  General Richard Myers  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  conceded that only 40 000 Iraqi security forces are really capable  He said  48 deployable  Battalions  around the country  equals about 40 000  which is the number that can go anywhere and do anything     We need a real accounting of how much progress is being made to train and equip effective and capable Iraqi Security forces    Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld  Senate Armed Services Committee  February 4  2004 We re increasing international military participation in Iraq  We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces  now more than 200 000 strong  Our forces are hunting down those who threaten Iraq s stability and transitions to self reliance  Another way to deal with the increased demand on the force is to add more people    Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  Confirmation Hearing  Senate Foreign Relations Committee  January 19  2005   We think the number right now is somewhere over 120 000     General Richard Myers  Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff  Senate Armed Services Committee  February 3  2005   There are 48 deployable  Battalions  around the country  equals about 40 000  which is the number that can go anywhere and do anything    ADMINISTRATION STATEMENTS ON IRAQ   On May 25  2004  President Bush said  At my direction and with the support of Iraqi authorities  we are accelerating our program to help train Iraqis to defend their country     On February 3  2005  Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz said  some of our commanders  believe that over the course of the next six months you will see whole areas of Iraq successfully handed over to the Iraqi army and Iraqi police    On February 17  2005  Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said  I can assure you that we have no intention  at the present time  of putting permanent bases in Iraq    On March 1  2005  General Abizaid  Commander of the U S  Central Command  said  I believe that in 2005  the most important statement that we should be able to make is that in the majority of the country  Iraqi security forces will take the lead in fighting the counterinsurgency  That s our goalThey will get better  And it think in 2005 they ll take on the majority of the tasks necessary to be done    On March 27  2005 General George W  Casey  Commanding General of the Multi National Force in Iraq  said  By this time next yearAssuming that the political process continues to go positivelyand the Iraqi army continues to progress and develop as we think it will  we should be able to take some fairly substantial reductions in the size of our forces   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
