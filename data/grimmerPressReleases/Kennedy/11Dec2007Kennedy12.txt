         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Thank you  Richard Trumka  for that introduction  and thank you for inviting me to take part in this historic meeting  I can think of no greater cause than the fight for dignity and respect for workers and their families  Its a cause that my brothers and the entire Kennedy family have made our first priority and Im proud to be your Chairman in the Labor Committee of the United States Senate      It is an honor to be here with so many leaders who have dedicated their lives to serving workers  often at great personal risk  This International Human Rights Day is about you and the hundreds of millions of workers that you fight for each and every day     This era of globalization must be judged not just by growing profits and rising GDP  but by how we treat the workers who make that progress possible  The ones who build the roads and skyscrapers  The ones who work in our schools and hospitals  The ones who toil in the factories that are at the heart of todays global economy  In fact  we know that true progress and prosperity for our nations comes only when our workers share in economic growth       Labor rights are human rights  and labor unions are at the heart of human progress  That was true yesterday  It is true today  And it will be true tomorrow      As President Kennedy said  Those who would destroy or further limit the rights of organized labor  those who cripple collective bargaining or prevent organization of the unorganized  do a disservice to the cause of democracy  Those words have been true throughout American history  When our unions are strong  our economy is strong  When workers are treated fairly  our democracy is stronger for it      We know this from our history  In the post war era  all Americans shared in the benefits of the nations rapid growth  and the rising tide truly did lift all boats  From the 1940s to the 1960s  union membership reached its peak  During that same time  wages and productivity rose together  Workers shared in corporate gains  and our entire society benefited as a result      Nearly half a century later  the tide now rises for only the few  With historic declines in union membership  most Americans find their boats sinking fast      We are seeing that declining union membership means rising inequality  Today  the richest one percent of Americans earns the highest share of national income in almost a century  More than 40  of the countrys total income goes to the wealthiest 10  of Americans       Middle class families  by contrast  are falling behind  America has the most productive economy in the world  yet its workers wages remain almost stagnant  Today  for the first time  young men are earning less than their fathers  and only 23  of American parents think their children will be better off than they are      Without unions  for far too many workers today  economic security is just a dream  Today only 1 in 5 workers earns a guaranteed pension  47 million Americans lack health insurance  even though 85  of them are in working families       We all know that this is what happens to a society when union membership declines  And we all know why union membership has fallen to historic lows  even though 60 million American workers say they want representation at work  Workers rights are under attack      Last year  more than 30 000 American workers were illegally discriminated against for exercising their rights in the workplace  Every 18 minutes a worker was fired or illegally punished for supporting a union  Let me repeat thatevery 18 minutes in the United States of America  a decent  hard working woman like Kelly Beringer  who is here with us today  is punished for standing up for her human rights      Unfortunately  there are unscrupulous employers around the world who are pleased by these trends  They are employing union breaking tactics and forcing rising inequality not just in America  but in Europe and Asia and South America  They are working to convince other nations to follow our lead by weakening their own labor laws and put profits ahead of the well being of their own people     Today  our mission is clear  We love our countries and were going to take them back  Well fight and fight and fight for workers not only for their well being but for the well being of the lands we love     Here in America  weve begun that campaign  Unions are leading the way to reform our labor laws  Were battling to enact the Employee Free Choice Act so that whenever a majority of workers want a union  they can form one without fear of retribution  delay  or harassment     So we assure you here today that America will do its part  The tide is turning and theres a new scent of optimism in the air  Together  we can lock arms and make history  for the workers of today and tomorrow and the generations to come     The future is in our hands and we will shape destiny     Thank you for all you do so well  and it is a deep honor to join you today                 As our first panel comes to a close  Id like to thank all of our panelists for their impressive leadership on justice and human rights      I also commend the members of the Senate and House Labor Committees for their thoughtful questions and their strong commitment to workers rights      Next  we will hear from Larry Cohen  the President of the Communications Workers of America  who is also President of the Union Network International Telecom Sector  Larry is well known for his strategic vision and effective advocacy for organizing in the United States and many other countries           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
