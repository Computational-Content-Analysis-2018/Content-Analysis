         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE          Millions of Americans rely on the drugs that the FDA reviews to protect them from sickness   But now  the FDA itself urgently needs treatment          For too long  the agency has been without a confirmed leader   Science has too often had to take a back seat at the very agency which should be setting the standard for objectivity and integrity   There is also growing evidence that the dedicated professionals at the FDA have been pressured to trim their scientific views to the prevailing political winds  These are symptoms of a serious illness  and we should act without delay to provide the cure   The Institute of Medicine has done a valuable service for the nation by diagnosing the problem  and providing a prescription for treatment   Its up to us to see that the patient takes the right medicine  and hopefully has a quick recovery  The stakes are high   The FDA oversees products accounting for a quarter of the US economy   Every day  it makes decisions that mean the difference between life and death for American patients  It is an honor to welcome  Sheila Burke  who served the Senate with such distinction on the staff of our former colleague Bob Dole   Sheila is now Deputy Secretary of the Smithsonian  but she found the time to chair the panel at the IOM that made these important recommendations on drug safety    As the IOM report makes clear  FDA has many needs that Congress must address   Its budget is  1 8 billion a year   That may sound like a lot  but it works out to about  6 a year for every American   In Washington  DC  you can barely buy a sandwich for  6  yet for that amount  we expect the FDA to assure the safety of the food we eat  the drugs we take  and the medical devices that save so many lives   Clearly  we need to increase FDAs budget  so that it can do a better job of guaranteeing drug safety   But money alone wont meet all the challenges   Additional authority is needed as well  The Institute of Medicines report recommends that FDA have the power to require post marketing risk assessment and risk management programs for new drugs  and to require the industry to make the results of drugs safety studies available to the public   The Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act  which Chairman Enzi and I introduced earlier this year  addresses these needs   Like the Institute of Medicine report  our bill emphasizes the need for a life cycle approach to drug regulation  both before and after approval   The bill would require every drug approved by the FDA to have an enforceable Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy  tailored to fit the risk profile of each new drug   Where appropriate  the strategy could include special requirements for labeling  post market clinical studies  and limitations on marketing the drug directly to consumers   For drugs with the most dangerous side effects  the strategy might require that only doctors with specialized training be allowed to prescribe the drug  If a manufacturer fails to implement a precaution that it has agreed to  the FDA will have new authority to assess civil monetary penalties to enforce compliance   By providing a legally enforceable yet flexible way for the FDA to oversee safety throughout the life cycle of a drug  the bill gives the agency the authority it now lacks to take effective action to ensure safety  The legislation also creates a public private partnership to improve the science of drug safety and drug development   It will help patients and physicians make more informed decisions by requiring the results of drug trials to be included in a public database   Our bill also takes stronger steps to avoid financial conflicts of interest by members of FDA advisory committees  Again  Mr  Chairman  I commend you for calling this hearing  I look forward to working with you and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give the FDA the authority it needs to restore public trust in the safety of prescription drugs   I welcome our witnesses and look forward to their testimony  S  3807  the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act of 2006 S  3807  the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act of 2006  was introduced by Senator Mike Enzi and Senator Ted Kennedy on August 3   The bill contains four titles  drug safety  establishment of the Reagan Udall Institute for Applied Biomedical Research  clinical trials registry and results databases  and reform of conflicts of interests on FDA advisory committees  S  3807 reflects the comments and input of dozens of stakeholders  including the Food and Drug Administration  patient and consumer groups  industry associations  individual companies  and scientific experts   Its provisions are outlined below  Drug Safety It is not possible to know everything about a drug at the time of approval   Requiring sponsors to obtain all safety information before allowing the drug on the market would unduly delay patient access to new therapies   The bill creates a framework for better pre approval planning of how sponsors and FDA will identify  assess and manage risks post approval   The result will be both a more efficient and effective way to obtain safety information  without compromising access  FDA has post approval authorities now  but they are not always the ideal tools to do what is needed   For example  if the agency believes a labeling change is necessary  it can request that the product sponsor make the change   If the product sponsor does not agree to the change  the agency cannot order the labeling change   FDA may initiate a misbranding action in the courts  but a sponsor who disagrees about a labeling change will contest the litigation  which can take months or even years to resolve   Moreover  such enforcement actions   seizing the product  or enjoining its distribution once FDA proves misbranding in court   may have the negative consequence of removing the drug from patients hands   In most cases  the agency and the sponsor will reach agreement about how to address a safety concern  However  there is currently no clear way to reach a decision and move forward to action when there is disagreement    By creating a structured framework for resolving safety concerns  the bill solves this problem  The framework  Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy  REMS  Under the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act  FDA would begin to approve drugs and biologics  and new indications for these products with risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  REMS   The REMS is designed to be an integrated  flexible mechanism to acquire and adapt to new safety information about a drug   Sponsors would propose a REMS and FDA would approve it after structured discussions  The sponsor and FDA will assess and review the REMS at least annually for the first three years  as well as in applications for a new indication  when the sponsor suggests changes  or when FDA requests a review based on new safety information  Minimal Elements of a REMS  Every REMS would have the following elements          The drugs FDA approved professional labeling          15 day  quarterly  and annual reports of adverse events for the drug          A pharmacovigilance statement that explains and justifies whether standard adverse event reporting for the drug is adequate to assess known serious risks and to identify unexpected serious risks  or whether and what additional studies or clinical trials are needed          A timetable for periodic assessment of the REMS  Additional Elements  Based on the nature and magnitude of the safety issues with a particular drug  the drugs REMS may include one or more of the following elements  if specific criteria are met          Required distribution of a Medication Guide or patient package insert when the drug is dispensed          A communication plan to health care providers regarding elements of the REMS          Post approval registries or epidemiological studies to assess signals of serious risks or to screen for serious risks in expanded patient populations  or  when necessary  clinical trials to assess signals of serious risks          Pre clearance of advertising  specific disclosures in advertising  or a prohibition on DTC advertisements for no more than 2 years after approval when disclosures alone arent adequate to protect public health          Restrictions on distribution and use for a drug that presents a serious risk to the public health but offers significant benefit to patients  Currently  only about 30 drugs are approved with restrictions on distribution and use  what is known as a RiskMAP   and such restrictions are intended to remain an infrequent requirement under S      Timeframes  Assessment  FDA review  and discussion of a drugs REMS would take place within set timeframes          In the context of an application or supplement  FDA must begin to discuss the proposed REMS with the sponsor at least 60 days before the drug user fee action deadline to ensure time for thorough review of the REMS and to minimize the chance that dispute resolution  if invoked  would delay regulatory action          If there is new safety information about a serious risk  FDA may order the sponsor to submit an assessment of a REMS and must begin discussions within a set time period          A sponsor may submit an assessment of  and propose modifications  which may include reductions  to  a drugs REMS at any time  Dispute Resolution  When there is disagreement between FDA and the sponsor about a drugs REMS  the drugs sponsor may initiate a structured dispute resolution process   This process will bring fairness  timeliness  and finality to the response to new safety information          The process begins by the sponsor proposing a REMS or assessing whether changes to an existing REMS are needed  and can be terminated by FDA and the sponsor reaching agreement at any point before the issuance of an order          After discussions begin between FDA and the sponsor regarding the proposed REMS  the sponsor may request review by the Drug Safety Oversight Board from day 15 until day 35          Both the sponsors proposed REMS and FDAs alternative go to the next monthly meeting of the Drug Safety Oversight Board for review  or a specially scheduled meeting can be called if the dispute needs quicker resolution          The Drug Safety Oversight Board reviews both proposals and makes recommendations to the Secretary within 5 days          The FDA issues a final order within 7 days of receiving the recommendations          From the time FDA sponsor discussions begin  the dispute resolution process takes from 36 days to 89 days  depending on circumstances  Compliance and enforcement  A REMS requirement that is not working can  and should  be modified through the assessment process   Should a sponsor still fail to comply with a REMS requirement  however  FDA can enforce the requirement as follows          Non compliance with an element of a REMS would be a prohibited act          Civil money penalties could be imposed for knowing violation of any REMS component  Application to generic drugs  A generic drug would be required to meet each element of a REMS except post approval clinical trial requirements that were imposed on the drug before it lost patent protection  Resources  Drug user fees will be increased to review REMS proposals and assessments and for FDAs general drug safety surveillance  Reagan Udall Institute for Applied Biomedical Research Title II of the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act would spur innovation by establishing a new public private partnership at the FDA to advance the Critical Path Initiative and improve the sciences of developing  manufacturing  and evaluating the safety and effectiveness of drugs  devices  biologics and diagnostics   The development of tools to evaluate medical products has not kept pace with discoveries in basic science   New tools are needed to better predict safety and efficacy  which in turn would increase the speed and efficiency of product development and evaluation  Creation of a new generation of performance standards and predictive tools will provide faster and more certain answers about the safety and effectiveness of products in development   This has enormous potential both to speed product development and increase safety  This public private partnership  known as the Reagan Udall Institute for Applied Biomedical Research  will facilitate these improvements in drug  biologic  device  and diagnostic sciences by coordinating research activities between government regulators and academic and industry researchers   Activities of the Institute           The Institute would identify and pursue research priorities to aid in the modernization of medical product development and enhancement of product safety so that research findings are quickly incorporated into regulatory regimes          The Institute would coordinate and participate in government research and development programs and award grants and establish collaborations to carry out research priorities          The Institute would broadly distribute the knowledge and intellectual property developed through this research to ensure that the fruits of the research are incorporated into the medical product development and evaluation processes          The Institute would sponsor scientific conferences or symposia to assist in the evaluation of new tools to assess the safety of therapeutic products  Governance Structure of the Institute  The Institute would be supported by Federal funds  which could be complemented by contributions from the pharmaceutical and device industries as well as from philanthropic organizations          The Institute would have a Board of Directors comprised of  o        Government officials  o        Pharmaceutical and device industry researchers  o        Academic researchers  and o        Patient and provider representatives          The Board of Directors would  o        establish by laws to carry out Institute activities  o        award contracts and peer reviewed grants  o        select an Executive Director to oversee the day to day operations of the Institute  and o        report to Congress annually on the support and operations of the Institute  Clinical Trials Registry and Clinical Trials Results Database Clinical trials are an essential part of drug development   However  issues such as patient recruitment and timely access to information add complexity and cost to trials   The current NIH database  ClinicalTrials gov  is a listing of trials for serious and life threatening conditions  so that patients can learn more about these trials and find out how to participate   However  not all clinical trials are required to register  and information about trial results important to providers and patients  particularly negative results  may or may not be released by sponsors   A central clearinghouse for information about clinical trials and their results would help patients  providers and researchers learn new information and make more informed health care decisions   Clinical Trials Registry  Title III of the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act would establish a publicly available database at NIH to enhance patient enrollment in clinical trials of drugs for any disease or condition and provide a mechanism to track subsequent progress of trials   This database would build on ClinicalTrials gov  which would remain publicly accessible          Late Phase II  Phase III  and Phase IV clinical trials would be required to register           Information about the trial would be searchable by key data elements  and the entry would include the data set developed by the World Health Organization and accepted as the international standard   Information must be truthful  not misleading  and non promotional           The information would be submitted within 14 days of the date the first patient enrolls in the trial  Clinical Trials Results Database  Title III would also establish a database to ensure that results of trials are made public  and that patients and providers have the most up to date information          Results of all Phase III and Phase IV clinical trials would be required to be submitted to the database   There would be a process instituted to determine whether and how to require submission of the results of late Phase II trials  since these results may contain commercially sensitive information           Basic pieces of information would be placed in searchable fields in the database  while the bulk of the results information would be in two summary documents  lay and technical    Both summary documents would be publicly available   There is not yet an agreed upon set of international standards in this area  so S   specifies the data elements that must be submitted          Results would be submitted to the database one year after the trial concludes   If regulatory action or publication is pending  the results would not be publicly available until that is resolved  which would protect both commercially valuable trial results and the ability of researchers to publish their results           The submitted results must be truthful  not misleading  and non promotional  Compliance          There are a variety of tools to enforce compliance with the registry and results database requirements  o        Submission to the registry database would be a requirement for an investigational new drug exemption  o        Unless information for a trial of a drug is submitted to the both the registry and results databases  FDA would not be permitted to file an application for approval of the drug  and the application could not be reviewed  o        If a clinical trial is funded from NIH or another Federal agency  but the trial is not registered or the results are not submitted  the grant money would not be released  o        FDA and the Inspector General Office at the Department of Health and Human Services would review the content of submissions to the results database  o        Medical journals would be able to query the database to determine whether or not results had been submitted  since many journals require submission of results to a database for publication  and o        Failure to submit required information  or the submission of false  misleading or promotional information would be a prohibited act under the Federal Food  Drug  and Cosmetic Act  Effect on other laws          State clinical trial databases would be preempted  and the fact of compliance with data submission requirements could not be used as evidence of off label promotion of the drug  Conflicts of Interest and FDA Advisory Committees Title IV of the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act would make improvements to FDAs process for screening advisory committee members for financial conflicts of interest   FDA relies upon its 30 advisory committees to provide independent expert advice  lend credibility to the product review process  and inform consumers of trends in product development   Advisory Committee recommendations are non binding on the agency  but the recommendations are usually followed   Recently  questions have been raised about conflicts of interest that panel members on FDA Advisory Committees may have because of industry funding or other financial interests   When a potential conflict is identified  FDA considers whether the persons expertise is essential and whether the need for that persons service outweighs the risks of the potential for a conflict   Based on that evaluation  FDA has the statutory authority to grant a waiver and allow that person to serve   Current FDA guidance on how to implement that authority contains inconsistent requirements that make it difficult to predict whether an individual under consideration will emerge as eligible for service  eligible only with a waiver  or recused   While the potential for a conflict should not automatically disqualify someone  a lack of transparency and predictability in how potential conflicts will be reviewed endangers the integrity of the review process   Finally  FDA faces a key challenge in identifying a sufficient number of people with the necessary expertise and a minimum of potential conflicts of interest to serve on advisory committees   Evaluation of candidates for appointment          New candidates for appointment to advisory panels would be screened by FDA with the goals of identifying qualified candidates and minimizing potential conflicts of interest          FDA would be directed to enhance public nomination of individuals for service on advisory committees in order to expand the pool of qualified candidates   Evaluation of panel members for service at a meeting          The categories of financial involvements used to evaluate a panel member for service at a panel meeting would be streamlined and clarified          FDA would be directed to define how interests imputed to an individual  such as financial interests of an employer  bear on eligibility for service on an advisory committee          FDA would be directed to standardize how individuals are evaluated for service on advisory committees across the centers of the agency  Disclosure of information          The identity of panel members recused from service or who receive a waiver for service at an advisory committee meeting would be disclosed prior to a meeting          All financial involvements of panel members at a meeting would be required to be read into the public record of advisory committee meetings  Review of past panel members          The HHS Inspector General would be directed to periodically evaluate current financial involvements of past advisory committee members to assess whether individuals are being rewarded for their past votes as members of an advisory committee    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
