         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washington  DC  Today  Senator Kennedy and Senator Leahy introduced a resolution rejecting the Administration s assertion that the Authorization for Use of Military Force authorized warantless eavesdropping on Americans  The White House repeatedly tried to justify its program with various legal theories  when in fact the Joint Resolution enacted in 2001  says nothing about domestic electronic surveillance  Today s resolution flatly rejects their false claims and sets the record straight  as a starting point for the Judiciary hearings that are set for February 7    Senator Kennedy  a member of the Judiciary Committee and one of the Patriot Act Conferees said  If President Bush can make his own rules for domestic surveillance  Big Brother has run amok  We need a thorough investigation of these activities  Congress and the American people deserve answers  and they deserve answers now    Below is Senator Kennedy s full statement  A PDF copy of the Resolution is available upon request    Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy January 20  2006   What is past is prologue  Today  we see history repeating itself  In 1978  President Carter signed into law the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  successfully concluding years of debate on the power of the President to conduct national security wiretapping    As a result of lengthy hearings and consultation  Congress enacted that law with broad bipartisan support  Its purpose was clear    to put a check on the power of the President to use wiretaps in the name of national security  One of the clear purposes of that law was to require the government to obtain a judicial warrant for all electronic surveillance in the United States in which communications of U S  citizens might be intercepted  The Act established a secret court  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  to review wiretapping applications and guarantee that any such electronic surveillance followed the rule of law  Since 1979  the special court has approved nearly 19 000 applications and denied only 4  Last year  the Administration reached an all time high with the number of applications granted    In the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  Congress established the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance could be conducted in the United States for national security purposes  One of the principal goals of the legislation was to ensure that information obtained from illegal wiretaps could not be used to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  We even made sure that there would be criminal penalties for anyone who failed to comply with these rules    The PATRIOT Act did not give the President the authority to spy on anyone without impartial judicial review    and neither did the Joint Resolution  enacted in 2001  authorizing the use of force against those responsible for the attacks of September 11th    The President seemed to agree  In 2004  in Buffalo he stated categorically that  any time that you hear the United States talking about a wiretap  it requires a court order  He said that  Nothing had changed    when we re talking about chasing down terrorists  we re talking about getting a court order before we do so    Now  however  the President and the Administration claim they do not have to comply with the law  Just yesterday  the Administration again asserted its constitutional authority to eavesdrop on any person within the United States    without judicial or legislative oversight and it claims that the Congress implicitly granted such power in the Joint Resolution of 2001    But that Joint Resolution says nothing about domestic electronic surveillance  As Justice O Connor has said  A state of war is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nation s citizens    The bipartisan 9 11 Commission made clear that the Executive Branch has the burden of proof to justify why a particular governmental power should be retained    and Congress has the responsibility to see that adequate guidelines and oversight are made available    The Executive Branch has failed to meet the 9 11 Commissioners  burden of proof  The American people are not convinced that these are surveillance methods achieve the right balance between our national security and protection of our civil liberties    These issues go to the heart of what it means to have a free society  If President Bush can make his own rules for domestic surveillance  Big Brother has run amok  If the President believes that winning the war on terror requires new surveillance capabilities  he has a responsibility to work with Congress to make appropriate changes in existing law  He is not above the law    Congress and the American people deserve full and honest answers about the Administration s domestic electronic surveillance activities  On December 22  2005  I asked the President to provide us with answers before the Senate Judiciary Committee began hearings on Judge Alito s nomination to the Supreme Court  We got no response  The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin separate hearings on February 6 on the President s actions  Instead of providing us with the documents the Administration relied upon  the Justice Department continues to circulate summaries and white papers on the legal authorities it purports to have to ignore the law  It now appears that the President did so on at least thirty occasions after September 11th  There is no legitimate purpose in denying access by Members of Congress to all of the legal thought and analysis that the President relied upon when he authorized these activities    Every forty five days  the President ordered these activities to be reviewed by the Attorney General  the White House Counsel and the Inspector General of the National Security Agency  That s not good enough  These are all executive branch appointees who report directly to the President    Congress spent seven years considering and enacting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  It was not a hastily conceived idea  We had broad agreement that both Congressional oversight and judicial oversight were fundamental    even during emergencies or times of war  which is why we established a secret court to expedite the review of sensitive applications from the government    Now  the Administration has made a unilateral decision that Congressional and judicial oversight can be discarded  in spite of what the law obviously requires  We need a thorough investigation of these activities  Congress and the American people deserve answers  and they deserve answers now          Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
