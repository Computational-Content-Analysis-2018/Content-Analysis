         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Iraq is the overarching issue of our time   American lives  American values  and Americas role in the world are all at stake I have three major concerns with the course the Administration is pursuing First  the Congress did not authorize sending our troops into the middle of a civil war   The mission of our armed forces today in Iraq no longer bears any resemblance to the mission authorized by Congress in 2002   The Iraq War Resolution authorized a war against the regime of Saddam Hussein because he was believed to have weapons of mass destruction  an operational relationship with Al Qaeda  and was in defiance of U N  Security Council Resolutions  not a civil war      Second  experience demonstrates a surge wont work   Similar surges have been tried every year 2004  2005  and 2006  and none of them have worked  We have had four surges and four failures   It makes no sense to try again    Even Generals Abizaid and Casey told this Committee that more troops are not the answer     Third  even the Iraqi Government itself doesnt seem to be on board with the escalation   Pulitzer Prize winning reporter John Burns with the New York Times reports that that there is opposition to an escalation within the Iraqi government and that Prime Minister Maliki is dodging public comment on it    Still  youre asking the American people to support a policy that the Iraqi Prime Minister is reluctant to embrace   The civil war we are fighting bears no resemblance to the war authorized by Congress    History argues against a surge   Your own Generals question it   And the Iraqi Prime Minister seems reluctant to speak up for it No war can succeed without the support of the American people   They deserve a strong voice in the decision about whether we are going to increase our involvement in Iraqs civil war     The  President recently wrote   We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus on Iraq If we are going to be sending our sons and daughters into the cauldron of civil war  shouldnt the President now act on those words   Shouldnt he seek consensus and unity and find out if the country is behind him by putting his proposal to a debate and vote in Congress before he escalates this war    The President took two monthscant he give Congress ten days so that we can allow the voices of the American people to be heard Not one member of Congress would have voted in favor of the 2002 Resolution if they thought they were sending American troops into a civil war    The President owes it to the American people to seek approval for this new mission from Congress   We cant be a rubber stamp any longer for the Presidents failed strategy   We should insist on a policy that is worthy of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform Four Surges  Four FailuresApril 2004we sent 15 000 more troops to Iraq to try and stop Maqtada al Sadrs uprising in Najaf  We lost 135 soldiers during that month long operation but Sadr and his militia were not stopped  Today  he and his militia are more powerful than ever November 2004we sent an additional 12 000 troops to stop the insurgents in Fallujah  We lost 137 Americans in the Fallujah assault  more than in any other month of the war  and Fallujah was not stabilized  September 2005we sent 22 000 more soldiers to provide security for the constitutional referendum and the next elections    There was calm on election day  it had absolutely no long term effect on the violence  and 300 more of our soldiers died  2006After the bombing of the mosque in Samara  we sent an additional 12 000 troops to stabilize Baghdad  It obviously didnt work and 347 more Americans died    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
