nationwide relief organizations met with Kennedy and Enzi and relayed their experiences and recommendations for meeting the challenge of providing support services to a region severely hit with health care  education  economic and structural devastation  Senator Kennedy has already put forth proposals to ensure that students don t miss a year of school  survivors receive much needed health care  and families receive economic assistance during this time of great tragedy  Some of these ideas became a part of Democratic Caucus agenda and others will become part of the HELP Committee s plan  Below is Senator Kennedy s remarks and the witness list from today s hearings     STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY HEARING ON HURRICANE KATRINA SEPTEMBER 8  2005   Thank you  Senator Enzi  for holding today s important hearing on assisting those affected by Hurricane Katrina  and thank you also to our distinguished witnesses for their expertise and thoughtful recommendations    Some images are so searing they are burned into our memories forever  None of us will ever forget the pictures we have seen from the Gulf Coast in recent days    We have seen images of despair among those who were abandoned in a nation of great wealth and of hope reborn in the faces of families reunited after surviving a calamity of Biblical proportions  We have seen great heroism too  not only in the spectacular images of rescues by helicopter  but in the quiet courage of neighbors who helped neighbors survive the howling winds and rising waters     We have seen darker images too   images we thought we d never see in America  The elderly  the disabled  and the sick left to die  Families split apart  And American citizens trapped without food  sanitation or adequate water in makeshift shelters     In short  we have witnessed a natural disaster turned into a national catastrophe by a botched and inadequate response  despite the bravery and sacrifice of relief workers  rescue personnel  and the hurricane survivors themselves     Most of all  these indelible images remind us that we are all part of the American family  When members of that family are in need  in want  and in fear  we all have a duty to make our family whole once more    All of us  I am sure  have been heartened by the thousands of volunteers who have honored their commitment to the American family by giving their time and their skills to healing the injured  repairing schools  counseling the grieving  and aiding the survivors in finding new hope    In my own state of Massachusetts  health professionals  educators  labor unions  businesses  and countless individual citizens have answered the call  Eighteen major hospitals are sending volunteer teams or supplies to the affected area  More than 30 colleges and universities in Massachusetts will enroll students impacted by hurricane Katrina  offering housing and tuition assistance     Congress has a major responsibility to help the survivors of this terrible ordeal rebuild their communities and their lives  Today s hearing is an important part of meeting that responsibility  The distinguished individuals seated around this table today  and the organizations they represent  have rolled up their sleeves to help those most in need along the Gulf Coast  They have the vision to see what must be done  and the experience to know how to get it done    As we speak  thousands of Americans displaced from their homes are at risk of epidemics   yet only three working hospitals remain in Southeast Louisiana  Thousands more face the silent battles of coping with bereavement and catastrophe  We must restore shattered hospitals  assure access to health care including mental health care  and build communities so that hurricane survivors can live with dignity and hope in homes of their own    135 000 students in Louisiana alone have been displaced from their schools  Hundreds of schools in Mississippi have been damaged or destroyed  Student s lives have been disrupted and their semester interrupted  Fortunately  superintendents and principals across the country have reached out to students displaced by this disaster to welcome them into their classrooms  It s our turn in Congress to reach out and provide the resources needed for schools to take these students in  while also helping to rebuild educational institutions devastated by Katrina    We cannot afford to neglect the impact of this disaster on our nation s youngest children  Many of the thousands of children and families in the Gulf region most seriously impacted by this storm were already among the most neglected and vulnerable in our nation  devastated by the impact of poverty  It s time for Congress to act to help those young children and their families cope with the effects of trauma  and build a stronger foundation for their future     Up to one million Americans will be left jobless in this tragic storm  The unemployment rate in the Gulf Cost region is expected to increase to 25 percent or higher  Experts estimate that many of the affected workers will be unemployed for nine months or more     These are staggering figures  And they have national implications  Standard  Poors says that the likelihood of another recession has doubled and is now more than 25 percent    These families have lost absolutely everything  and they need a source of income while they try to get back on their feet and begin looking for new employment  This process will undoubtedly take time  Many of these people have more basic needs   such as finding shelter or finding lost family members   that must be met before they can focus on finding work     In addition  while communities across the country have generously opened their doors and their hearts to Katrina victims  the local economies in these areas do not necessarily have the capacity to accommodate the influx of workers that have arrived    Families  needs are immediate and significant  Employers and state governments in hurricane ravaged states cannot bear the burden of compensating the huge numbers of workers that are now jobless through their state unemployment compensation systems  We need a comprehensive federal response that makes disaster unemployment assistance available to every worker left jobless by this tragedy  and this federal assistance must provide a meaningful benefit that will meet the basic needs of unemployed workers and their families as they begin their long road to recovery    We must also take steps to see that we are better prepared for future calamities  whether from floods  earthquakes or terrorist attacks  In the days and weeks to come  we will have much to learn that will be helpful in this task    But an essential part of building for the future is a clear eyed assessment of the mistakes made in the response to Hurricane Katrina  If we fail to recognize and admit mistakes  they are sure to be repeated    But our task for today is to learn from our distinguished panelists how best to protect the health of those affected by the hurricane  and see that they can rebuild their lives     What should be our measure of success    Some would think it enough to return the survivors to the lives they knew before the flooding   but we should aim higher  For many of the survivors  the life they knew before the storm was one of ill health  inadequate education  and opportunity denied  The nation had failed them long before Katrina hit    Our promise to those who have survived the hurricane should not simply be to turn back the clock a month or two it should be to fulfill the true promise of the American Dream by committing ourselves to better health  better education and better job opportunities for them  and for all Americans    HURRICANE KATRINA ROUNDTABLE PARTICIPANTS   1       Michael Casserly  Great City Schools    2       Dr  Leonard Merrell  Superintendent of Katy Independent School District
