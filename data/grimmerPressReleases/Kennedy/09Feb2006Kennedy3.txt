         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     For months  we have been ready to roll up our sleeves and get back to work on the PATRIOT Act  but once again the White House has slammed the door on our efforts to act responsibly with regard to far reaching surveillance methods  Again  and again  the Administration refused to cooperate with Congress on matters of national security  including the National Security Agency s warrantless wiretaps and the use of National Security Letters     This latest proposal falls short in doing what s needed to improve our intelligence capabilities in a way that respects the checks and balances indispensable to our democracy  One of the most glaring omissions in the proposal is its failure to include a four year sunset provision on National Security Letters  even though it would be consistent with the new reporting and auditing requirements agreed to by the conferees on this provision  The latest changes also promise some additional protections for libraries  but they fail to require a link between the information sought and a foreign intelligence investigation for searches of library records    We have not yet achieved the goal of the 9 11 Commission  governmental powers that truly enhance our national security while ensuring adequate oversight over their use  With so much at stake  the Administration s refusal to work with Congress can only weaken our national security and undermine the public s trust in their government    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
