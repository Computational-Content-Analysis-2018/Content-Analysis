         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  In response to the troubling revelations about the failure of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to enforce the nation s civil rights laws  Senators Kennedy  Leahy  Dodd  Obama and Congressman Lewis sent a letter today to Attorney General Gonzales requesting that he report on the priorities of the Division  The letter addresses concern over the DoJ s apparent ideological approach to civil rights enforcement  the latest example being Division officials  decision to approve Rep  Delay s Texas redistricting plan  despite the conclusion by the Division s career staff that the plan would discriminate against black and Latino voters     As reported in Friday s Washington Post  six lawyers and two analysts in DOJ s Civil Rights Division unanimously concluded that the Texas redistricting plan violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because it eliminated several districts where minorities had substantial voting power and illegally diluted black and Hispanic voting power  However  according to the report  political appointees overruled their recommendation that the redistricting plan not be approved  and the approved redistricting plan resulted in significant Republican political gains in the 2004 election     Senator Kennedy said  Rosa Parks s refusal to accept racism and injustice fifty years ago yesterday is a reminder of how much more must be accomplished to fulfill the great promise of equality  Key to continuing that march toward progress is the Department of Justice    but unfortunately its enforcement of civil rights over the past five years has been negligent  especially in the critical area of voting rights  And today we learn that its ideologically driven approach to enforcement not only persists but fell prey to Tom Delay s redistricting scheme for Republican political gain  America deserves better than a Civil Rights Division that doesn t do its job and puts the political agenda of those in power over the interests of the people its serves      Below is the text of the letter    December 5  2005   The Honorable Alberto Gonzales Attorney General United States Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W  Washington  D C  20530   Dear Attorney General Gonzales    We are writing to follow up on Chairman Specter s letter to you dated November 22  2005 requesting a report to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the current priorities of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice  DOJ   We want to re emphasize the depth of concern regarding trends away from vigorous civil rights enforcement in light of recent news reports  The information reported in the press and available to the Congress shows an unacceptable decline in the number of traditional civil rights cases filed by the Division under this Administration  particularly in the important area of voting rights  a disturbing attrition of experienced attorneys from the Division  and an increasing diversion of the Division s resources to non civil rights issues  such as immigration enforcement    We are particularly concerned about reports that the conclusions of experienced career DOJ attorneys have been overruled by DOJ officials for what appear to have been politically motivated reasons  The Washington Post recently reported that the Division overruled the recommendation of career DOJ attorneys by approving a Texas congressional redistricting plan that the career attorneys believed would discriminate based on race and ethnicity  As reported in the December 2  2005 article by Dan Eggen  Justice Staff Saw Texas Districting As Illegal  Voting Rights Finding On Map Pushed by DeLay Was Overruled  six lawyers and two analysts in DOJ s Civil Rights Division unanimously concluded that the Texas redistricting plan violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because it eliminated several districts where minorities had substantial voting power and illegally diluted black and Hispanic voting power  However  according to the article  political appointees overruled their recommendation that the redistricting plan not be approved  and the approved redistricting plan resulted in significant Republican political gains     This new revelation follows on other recent reports of political appointees overruling the conclusions of career employees regarding the pre clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act  Earlier this month  The Washington Post reported that Civil Rights Division officials overruled a 5 1 career staff recommendation against approving a Georgia voter photo identification requirement  which disadvantaged African Americans and other voters  As you know  the Georgia law  which The New York Times has called a national disgrace  was recently enjoined by a federal court     These disclosures highlight the urgent need for your report and for increased oversight of the Civil Rights Division  We request that your report include an explanation of the decision making process which led to the approval of the Texas redistricting plan and the Georgia voter ID requirements  in addition to an explanation of the decline in civil rights enforcement and the increase in attorney attrition  The vital work of the Civil Rights Division demands that the civil rights enforcement decisions made by experienced career attorneys not be curtailed for political reasons     Thank you for your prompt response to this request regarding the protections of the Voting Rights Act  which guarantee that no individuals or groups are without a voice in this democracy    Sincerely    SENATOR KENNEDY SENATOR LEAHY SENATOR DODD SENATOR OBAMA CONGRESSMAN LEWIS   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
