as a fact sheet on his plan to raise the minimum wage Statement By Senator Edward M  Kennedy on the Minimum Wage and Business   As Prepared for Delivery Im honored to be joined here today by two representatives of the business community  Howard Kuntz  CEO of Kindred Healthcare  and Lew Prince  co owner of Vintage Vinyl They represent a broad spectrum of the business community  Mr  Kuntz heads a large  national  publicly traded corporation based in Louisville  and Mr  Prince owns two very popular local record stores in St  Louis  Although they work in industries  health care and retail  that opponents of raising the minimum wage say will be hurt by an increase  though both agree that a fair increase is long overdue  Theyre here today not just to share their personal views  They support a higher minimum wage because they believe its good for their businesses  and good for their communities  Many parts of the country are suffering in the current economy  especially low income communities  Increasing the minimum wage will give these employees more money to meet the cost of their basic needs  They are very likely to spend it immediately  injecting more money into the local economy  creating jobs and benefiting  not hurting  local businesses  Even Wal Mart CEO Lee Scott  a man with whom I often disagree  but who is  without question  a brilliantly successful businessman  agrees that raising the minimum wage is good for the working families that shop at his stores  Hes observed first hand that many of his customers are struggling to get by  They simply don t have the money to buy basic necessities between pay checks  he says A higher minimum wage will also help businesses  Multiple studies of Baltimore  Boston  Los Angeles  and San Francisco have shown that firms have lower turnover and higher productivity of employees after a minimum wage increase  When San Francisco raised its minimum wage to  8 40 an hour  the average tenure of workers in the high turnover fast food industry increased by almost 4 months  Businesses saved the high cost of training new employees  In the House debate last week  opponents again claimed that the small business community is vehemently opposed to an increase  They think small businesses will suffer or collapse even with our modest increase  Thats preposterous  A recent Gallup poll found that 86  of small business owners dont think that the minimum wage affects their businessat all  In fact  small businesses have historically prospered after past increases  More than half the states have already acted to increase minimum wages above the federal level today  and these states are generating more small businesses than states with a minimum wage of  5 15 an hour  Our opponents arent giving the business community enough credit  Business leaders understand fairness  The vast majority want to do whats best for their employees  As a North Carolina small business owner recently wrote in an op ed article  I am proud to say that my lowest paid employee makes  8 per hour  With only 11 employees  things are tight  to say the least  If I can find a way to be fair with my employees in rural Eastern North Carolina  why cant our government  Try driving to work and raising a family on minimum wage  My guys make me money  and I try to share the wealth with them Well said  After 10 long years without a raise  its long past time to share the wealth with Americas minimum wage workers  Im optimistic that my colleagues in the Senate will agree  and we can take prompt action next week to give working families the raise they deserve  No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty   RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS Senator Kennedys Fair Minimum Wage Act would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps   5 85 60 days after enactment   6 55 one year later   7 25 one year after thatThe number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office  37 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year earn  10 700 per year  almost  6 000 below the federal poverty guidelines of  16 600 for a family of three  Since then the minimum wage was last raised in 1997  its real value has eroded by 21 3 percent  Every day the minimum wage is not increased  it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind  Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  4 00 below what it was in 1968  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  9 37 an hour today  not  5 15  Nearly fifteen million Americans will benefit from a minimum wage increase to  7 25 an hour  6 6 million directly  and another 8 3 million indirectly  Fifty nine percent of these workers are women  and forty percent are people of color Eighty percent of those who would benefit are adult workers  not teenagers seeking pocket change  Fifty four percent of workers who will benefit are full time employees  and more than a third of these adults are sole breadwinners for their families  Increasing the minimum wage will help more than 7 3 million children whose parents would receive a raise  Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 400 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families  It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy  o 15 months of grocerieso 19 months of utilitieso 8 months of rento Over two years of health careo 20 months of child careo 30 months of college tuition at a public  2 year collegeThis year  the Senate raised its pay by  3 100 and is set to receive an additional  3 300 raise in 2007  It is shameful that Members of Congress received our eighth pay increase in nine years  yet we have not provided a single pay increase to the lowest paid workers  The salaries of lawmakers have gone up by  31 600 since 1997  while minimum wage workers continue to earn just  10 700 a year History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation  In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades  Nearly 12 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 248 000 per month  In contrast  in the last four years  the minimum wage has held steady  but only 4 9 million jobs have been created States across this country have raised their own minimum wages without adverse economic consequences  Study after study has shown that raising the minimum wage has not cost jobs in the states  An Economic Policy Institute study of Washington  Oregon  and Alaska showed that increases in the state minimum wage had no impact on the state unemployment rate  Similarly  the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center has found that after the last two minimum wage increases in Massachusetts in 2000 and 2001  employment grew more quickly in sectors with the most minimum wage workers  including leisure  hospitality  and the service sector A recent Gallup poll found that 86  of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business  and three out of four small businesses said that a 10  increase in the minimum wage would have no effect on their company  Additionally  nearly half of small business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased  and only 16  of owners think the minimum wage should be reduced or eliminated entirely Britain has the second largest economy in Europe  after Germany   They implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty  They raised their minimum wage to about  9 51 per hour last year  and they are planning to raise this rate to about  9 89 in October of this year Ireland has an extremely robust economy  with impressive growth over the last decade  and the fourth largest GDP per capita in the world  The minimum wage rate in Ireland is 7 65  hour  about  9 65  and yet their unemployment rate is lower than the U S    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
