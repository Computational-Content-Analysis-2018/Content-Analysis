         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  yesterdays Washington Post included details from a memo by our Ambassador to Iraq  Ryan Crocker  in which he makes a strong case that we need to do more to make it possible for Iraqis employed by our government to come to the United States  Ambassador Crocker emphasizes the growing danger facing these Iraqis  who as he states work under extremely difficult conditions  and are targets for violence including murder and kidnapping  According to the article  Ambassador Crocker has called for establishment of an immigrant visa program for these Iraqi employees  In fact  Senators Smith  Biden  Hagel  Lieberman  Leahy  Levin and I have introduced legislation  which establishes a program to do precisely what Ambassador Crocker calls for  Our legislation establishes an immigrant visa program for Iraqis who have worked for or directly with the United States government for at least one year  Our government now provides such special immigrant visas but only for Iraqi and Afghan translators and interpreters  Our bill expands it to include Iraqis in other professions who have been employed by us or who have worked directly with us In addition  our legislation creates additional options for Iraqis who are under threat because of their close association with the United States to apply to our refugee resettlement program The Senate is obviously divided on the best overall policy to pursue on the war  I thought it was a mistake from the beginning  Thats no secret  Some of our colleagues are convinced that continuing the use of military force in Iraq is necessary to protect our national security  But our divisions on that issue shouldnt obscure the fact that all of us on both sides of the aisle agree that America owes an immense debt of gratitude to these Iraqis  and we have a special responsibility to help them  Theyve supported our effort  saved American lives  and are clearly at great risk because of it  David Keene  Chairman of the American Conservative Union  recognized this obligation and called for action in a June 12 article in the Hill  He recalled a Vietnamese friend who didnt make it out of Vietnam when the U S  left  and said  There are in Iraq today untold numbers of people like my Vietnamese friend who rushed to our aid when we arrived and have worked with us since  If we abandon them  they may not be so lucky  Similarly  In a June 24  op ed in the Washington Post  Julia Taft called for swift action to assist Iraqis whose lives are in danger because of their work with our government  Ms  Taft served as director of the Interagency Task Force for Indochinese Refugee Resettlement in the Ford Administration and was later Assistant Secretary of State for Population  Refugees and Migration  she wrote about an Iraqi couple working for the U S  Embassy in Baghdad who had been kidnapped and executed  She said  They are among the most recent of thousands of cases in which Iraqis affiliated with the United States have been forced into hiding  tortured or  often  killed I found myself thinking of this husband and wife last week and struggling with a terrible contradiction  The United States is the world s most generous contributor to refugee relief  and we have always taken the lead on resettling refugees  Yet our country has done the bare minimum to help these Iraqis facing death and exile In her call for action  Taft said  The administration and Congress cannot waste any more time  Their lack of political will has cost too many people their livesIn a July 19 op ed in USA today  Michael Medved  a conservative Republican who supports the ongoing war effort  and Lanny J  Davis  a liberal Democrat who supports the withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq  called for swift and bold action action to help Iraqi refugees  They wrote  one issue should bring together all factions of the ongoing debate  and that is America s moral obligation to open our doors    immediately    to Iraqis who face danger and death because of their assistance to our forces They specifically called for action on our legislation  saying Last month  a bipartisan group of senators  including Kennedy  who is anti war  and Lieberman  who supports the war  introduced legislation that would provide special refugee status for Iraqis who are in danger because of their association with the United States or its contractors  This legislation  or something like it  needs strong support from the administration as well as from citizens across ideological and partisan lines days  even hours  could mean the difference between life and death for people who did nothing wrong other than help Americans Many Iraqis have been working with our armed forces  our diplomatic mission  and our reconstruction teams in Iraq and have performed valiantly  and their lives are at risk  Many have lost their lives  and many more have lost their homes  their property  and their livelihood  For some  it will be too dangerous to ever return home America has a special obligation to keep faith with the Iraqis who now have a bulls eye on their back because of their association with our government  Our bipartisan legislation will establish the kind of process that Ambassador Crocker  David Keene  Julia Taft  Roy Medved  Lanny Davis and many others have called for to help these Iraqis who have sacrificed so much for the United States  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article and other articles I have mentioned may be placed in the Record  I urge my colleagues to support our legislation  S 1651  to keep the faith with the many brave Iraqis whose lives are in great danger because they have the courage to work with the United States       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
