         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE          Law enforcement and intelligence officers must have strong powers to prevent and investigate terrorist attacks  Yet  once again  the Bush Administration has been sharply rebuked for making up its own rules this time to carry out warrantless surveillance of Americans  Our nation is safest when the President and Congress work together  By acting so cavalierly  the White House created a surveillance program that flunks the requirements of our laws and Constitution and leaves us at risk    There is a way to fight terrorism within the framework of the ruling law  Nearly thirty years ago  President Carter and Congress worked together to pass the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978  which has served this nation well  By ignoring that law  the Administration took a path filled with legal uncertainty  putting employees of the National Security Agency at risk of criminal penalties and jeopardizing prosecutions of terrorists who may be able to successfully challenge the evidence against them      Its not too late for President Bush to work with Congress  and its vital to our national security that he does so     Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
