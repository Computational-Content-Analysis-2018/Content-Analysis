         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE          On its third year anniversary  it is clearer than ever that Iraq was a war we never should have fought   The Administration has been dangerously incompetent  and its Iraq policy is not worthy of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform    Yet  President Bush continues to see the war through the same rose colored glasses hes always used   He assures the American people that we are winning while Iraqs future and the lives of our troops hang so perilously on the precipice of a new disaster          Our highest priority must be achieving a broad based political settlement to prevent a downward spiral into civil war  American initiative can be decisive in this effort and the President should lead  not by waging a public relations campaign  but by pulling the factions together right away in a summit to develop a unified plan for Iraqs future   Our troops  who are at serious risk of being caught in a civil war  deserve nothing less   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
