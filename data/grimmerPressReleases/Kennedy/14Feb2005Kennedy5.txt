         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Millions of Americans rely on the FDA each day for the safety of our food and medicines  and I welcome the naming of a permanent commissioner by the President  Dr  Crawford has had a long association with the FDA  and is intimately familiar with the issues facing the agency     The credibility of the FDA has been questioned due to recent serious controversies regarding drug safety and the possible intrusion of political decisions into agency decisions  As many of these controversies arose while Dr  Crawford was Acting Commissioner  it will be important for him to lay out to Congress and the American public his specific plans to ensure the safety of our prescription drugs as well as our food supply  I look forward to discussing these plans with him    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
