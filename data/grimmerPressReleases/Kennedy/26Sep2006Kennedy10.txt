         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     MASSACHUSETTS FACT SHEETS INCLUDED       Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward Kennedy  joined by a bipartisan group of 13 Senators  introduced the National Competitiveness Investment Act  to encourage innovation in America as a way to create jobs and move our economy forward  Kennedy believes the bill is an important down payment on the commitment and sustained investment needed to keep America competitive in the years to come  Among other things  the bill doubles basic research funding by the National Science Foundation over the next five years and puts us on a strong course to doubling basic research funding at the Department of Energy as well  The National Competitiveness Investment Act also recognizes and responds to the critical need to recruit and train high quality math  science  technology and engineering teachers to teach in the schools with the greatest need so that we can begin to close the achievement gap and ensure that all American students can compete on a level playing field with their peers in other nations   America has long been at the forefront in innovation  invention  and education  We know how to rise to challenges and come out ahead  Weve done it before and we can do it again  Senator Kennedy said  Today we are taking a step toward putting America back on the right track  but we need a bold commitment to help the current generation meet and master the global challenges of today and tomorrow  I look forward to working with my colleagues as the bill moves forward to ensure that Congress provides the new investments needed to fully support and build on these important proposals    Senator Kennedy is committed to doing more to get this country back on track  He will continue to move forward to ensure that the cost of college is not a barrier to full participation in the new economy  He also is committed to addressing the impact of the global economy on the American worker   Below is Senator Kennedys full statement upon introduction  a summary of the bill and fact sheets on education and research and development  both nationally and in Massachusetts         Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy Introduction of the National Competitiveness Investment Act September 26  2006  Families across America are facing serious challenges in todays global economy  The value of their wages is declining  the cost of living is going up  and many of their jobs are being shipped overseas   We must respond to this challenge to ensure that our citizens can achieve the American dream once again  We have the best workers in the world  and we must prepare them to compete and succeed in the global economy   America has long been at the forefront in innovation  invention  and education  But other countries are catching up and surpassing us    We are now ranked 28th out of 40 nations in math education   Since 1975  we have dropped from 3rd to 15th in the world in producing scientists and engineers   A recent report shows that high school and college graduation rates in the United States have dropped below the average for other developed countries    Federal investment in research and development has been shrinking as a share of the economy  and government research programs at the National Institutes of Health  the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy all have less funding this year than they did three years ago    At the same time  fast growing countries like China  Ireland and South Korea are realizing the potential for economic growth that comes with investing in innovation  For example  Chinas total research and development investments rose from  12 4 billion in 1991 to  84 6 billion in 2003  an average increase of 17 percent a year  Over the same period  the increase in U S  investment averaged only 4 to 5 percent annually   Study after study tells us that we need major new investments in education and research and development to stay ahead  We cannot just tinker at the margins and expect to master our own destiny in the global economy  We have a responsibility to make the investments that are necessary to our progress  a responsibility to our families  to our economy  to our nation  and to our national security    Last year  the Council on Competitiveness urged a focus on lifelong skill development  through elementary  secondary and higher education  and workforce training and support  as essential to keeping America on the cutting edge of innovation    The recent report by the National Academy of Sciences  Rising Above the Gathering Storm  emphasized these recommendations  Two of the reports four major recommendations involved education as the solution to meeting the global challenge  The report set out a broad roadmap for keeping America competitive  but it prioritized investment in education over all other recommendations   The National Association of Manufacturers also issued a report urging renewed focus on education and training to keep American businesses competitive   It is clear that we must act  and today we are taking a step toward putting America back on the right track   I am pleased to join with a bipartisan group of my colleagues today to introduce the National Competitiveness Investment Act  It is a modest proposal  but it represents an important down payment on the commitment and sustained investment needed to keep America competitive in the years to come    The legislation responds to many of the recommendations in the Gathering Storm and other recent reports and includes many provisions based on those in the Right TRACK Act  which I introduced earlier this year    The bill takes important steps to encourage innovation in America as a way to create jobs and move our economy forward  It is often federally funded research that primes the pump for technological  medical and scientific breakthroughs  and the bill doubles basic research funding by the National Science Foundation over the next five years  It also puts us on a strong course to doubling basic research funding at the Department of Energy as well    The legislation also creates a Presidents Council on Innovation and Competitiveness  based on successful models being used in established and emerging economies in Europe and Asia  The council will bring together the heads of federal agencies with leaders in business and academia to develop a comprehensive agenda to promote innovation  Japan for some time has had a similar council  and Ireland  known as the Celtic Tiger  has already had success in expanding its RD strength since it established its council last year   The bill also strengthens programs at college and universities to encourage a renewed interest in nuclear science  Massachusetts has long been a leader in nuclear research  There are only three dozen licensed nuclear reactors in the United States  and three of them are located at Massachusetts universities  University of Massachusetts Lowell  Worcester Polytechnic Institute and MIT  These colleges will have a vital role as nuclear science expands  and this bill will help expand their programs and establish new ones to meet the growing demand   These are important investments  but there is more we can do  We should act to renew the research and development tax credit as soon as possible  The incentive provided by the tax credit has led to quality jobs  better  safer products  greater productivity and a stronger  more robust national economy  A growing number of countries who recognize the importance of research and development spending to future economic growth now offer more generous RD tax incentives than the United States  The top 6 pharmaceutical companies  and American high tech companies like Microsoft  Intel and GE have all opened advanced RD facilities in India  We must give American companies the certainty that these incentives will continue to be there  so that they can choose to maintain these high skilled jobs here at home  to keep America at the cutting edge as a leader in innovation in the global economy    These investments also depend on a talented pool of well trained individuals who can make discoveries and scientific breakthroughs  Jobs in science and engineering are expected to increase 70  faster than those in other fields over the next 6 years  To ensure Americans are prepared to hold these jobs  we must improve education at all levels  from the very early years in a childs life all the way through doctoral study and beyond  especially in math  science  engineering and technology    Although international comparisons of student achievement show that the United States is slipping behind other countries  a closer look shows that the picture is more complex  The real problem lies in the serious and pervasive achievement gap in this country between higher income students and lower income students   On the most recent test comparing student achievement in industrialized nations  white students in the United States performed better than the average for all countries in both math literacy and problem solving  while their Hispanic and African American peers did worse  Low income students in the U S  performed worse than their high income peers  and also performed worse than other low income students in over half of the developed countries surveyed    If we close this achievement gap  and guarantee all children in this country a world class education  we can put America back at the top of the list  To do so  we should fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act    We must also invest in teachers  The National Competitiveness Investment Act recognizes and responds to the critical need to recruit and train high quality math  science  technology and engineering teachers to teach in the schools with the greatest need so that we can begin to close the achievement gap and ensure that all American students can compete on a level playing field with their peers in other nations   Research shows that having a high quality teacher is one of the most important factors in a childs success in school  But almost half of math classes taught in high poverty and high minority schools are taught by teachers without a college major or minor in math or a related field  such as math education  physics or engineering  The problem is even more serious in middle schools   70  of math classes in these schools are taught by a teacher who doesnt even have a minor in math or a related field   The bill provides a 10 fold increase in the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program at the National Science Foundation to recruit math  science  engineering and technology students and professionals to become teachers in high need school districts   It provides grants to institutions of higher education to create undergraduate programs that integrate the study of math  science  engineering  or critical need foreign language with teacher education  modeled on the successful U Teach program at the University of Texas  It also helps institutions create part time masters degree programs to improve the content knowledge and teaching skills of current teachers  In both of these programs  universities would partner with high need school districts to ensure that these resources will go where they are needed most    The bill expands the Teacher Institutes for the 21st Century program at the National Science Foundation to provide cutting edge summer professional development programs for teachers who teach in high need schools  It also creates a summer institute program in the Department of Energy to strengthen the math and science teaching skills of elementary and secondary school teachers   Recruitment and training are the first steps  but we must also do more to see that teachers have an incentive to stay in classrooms once they are there  We should provide financial incentives  through fellowships or salary increases  to teachers who commit to teach in the highest need schools  where the unique challenges make the schools the hardest to staff  I look forward to working with my colleagues as the bill moves forward to add this critical component to the effort   In addition to providing a high quality teacher in every classroom  we must also ensure that children in low income school districts have access to the same college preparatory classes that more affluent school districts are able to provide  and  importantly  that they have the preparation they need to succeed in those classes  To do so  the bill expands access to Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate classes as well as pre AP and pre IB courses  especially in high need schools  and creates a program to improve instruction in math for elementary and middle school students and provide targeted help to students struggling with the subject    The bill also addresses the critical need to ensure our education system is preparing students for the challenges they face after graduation from high school  According to a recent study  the nation loses over  3 7 billion a year in the cost of remedial education and lost earning potential because students are not adequately prepared to enter college when they leave high school   Many states have recognized the need to better align elementary and secondary school standards  curricula  and assessments with the demands of college  the 21st century workforce and the Armed Forces  This bill provides grants to assist states in those efforts  The grants would support state PreK 16 councils that bring together stakeholders from all levels of the education community  from the business sector  and from the military to improve the rigor of elementary and secondary education and prepare students for the postsecondary challenges they will face    In addition to the education programs at the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation  the legislation relies on the resources of the Department of Energy to assist in the effort to improve math and science education  The National Labs at the Department of Energy can have a critical role in these efforts  and so can the more than 300 colleges and universities across the country conducting research supported by the Department of Energy  I appreciate my colleagues efforts to ensure that the resources of the Department of Energy are used to enhance educational opportunities for children not only in the states that host National Labs  but across the country    It is also becoming increasingly important for students to become exposed to and immersed in critical foreign languages and cultures  In recent years  foreign language needs have significantly increased throughout the public and private sector due to the presence of a wider range of security threats  the emergence of new nation states  and the globalization of the U S  economy  American businesses increasingly need employees experienced in foreign languages and international cultures to manage a culturally diverse workforce  But if students are to become proficient in these critical foreign languages  they must have access to a sustained course of study  beginning in the early grades   To address these needs  the bill provides grants to enable institutions of higher education and local educational agencies working in partnership to create programs of study in critical foreign languages for students from elementary school through postsecondary education    All of these programs and investments will help prepare our students to compete in the 21st century  but if we are serious about keeping America competitive  there is more we can  and must  do    A college degree is fast becoming the price of admission to participation in the global economy  Eighty percent of the fastest growing jobs in this country will require some postsecondary education  A recent study by the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development shows that in the United States  earnings of people with a post secondary degree are 72  higher on average than for those with only a high school diploma   But with soaring costs and stagnant financial aid  college is increasingly out of reach for students and families  Research shows that 400 000 students a year do not go to a four year college because they cannot afford it    When our troops returned home from World War II  we created the GI Bill and sent them to college to learn the skills they would need in the changing world  The economy reaped an estimated  7 in benefit for every dollar invested in that effort   In recent decades however  federal grant aid has dwindled and the grants provided dont go as far as they used to  Thirty years ago  seventy seven percent of the federal assistance provided to students was in the form of grants  but in recent years its twenty percent  The Pell Grant now covers less than 35  of the cost of attending college    To ensure the prosperity of our families and the nation  we must open the doors of college to all by restoring the Pell Grant as the foundation of the student aid system   Earlier this year  Congress squandered an opportunity to significantly increase aid for low income students  The Senate passed a bill that would have immediately increased the  Pell grant from  4 050 to  4 500  But this increase was rejected  and the funds instead were used to pay for tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans    I know many of my colleagues agree that higher education is the key to keeping America competitive  and I look forward to working with them to ensure that the cost of college is not a barrier to full participation in the new economy    We must also do more to address the devastating impacts of the global economy on American workers and their families    American workers are facing global competition that is fundamentally unfair  but this bill does nothing to level the playing field or to help ease the burden of their transition to the global economy  To truly improve our national competitiveness  we must address all aspects of this challenge  We cannot continue to ignore the plight of working Americans    First  we need to level the playing field in the competition for good jobs  Americans have nothing to fear from competition thats fair  But its not fair when Americans are competing with foreign workers who lack even basic labor standards  like child labor laws  a minimum wage  or the right to organize  And its not fair when companies cut costs by exploiting and abusing foreign workers   We need to exercise global leadership in promoting fair wages and safe working conditions for workers around the world  reward companies that treat their foreign workforces fairly  and be a strong voice in sanctioning those countries that will not play by the rules    Beyond these basic steps to level the playing field  we owe a particular duty to those American workers who are losing their jobs because of trade  We all benefit from the lower prices and variety of products that globalization provides  but many of our most vulnerable workers are paying the price  In the manufacturing sector alone  weve lost nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs since 2001  and service sector jobs are now moving overseas as well  These are good  middle class jobs  with decent wages and benefits that form the core of the American middle class    Our response to globalization must address the disappearance of good jobs  We must create the good jobs of the future  We must eliminate tax incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas  We must give workers who are at risk of losing their jobs to overseas competition fair warning so that they can plan for their futures  We must strengthen our commitment to help workers who lose their jobs adjust to the new economy  with well funded training and income assistance programs that ease the transition to new employment    Fulfilling our commitment to American workers also demands that we give them their fair share of the economic growth that globalization brings  We must raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour  and give workers a stronger voice in the new economy by protecting their right to organize and form a union    If we truly want to be competitive in the global economy  we need to address these challenges facing the American workforce head on  and give workers greater job security in the present  and better opportunities in the future  I hope that the same bipartisan coalition that has worked together so effectively on this bill can also work together to address these important issues for Americas working families    The legislation we are introducing today is not a complete package  It represents only the beginning of a strong commitment that we will need to build on and sustain if America is to remain competitive in the years ahead  I am proud that the bill has strong bipartisan support  and that support is critical to ensuring these proposals become a reality    In 2001  there was strong bipartisan support to significantly increase funding to improve our schools through the No Child Left Behind Act  But President Bushs budget this year would mean a cumulative shortfall of  56 billion in funding since that bill was enacted  and this year he proposed cutting education funding by  2 billion   In 2002  we promised to double NSF funding  but last years appropriation was only two thirds the level we agreed to four years ago  nearly  3 billion short of staying on track to that goal   Words alone will not keep America competitive  This legislation must be more than a promise  I look forward to working with my colleagues as the bill moves forward to ensure that Congress provides the new investments needed to fully support these important proposals    Americans know how to rise to challenges and come out ahead  Weve done it before and we can do it again  When we were called into action in 1957 with the Soviet Sputnik launch  we rose to the challenge by passing the National Defense Education Act and inspiring the nation to ensure that the first footprint on the moon was by an American  We doubled the federal investment in education    We need the same bold commitment to help the current generation meet and master the global challenges of today and tomorrow  The National Competitiveness Investment Act will start to put America back on track  I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve upon the bill as it moves forward and to expand on these efforts in the months to come     SUMMARY OF THE NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS INVESTMENT ACT  The National Competitiveness Investment Act is a bipartisan legislative response to recommendations contained in the National Academies Rising Above the Gathering Storm report and the Council on Competitiveness Innovate America report  Several sections of the bill are derived from proposals contained in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2006  S 2802   approved by the Senate Commerce Committee 21 0  and the Protecting Americas Competitive Edge Through Energy Act of 2006  S 2197  approved unanimously by the Senate Energy Committee  Accordingly  the National Competitiveness Investment Act focuses on three primary areas of importance to maintaining and improving United States innovation in the 21st Century   1  increasing research investment   2  strengthening educational opportunities in science  technology  engineering  and mathematics from elementary through graduate school  and  3  developing an innovation infrastructure  More specifically  the National Competitiveness Investment Act would   Increase Research

insufficient support make it extremely difficult to recruit and retain highly qualified teachers  Teachers are paid on average almost  8 000 less than graduates in other fields  and the gap widens to more than  23 000 after 15 years of teaching  More than 20  of new teachers leave during their first three years  and almost half of teachers in urban districts leave during the first five years   AFT and NEA    According to NCES  20  of teachers in high poverty schools have three or less years of teaching experience  compared to 11  of teachers in low poverty schools   Qualified Teachers for At Risk Schools  A National Imperative    Other industrialized countries are doing much better in ensuring students have access to highly qualified teachers  In 1999  only 41  of US 8th grade students received instruction from a math teacher who specialized in mathematics  while the international average was 71    NAS Rising Above the Gathering Storm    Despite the strong evidence that shows how important quality math and science teachers are  a crisis remains in the workforce  In 2002  20  of math teachers and between 17  and 28   depending on the field  of science teachers lacked certification in their fields  This crisis was especially acute in middle school   Ed Trust    Students in high minority and high poverty schools are at an even greater disadvantage  Almost half of math classes taught in high poverty and high minority high schools are taught by teachers who dont have a college major or minor in math or a related field  such as math education  physics or engineering  Its even worse in middle school  70  of math classes in high poverty and high minority middle schools are taught by a teacher who doesnt even have a minor in math or a related field   Education Trust  2006   The United States is Slipping Behind in the Production of New Scientists   It is estimated that jobs in science and engineering will increase more quickly than those in other fields  70  faster from now until 2012   NSB Science and Engineering Indicators 2006 supplement  Americas Pressing Challenge    In 1975  the United States ranked 3rd in the world in producing science and engineering professionals  by 2000  the U S  ranked 15th   NSB 2004 Science and Engineering Indicators     China graduates over 2 and a half times as many engineers and computer scientists as the United States   Duke University    In 2002  one third of the worlds engineering doctorates were awarded in Asia  while the U S  produced only 15   half of which were earned by students on temporary visas    National Science Board  2006    From 1988 to 2003  the US share of research articles published in the worlds major peer reviewed journals declined from 38  to 30   Over this same time period  Chinas output rose by 530   and their share of articles rose from 4  to 10   US articles continue to be cited more often than others  which indicates a higher quality of research  but the US share of citations has declined since 1990   National Science Board  2006   American Students and Workers Need Foreign Language Skills and Knowledge of Global Cultures   In recent years  foreign language needs have significantly increased throughout the public and private sector due to the presence of a wider range of security threats  the emergence of new nation states  and the globalization of the U S  economy    Only 1 3 of students in grades 7 12  and a mere 5  of elementary school students  study a foreign language  Even fewer study critical need foreign languages   Committee for Economic Development  2006    A 2004 survey found that 2 400 high schools would be interested in offering the AP in Chinese language and culture  even though most of these schools do not currently offer Chinese   Asia Society    In the 2003 National Survey of Student Engagement  only 40  of undergraduates reported taking foreign language coursework and only 20  reported having studied abroad  Foreign languages represented 1  percent of all undergraduate degrees conferred in the 2000 2001 school year      More than 200 million children in China are studying English  a compulsory subject for all Chinese primary school students  By comparison  only about 24 000 of approximately 54 million elementary and secondary school children in the United States are studying Chinese   U S  Department of Education    Arabic accounts for just 0 8  of foreign language enrollments in American postsecondary institutions   Committee for Economic Development  2006    American companies lose an estimated  2 billion per year as a result of inadequate cross cultural guidance for their employees in multicultural situations   Committee for Economic Development  2006    With the exception of Italy and Wales  all European students are required to learn a foreign language throughout their compulsory education   Committee for Economic Development  2006     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
