         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on tomorrows visit by Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki   Iraqi Prime Minister Malikis visit to the United States comes at an important time    All Americans want Iraqs new government to succeed  The principal measure of success will be whether the tide of violence recedes and full scale civil war is avoided   But for that to happen  the new government must deal quickly and decisively with the principal threat to stability    the deadly influence of the militias  especially in Baghdad      It is time for the Iraqi Prime Minister to move beyond vagaries and develop a viable strategy to deal with the militias and prevent Iraq from descending into full scale civil war   When President Bush meets with Prime Minister Maliki tomorrow  the President should ask him two critical questions         Does the Iraqi Government have a credible plan to disarm and demobilize the militias and reintegrate as many of their members as possible into government security forces       Can the Iraqi Government obtain a real commitment from the political parties to disarm and disband the militias   Its essential that commanders in the security forces are loyal to the government  and that personnel with loyalty to militias are weeded out  so that units within the security forces are not also operating as militias     As the new violence in Lebanon demonstrates  political parties cannot govern with one hand and terrorize civilians with militias with the other hand    It did not work with Hezbollah in Lebanon   It cannot work with Hamas   And it will not work in Iraq     There is no role for militias in a legitimately functioning government of Iraq   We ignore this immense danger at our peril   Iraqs future and the lives of our troops are close to the precipice of a new disaster   The time bomb of civil war is ticking  and our most urgent priority is to defuse it   If Prime Minister Maliki does not have a credible plan to disarm  demobilize  and reintegrate the militias  even President Bush would have to concede that it would be far better for our men and women in uniform to begin to leave Iraq than to take sides in an unwinnable sectarian civil war    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
