         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  earlier today  the Senator from Alabama  Senator Sessions said that Senator Kerry and I objected to Senate consideration of the Intelligence Authorization bill because we wish to offer amendments In fact  neither Senator Kerry nor I have objected to this bill and no other Democrat has objected to considering it  The bill is cleared on the Democratic side  That means an unidentified Republican Senator or Senators have placed a hold on the bill and are preventing the Senate from considering it I do have two amendments to the bill  My first amendment would require the Administration provide to the Intelligence Committee with the Presidential Daily Briefs on Iraq from 1997 to the first day of the Iraq war as part of the committee s investigation on the use of pre war intelligence  I d certainly be willing to support a time agreement allowing reasonable debate and a vote on the amendment My second amendment would guarantee that detainees held by the intelligence community would be treated humanely  and that treatment would be verified independently Apparently  to prevent debate on this very important issue  a Republican Senator is willing to let the whole intelligence bill fail  That s an outrage It s important for the Senate to approve the Intelligence Authorization Bill  and it s important for the Senate to get to the bottom of the abuse of intelligence the Administration used to justify war   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
