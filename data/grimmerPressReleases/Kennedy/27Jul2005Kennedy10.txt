         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C   Today  on the floor of the United States Senate  Senator Edward M  Kennedy spoke out on the shameful bill before the Senate that would allow gun manufacturers to strip away law enforcement and gun violence victims of their right to go to court  Rather than debating the Department of Defense Authorization bill that would send support to our troops overseas and here at home  the Senate instead debated whether gun manufacturers should receive legal immunity  and therefore not be held accountable  for deaths they cause through incompetence  negligence or illegal activity  Kennedy offered an amendment to require that  if passed  this irresponsible bill would only apply to cases filed after the bill was signed into law    Senator Kennedy said  Americans want gun manufacturers and gun dealers to be held accountable for their own actions  They want gun dealers to be held responsible if they fail to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists  criminals and other prohibited purchasers  Supporters of this bill are aiding and abetting in the flow of guns to criminals    Kennedy offered his amendment in an effort to give families that have been challenge gun manufacturers in court the ability to continue fighting for justice for their slain loved ones  Worcester  Massachusetts  like hundreds across the country  has seen firsthand the tragedy gun manufacturers can cause and the loved ones left behind  Thirty three year old father of two  Danny Guzman of Worcester  Massachusetts was an innocent bystander killed by a gun that went missing from Kahr Arms  a gun manufacturer with factories in Worcester  Danny s mother has been engaged in a court battle with Kahr since Danny s death in 1999  Under the bill before the Senate today  Danny s case would be thrown out    The people of Worcester  like those across the United States  want gun manufacturers to be held accountable  Mayor Tim Murray of Worcester said  In Worcester we have seen first hand how a gun manufactures lack of proper controls and security measures of its weapons inventory has resulted in destruction and violence in our neighborhoods  There is absolutely no justification for the United States Congress to exempt such irresponsible behavior from liability    Cities  counties and states incur billions of dollars in costs each year as a result of gun violence  the costs of medical care  the cost of law enforcement  the costs of many other public services  Studies estimate that the public cost of firearm related injuries is over one million dollars per shooting victim    Now  just as the gun industry is beginning to be held accountable  the industry is striking back with this unconscionable effort to prevent injured citizens from having their day in court    Senator Kennedy s floor remarks are below     OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY  ON LEGAL IMMUNITY FOR THE GUN INDUSTRY  S 397    Here we go again  Without shame  the Republican leadership has brought back this special interest  anti law enforcement bill that strips away the rights of victims to go to court     Why the urgency to take up this bill right now  This is a critical moment for the country s future  The war in Iraq brought new dangers  imposed new costs  and more and more American lives are being lost each week  The recent bombings in London remind us that terrorism can shatter the calm of an otherwise ordinary morning in any community in America and our cities our at serious risk     The Senate is about to begin work on the confirmation of the next Justice of the Supreme Court  We owe it to the country to approach this process with serious deliberation because the President s nominee will have a vital role in setting the direction of the country for generations to come     The country is waiting for Congress to finish the energy bill  That conference has been held up because the oil companies want their own liability protection from groundwater contamination suits  What other special interest bills will take priority over our nation s interests     The list of other major issues that demand the Senate s immediate attention is long  Last week  the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out a bill to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act with unanimous support  Through lengthy negotiations  we produced a bipartisan compromise that strikes the right balance between national security and civil liberties  The President has asked Congress to finish the bill and get it to his desk  But  instead  the Republican leadership insists on taking time to debate a bill that provides flagrant protection for the gun industry     Let s not forget the other issues at hand  The nation s pension system is a mess  Without construction funds  our schools are literally falling apart  Health care and prescription drug costs are on the rise  Federal budget deficits continue to grow  Over the last four years  the well being of most American families has declined at an alarming rate     Surely  the Republican leadership can take some time to address these priorities before attempting to give a free pass to the gun industry  Surely  Congress can do more for our citizens than rush to pass unprecedented special interest legislation  We can and should be acting to meet the real challenges we face     Make no mistake    the National Rifle Association clearly has the top priority in the Senate Republican agenda  This is not just about the immunity bill on the floor today  If this bill passes  it will open the floodgates for the NRA s priorities  Its past efforts have systematically weakened federal gun laws over the past two decades  Unbelievably  the gun industry and the tobacco industry are the only two consumer industries that are not subject to federal consumer safety regulation     Last year    the federal government recalled a water pistol    the Super Soaker    just a few days before the assault weapons ban expired  America does more today to regulate the safety of toy guns than real guns   and it s a national disgrace  The gun industry has worked hard to avoid federal consumer safety regulation  Where are our priorities  Where is the logic in passing a bill that makes it harder to sue for harm caused by a real gun than harm caused by a plastic toy gun     The industry has conspicuously failed to use technology to make guns safer  It has attempted to insulate itself from its distributors and dealers  once guns leave the factory  Under this bill  it won t even matter if the guns are stolen by factory employees and sneaked out of the factory in the middle of the night     The gun industry wants to become the only industry in the nation exempt from lawsuits  The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that gun dealers and gun manufacturers should be held accountable for their irresponsible conduct  like everyone else    Cities  counties  and states incur billions of dollars in costs each year as a result of gun violence   the costs of medical care  the costs of law enforcement  the costs of many other public services  Studies estimate that the public cost of firearm related injuries is over one million dollars for each shooting victim  Yet  this bill would take a fierce toll and dismiss even pending cases where communities are trying to get relief  The supporters of this bill do not want to give these towns their day in court    Too often  citizen lawsuits   including lawsuits brought as class actions   are the only means for the American people to hold industries accountable  In recent years  citizens have been succeeding in getting their day in court against the gun industry  Individuals  organizations  and municipalities are making progress in the effort to hold the industry liable for its failure to include reasonable safety measures in the guns they sell     Now  just as the industry is beginning to be held accountable  it is striking back with this unacceptable effort to prevent injured citizens from obtaining their day in court  Under this bill  even all pending cases would be dismissed    regardless of the merits of any lawsuit    The bill s proponents claim they want to eliminate junk lawsuits  But  the real effect of this bill would be to prevent victims of gun violence from pursuing even obviously valid claims in state or federal courts    This bill would bar the legal rights of hard working law enforcement officers  such as Ken McGuire and David Lemongello  These two police officers from Orange  New Jersey were seriously wounded in a shoot out with a burglary suspect  The gun used by the suspect was one of twelve guns sold by a West Virginia pawnshop to an obvious straw purchaser for an illegal gun trafficker  Fortunately for the officers  this bill did not become law last year    and their case was able to proceed     Recently  David Lemongello was able to obtain a  1 million settlement  Significantly  the settlement required the dealer and other area pawnshops to adopt safer practices  This precedent will make our communities safer and put real hurdles in front of gun traffickers trying to beat the system  These reforms go beyond the requirements of current law and are not imposed by any manufacturers or distributors  This is not about money  This is about public safety  and I commend these brave officers for their courageous battle to change the system     If the NRA had succeeded in passing this bill last year  the families of the victims of the D C  snipers would also have been thrown out of court  Fortunately  this case was also able to proceed  These families sued Bushmaster  the manufacturer of the assault rifle used in the shooting  and the Bull s Eye Shooter Supply Store which sold the gun  The families wanted to hold the defendants accountable for their failure to use reasonable care in distributing the weapon and maintaining its inventory  In addition to the snipers  assault rifle  the dealer had lost more than 237 other guns  Last year  the families won a  2 5 million settlement  As part of the settlement  Bushmaster also agreed to inform its dealers of safer sales practices that will prevent other criminals from obtaining guns   something Bushmaster had never done before  Like Officers Lemongello and McGuire  these survivors of gun violence have done more to improve the safety of our streets than this Congress is willing to do  They achieved these remarkable accomplishments because they were able to have their day in court    It is clear what will happen if Congress gives the gun industry this unprecedented legal immunity  on top of its existing exemption from federal consumer safety regulations  Guns will be more dangerous  Gun dealers will be more irresponsible  More guns will be available to terrorists and criminals  There will be more shootings  and more dead children    America has a massive gun problem  The crisis is especially serious for children  In 1997  the most recent year for which figures are available  firearms killed no children in Japan  19 in Great Britain  109 in France  153 in Canada  and 5 285 children in the United States  For every child in the United States killed with a gun  four more are wounded  The overall rate of firearm related deaths for American children is nearly twelve times greater than in twenty five other industrial countries    The nation s response to this death toll has been unacceptable  Yet year after year  little changes in our approach to regulating guns  How can we possible justify this neglect  How can we continue to ignore this vast discrepancy in gun deaths in the United States compared to other nations  How can we possibly justify this effort to give the gun industry even greater protection for irresponsible behavior    Law enforcement officers are strongly opposed to any bill that gives the gun industry special legal immunity  The International Brotherhood of Police Officers  the National Black Police Association  the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association  the National Latino Peace Officers Association and the Major Cities Chiefs Association  representing the largest the nation s largest police departments  all oppose this bill  They know this legislation will strip away the legal rights of victims of gun violence  including law enforcement officers and their families  to seek redress against irresponsible gun dealers and manufacturers     Proponents of this bill argue that it is needed to stop victims from bankrupting the firearms industry  Give us a break  Smith  Wesson just filed a statement with the SEC last month  stating that we expect net product sales for fiscal 2005 to be approximately  124 million  a 5  increase over the  117 9 million reported for fiscal 2004  Firearms sales for fiscal 2005 are expected to increase by approximately 11  over fiscal 2004 levels  Another gun manufacturer Sturm  Ruger  reported to the SEC earlier in the year that  It is not probable and is unlikely that litigation  including punitive damage claims  will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company  The claims that the industry is facing an economic crisis are grossly unfounded    I urge my colleagues to break the stranglehold of the gun industry and gun dealers on Congress  and oppose this shameful legislation   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
