         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                I regret that the Committee is now moving forward on legislation    when we continue to tip toe around a serious investigation of the Administrations massive electronic surveillance program being conducted by the National Security Agency  Only four Members of the Judiciary Committee sit on the Intelligence Committee  Perhaps they know more  but the rest of us are legislating in the dark    When it comes to national security  our country is far stronger when all of us stand united  Across party lines  we all agree on the need for law enforcement and intelligence officers to have strong powers to investigate terrorism  to prevent future attacks  and improve information sharing between federal  state and local law enforcement  Cooperation between the Administration and Congress is fundamental to our national security  and we should all come together to meet our obligations to protect the safety and security of the United States    There is a way to fight terrorism within the framework of the Constitution  Thirty years ago  when the Cold War still threatened us  a Republican Administration and a Democratic Congress worked together to enact the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  giving broad authority to the government in cases involving national security    Then  as now  the debate was driven by public disclosures of widespread surveillance by the National Security Agency  Then  as now  there was discussion over the proper scope of the Presidents authority    But then  unlike now  the President decided to work with Congress to obtain clear authority for a wiretapping program  Since the enactment of that law in 1978  the rules have been clear  The conference report states plainly that Congress was setting forth a standard for all future Presidents to follow  It established the exclusive means by which  such surveillance could be conducted on U S  soil    The laws purpose has always been clear  to put an end to unsupervised wiretapping under the blanket claim of national security  The Act was also intended to ensure that the Executive Branch  under any President  would not ignore basic civil liberties of the American people by claiming an unchecked inherent power to eavesdrop on conversations on U S  soil    The Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress after September 11th did not authorize domestic electronic surveillance  and certainly did not authorize domestic electronic surveillance of American citizens without a judicially approved warrant  Congress has never authorized and never approved domestic electronic surveillance of United States citizens without a warrant    Like the Intelligence Committee  the Judiciary Committee has its own important oversight role  When we began drafting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1976  both Committees held hearings and we had ongoing discussions with the Administration  and the legislation enacted in 1978 has been a success by any standard   For the past 26 years  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has provided the exclusive means for domestic surveillance by the Administration  Yet the Chairmans bill would repeal the existing statutory scheme  and give the President an unprecedented blank check  The White House is thumbing its nose at the role of Congress  and ignoring the recent clear rebukes by the Supreme Court    Section 8 of this proposal states categorically that  Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the constitutional authority of the President to collect intelligence with respect to foreign powers and agents of foreign powers  This section has only one purpose  to codify the breathtakingly broad and erroneous view of executive power asserted by the Bush Administration and rejected by the Supreme Court  The bill that we have is labeled Discussion Draft  but the Chairman has already announced that the White House does not want any discussion  much less any changes to this so called compromise   This sham proposal allows the President alone to decide whether he will permit a court to review the legality of his electronic surveillance activities  For the first time  these sweeping programs of domestic surveillance would be subject to court review only if the President agrees voluntarily to have a court conduct such a review  The bill also allows the President to authorize entire programs of surveillance  not just applications for individual warrants    The American Bar Association minces no words  It calls this White House bill an enormous and unwarranted departure from existing law  It ignores the requirements of the Fourth Amendment  which require probable cause and individualized suspicion before the government can monitor communications  It even allows the government to transfer any case challenging the legality of its surveillance program to the secret FISA court  where the government can then seek dismissal of the case for any reason  Under this proposal  the President can go to a court that permits only government lawyers to appear before it  and obtain a secret    blanket    endorsement of his surveillance program    Its obvious our Congressional oversight so far hasnt been effective in guaranteeing that the constitutional checks and balances on executive power are working  All weve received are after the fact legal rationalizations for the program  If the Committee stops having hearings and stops carrying out its investigative and oversight functions  then we are abandoning our own oath to protect and defend the Constitution  Instead of fulfilling our long standing role as a constitutional watch dog  we become a presidential lap dog   Americans deserve national security laws that protect both our security and our constitutional rights  The 9 11 Commissioners got it right  Our goal should be to adopt governmental powers that genuinely enhance our national security while maintaining adequate oversight over their use  If our current national security laws are inadequate  the Administration should work with both Republicans and Democrats Members in Congress to update our laws with due regard for our Constitution  treaties  and the laws of war  The Bush Administration  however  is asking us not only to write legislation  it wants us to override the constitutional checks and balances that are at the core of our democracy  and we should not yield to that arrogant request   The Administration has made blunder after blunder in waging the war on terrorism  Congress should not aid and abet them in committing another one     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
