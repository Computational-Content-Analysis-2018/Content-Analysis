         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner     202  224 2633    As Prepared for Delivery    We re all deeply affected by the tragedy wrought by Hurricane Katrina  But we re also moved by the generosity of millions of Americans who opened their pocketbooks  their communities  their schools  and even their homes to their fellow citizens in need    Americans are united in their determination to restore the lives of those who lost so much in this disaster  And they deserve a response from their national government that is as caring and as generous as the American spirit    The devastation and human upheaval caused by Hurricane Katrina is of an order of magnitude that exceeds any natural disaster this nation has witnessed    We need a place where everyone comes together at a common table to plan  set priorities  cut through the red tape  and bring about the revival of our treasured city of New Orleans  of Biloxi  of Gulfport  of Pascagoula    of the entire region of the Gulf Coast affected by this disaster  The national government  governors  mayors  communities  and affected citizens should all come together to meet the common challenge of rebuilding the Gulf Coast    FEMA cannot perform this function  It must respond to an average of 30 disasters every year  It cannot provide the kind of leadership and exclusive focus that the people of the Gulf Coast deserve    Also  the Department of Homeland Security must look after our security nation wide  It  too  must perform many functions  and cannot focus adequately on this task    I believe we should consider creating a Gulf Coast Reconstruction Authority to fulfill this function  to focus its full energies on the challenge of rebuilding the Gulf  And we should provide it with ample resources to meet the challenge     It should be led by an eminent American with cabinet rank who has the trust of the American people and can get things done    Its members should be governors  local officials  and community leaders  so that all voices and perspectives are represented in the decision making     It should coordinate planning and provide funding to rebuild the region     It should bring the nation s best engineers  scientists  and experts together to aid in the task    It should hire the people of the region to put them back to work to rebuild their own communities  just as we did with the Tennessee Valley Authority and other bodies    This is what we should do  And we should be prepared to take the responsible course to provide the resources that are really needed to restore the life of this region  We must be prepared to provide tens of billions of dollars to meet this challenge    maybe even  150 billion or more    First and foremost  this is about rebuilding lives and communities  It s about restoring the dignity of honest people who have worked hard to raise strong families and contribute to their communities    and now have lost everything  It s about carrying for the American spirit of progress  even in the face of difficult odds     But we must recognize that rebuilding the Gulf Coast is a national necessity     60 percent of our nation s oil and gas comes through the ports in the Gulf    70 percent of our soybeans and 62 percent of our corn are exported through New Orleans and Mobile    As one expert describes it  The Mississippi River is the aorta of the American economy  and New Orleans is the access point to it    It is a source of American pride in the culture and art that this unique region contributes to our nation and our world    So  we must rebuild  and we must not hesitate to act in large ways to meet this massive challenge  It cannot be business as usual in responding to this extraordinary disaster    Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
