         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  the war in Iraq is the most important issue of our time  The American people know that our soldiers are serving nobly under extraordinarily difficult circumstances  and that far too many of them are making the ultimate sacrifice for our country  Citizens are calling on us  begging us  to address this issue with the seriousness and urgency it deserves  The House of Representatives will vote later today on a major resolution supporting our troops and opposing the escalation of the war  It will be an historic vote and a clear response to the American peoples clarion call for change  The Senate will have a chance to do so soon as well  The voices of the American people are growing louder  and louder  and the need for us to act could not be clearer  Under the Presidents current policy  the war continues to impose an enormous human toll on our soldiers  their families  and their loved ones  Our men and women in uniform have served with great courage and honor for nearly four years    longer than it took to win World War II  More than 3000 of our forces have been killed  and more than 23 000 have been wounded  The casualties keep mounting  Last fall was the deadliest period since the war began  287 American soldiers were killed in October  November  and December  Already 118 have been killed since the President announced the surge  and the number keeps rising The toll in Massachusetts has been heavy  Just last week  Captain Jennifer Harris of Swampscott was killed when her helicopter went down north of Baghdad  She was the first woman from our state to make the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq  and our hearts and prayers go out to her family and loved ones  So far  65 Massachusetts members of our forces have given the last full measure of devotion to our country  The youngest was 19  The oldest was 46  They died far from their homes in Bedford and Bristol  Lawrence and Lowell  Plymouth and Pittsfield  Weymouth and Woburn  and other towns and cities across the state  They were fathers  sons  a daughter  brothers  and friends  Each of them represents a life cut short in service to our country More than 3 000 families across America share in such heartbreak  Their loved ones have died in Iraq  and we mourn their loss  We honor their service  and we pray that Gods grace and mercy may ease the anguish of those they have left behind  Citizens of Massachusetts have answered their countrys call from the very first days of the Republic  and those we honor today are members of that noble company  Each knew they were going into harm s way  They faced dangers in Iraq that vast numbers of our troops had never seen before such as suicide bombers and improvised explosive devices We mourn the loss of these heroes  We honor their sacrifice  and extend our deepest condolences to their families  Words cannot ease the grief of losing a loved one  but I hope that the families may find comfort in the words of Abraham Lincoln in the famous letter he sent to a bereaved mother during the Civil War Dear Madam  he wrote I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming  But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save  I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement  and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and the lost  and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom The consequences of the decisions we make here in Congress profoundly affect our military  their families  and the communities they have left  We have an obligation to our soldiers to make sensible decisions that will not place them needlessly in harms way  We in Massachusetts feel especially deeply the loss of the 65 soldiers who have died in Iraq Sergeant Justin W  GarveyPrivate
