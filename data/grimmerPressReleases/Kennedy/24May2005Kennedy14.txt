         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Yesterday was a day that will live in American history       Our grandchildren and their grandchildren will discuss what happened yesterday  They will do so with much more insight than we can today  because they will know what the results of yesterday s agreements actually turn out to be    I hope that history will judge us well as an institution  We came close to having a vote that threatened the essence of the Senate and of our government  It risked destruction of the checks and balances among the branches that the framers so carefully constructed  It risked destruction of the independence of the judiciary  It risked an accumulation of power in the President that might have turned back the clock toward the days when we were subjects instead of citizens    We have avoided that confrontation  and have done so within the traditions of the Senate  discussion  debate  negotiation  compromise  Moderation and reason have prevailed  As in any compromise  some of us on each side are very unhappy with specific aspects of the result  But the essence is clear  a majority of this body does not want to break its rules and traditions  and those rules and traditions will be preserved    This body s self regulating mechanisms will continue to be a moderating influence not only within the body but also on the other House and the other Branches     Once again the Senate has reminded the Chief Executive that we are not merely the occupants of a beautiful building at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue  We taught George Washington that lesson when we rejected one of his Supreme Court nominations  We taught Thomas Jefferson that lesson when we refused to convict an impeached Justice whose opinions Jefferson did not like  We taught Franklin Roosevelt that lesson when he tried to pack the Supreme Court  We taught Richard Nixon that lesson when he sent us an even worse nominee after we defeated his first nominee for a Supreme Court position    As even the Republicans in the Agreement Group said  this agreement should persuade the President to take more seriously the advice portion of advice and consent  If the President understands the message and takes it to heart  his nominees will be better off  the courts will be better off  and the nation will be better off    Our principal goal was to preserve the ability of the Senate to protect the independence of the federal courts including the Supreme Court  and we have succeeded in doing so  And we have sent a strong message to the President that  if he wants to get his judicial nominees confirmed  his selections must have broad support from the American people    And as a result of this agreement  we can hope that no Senator will ever again pretend that the Constitution commands a final vote on every executive nominee  for it has not ever done so  and does not do so now    We can hope that no one will again pretend that there has never been a filibuster of a judicial nominee  when they can look across the Senate floor at three Democratic Senators who witnessed the Republican filibuster against Justice Fortas  and at Republican Senators who participated in other judicial filibusters    We can hope that no one will again pretend that it is possible to break the fundamental Senate rule on ending a filibuster  without shattering the basic bonds of trust that make this institution the world s greatest deliberative body    I believe that history will judge that we have not failed those who created America two centuries ago by what we have done here  We have fought off those who would have destroyed this institution and its vital role in our government for shameful partisan advantage      By rejecting the nuclear option the Senate has lived up to its responsibility as a separate and equal branch of government    But I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  the agreement does not change the serious objections to the nominations that have been debated in the past days  Those of us who care about the judiciary  who respect mainstream values  and who reject the notion that judgeships are spoils to be awarded to political fringe groups  will continue to oppose the nominations of Priscilla Owen  Janice Rogers Brown  and William Pryor  because they would roll back rights and freedoms important to the American people    Now that these nominees are slated to get a vote on the floor  I hope that courageous and reasonable Republicans will show their independence from the White House and thoroughly examine the records of each of them  If they do  I hope they will agree that these nominees should not be given life time appointments to the nation s courts  where they would wield enormous power over the lives of all Americans     Those of us who opposed the nomination of Priscilla Owen have done so with good cause  because her record makes clear that she puts her own ideology above laws that protect the American people    Priscilla Owen has written opinions to limit the rights of minors in medical malpractice cases  She has tried to cut back on people s right to relief when insurance company claims are unreasonably denied  even in cases of bad faith  Her frequent dissents show a pattern of limiting remedies for workers  consumers  and victims of discrimination or personal injury    Some of her supporters state that several Texas newspapers endorsed Justice Owen when she ran for a spot on the Texas Supreme Court  But they never mention that many of these same home state newspapers changed their view after seeing how she ruled on that court and now oppose her nomination    The Houston Chronicle wrote that her record shows less interest in impartially interpreting the law than in pushing an agenda  and that she too often contorts rulings to conform to her particular conservative outlook     The Austin American Statesman wrote that Priscilla Owen is so conservative  she places herself outside of the broad mainstream of jurisprudence  and that she seems all too willing to bend the law to fit her views     The San Antonio Express News said she always voted with a small court minority that consistently tries to bypass the law as written by the Legislature    She dissented in a case interpreting a key Texas civil rights law that protects against discrimination based on age  race  gender  religion  ethnic background  and disability  Justice Owen s opinion would have required employees to prove discrimination was the only reason for the actions taken against them    even though the law clearly states that workers need only prove that discrimination was one of the motivating factors  Justice Owen s view would have changed the plain meaning of the law to make it almost impossible for victims of discrimination to prevail in civil rights cases  It s precisely this tendency to write new requirements into the law that makes her unfit to serve on the federal courts    She also joined an opinion that would have reversed a jury award to a woman whose insurance company had denied her claim for coverage of heart surgery bills     She dissented in a case involving three women who sought relief for intentional infliction of emotional distress on the job because of constant humiliating and abusive behavior by their supervisor  The supervisor harassed and intimidated employees by the daily use of profanity  by screaming and cursing at employees  by charging at employees and physically threatening them  and by humiliating employees  including making an employee stand in front of him in his office for as long as thirty minutes while he stared at her     Eight Justices on the Texas Court agreed that the actions  viewed as a whole  were extreme and outrageous enough to justify the jury s verdict of intentional infliction of emotional distress  Justice Owen wrote a separate opinion  stating that while she agreed that there was evidence to support the women s case  she thought most of it was legally insufficient to support the verdict    Some have said that those who raise questions about Justice Owen s record are somehow criticizing her personally  That s untrue and unfair  Each of us has a responsibility to review her record and to take seriously the problems we find  That means taking seriously the rights of persons like Ralf Toennies  who was fired at age 55  and found that Justice Owen s wanted to impose obstacles to his age discrimination claim that were nowhere in the statute  We must take seriously the rights of the women employees criticized by Justice Owen for their testimony on workplace harassment  We can t ignore the rights of the millions of families who live in the Fifth Circuit states of Texas  Louisiana  and Mississippi     I urge my colleagues to reject the nomination of Priscilla Owen to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit    This week  the American people are saying loud and clear that they are tired of the misplaced priorities and abuse of power of the right wing  They are saying it with this agreement on judges  They are saying it on stem cell research  They are saying it in rejecting the President s efforts to privatize Social Security and cut your benefits     But more broadly  they are saying it s high time to get on with the issues that affect their families and their lives and open the doors of opportunity ever wider    the high cost of health care and education  protecting their jobs  securing their neighborhoods  cleaning their water and their air    The real question this week is this  Are the President and the Republican leadership in Congress listening  Will we see the White House and Congress reject the grip of the right wing and finally focus on what really matters to the American people   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
