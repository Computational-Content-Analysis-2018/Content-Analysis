         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC  Today  a bipartisan group of fourteen Senators  led by Senators Kennedy and Specter  introduced a bill to overturn the Supreme Courts recent 5 4 decision in Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire  Rubber Company  which undermined the basic protection against pay discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964   The decision also undermines pay discrimination claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act  The bill would restore the clear intent of Congress that workers must have a reasonable time to file a pay discrimination claim after they become victims of discriminatory compensation  The bills co sponsors are Senators Kennedy  Specter  Harkin  Snowe  Clinton  Mikulski  Obama  Durbin  Dodd  Leahy   McCaskill  Whitehouse  Boxer  Stabenow  Murray and Reed  Its unacceptable that some victims of ongoing pay discrimination are unable to hold their employers accountable  Senator Kennedy said  Yet thats what happened to Lilly Ledbetter  I hope that all of us  on both sides of the aisle  can join in correcting this obvious wrong    The supporters of this bill believe that no American should be denied equal pay for equal work  Employees ability to provide for their children  save for retirement  and enjoy the benefit of their labor should not be limited by discrimination  The Courts decision undermined these bedrock principles by imposing unrealistically short time limits on such claims    The House Committee on Education and Labor recently passed the bills House counterpart  and it the bill is ready for floor action in the House Below is a summary of the bill   A PDF copy of it is available upon request   The Fair Pay Restoration ActThe Fair Pay Restoration Act would clarify that the laws against pay discrimination apply to every paycheck or other compensation a worker receives   The bills protection would extend to pay discrimination based on race  national origin  gender  religious  age or disability The bill overturns Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire  Rubber Co   a divided Supreme Court held that workers must sue for pay discrimination within 180 days after the original pay setting decision  no matter how long the unfair pay continues   Under the case  it doesnt matter if the discrimination is still ongoing today  and the worker initially had no way of knowing that others were being paid more for the same work  So workers receiving an unfairly low wage today could still be out of time to hold the company accountable if they did not discover the discrimination soon after it first began  The Fair Pay Restoration Act will  Restores a fair  reasonable time limit for filing pay discrimination claims   The bill would start the clock for filing pay discrimination claims when compensation is received  rather than when the employer decides to discriminate  Each discriminatory paycheck would restart the clock for filing a pay discrimination claim   As long as workers file their claims within 180 days of a discriminatory paycheck  their charges will be considered timely  Retains a fair limit on the amount employers owe   Under the Kennedy bill  employers would not have to make up for salary differences that occurred decades ago  Current law limits back pay in job discrimination cases to two years before the worker filed a discrimination claim   The bill would not change this two year limit on back pay   Restores Congressional intent   The bill mirrors language prohibiting discriminatory seniority systems  which was included in the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1991  The 1991 Act was signed by the first President Bush in 1991 with broad bipartisan support  passing the House 381 38 and the Senate 93 to 5        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
