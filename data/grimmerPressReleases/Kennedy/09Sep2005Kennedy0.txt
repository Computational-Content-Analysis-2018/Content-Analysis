of you  for being here today as we gather together to share ideas as to how we can best assist those affected by Hurricane Katrina    a tragedy of biblical proportions  Each of you brings your own sense of compassion to this conversation and I look forward to your thoughtful recommendations  Many of you  and the organizations you represent  have rolled up your sleeves to help those most in need along the Gulf Coast     America is wounded  America is hurting  and America is in need of new hope      Floods took over our cities and communities  families were torn apart and the poor were abandoned       We witnessed a natural disaster turned into a national catastrophe by a failed and inadequate response      Physical needs are beginning to be met  The military is rescuing survivors  families are receiving  2 000 to buy food and clothing  and Congress passed  51 billion in immediate aid to help our fellow Americans     Obviously  there is much  much more to be done  But perhaps most important is to renew the spirit of hope  We need to lift up all Americans in this time of crisis     The powerful winds of this storm have torn away that mask that has hidden from our debates the many Americans who are left out and left behind  When we rebuild the land ravaged by the winds and the floods  we must rebuild it to be a more just and fair land  There is no room for injustice in America     As we rebuild the Gulf Coast  we must also come together to tackle these disparities  We must be a united America    one nation  under God  with liberty and justice for all  And when we say all  we mean all     To address this challenge  our government must respond in ways that are as good and compassionate as the American people  We can t just fix the hole in the roof  We need to rebuild the whole foundation    Bruce Gordon  president of the NAACP  was there and I imagine he saw first hand the images of despair among those who were abandoned in a nation of great wealth    and of hope reborn in the faces of families reunited after surviving a calamity of Biblical proportions  Along with the despair  we have seen great heroism too  not only in the spectacular images of rescues by helicopter  but in the quiet courage of neighbors who helped neighbors survive the howling winds and rising waters     This is a national responsibility  The tragedy affects us all  not only in our hearts  but it affects the national economy and our national security    We ve put forth proposals to ensure that students don t miss a school year  survivors received much needed health care  and families receive economic assistance during this time of great tragedy     I believe that we need to look beyond the immediate response and put in place an agenda that lifts those communities and neighborhoods into a place of equality and prosperity  We need a Gulf Coast Regional Redevelopment Authority to focus our full energies on the challenge of rebuilding the Gulf and ensuring new and continued economic prosperity for all that live there  We should invest at least  150 billion in its actions to work with governors and mayors and citizens and communities to plan  help fund  and coordinate for the reconstruction of that damaged region  It should be led by an eminent American with cabinet rank who has the trust of the American people and can get things done  And it should help hire workers to put people back to work rebuilding their own communities and help them get back on their feet again    Some would think it enough to return the survivors to the lives they knew before the flooding   but we should aim higher  For many of the survivors  the life they knew before the storm was one of ill health  inadequate education  and opportunity denied  The nation had failed them long before Katrina hit    Our promise to those who have survived the hurricane should not simply be to turn back the clock a month or two    it should be to fulfill the true promise of the American Dream by committing ourselves to better health  better education and better job opportunities for them  and for all Americans    Earlier this week I was reminded about the story of Moses  who fiercely protected his people in battle  But then he became weary  When this happened  his brother and brother in law  Aaron and Hur  stepped in and held up his tired arms      To the Gulf Coast region  we need to be like Aaron and Hur and hold up Moses  tired arms in battle     Thank you for meeting here today   I look forward to your thoughts           GULF COAST REGIONAL REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY   We need to look beyond the immediate response and put in place an agenda that lifts communities and neighborhoods into a place of equality and prosperity  We need a Gulf Coast Regional Redevelopment Authority to focus our full energies on the challenge of rebuilding the Gulf and ensuring new and continued economic prosperity for all that live there  We should invest at least  150 billion in its actions to work with governors and mayors and citizens and communities to plan  help fund  and coordinate for the reconstruction of that damaged region  It should be led by an eminent American with cabinet rank who has the trust of the American people and can get things done  And it should help hire workers to put people back to work rebuilding their own communities and help them get back on their feet again  Components of Senator Kennedy s Gulf Coast Regional Redevelopment Authority     To coordinate planning and provide funding for redeveloping infrastructure in Louisiana  Mississippi and Alabama   Modeled after the Tennessee Valley Authority  Cabinet Rank  so that it has real authority  Led by an eminent  non partisan person  Coordinates with governors  mayor  communities  and local citizens  Brings on board the best economists  planners  and experts in the nation  Hires thousands of people displace by the disaster to help rebuild their own communities   Today the TVA employs 13 00 people on  8 billion budget  In 1942  at its peak  employed 28 000     150 Billion budget KENNEDY S FLOOR SPEECH ON THE CREATION OF GULF COAST REGIONAL RECONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY  As Prepared for Delivery     We re all deeply affected by the tragedy wrought by Hurricane Katrina  But we re also moved by the generosity of millions of Americans who opened their pocketbooks  their communities  their schools  and even their homes to their fellow citizens in need    Americans are united in their determination to restore the lives of those who lost so much in this disaster  And they deserve a response from their national government that is as caring and as generous as the American spirit    The devastation and human upheaval caused by Hurricane Katrina is of an order of magnitude that exceeds any natural disaster this nation has witnessed    We need a place where everyone comes together at a common table to plan  set priorities  cut through the red tape  and bring about the revival of our treasured city of New Orleans  of Biloxi  of Gulfport  of Pascagoula    of the entire region of the Gulf Coast affected by this disaster  The national government  governors  mayors  communities  and affected citizens should all come together to meet the common challenge of rebuilding the Gulf Coast    FEMA cannot perform this function  It must respond to an average of 30 disasters every year  It cannot provide the kind of leadership and exclusive focus that the people of the Gulf Coast deserve    Also  the Department of Homeland Security must look after our security nation wide  It  too  must perform many functions  and cannot focus adequately on this task    I believe we should consider creating a Gulf Coast Reconstruction Authority to fulfill this function  to focus its full energies on the challenge of rebuilding the Gulf  And we should provide it with ample resources to meet the challenge    It should be led by an eminent American with cabinet rank who has the trust of the American people and can get things done    Its members should be governors  local officials  and community leaders  so that all voices and perspectives are represented in the decision making                It should coordinate planning and provide funding to rebuild the region                It should bring the nation s best engineers  scientists  and experts together to aid in the task    It should hire the people of the region to put them back to work to rebuild their own communities  just as we did with the Tennessee Valley Authority and other bodies    This is what we should do  And we should be prepared to take the responsible course to provide the resources that are really needed to restore the life of this region  We must be prepared to provide tens of billions of dollars to meet this challenge    maybe even  150 billion or more    First and foremost  this is about rebuilding lives and communities  It s about restoring the dignity of honest people who have worked hard to raise strong families and contribute to their communities    and now have lost everything  It s about carrying for the American spirit of progress  even in the face of difficult odds                But we must recognize that rebuilding the Gulf Coast is a national necessity                60 percent of our nation s oil and gas comes through the ports in the Gulf    70 percent of our soybeans and 62 percent of our corn are exported through New Orleans and Mobile    As one expert describes it  The Mississippi River is the aorta of the American economy  and New Orleans is the access point to it    It is a source of American pride in the culture and art that this unique region contributes to our nation and our world    So  we must rebuild  and we must not hesitate to act in large ways to meet this massive challenge  It cannot be business as usual in responding to this extraordinary disaster            SUMMARY OF SENATOR KENNEDY S RECOMMENDATIONS    Labor  Pensions  Disaster Unemployment Assistance  Legislation is needed to correct flaws in the DUA program that keep it from helping as many disaster victims as it should  In addition  the Department of Labor should suspend regulations that impose barriers to people receiving DUA     Pensions and IRAs  There is a provision in the Enzi Kennedy pension reform bill that gives the Secretaries of Labor and Treasury and the PBGC authority to postpone filing and payment deadlines for pension plans affected by Katrina  The rules for 401 k  plans should be relaxed for Katrina victims to allow them to withdraw money  and allow loans from IRAs for living expenses and home rebuilding    Education  Funding for school districts near the disaster zone  Grants should be provided to communities that have accepted refugees to help them cope with an upsurge in new students      Assistance to students  Students from the areas affected by Katrina should receive deferments on their need to repay student loans and or financial assistance in transferring to another institute of higher education if needed      Flexibility in administering programs  Income requirements should be waived for access to Head Start in the affected areas  HHS should grant flexibility under CCDBG on child care subsidy payments  NCLB requirements should similarly be applied flexibly in affected areas      Funds for rebuilding  Communities affected by Katrina should receive funding for rebuilding their education and healthcare infrastructure     Health  Disease surveillance and control  Funding should be provided for measures to control epidemics in the affected areas  In the long term  the health of refugees should be studied and care should be provided if exposure to toxic chemicals from flood water increases refugees  risk of chronic illnesses  Diseases will spread quickly in cramped refugee camps  Temporary housing needs to be built immediately not only to prevent infectious diseases but to restore hope     Mental health  Funding is needed to deal with the mental health consequences of the disaster  Legislation to support children s mental health should be strengthened and reauthorized and the overall provision of mental health services to victims of the storm should be federally facilitated      Disabilities  Allow flexible use of funds under the Developmental Disabilities Act to help support people with disabilities and their families at the local level who are victims of the storm     Eligibility for care   Refugees should receive 100  Medicaid reimbursement       De politicizing decision making  CDC and FEMA should be able to directly request support and funding without having to clear decisions through the political bureaucracies at HHS and DHS  respectively        TODAY S PARTICIPANTS   Senator Edward M  Kennedy Senator Stabenow Senator Mark Pryor  Senator Joseph Lieberman  Rep  Grace Napolitano Bruce Gordon  NAACP  Rep  Raul
