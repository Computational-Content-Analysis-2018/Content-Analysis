         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Senator Edward Kennedy and Senator John McCain addressed the U S  Chamber of Commerce Foundation today to discuss their bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill  Because of its common sense approach to fixing our broken immigration system  the McCain Kennedy legislation has received strong and diverse support  from business and labor  from Republicans and Democrats  and across the country     The U S  Chamber of Commerce is one of the bill s strongest backers  touting its realistic approach of strengthening border protection and enforcement  harnessing the economic benefits of a reformed immigration system  while also reflecting our best values as a nation    of fairness  equal opportunity  and respect for the law  Thomas Donohue  President and CEO of the Chamber expressed his enthusiasm for the legislation and shared what the Chamber is doing across the country to support the bill     Americans want and deserve realistic solutions to the urgent immigration problems we face  They want secure borders  which require fair and effective immigration laws that can actually be enforced  that protect our security  strengthen our economy  respect our ideals  and honor our heritage as a nation of immigrants  said Senator Kennedy  Because our bill offers these practical solutions  business and labor  conservatives and liberals  have joined forces with faith based groups and immigrant organizations to support the McCain Kennedy plan  With their help  we will pass this urgent legislation  Each day that goes by without reform is another missed opportunity in terms of strengthening our economy and protecting our borders     The U S  Chamber of Commerce is one of over 60 groups that have endorsed the bill  Over 60 favorable editorials have been written from papers across the country  Below is a summary of the bill  Senator Kennedy s remarks  and a list of endorsements    McCain Kennedy Kolbe Flake Gutierrez Bill at a Glance 5 12 2005   Title I  Border Security  Requires the development of various plans and reports evaluating information sharing  international and federal state local coordination  technology  anti smuggling  and other border security initiatives  Establishes a Border Security Advisory Committee made up of various stakeholders in the border region to provide recommendations to the Department of Homeland Security regarding border enforcement  Encourages the development of multilateral partnerships to establish a North American security perimeter and improve border security south of Mexico   Title II  State Criminal Alien Assistance  Reauthorizes the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program that provides reimbursement to state and local governments for incarcerating undocumented aliens convicted of crimes  Allows for funding to pay for additional criminal justice costs associated with undocumented immigrants charged or convicted of crimes   Title III  Essential Worker Visa Program  Creates a new temporary visa to allow foreign workers to enter and fill available jobs that require few or no skills  the H 5A visa   Applicants must show that they have a job waiting in the U S   pay a fee of  500 in addition to application fees  and clear all security  medical  and other checks  Requires updating of America s Job Bank to make sure job opportunities are seen first by American workers  Initial cap on H 5A visas is set at 400 000  but the annual limit will be gradually adjusted up or down based on demand in subsequent years  Visa is valid for three years  and can be renewed one time for a total of 6 years  at the end of the visa period the worker either has to return home or be in the pipeline for a green card  Visa is portable  but if the worker loses his job he has to find another one within 60 days or return home  Ensures that employers hiring temporary workers abide by Federal  state and local labor  employment and tax laws  Prohibits the hiring of temporary workers as independent contractors  Protects temporary workers from abuse by foreign labor contractors or employers   Gives temporary workers and U S  workers remedies for violations of their rights  An employer can sponsor the H 5A visa holder for a green card  or after accumulating four years of work in H 5A status  the worker can apply to adjust status on his her own  Sets up a task force to evaluate the H 5A program and recommend improvements   Title IV  Enforcement  Creates a new electronic work authorization system that will ultimately replace

reduce the pressure to immigrate to the U S   Encourages the U S  government to partner with Mexico on health care access so that the U S  is not unfairly impacted with the costs of administering health care to Mexican nationals   Title VI  Family Unity and Backlog Reduction  Immediate relatives of U S  citizens are not counted against the 480 000 annual cap on family sponsored green cards  thereby providing additional visas to the family preference categories  The current per country limit on green cards is raised slightly to clear up backlogs  Income requirements for sponsoring a family member for a green card are changed from 125  of the federal poverty guidelines to 100   and other obstacles are removed to ensure fairness  The employment based categories are revised to provide additional visas for employers who need to hire permanent workers  and the annual cap is raised from 140 000 to 290 000  Immigrant visas lost due to processing delays are recaptured for future allotments    Title VII  Adjustment of Status for H 5B Non Immigrants  Undocumented immigrants in the U S  on date of introduction can register for a temporary visa  H 5B   valid for six years

the dissemination of information related to the provisions of this legislation  Includes anti discrimination protections that cover all workers  including H 5A and H 5B visa holders   Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy National Chamber Foundation Conference Comprehensive Immigration Reform  Fixing a Broken System    As Prepared for Delivery  October 18  2005   There is no question that the immigration system needs to be fixed  We need to mend this broken system now  and with your help  we have the best opportunity in years to do so  Americans want and deserve realistic solutions to the acute immigration problems we face  They want secure borders  which require fair and effective immigration laws that can actually be enforced  that protect our security  strengthen our economy  respect our ideals  and honor our heritage as a nation of immigrants    This is not a Republican versus Democrat  conservative versus liberal  business versus labor debate  A recent poll of Republican voters found that eighty four percent of them believe it s impossible to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented workers and their families who are here today  These voters soundly reject the enforcement only approach    78  support an enforcement plus solution combining stricter border security  higher penalties for employers  registration for temporary workers  and a path to eventual citizenship for undocumented workers  I m sure Democratic voters feel the same way    Business and labor  conservatives and liberals  have joined forces with faith based groups and immigrant organizations to support the bill that Senator John McCain and I have introduced  and the AgJOBS bill that Senator Craig and I have introduced  What we need are immigration measures that offer practical solutions to deal with the difficult problems we face     National security and economic vitality are too important to pass half way measures that may look and sound tough but offer no real solutions and protections  Yet that is exactly what we ll end up with if Congress deals with border security and enforcement alone and fails to reform other major parts of our immigration laws     We need real solutions  not feel good empty gestures  To repair what s broken  we need to combine increased enforcement and greater legality  Better border control and better treatment of immigrants are not inconsistent  and both are necessary for success  Effective reform must address these issues together     We ve tried enforcement alone in the past and it s failed  In the past 10 years  the federal government has spent more than  20 billion to triple the number of border patrol agents  build fences  and adopt other border enforcement measures  Yet  none of our efforts have been adequate  Illegal immigration continues to thrive     Americans understand that the only realistic way for us to know who is here and who is coming here is to combine strict enforcement with realistic reforms in admissions  The best way to help all workers is to eliminate the culture of illegality that undermines the wages and working conditions of all workers  They recognize that we can be both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws     Today  many sectors of our economy rely heavily on the hard work and contributions of immigrants  Their work is indispensable to the continued growth of the American economy  and our dependence on immigrants will be even greater in years to come  As the education of U S  workers continues to rise and as older workers retire  the number of U S  workers in lower skilled jobs will continue to decline     Immigrant workers care for our children and our elderly parents  They harvest crops for our farmers  They help to build and clean America s homes and office buildings     But millions of these workers are here illegally  They live in the shadows  in constant fear of deportation  and are easy targets for exploitation by unscrupulous employers  Inevitably  they are afraid to stand up for their rights or bargain with employers  They accept substandard wages and shameful working conditions    which in turn makes it even harder for American workers to thrive     Our bill has clear goals    to bring immigrants out of the shadows  shut down the black markets  and restore the rule of law at our borders  in our workplaces  and in our communities  By providing an adequate flow of legal temporary workers and by implementing strict  new workplace enforcement provisions  our bill will greatly reduce the current unfair competition  Temporary workers with full portability and newly legalized immigrants will have the freedoms enjoyed by U S  workers  such as bargaining for wages and benefits  making life better for them and for U S  workers as well     Proposals that require undocumented workers to return home won t work  We know what will happen  They won t come out of the shadows  or sign up for temporary worker programs  They ve spent years in this country  working hard  paying taxes  raising their children  and contributing to our communities  Requiring them to leave is unrealistic as policy  impractical to carry out  and unacceptable to the many businesses that rely heavily on their labor     Our plan offers a realistic alternative    not an amnesty  There is no free pass  no automatic pardon  no trip to the front of the line  But we do provide a sensible plan to encourage people to come forward to receive work permits and earn legal status  They will have to pay a substantial fine and go through rigorous security and criminal background checks  Those who want permanent status must pay all their back taxes  learn English  maintain a strong work record  stay out of trouble  and wait their turn     The repair we provide combines increased enforcement and increased legality  Better border control and better treatment of immigrants are not inconsistent    they are two sides of the same coin  and I m optimistic that Congress will agree    I greatly appreciate your support of the bills we ve introduced  and I look forward to working with you to pass these responsible and long overdue reforms in our
