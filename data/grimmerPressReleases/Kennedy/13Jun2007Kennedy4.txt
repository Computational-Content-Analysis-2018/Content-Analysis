RECEPTION As prepared for delivery Welcome to the Senate  Were grateful that so many of you could join us to honor the students with us today and celebrate the continuing success of the Cultural Bridges Youth Exchange and Study program  Senator Lugar and I are very proud of the Cultural Bridges Program  Were pleased to welcome Miller Crouch  the Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs of the State Department  who has done an extraordinary job of making the program the great success it is today  I also commend Jeff Watson  the President of AYUSA International and its consortium partners  Their work with students  families  schools and communities is indispensable  This public private partnership is an example of America at its best  and crucially important to building understanding between the United States and the Muslim world  Since 2003 almost two thousand students from Africa  the Middle East and Asia have had the opportunity to learn what life is like in the United States  This year alone  674 students from 25 countries have been visiting America  Theyve lived with families in 45 states and Washington  DC  This is the final week of their scholarship  and I am honored to welcome so many of them to the Senate As youve been exploring Washington this week  youve seen crowds of American students your age doing the same thing   walking along the Mall  visiting the Capitol  Congress  and the White House  The monuments and museums you see are inspiring reminders of American history and of the ideals upon which this America was founded Many visitors from your home countries come to Washington every year and see many of the places you have this week  But very few of your countrymen and women have had the chance to see American life up close  in cities and towns across the country  Fewer still have had the opportunity to live with American families and study in American schools  Much of the world only knows America from television or movies or what they see on the news  You know us better  through your own eyes and your own experiences and I hope they were positive experiences  Senator Lugar and I are great believers in this program  We believe that the people of the Islamic world and the people of the United States need to do more to understand each other and work together  so that all our peoples can live in peace  But we need your help  This year  youve been more than students  Youve also been teachers  sharing with your American families and friends your perspectives on your homes  your families  and your countries  Within a few days  all of you will be returning to your homes  Im sure youll all be glad to see your parents  your brothers and sisters  after so long an absence  When you get home  I hope youll continue to be teachers  to share with your families and friends what youve learned about the United States  I hope youll be bridge builders and work to create trust and understanding among our countries and cultures  If you do that  with the same dedication and determination that you brought to America  Im confident youll succeed Remember  always  that you have friends here in Washington and across the United States  Cultural Bridges Fact SheetThe Cultural Bridges program was established by Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Senator Richard G  Lugar  R IN
