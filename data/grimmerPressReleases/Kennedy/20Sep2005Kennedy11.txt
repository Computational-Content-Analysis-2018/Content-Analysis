September 20  2005   The Honorable Thad Cochran    The Honorable Robert C  Byrd Chairman       Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations     Committee on Appropriations United States Senate      United States Senate Washington  DC  20510     Washington  DC 20510   Dear Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Byrd    Hurricane Katrina upset the lives of millions  displacing families from their homes and inflicting severe economic damage  Without question  the people of the Gulf region deserve our support  and we stand ready to help  As the Appropriations Committee considers an urgently needed comprehensive supplemental appropriations bill to address Hurricane Katrina s devastation as well as its economic and energy impacts on the nation  we urge you to include  1 276 billion in emergency Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  funds  With this additional funding  the LIHEAP program will be able to provide the same level of purchasing power as last year  This funding is critical to avoid a looming  but preventable  crisis for millions of additional Americans caused by the soaring cost and diminishing affordability of home heating fuel as winter approaches    The effects of Hurricane Katrina are being felt by Americans outside of the Gulf Region as gasoline  heating oil  and natural gas prices rise in the wake of this disaster  Indeed  there is an imminent emergency confronting millions of low income Americans unable to afford the cost of rising energy prices  The current skyrocketing in energy prices coupled with energy debt remaining from last winter and this summer are leading to increased disconnections and arrears among consumers as the winter heating season begins    threatening the well being of low income families and seniors  This situation warrants the provision of emergency LIHEAP funding in the comprehensive supplemental request    Prior to Hurricane Katrina s devastation in the Gulf region  Americans were facing record prices for oil  natural gas  and propane  Hurricane Katrina damaged platforms and ports and curtailed production at refineries in the Gulf of Mexico  the source of almost a third of U S  oil output  Crude oil for October delivery stands at over  66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  Heating oil prices increased dramatically after Hurricane Katrina  Prices averaged  1 70 per gallon in July  but now stand over  2 per gallon  Before Hurricane Katrina struck  the Energy Information Administration  EIA  predicted a 16 percent increase in heating oil costs  This increase comes on top of the 34 percent increase during the 2003 2004 winter  Natural gas prices also rose dramatically after Hurricane Katrina  and now stand over  12  more than 140 percent increase compared to last year at this time  EIA s Short term Energy Outlook reports  The ranges for expected heating fuel expenditure increases this winter are 69 percent to 77 percent for natural gas in the Midwest  17 percent to 18 percent for electricity in the South  29 percent to 33 percent for heating oil in the Northeast  and 39 percent to 43 percent for propane in the Midwest  Heating costs for the average family using heating oil are projected to hit  1 666 during the upcoming winter  This represents an increase of  403 over last winter s prices and  714 over the winter heating season of 2003 04  For families using natural gas  prices are projected to hit  1 568  representing an increase of  611 over last year s prices and     643 over 2003 04  States need additional funding immediately to help low income families and seniors to ensure they can afford to heat their homes  States are bracing for potentially crisis conditions caused by the lack of affordable heating sources  particularly for seniors and the disabled     Almost daily  newspapers are reporting on the impacts of higher energy costs for consumers  Hurricane Katrina s impact on energy markets comes on top of soaring energy prices over the past several years  Utilities from New England to Florida to Oregon are seeking rate increases  In addition to rising energy prices  the economic devastation in the Gulf region is likely to impact the national economy  Many more Americans will need LIHEAP assistance than the 5 million households that received aid during FY 2005  State LIHEAP programs are expecting a major increase in applications due to the rapid increase in home energy prices and this additional funding will allow them to address the need for assistance    Residents and business affected by Hurricane Katrina deserve the nation s full support and financial assistance  and we stand ready and willing to do everything we can to help  We recognize that the Committee is still working to assess the needs wrought by Hurricane Katrina and will face difficult priorities in determining emergency funding  We feel that preventing hardship for millions of Americans by acting to provide LIHEAP emergency funds before we have another crisis on our hands is an important priority  Thank you for your serious consideration of our request         Sincerely    Susan M  Collins       Jack Reed    Jeff Bingaman       Joseph R
