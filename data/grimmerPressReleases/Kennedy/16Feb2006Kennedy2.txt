         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy delivered opening remarks at the Center for American Progress  panel discussion on raising the minimum wage  Kennedy has fought for decades on behalf of America s minimum wage workers and leads the effort in the Senate to raise it  Yet  time and time again the Republican controlled has blocked those efforts  caving to corruption and special interests  After years of federal inaction  states across the country have recognized that those who work hard to make a living shouldn t be gripped by poverty     Raising the minimum wage is a profoundly moral issue  Senator Kennedy said  it is wrong that hard working men and women cannot afford to put food on the table or heat their homes  It is wrong to give billions upon billions of dollars in tax relief to the wealthy  but turn your backs on the hard working families who live in poverty each day  and the 14 million children who go to bed hungry each night    Congress received their seventh pay increase in nine years  while there has not been a single pay increase to our lowest paid workers  Since January of 2004  eleven states have raised their minimum wage either legislatively or through a ballot initiative  In all  17 states and the District of Columbia now have minimum wages above the federal rate of  5 15    Below are Senator Kennedy s remarks and fact sheets on minimum wage  Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy Center for American Progress Minimum Wage Event  As Prepared for Delivery    The wages that we pay our workers make a profound statement about who we are as a nation  The American Dream is about working hard to build a better life for your family  In the wealthiest country on the face of the earth  no one that works hard for a living should have to live in poverty     So raising the minimum wage is a profoundly moral issue  It is wrong that hard working men and women cannot afford to put food on the table or heat their homes  It is wrong to give billions upon billions of dollars in tax relief to the wealthy  but turn your backs on the hard working families who live in poverty each day  and the 14 million children who go to bed hungry each night     Americans understand fairness  and that is not fair   Americans understand right and wrong  and that is wrong    The people understand what this Republican Congress does not    that a fair increase in the minimum wage is long overdue  Minimum wage workers are men and women of dignity  They take care of young children in day care centers  They care for elderly parents at nursing homes and assisted living facilities  They check out groceries in the supermarket and clean our office buildings     These Americans work as hard as anyone else    and often harder  But the minimum wage they receive doesn t cover their bills  A minimum wage employee who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  will make about  10 700 a year  For a family of three  that s almost  6 000 below the poverty line     In this era of skyrocketing costs  these hardworking Americans are forced to make impossible choices between paying the rent or buying food  between paying the heating bill or paying the doctor  Today  minimum wage workers can t afford adequate health care  and can t afford adequate housing for their families anywhere in the country     While these courageous Americans struggle to get by  Congress lacks the courage to stand up to the special interests and increase the minimum wage  The nine years since it was last increased is the longest period without a raise since the minimum wage was enacted in 1938     We ve tried time and again in recent years to pass an increase  Our Fair Minimum Wage Act will raise it to  7 25 an hour in three steps over the next two years  It will directly raise the pay of seven and a half million workers  and indirectly benefit eight million more     Raising the minimum wage isn t just a fairness issue    it s also a women s issue  because more than 60 percent of the workers who will benefit are women  It s a children s issue  because more than half of these women have children  It s a civil rights issue  because African Americans and Hispanic Americans are far more likely to work in low paying jobs     What raising the minimum wage shouldn t be is a partisan issue      We have raised the minimum wage eight times since it was enacted in the 1930s  including three increases under Republican Presidents  It s certainly not a partisan issue for the American people  At the state level  we ve had minimum wage victories in red states and blue states alike     Indeed  eighteen states and the District of Columbia have responded to our inexcusable inaction at the federal level by raising their minimum wages at the state level  But  there are still millions of hardworking Americans across the country who have had no increase  That s why the fight in Congress is so important     Americans are paying a high cost for the Republican culture of corruption in Washington    the worst corruption since Watergate  The Republican leadership continues to serve special interests and ignore the priorities that matter most to working Americans  There is no better example of those distorted priorities that our failure to raise the federal minimum wage     The Republican leadership is out of touch on this issue  They are caving in to industry lobbyists and special interests  and ignoring what s best for working Americans  When we give the people a chance  they always vote for fairness  It s time for us in Congress to do the same  and vote to raise the minimum wage    RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS     The Fair Minimum Wage Act would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps        5 85 60 days after enactment     6 55 one year later     7 25 one year after that     The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office  37 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s  An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem       Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year   5 900 below the federal poverty guidelines of  16 600 for a family of three  Since Congress last acted to raise the minimum wage in 1996  its real value has eroded by 18 percent      Every day the minimum wage is not increased it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind  Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase       Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  3 00 below what it was in 1968  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  8 50 an hour today  not  5 15       Over seven million workers will directly benefit from the minimum wage increase        Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 370 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families  It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy      More than one year of groceries    Over 9 months of rent     A year and a half of heat and electricity  or   Full tuition for a community college degree      This year  the Senate raised its pay by  3 100  It is shameful that Members of Congress received our seventh pay increase in nine years  yet in those same nine years  we have not provided a single pay increase to the lowest paid workers       The salaries of lawmakers have gone up by  31 600 since 1997  while minimum wage workers continue to earn just  10 700 a year      History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation  In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades  Nearly 11 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 232 000 per month  In contrast  in the last four years the minimum wage has held steady  but only 4 0 million jobs have been created      A fair increase is long overdue  Congress should act as quickly as possible to pass a minimum wage increase that reflects the losses suffered as the result of our shameful inaction in the past  No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty    MINIMUM WAGE STATE BALLOT INITIATIVES   States with measures already on the ballot for 2006      Nevada  Although in 2004 Nevada passed a ballot initiative by 68  to
