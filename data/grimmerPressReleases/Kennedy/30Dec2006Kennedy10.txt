         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today the Washington Post published Senator Edward M  Kennedys op ed on the critical need for the United States to take the lead in regard to Iraqi refugees  Below is Senator Kennedys op ed  We Can t Ignore Iraq s Refugees Edward M  Kennedy Link  http   www washingtonpost com wp dyn content article 2006 12 29 AR2006122901066 html With the nation still at war in Iraq  each of us is deeply grateful to the brave men and women in our armed forces who celebrated the holidays this year with half their hearts at home and half in Iraq  But this year especially it is essential that we also reflect on another human cost of the war    the hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi men  women and children who have fled their homes and often their country to escape the violence of a nation increasingly at war with itself  The refugees are witnesses to the cruelty that stains our age  and they cannot be overlooked  America bears heavy responsibility for their plight  We have a clear obligation to stop ignoring it and help chart a sensible course to ease the refugee crisis  Time is not on our side  We must act quickly and effectively  Today  within Iraq  1 6 million people have already fled or been expelled from their homes  An additional 1 8 million  fleeing sectarian violence  kidnappings  extortion  death threats and carnage  have sought refuge in neighboring countries  At least 700 000 are in Jordan  600 000 in Syria  100 000 in Egypt  54 000 in Iran and 20 000 in Lebanon  Typically they are not living in refugee camps but have relocated in urban areas  where they must draw on their own meager resources to pay for food and shelter  and must depend on the good graces of the host governments  The neighboring countries  in turn  are under enormous financial stress from the rapidly increasing needs of the refugees  In Jordan  they now make up more than 10 percent of the population    the equivalent of 30 million people flooding America s shores  These countries are increasingly unable to meet the refugees  basic needs  Borders are being closed to more and more of these men  women and children  with the result that many who are most in need or in danger are trapped in the Iraqi caldron of violence  As it continues to boil  the humanitarian crisis will only worsen  The recent report of the Iraq Study Group rightly concluded that if this refugee situation is not addressed  Iraq and the region could be further destabilized  and the humanitarian suffering could be severe  Sadly  as with so many other aspects of the Iraq war    from the growing threat of the insurgency to the need to provide adequate armor for our troops    the administration has failed to recognize the breadth of the crisis and to adjust our policy to address the plain facts on the ground  There is an overwhelming need for temporary relief and permanent resettlement  Last year  however  America accepted only 202 Iraqi refugees  and next year we plan to accept approximately the same number  We and other nations of the world need to do far better  Thousands of these refugees are fleeing because they have been affiliated in some way with the United States  Cooks  drivers and translators have been called traitors for cooperating with the United States  They know all too well that the fate of those who work with U S  civilians or military forces can be sudden death  Yet  beyond a congressionally mandated program that accepts 50 Iraqi translators from Iraq and Afghanistan each year  the administration has done nothing to resettle brave Iraqis who provided assistance in some way to our military  This lack of conscience is fundamentally unfair  We need to do much more to help Iraqi refugees  especially those who have helped our troops  Our nation is spending  8 billion a month to wage the war in Iraq  Yet to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of the refugees who have fled the war  the State Department plans to spend only  20 million in the current fiscal year  America needs to lead  but we cannot adequately respond to this overwhelming crisis alone  Because of the magnitude of the problem  we also need action by Iraq s neighbors and the rest of the world  An essential first step could be to hold an international conference on the issue    ideally sponsored by the countries in the region and the United Nations    to begin to deal with the growing number and needs of Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons  The United States should participate in the conference and provide substantial support for the refugees  Doing so would encourage other nations to address the crisis  help the refugees and displaced persons  and assist the countries shouldering the greatest burden  Working with Iraq s neighbors and the United Nations  we can encourage rapid action to relieve suffering and save lives  And a productive conference could lead in turn to broader discussions and greater progress on the future of Iraq  Clearly  in the long term we need to work together to find a way to end the violence and stop the hemorrhaging of lives  In the short term  America needs to respond far more effectively to the needs of the millions of refugees and displaced persons who are suffering so much from the war  Failure to act quickly and cooperatively with other nations will only result in more carnage  chaos and instability in the region        Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
