         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  he unethical practices of executives at Enron  Global Crossing  Tyco  and WorldCom have undermined the financial security of tens of thousands of hard working men and women and shattered the trust of millions of other Americans  Now  with this greedy  dishonest  and irresponsible handling of a billion dollars in retirement and other funds  the executives of Capital Consultants have joined that shameful list Capital Consultants  record of mismanagement and lies is appalling  The company operated a private investment portfolio of risky loans that were inadequately underwritten and poorly documented  It charged clients excessive fees  As long ago as 1995  the Department of Labor ordered the firm to repay  2 million in fees that it overcharged a pension trust in Oregon  Yet Capital Consultants continued to pull the wool over the eyes of its clients with a sophisticated scam  When one of its biggest debtors went bankrupt  Capital Consultants began a complex ponzi scheme rather than disclosing the truth to its clients  The fraud involved placing the resources of employees  pension funds and health care funds into shell companies that passed the money back to Capital Consultants  Clients who asked questions were lied to and deceived  and the devious practices continued until 2000 This Congress has ushered in new tax cuts for the wealthy  and has passed a bankruptcy bill that caters to the credit card industry and a class action reform measure that shields corporate defendants  when the obvious need is for reform that will restore trust in our financial markets We know that employees across the country are still overinvested in company stock  And we need to deal with kickbacks and conflicts of interest by investment managers and financial services companies that oversee people s hard earned pensions  We need to ensure that cases like Capital Consultants do not happen again I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses and to working with my colleagues in Congress to curb the abuses that have left far too many hard working Americans without the financial security which they worked so hard for and rightly deserve   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
