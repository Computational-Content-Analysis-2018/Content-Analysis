         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     BOSTON  MA  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Mayor Thomas M  Menino today touted efforts to bring relief to families and individuals faced with the skyrocketing costs of home heating energy  Senator Kennedy and Mayor Menino discussed home heating with residents of Boston at the Curtis Hall Community Center in Jamaica Plain     According to a report released by the Department of Energy  DOE  Energy Information Agency this morning on average  households heating primarily with natural gas are expected to spend about  350  48 percent  more this winter in fuel expenditures  Households heating primarily with heating oil can expect to pay  on average   378  32 percent  more this winter  Thirty seven percent of New England homeowners rely on natural gas to heat their homes  Senator Kennedy said  We shouldn t have to wait for a crisis until there is action by this Administration  President Bush has put the wrong priorities first time and time again  Instead of working to lower high heating bills for low income Americans he increased profits for his oil executive friends  The American people should be put first  The impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita strained already tight oil and natural gas markets     Senator Kennedy discussed his efforts in the U S  Senate to push for  3 1 billion in federal funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  during this time of increased financial strain on people who need to heat their homes this winter  We know that America can do better and that Congress needs to stand up for the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet  LIHEAP provides a critical service to desperate families who have nowhere else to turn for basic energy help  and LIHEAP is indispensable in filling that need  said Senator Kennedy     Mayor Menino discussed his Heat Works program that provides home heating system repair and replacement services to low income senior homeowners     With winter fast approaching  the soaring cost of fuel is a major concern for both renters and homeowners  The elderly and people of low income are especially at risk of being unable to pay for heat  I m proud that  once again  the City is doing its part by offering assistance through the Heat Works program  Mayor Thomas M  Menino said  I want to thank Senator Kennedy for joining me here today  A dedicated public servant  Senator Kennedy has spent his career fighting on behalf of the poor and working families    At the federal level  last week Senator Kennedy and Senator Kerry introduced an amendment to increase emergency funds for LIHEAP through the Department of Defense appropriations bill  The Republican leadership in Congress blocked this legislation with a procedural vote  but Senator Kennedy will push to include it in the upcoming Katrina supplemental appropriations bill     Statement by Senator Edward M  Kennedy  on the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program October 12  2005    It s an honor to be here today with Mayor Menino at the Curtis Hall Community Center    With temperatures dropping  there are few more important duties than keeping our citizens safe and warm for the winter  Rising fuel prices give added urgency to our efforts to lend a hand to those who can t afford their heating bills     Mayor Menino is a leader in making sure our citizens are not left in the cold  The mayor s Heat Works program begun last year has been a lifesaver for so many seniors in our city with broken heating systems     The Energy Information Administration is expected to release a report later today illustrating the soaring home heating costs  37 percent of New England homes heat with natural gas and their bills are expected to increase by 50 percent this winter  Heating oil prices are also expected to increase  The forecast for a cold winter and high fuel costs means that the elderly  the disabled  and many others will be forced to make painful choices between heating their homes and paying for food  healthcare  and rent    unless we act and act now  Instead of working to lower high heating bills for low income Americans President Bush has increased profits for his oil executive friends  America can do better    That s why I m joining the mayor not only in supporting his program  but also in fighting for additional federal low income heating assistance for Massachusetts    The LIHEAP program has not been given the resources to meet today s responsibilities  In fact  its funding level is almost the same today as when it was created in 1981  while heating oil prices have gone up 265 percent over that period    In Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves 130 000 householdsincluding 15 000 households in Boston  This is only 22 percent of the eligible recipients  And applications for fuel assistance have been increasing  8 000 of the 12 000 fuel assistance applications sent out have already been returnedthat s 1 500 more than this time last year    With current funding  even those receiving LIHEAP funds won t receive enough money to last the entire winter    Here in Massachusetts  one 71 year old woman lives alone and keeps her thermostat set at 60 degrees to save money  She hopes the federal government will come through with more LIHEAP money before she runs out of ways to pay her heating bill  She says  I turn down the thermostat as low as I can and sometimes I turn it off and put on extra sweaters  I don t know how much longer I can keep doing this    In addition  many families in Massachusetts will struggle just to get their heat turned back on for the winter because they still owe money from last winter s bills     There s a single mother who lives with her baby daughter  She is a nurse  but lost her job last August and has been working temporary jobs ever since  Her salary doesn t cover her bills  and her electricity has been cut off  She worries about how she ll pay off her bill before the winter    While people are suffering  Republicans in Congress are trying to cut the LIHEAP program  Their plan would mean a 70 percent cut for Boston  If they get their way  more than 10 000 of the 15 000 LIHEAP families in Boston will lose their federal heating assistance    Earlier this week  President Bush s energy secretary was asked about LIHEAP funding  He replied  At least at this point in time  that s not on the agenda    We re here today to say it may not be on their agenda  but it s on ours  That s why Senator Kerry and I are fighting so hard not only to block the cuts  but to increase LIHEAP funding  Our amendment didn t quite make it into law when we offered it last week  but we ll be back and back and back until the people of Massachusetts are fully protected this winter     The needs of the poor must not be ignored  Until every senior citizen has a warm place to come home to every day  and every child has a warm bed to sleep in every night  our job is not done   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner
