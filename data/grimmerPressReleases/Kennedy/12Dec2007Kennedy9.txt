         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  Senators Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   and Orrin Hatch  R Utah  celebrated the Senate approval late last night of a bill to reauthorize the Traumatic Brain Injury Act  This legislation expands the Public Health Services Act and provides individuals with traumatic brain injury  TBI  assistance in returning to work  finding a place to live  accessing needed supports and services  and obtaining appropriate rehabilitation services  The legislation now goes to the House of Representatives      Approximately 1 5 million people in the United States suffer traumatic brain injuries every year  with 40 000 of those occurring in Massachusetts and 8 400 in Utah  This legislation is crucial to providing the care and opportunities needed by the most deserving groups  our children and soldiers     Senator Kennedy said  Brain injuries have become the signature wound of the war in Iraq  Up to two thirds of our wounded soldiers may have suffered such injuries  Here at home  an unacceptably large number of children from birth to age 14 experience traumatic brain injuries approximately 475 000 a year  and some of the most frequent of these injuries are to children under the age of five  Today  we have taken a step toward ensuring that these citizens and their families will receive the best care we can provide      Victims of falls  auto accidents  assaults  and even many veterans suffer from traumatic brain injuries  Hatch said  We need to help these people  so I appreciate the Senates action on this bill and look forward to seeing it finally enacted  If TBI patients dont receive proper care  the financial and emotional costs can become overwhelming  to the individual  the family  and society   Summary of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act Reauthorization  What is TBI   Traumatic brain injury  TBI  is a blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that causes damage to the brain  Common causes include falls and car crashes  Every year  of the 1 5 million people in the United   States who sustain a TBI  50 000 die  235 000 are hospitalized  and approximately 80 000 to 90 000 will become disabled   Who would this bill primarily help    Soldiers  This bill will provide assistance to the millions of children and adults in our nation who are facing an array of problems because of their traumatic brain injury  The programs authorized under this bill can help the thousands of soldiers wounded in the war  As of December  2007    30 327 service members have been wounded in Iraq brain injuries are approximately two thirds of the injuries suffered in the war    Children  There is an extremely high incidence of Traumatic Brain Injuries among children between the birth and age 14  approximately 475 000 a year  and some of the highest numbers of injuries are among children under the age of five    What would the bill do   The Act expands the Public Health Services Act with respect to traumatic brain injury  Reauthorization of the TBI Act is crucial to continue federal funding for a range of traumatic brain injury programs  The bill will reauthorize grants that have been assisting States  Territories  and the District   of Columbia in building or enhancing coordinated systems of community based services and supports for children and adults with traumatic brain injuries  It will extend the ability to apply for these grants to American Indian Consortia   In addition  when Congress first authorized the Traumatic Brain Injury Act as part of the Childrens Health Act of 2000 it had the foresight to include funding for the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury program  This program has played a crucial role because individuals with traumatic brain injury have an array of advocacy needs including assistance with returning to work  finding a place to live  accessing needed supports and services such as attendant care and assistive technology  and obtaining appropriate rehabilitation services    Often these individuals are forced to remain in extremely expensive institutional settings far longer than necessary because the community based supports and services they need are not available  Effective protection and advocacy services for people with traumatic brain injury can lead both to reduced government expenditures and increased productivity  independence and community integration  However  the advocate must possess specialized skills and the work is often time intensive    The reauthorization   It extends the authorization of such sums as may be necessary for the CDC research  public education  and state registry programs  NIH research  and HRSA programs through 2011    It establishes several new studies  including a study through the CDC and NIH to determine the incidence and prevalence of traumatic brain injury  identify common therapeutic interventions  and develop rehabilitation guidelines    It also establishes a CDC NIH study in collaboration with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to identify the best methods of coordinating prevalence data  in order to ensure that national research takes into account the incidence of brain injuries among our nations veterans and that current information about diagnostic tools and treatments are shared    It establishes a GAO study to determine the extent to which soldiers who have acquired a brain injury are being reintegrated into their communities  and examines the extent to which their care is coordinated and appropriate employment  housing  rehabilitation  and other services are being obtained   It amends the HRSA demonstration projection program such that American Indian consortia can apply for funding  that the projects are redefined to improve access to rehabilitation  and the grants are limited to 3 years    It requires the Administrator of HRSA and the ADA Commissioner to coordinate data collection regarding protection and advocacy  It stipulates that  in any year where  6 million is appropriated for the HRSA protection and advocacy services program  2  is used for a grant providing for training and technical assistance to protection and advocacy systems        Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
