         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                            Gracias   Thank you for that warm introduction      Buenos dias amigos   Bienvenidos a todos    And thank you to Esperanza USA for your vision and leadership on so many issues of concern to our communities  The video we just saw of your HIV AIDS initiative is just one example of the difference you are making in lives across America  and were deeply grateful to you for carrying forward Christs mission here on earth  Thank you  too  Reverend Cortes  for your leadership and your voice across our great land    We all know the inspiring story of the ancient Israelites who braved a dangerous journey through the desert to seek freedom and opportunity in a new and sacred land  They endured hardship not just for themselves  but for their children and for future generations  so they might enjoy fuller lives  God was with them every step of the way and blessed them in the Promised Land    So today  in another place and in another time  we are witnessing another great migration  And I commend President Bush for his leadership in guiding the nation toward responsible solutions to this challenge     It is our moral duty in this debate to ensure our security  but also to reflect our humanity   That is our calling      We should keep out those who would harm us  but welcome those who will contribute to America    We must protect our communities and our nation with laws that are just and fair  But we must also provide a path for honest  hardworking people to emerge from the shadows and earn the privilege of American citizenship    I believe that the United States Senate just passed legislation that meets this high test  Democrats and Republicans put differences aside and came together for the common good to pass common sense reforms  I was proud to join with John McCain  Ken Salazar  Lindsey Graham  Dick Durbin  Mel Martinez  and so many other Senators who made this possible    Senator Reid has been an outstanding leader on this issue  And with help from him and Senator Frist  we rejected the view that undocumented immigrants are criminals  We rejected the view that the Good Samaritans who lend them a helping hand are felons  We rejected that view that walls and fences add up to an immigration policy    Above all else  America is a nation of hope and reconciliation  not fear and division  We remember the words of our Lord that we are to feed the hungry and clothe the poor  But Christ reminded us in the same breath that we are to welcome the stranger as well     We have made progress  but our struggle is far from over  The voices of fear and division still echo strongly through this debate  But you  like Isaiah  are the prophets for our time  anointed to preach good news to the poor  bind hearts that are broken  proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners    You know todays immigrants by name  They sit in your pews  They pray in your churches  They participate in the life of your communities  Todos son hijos de Dios  They are all Gods children    Now more than ever  we need to lift up the voices of faith to ensure that our immigration laws and policies honor our heritage of hope as a nation of immigrants  All of us can work together to restore hope and dignity   We remember the words of the poet Jose Marti  that remind us that we can each make a difference in this debate    Todo es hermoso y constante  Todo es musica y razon  Y todo  como el diamante  Antes que luz es carbon   All is beautiful and constant  All is music and reason  And all  like the diamond  Before it is light is coal    We are taught in the Sermon on the Mount that we are the light of the world  And as our light shines today  we can transform the coal of this debate into diamonds that can make a difference for generations to come    Thank you for your leadership   Thank for all that you do so well   And thank you for having me here today    Gracias   Gracias   Gracias           Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
