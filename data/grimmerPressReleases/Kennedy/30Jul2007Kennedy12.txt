         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Many of the best ideas in public policy are the simplest  The Childrens Health Insurance Program is based on one simple and powerful idea  that all children deserve a healthy start in life  and that no parents should have to worry about whether they can afford to take their child to the doctor when the child is sick  CHIP can make the difference between a child starting life burdened with disease  or a child who is healthy and ready to learn and grow The enactment of Medicaid in 1965 brought decent health care to families living in poverty  including children  But it became clearer and clearer as the years and the decades passed  that more and more children were unable to obtain health care because they lived in families whose incomes were too high tot qualify for Medicaid but too low to afford health insurance Finally  in Massachusetts  in the 1990s we agreed that health care coverage for children is a necessity and that action needed to be taken  John McDonough  Executive Director of Health Care for All in Massachusetts  deserves much of the credit for what came next  His pioneering work while he was in the Massachusetts Legislature on childrens health care led to the passage in 1993 of the states Childrens Medical Security Plan  which guaranteed quality health care to children in families ineligible for Medicaid and unable to afford health insurance  A year later  Massachusetts expanded eligibility for Medicaid  and financed the expansion through a tobacco tax  the same approach we used successfully a few years later for CHIP and the same approach that is proposed in the bill before us now Rhode Island and other states took similar action  and helped create a nationwide demand for action by Congress to address the unmet needs of vast numbers of children for good health care In 1997  Congress acted on that call  and the result was CHIP  Senator Hatch and I worked together thenas we have this yearto focus on guaranteeing health care to children who need it  Now  in every state in America and in Puerto Rico  CHIP covers the services that give children a healthier start in life  well child care  vaccinations  doctor visits  emergency services  and many others  In its first year 1997  CHIP enrolled nearly a million children  and enrollment has grown ever since  An average of 4 million are now covered each month  and 6 million are enrolled each year As a result  in the past decade  the percentage of uninsured children has dropped from almost 23 percent in 1997 to 14 percent today  That reduction is significant  but its obviously far from enough CHIP improves the overall quality of life for children fortunate enough to have its coverage  by allowing them to get the care they need when they need it  Theyre more likely to have a real doctor and a real place to obtain care  and  their parents dont delay seeking care when their child needs it  Children on CHIP also have significantly more access to preventive care Studies also show that CHIP helps to improve childrens school performance  When children are receiving the health care they need  they do better academically  emotionally  physically and socially  CHIP helps create children who will be better prepared to contribute to America And CHIP all but eliminates the distressing racial and ethnic health disparities for the minority children who disproportionately depend on it for their coverage CHIPs success is even more impressive and important when we realize that more and more adults are losing their own insurance coverage  because employers reduce it or drop it entirely  Thats why organizations representing children  or the health care professionals who serve them  agree that preserving and strengthening CHIP is essential to childrens health  The American Academy of Pediatrics  First Focus  the American Medical Association  the National Association of Childrens Hospitals and countless other organizations dedicated to children all strongly support CHIP A statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics puts it this way  Enrollment in SCHIP is associated with improved access  continuity  and quality of care  and a reduction in racial ethnic disparities  As pediatricians  we see what happens when children dont receive necessary health care services such as immunizations and well child visits  Their overall health suffers and expensive emergency room visits increase Today  we are here to dedicate ourselves to carrying on the job begun by Congress ten years ago  and to make sure that the lifeline of CHIP is strengthened and extended to many more children  Millions of children now eligible for CHIP or Medicaid are not enrolled in these programs  Of the nine million uninsured children  over two thirdsmore than 6 million  are already eligible for Medicaid or CHIP  These programs are there to help them  but these children are not receiving that help either because their parents dont know about the programs  or because of needless barriers to enrollment Think about that number9 million children in the wealthiest and most powerful nation on earth  9 million children whose only family doctor is the hospital emergency room  9 million children at risk of blighted lives and early death because of illnesses that could easily be treated if they have a regular source of medical care  9 million uninsured children in America isn t just wrongit s outrageous  and we need to change it as soon as possible We know where the Bush Administration stands  The Presidents proposal for CHIP doesnt provide whats needed to cover children who are eligible but unenrolled  In fact  the Presidents proposal is  8 billion less than whats needed simply to keep children now enrolled in CHIP from losing their current coverage 8 billion short  To make matters worse  the President has threatened to veto the Senate bill  which does the job that needs to be done if were serious about guaranteeing decent health care to children of working families across America  We can t rely on the Administration to do what is needed  We in Congress have to step up to the plate and renew our commitment to CHIP  Thats why Im supporting the CHIP bill before us  It is a genuine bipartisan compromise  and I commend Senator Baucus  Senator Grassley  Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hatch for their dedication to making sure that more of Americas children have a start at a healthy life  This bill provides coverage to 4 million children who would otherwise be uninsured  It adjusts the financing structure of CHIP so that states that are covering their children arent forced to scramble for additional funds from year to year  and  so that Congress doesnt have to pass a new band aid every year to stop the persistent bleeding under the current program  Importantly  this bill will not allow states to keep their CHIP funds if they arent doing something to actually cover children Equally important  this bill allows each state to cover children at income levels that make sense for their state The bill also supports quality improvement and better outreach and enrollment efforts for the program  Its a scandal that 6 million children today who are eligible for the program are not enrolled in it In sum  this bill moves us forward together  Republicans and Democrats alike  to guarantee the children of America the health care they need and deserve Our priority should be not merely to hold on to the gains of the past  but to see that all children have an access to decent coverage  Families with greater means should pay a fair share of the coverage  But every parent in America should have the opportunity to meet the health care needs of their children Quality health for children isn t just an interesting option or a nice idea  It s not just something we wish we could do  It s an obligation  It s something we have to do  And its something we can do today  I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure this very important legislation is enacted      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
