         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Today  Senator Kennedy  joined Senators Levin and Reid to announce that they will offer an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill to create an independent commission to investigate detainee abuses  The amendment was authored by Senators Levin  Kennedy  and Reed    Below are Senator Kennedy s remarks from the press conference today    Last Friday  I traveled to Guantanamo in the wake of serious and distressing reports of prisoner abuse  I continue to have those concerns    Congress has a duty to uncover the truth as these actions violate our values  threaten our national security  and put our own troops at risk if captured on the battlefield    The stain of torture hurts America s image around the world and makes the war on terror more difficult     After 9 11  the administration threw out well settled law and practice in favor of a new regime  one that elevated expediency over principle  one that sought to throw out the rule book without regard for consequences    The need for accountability is greatthe investigations to date have been incomplete and narrow  For example  in the most recent Pentagon investigation into the FBI s allegations of abuse at Guantanamo  we learned that not every agent with information was interviewed  How can that be  How can we say that is complete and thorough    In hearing after hearing  request after request  we have been denied the memos and documents that would explain how civilian authorities undermined years of military culture and practice  The administration refuses to tell us the whole truth about the policies that led to the shocking tales of detainee abuse    Years after it was being implemented  we discovered the infamous Bybee torture memoa Justice Department memo that defined torture so narrowly that it permitted behavior that our career military men and women found objectionable  Howard Koh  dean of the Yale Law School  called it an example of some of the worst legal reasoning he had ever seen  Yet it formed the backbone of our interrogation policy for two years until the administration was embarrassed into retracting it    We have heard testimony from the judge advocate generals that their advice on interrogation policy was overruled by civilian authorities  yet we have never been provided the documents that explain how that happened    We have asked time and time again for explanations  We have asked for the memos  But we have been rebuffed  We owe it to the American people and the world to know how the administration led us to this point  We need to know how the advice of Jay Bybee  John Yoo and other administration officials led to ignoring the collective wisdom of our career military lawyers    Last week  in the Armed Services Committee  the service JAG officers agreed that if they had been listened to  we would not be confronting front page news about detainee abuse  This commission will help insure that our military lawyers never have to make the same shocking admission again   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
