         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Last night  the Administration strongly objected to an independent inquiry into its policies and practices related to the detention of prisoners in Iraq  Guantanamo and elsewhere  and threatened to veto the defense bill if Congress requires changes to those policies  The nation was well served by the thoughtful inquiry and timely recommendations of the 9 11 Commission  We need the same light and wisdom when it comes to getting to the bottom of the prisoner abuse and our detention policies    It s appalling that this administration is so afraid of the truth that they are willing to veto the defense bill  with the pay raise for the troops  uparmored humvees to protect our people in Iraq  and  50 billion in funding for the war  all to prevent the truth from coming out  If they have done nothing wrong  and have nothing to hide  they should welcome this amendment    This Administration knows more about stonewalling than they do about accountability  Yesterday they submitted an overdue report on Iraq that fails to give the American people the facts behind our Iraq policy that they clearly deserve    It s long past time to level with the American people    on the detention of prisoners  on what s really going on in Iraq  and on what lies ahead for our troops and their families    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
