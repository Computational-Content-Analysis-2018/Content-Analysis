         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    FACT SHEET INCLUDED  Washington  D C   As President Bush visits Albuquerque  New Mexico to tout his education initiatives  Senator Kennedy  the leading Democrat on the Senate Education  Health and Labor Committee  points to his education track record and questions his credibility  Senator Kennedy gave President Bush the benefit of the doubt and worked with him on No Child Left Behind  only to have the White House break their promise to America s children by underfunding it by  40 billion Now  President Bush is pledging to strengthen our global competitiveness   a goal Senator Kennedy very much supports    yet the President s record shows consistent cuts to job training  research and development  student aid  and math and science training  For example  about 75 000 students in New Mexico s public K 12 schools live in poverty  yet President Bush s 2006 budget left behind over 26 000 disadvantaged children  denying them the Title I services they were promised and denying 14 000 children the after school services they qualify for Senator Kennedy issued the following statement and below are fact sheets on the President s record When it comes to President Bush s education initiatives  it isn t just a day late and a dollar short    its five years late and 50 billion dollars short  He has shortchanged our competitiveness  shortchanged our opportunity and shortchanged our future  Sadly  there is a huge gap between the President s words and deeds and it is harming our progress  I would give the President s education proposals a B  on ideas  but an F on follow through  an F on funding and an F on building a foundation for our future I hope that this year will be different  but the record is not reassuring  Time and again  our efforts to meet the challenges on education have been blocked by the Administration and the Republican leadership  Last year  I offered an amendment to the President s budget in the Senate that would have added over  5 billion for education  This amendment would have increased the Pell grant to  4500  increased funding for 57 000 math and science teachers in high poverty schools  and increased funding for job training programs and other education priorities  This passed with bipartisan support  but in Conference  the Administration and the Republican leadership dropped every penny  In the budget reconciliation bill  we again secured bipartisan support in the Senate to provide  6 billion over 5 years for increases in the Pell grant  And again in a backroom deal between the Administration and Republican leadership  that funding was dropped To make this country more competitive  I agree with the President that we must increase our focus on math and science education  and I welcome his interest  But it takes more than State of the Union rhetoric to meet this challenge  and that s where he falls short time and again  In his past two budgets  he called for absurd reductions in funding for math and science education programs at the National Science Foundation  Last year he eliminated funding to support technology in the classroom  Unfortunately  his Administration continues to be the Administration of broken promises and nowhere is that truer than in education  where his No Child Left Behind Act has been starved for funds since he signed it into law in 2002 The President s fifth State of the Union Address was tacked to his fifth year in office  full of empty promises  a growing credibility gap  and a failure to acknowledge that without restoring honesty in government and ending the culture of corruption  the special interests will prevail over those of the American people President Bush  Broken Promises on Education Leave Americans Under prepared for the Global ChallengeOur ability to compete depends on improving math and science education  yet President Bush s last two budgets cut funds to train math and science teachers at the National Science Foundation Our ability to compete depends on leaving no child behind  yet President Bush has underfunded the Act by  40 billion Our ability to compete depends on providing every student the opportunity to go to college  In his campaigns  President Bush pledged to increase the maximum Pell grant to  5 100  but for the last 4 years it s been frozen at  4 050 Our ability to compete depends on helping students use technology in the classroom  yet last year President Bush called for the elimination of the federal Educational Technology program Our ability to compete depends on providing workers with job training to enhance their skills in the global market  yet Bush has consistently called for cuts to Workforce Investment programs and Adult Education  Workers need a system that supports and guides workers into new jobs  not flexible accounts Our ability to compete depends on investments in research and development to ensure innovations  but last year the NIH  NSF  DOE  USDA  and NASA all saw basic research funding  in real terms  cut below what they had in 2003 Basic Research Fact Sheet  2006 Federal research and development spending  outside of defense weapons and human space exploration technologies  fell nearly 2 percent after adjusting for inflation   The Department of Energy s Office of Science RD portfolio is down 0 4 percent to  3 3 billion   The National Institutes of Health s 2006 budget fell for the first time in 36 years   The U S  Department of Agriculture s research funding fell 0 4 percent in 2006 to  2 4 billion   NIH  NSF  DOE  and USDA all have less basic research funding in real terms in 2006 than they had in 2003   Although NASA s RD funding climbed 6 2 percent to  11 4 billion  funding for RD in all other programs  except for human space vehicles  have seen steep cuts    Aeronautics research funding is down 3 4    Earth sciences research funding is down 8 3    Biological and physical sciences research funding is down 14 4   The President s 2006 budget request included  2 5 billion more in cuts than what was approved by Congress   Federal research investment is shrinking as a share of the U S  economy    federal RD investment has plateaued at 1 1 percent of U S  GDP and is expected to decline further to less than 0 4 percent in 2006   At the same time fast growing countries like China  Japan  Ireland and S  Korea are increasingly recognizing the immense potential for economic growth from basic research   China alone doubled its investment in RD as a percentage of GDP over the last 10 years    but we increased it by only 34    RD also leads to greater employment growth as compared to overall private sector employment  From 1994 to 2000  research and development employment grew 5 4  annually  compared with 2 7  in total employment President Bush s education track record in New Mexico  President Bush s 2006 budget  o Left behind over 26 000 disadvantaged children  denying them the Title I services they were promised  o Eliminated funding for a  4 million program to support technology in New Mexico classrooms  o Denied after school services to 14 000 eligible children in New Mexico  o Significantly cut funding to train math and science teachers in New Mexico  Last year  nearly all school districts in New Mexico saw cuts in Title I funds  Over 39 800 of the 44 000 Pell grant recipients in New Mexico will receive no increase in aid under the new student aid program in the Republican budget New Mexico 328 000 students in 795 schools    54  Hispanic  31  white  11  Native American  and 2 5  African American About 23  of K 12 students in New Mexico live in poverty  New Mexico Scholars  This program is a business led initiative to motivate students to complete rigorous coursework  primarily in math and science  while in high school  The Initiative is managed by the New Mexico Business Roundtable for Educational Excellence in cooperation with local Chambers of Commerce  Albuquerque  Rio Rancho and Bernalillo are the three pilot communities selected for implementation  New Mexico has 26 public colleges and universities  educating more than 127 000 students  Nearly 44 000 college students in New Mexico receive Pell grants Albuquerque Public Schools  87 000 students in 127 schools  divided into 12 clusters   There are 32 magnet schools in the district and 12 of them  including two high schools  are focused on science  math and or technology   Albuquerque Public School system also has 8 year round schools   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202
