20191   Ivan G  Seidenberg Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Verizon Communications Inc  140 West Street Floor 29 New York  NY  10007   Dear Mr  Whitacre  Mr  Forsee  and Mr  Seidenberg    On February 6  2006  USA Today published an article entitled Telecoms let NSA spy on calls  According to this article  the National Security Agency  NSA  has secured the cooperation of ATT  MCI and Sprint in eavesdropping on certain calls between the United States and foreign countries without a warrant  As you know  wiretap orders under the Wiretap Act or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA  are usually required before the government may intercept the domestic or international calls of individuals in the United States  Providers of telecommunications and Internet service are permitted to assist the government in the implementation of such wiretaps if they have been provided with either a court order  or a written certification from a high ranking Justice Department official that no court order is required  that all statutory requirements have been met  and that the assistance is required  The USA Today article  however  states that your companies  cooperation is on the basis of oral requests from senior government officials    We believe that understanding your company s participation in the NSA s domestic surveillance program is critical to congressional oversight efforts  Please provide all relevant information and records on the following topics for the period September 11  2001  to the present  Page 2 February 9  2006   1  Have government officials requested your company s cooperation  either in writing or orally  in conducting surveillance of communications in the United States without a court order under the Wiretap Act or FISA  other than requests explicitly stating that they were authorized under the emergency provisions of those Acts  If so  what are the names of those government officials  Please provide the dates of all such requests and subsequent contacts  If any requests have been made in writing  please provide copies of those written requests  If the requests were made orally  please provide a detailed description of the requests  2  In each of these instances  did any government official provide you with a certification in writing  that no warrant or court order is required by law  that all statutory requirements have been met  and that the specified assistance is required  as set forth in 18 U S C   2511 2  a  ii   3  If anyone from or on behalf of the federal government informed you that it was not necessary to meet the requirements of that section  please provide a detailed description of any such communication  including all persons involved and all documents reflecting or describing such communication  4  What was the response of your company to these requests  If the response was in writing  please provide copies of all relevant documents  If the response was oral  please provide the dates on which the response was made  the identity of those in your company responding to government requests  and a full description of the response  5  How many communications and individuals were intercepted  covered  monitored or otherwise subjected to any form of surveillance in response to these requests  Please provide the dates on which these actions were taken  6  Is cooperation with government officials with regard to this matter ongoing  7  Were you asked to perform or permit any actions that conflict with your tariffs  your customer agreements  or any provisions of federal or state law  or would so conflict if your own employees did so  Please provide a detailed description of any such requests  including all persons involved and all documents reflecting or describing such requests    If you believe there are legal restrictions that prohibit you from answering any of these questions  please provide a detailed explanation of such restrictions  including the names and positions of any government officials or agents who may have informed you of such restrictions  We will work with you to ensure that the confidentiality of any sensitive information is preserved    As you may know  the Senate Judiciary Committee will be continuing with hearings on the NSA s surveillance program later this month  Accordingly  we would appreciate a reply no later than Friday  February 17  2006  We look forward to your prompt reply    Page 3 February 8  2006   Sincerely    __________________________   __________________________  Russell D  Feingold     Edward M  Kennedy United States Senator
