         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     It s a privilege to join Senator Craig in offering the Agricultural Jobs  Opportunity  Benefits  and Security amendment      The AgJOBS bill corrects long festering immigration problems  It provides a fair and reasonable way for undocumented agricultural workers to earn legal status  And it reforms the current visa program  so that agricultural employers unable to hire American workers can hire needed foreign workers  Both of these components are critical  They serve as the cornerstone for comprehensive immigration reform of the agricultural sector  Our bill strikes a fair balance     The AgJOBS bill will enhance our national security and make our communities safer  It brings undocumented farm workers and their families out of the shadows and enables them to pass through security check points  Reducing the size of the undocumented population reduces the ability of suspected terrorists to hide  All workers eligible for this program will undergo rigorous security checks as they apply for legal status     Opponents of reform continually mislabel any initiative they oppose as Aamnesty in a desperate attempt to stop any significant reform  Instead of proposing ways to fix our current broken system  they are calling for more of the same    increased enforcement of broken laws  However  enforcing a dysfunctional system only leads to greater dysfunction     The AgJOBS bill is not an amnesty  The program requires farm workers to earn legal status  They must demonstrate not only past work contributions  but also a substantial future work commitment before they earn the right to remain in our country  First  they will receive temporary resident status  based on their past work experience  To earn permanent residence  they must fulfill a prospective work requirement  Temporary residents who fail to fulfill the prospective agricultural work requirement will be dropped from the program and required to leave the country     It s not amnesty if you have to earn it  AgJOBS offers farm workers a fair deal  if they are willing to work hard for us  then we re willing to do something fair for them  It s the only realistic solution     Contrary to statements made by its critics  AgJOBS does not provide a direct path to citizenship  Farm workers would first earn temporary residence if they provide evidence of past work in agriculture  The next step would be permanent residence  but only after they have completed thousands of hours of back breaking work in agriculture    a process that could take up to 6 years  Once they earn permanent residence  these farm workers would have to wait another 5 years to be able to apply for citizenship  This process is long and arduous  as it should be  There is nothing direct about it     To be eligible for legal status  applicants must present no criminal or national security problems  All applicants will be required to undergo rigorous security clearances  Their names and birth dates must be checked against our government s criminal and terrorist databases  Applicants  fingerprints would be sent to the FBI for a criminal background check  which includes comparing the applicants  fingerprints with all arrest records in the FBI s database     Contrary to arguments made by detractors of AgJOBS  terrorists will not be able to exploit this program to obtain legal status  Anyone with any ties to terrorist activity is ineligible for legal status under our current immigration laws  and would be ineligible under the AgJOBS bill  Our proposal has no loopholes for terrorists     Opponents of AgJOBS claim that this bill is soft on criminals  Wrong again  AgJOBS has the toughest provisions against those who commit crimes    tougher than current immigration law  Convictions for most crimes will make them ineligible to obtain a green card  Applicants can also be denied legal status if they commit a felony or three misdemeanors  It doesn t matter whether the misdemeanors involve minor offenses  In addition  any one convicted of a single misdemeanor who served a sentence of 6 months or more would also be ineligible  These rules are additional requirements that cannot be waived by DHS     Opponents of AgJOBS also claim that it will be a magnet for further illegal immigration  Once again  they are wrong  To be eligible for the earned adjustment program  farm workers must establish that they worked in agriculture in the past  Farm workers must have entered the United States prior to October  2004  Otherwise  they are not eligible  The magnet argument is false  New entrants who have not worked in agriculture won t qualify for this program     Our opponents also claim that we are rushing this bill through Congress  without full and careful consideration  This claim is without merit  Since 1998  the Immigration Subcommittee has held 4 hearings that have fully examined our agricultural work force problems and the need to reform our immigration laws  Legislation to address this problem has been introduced by both Republicans and Democrats in every Congress since 1996  In 2003 a compromise was finally reached by business and labor  which led Senator Craig and me to introduce the AgJOBS bill  Last Congress we had 63 Senate co sponsors  nearly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans  This is the second Congress in we have introduced the AgJOBS bill  Congress has had extensive discussions of this legislation in the past  and it is long past time for us to act    Everyone agrees that our immigration system is broken  In the last 10 years  the U S  government has spent more than  20 billion to enforce our immigration laws  Yet  none of our efforts have been adequate     Illegal immigration continues  The proof is in the numbers  Today  that number is nearly 11 million  with an average annual growth of almost 500 000  Those already here are not leaving  and new immigrants keep coming in  A significant part of the workforce in many sectors of the economy  especially agriculture  is undocumented  Massive deportations are unrealistic as a policy  impractical to carry out  and unacceptable to businesses that rely heavily on their labor  The American people want common sense solutions to these real problems  They want neither open borders  nor closed borders  They want smart borders  They want the federal government to get its act together  to set rules that are realistic and fair  and to follow through and enforce these realistic rules effectively and efficiently  They want immigration laws that protect our nation s security  respect its ideals  and honor America s heritage and history as a nation of immigrants     AgJOBS meets these goals  It addresses our national security needs  reflects current economic realities  and respects America s immigrant heritage     We must control our borders and enforce our laws  but we first need realistic immigration laws that we can actually enforce  We need comprehensive immigration reform and the AgJOBS bill is the first significant step  Our bill will help reduce the chaotic  illegal  and all too deadly traffic of immigrants at our borders  by providing safe and opportunities for farm workers and their families to enter the country    AgJOBS is a bi partisan compromise reached after years of negotiations  Both farm workers and growers have made concessions to reach this agreement  but each side obtained important benefits  It reflects a far reaching and welcome agreement between the United Farm Workers and the agricultural industry to meet this urgent need  and Congress should make the most of this unique opportunity for progress     We have strong support from business and labor  civic and faith based organizations  liberals and conservatives  trade associations and immigrant rights groups  More than 500 organizations across the country have endorsed our bill     In contrast  our opponents  offer a one sided proposal that has failed to win the broad support that AgJOBS has achieved  I urge my colleagues to oppose it     Their proposal vastly favors employers at the expense of farm workers  It makes harsh revisions to the current agricultural guestworker program and creates a new blue card program for undocumented workers without a path to permanent residence  and without any meaningful governmental oversight to prevent labor abuses     It would return us to the dark and shameful era of the Bracero Program  where abuses were rampant and widely tolerated  That s unacceptable  We must learn from our mistakes  not repeat them  By offering no path to permanent residence  none of the guestworkers  no matter how long they worked  will ever be eligible to earn permanent status     Most troubling is the amendment s repeal of the longstanding adverse effect wage rate under the current program  This wage rate was created during the Bracero Program as a necessary protection against the depression in wages caused by guestworker programs  Our opponents  proposal would replace it with a prevailing wage standard substantially lower than the adverse effect wage rate  Farm workers who are already the lowest paid workers in the U S  would see their wages drop even lower     I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the Craig Kennedy AgJOBS amendment  Once cloture is invoked  Senator Craig and I are willing to wrap up debate on this issue within an hour or two  We can quickly dispense with the outstanding issues and consider all second degree amendments  We have no intention of delaying the vote on the final passage of the emergency supplemental to provide vital funds for our armed forces and tsunami relief     Opponents of our amendment have offered no workable solutions  We can t be complacent any longer  It s time for a new approach  I urge my colleagues to wholeheartedly endorse the AgJOBS bill and reject the Chambliss amendment      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
