         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy delivered the following floor speech on his opposition to the Chambliss Amendment  The Chambliss amendment would change the immigration bill s wage protections for H 2A agricultural workers  Currently  such workers must be paid the federal or state minimum wage  the prevailing wage as set by the Department of Labor  or the Adverse Effect Wage  i e   the average hourly wage for field and livestock workers   whichever is highest  The Adverse Effect Wage is typically the highest of these wage rates If Senator Chambliss won t stand up for the hardworking peach pickers of his state  I will  said Senator Kennedy  the wages his proposal would allow are intolerable  These are hardworking people who live on the very margins of our society  It is unconscionable for us to steal the few precious dollars they make from a hard day s work The amendment would eliminate the Adverse Effect Wage altogether  change the formula for calculating prevailing wages to reduce these wages  and make the federal minimum wage inapplicable to agricultural guest workers  The combined effect of these amendments would be to dramatically reduce the wages paid to agricultural guest workers  and harm U S  workers by dragging down wages in the entire industry Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy in Opposition to the Chambliss AmendmentI rise in opposition to the Chambliss amendment  which would drastically reduce wages for some of our nation s most vulnerable workers    H2 A Agricultural guest workers  These hardworking people are struggling each day just to make ends meet and feed their families  It would be inexcusable for Congress to make their struggle to survive even more difficult by reducing their already low wages I know that many of us in this chamber can recall hearing shocking revelations about the days of the Bracero program  where migrant farmworkers toiled in appalling working conditions  They performed dirty  miserable  and dangerous work  often without adequate housing and sanitation facilities  Many braceros were physically abused  or denied wages they had rightfully earned  While these workers were supposed to be paid prevailing wages these prevailing wages were fixed by their employers  and were often criminally low  In fact  the situation got so bad that the U S  Department of Labor officer in charge of the Bracero program  Lee Williams  referred to it as legalized slavery Fortunately  agricultural guestworkers workers now get a better deal  To protect these workers from exploitation  and to ensure that these guestworkers do not drive down wages for American workers  President Kennedy created a new wage protection called adverse effect wages  Now  H2 A workers must be paid at least the average hourly rate for field and livestock workers in the region The Chambliss amendment would turn back the progress we ve made since the days of the Bracero program  returning us to a system where agricultural guestworkers can be forced to work for sub poverty wages  Senator Chambliss wants to eliminate the adverse effect wage requirement altogether  and to make agricultural guestworkers ineligible for the federal minimum wage  That s shocking  At a time when the vast majority of the population agrees that the federal minimum wage is appallingly low  Senator Chambliss is proposing that we pay workers even less The minimum wage is about fairness  It s a moral issue  The wages we pay these workers reflect our personal values and our nation s values  In America  we value hard work  We respect hardworking people We believe a job should keep you out of poverty  not keep you in poverty  Paying hardworking people less than the minimum wage is simply wrong  and we cannot tolerate it Under the Chambliss proposal workers would be paid prevailing wages  or piece rate wages    meaning that workers get paid by the bushel or the bucket  Unfortunately  many states    including Senator Chambliss s home state of Georgia    have no state minimum wage for agricultural workers to set a bottom floor for these piece rate wages  So  a peach picker in Georgia earning the prevailing wage of 45 cents a bushel  could make as little as  4 or  3 per hour If Senator Chambliss won t stand up for the hardworking peach pickers of his state  I will  The wages his proposal would allow are intolerable  These are hardworking people who live on the very margins of our society  It is unconscionable for us to steal the few precious dollars they make from a hard day s work Now  Senator Chambliss claims that if we maintain the current system  employers who illegally employ undocumented workers will have an advantage over employers that play by the rules and pay decent wages  But we ve already dealt with this problem in the bill  It took years of negotiations  but both sides agreed on a compromise    freezing adverse effect wages at their 2002 levels for three years  This bipartisan solution will ensure that employers have incentives to hire legal workers rather than breaking the law  The Chambliss amendment would undermine this historic compromise that we reached with Senator Craig  the United Farm Workers of America and the agricultural businesses This is a fair deal  It s a good compromise that keeps law abiding employers competitive while ensuring fair wages for hardworking people  Both growers and workers agree that this bill will help stabilize the agricultural workforce until we have the opportunity to investigate these complex issues more thoroughly and come up with long term solutions  There is absolutely no reason to go back now and revisit this historic deal  solely to take money out of hardworking people s pockets I urge my colleagues to oppose the Chambliss Amendment  and any proposal that would deny working people the basic protections of the federal minimum wage   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
