         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   We have now reached Day 8 of the minimum wage debate   In the countless hours that we have spend debating this bill on the Senate floor  minimum wage workers across the country have served thousands of meals  cleaned thousands of hotel rooms  and changed thousands of diapers   Unfortunately  we have not been nearly as productive     Yesterday  we finally took a step forward   87 Senators voted to bring debate on this bill to a close and do whats right for working Americans   It was a strong vote  and I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their overwhelming support of this important bill   This vote sends a clear statement that the United States Senate is finally listening to the voice of the American people   88  of Americans support an increase in the minimum wage    Three quarters of the House of Representatives voted for a raise  including more than 80 Republican Members   Now 87 Senators have voted to close debate on an unrelated amendment   And yet  somehow  we just cant get this done   We are still not voting on an increase in the minimum wage There is just no excuse for further delay   We have voted on more than a dozen amendments  and negotiated many more   Republicans have added tax giveaways and goodies to this simple bill   Weve debated everything from immigration to health savings accounts  When are we going to say enough is enough The only reason we cant have a vote right now  right this very minute  is that the Republican leadership is playing procedural tricks and standing in the way of what the American people clearly want The United States Senate is a unique institution that has strong protections for dissenting voices   At times  that is a very good thing   We all have visions of Mr  Smith Goes to Washington  where one lone Senator stands against all odds to support a noble goal But the situation today is far different   These obstructionist Republicans have no noble goal in mind  quite the contrary   Theyre needlessly delaying a vote on the minimum wage because they dont want to move on and talk about Iraq   Thats not noble or brave   Its cowardly  and its unfair to the 13 million working Americans who shouldnt have to wait another day for the raise they so clearly deserve Lets talk about the people who are left waiting   They are men and women of dignity  who perform some of the most difficult and important jobs in our society   They care for out children in day care centers   They care for our elderly in nursing homes   They clean our hotel rooms and buildings of commerce   They are our friends and neighbors   They are even our nations military families Thats right  our men and women sacrificing in Iraq  Afghanistan  and countries around the world often have spouses here at home who work in low wage jobs and struggle to get by on their meager earnings when their loved ones are called away to serve their country   10  of military spouses  thats 50 000 military families  would benefit from our bill to increase in the minimum wage   Thats a shocking statistic   While our fighting men and women are promoting security around the world  we cant even provide their families with financial security here at home Im deeply saddened that we cant act more quickly to help these families  and all the other families across the country  that are struggling to survive on the minimum wage   After 10 years of waiting  10 long years of procedural trickery and political game playing  there is no more reason  not even the flimsiest excuse  for delay   Its time to put a stop to this once and for all and do what is right for the American people   Its time vote to raise the minimum wage    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
