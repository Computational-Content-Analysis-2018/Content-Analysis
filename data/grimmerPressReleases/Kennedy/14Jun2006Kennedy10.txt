         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       Washington  D C     Yesterday  House lawmakers voted to approve a  3 300 Congressional pay increase  If this raise is approved by the Senate  it will be the eighth Congressional pay increase in 10 years  Senator Kennedy issued the following statement calling on Congress to give the same consideration to the rising cost of living for low wage workers  and act immediately to raise the minimum wage   It is the worst kind of hypocrisy for Congress to vote itself another pay increase this year while continuing to ignore the hardworking families struggling to survive on the minimum wage  With this proposed increase  Congress will have increased its own salary by more than  34 000 in the last nine years  while minimum wage workers have not seen another cent in their paychecks  How can Congress keep saying yes to itself  and no to these millions of deserving working families  Its long past time for Congress to give these hardworking Americans a raise         Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
