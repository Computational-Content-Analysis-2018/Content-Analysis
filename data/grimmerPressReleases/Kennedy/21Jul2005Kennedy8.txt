         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     With the somber news breaking in London  our thoughts and hearts are with those waking up to another morning of uncertainty and terror  Across the globe and our country  we have never been more united in efforts to stop such attacks    In the wake of the tragic events of September 11th  Congress faced the urgent priority to become more united behind the ideals that make us strong and more committed to protecting our security  We recognized the need to monitor the implementation of these new powers carefully  to make sure we achieve the right balance between law enforcement and civil liberties     That s why we put sunset provisions in the original legislation  to require Congress and the Administration to come back and review our legislative response     Then  as now  we must meet the challenge of striking the right balance between law enforcement and civil liberties    The 9 11 Commission Report put it plainly      The burden of proof for retaining a particular governmental power should be on the executive  to explain that the power actually materially enhances security and that there is adequate supervision of the executive s use of the powers to ensure protection of civil liberties    If the power is granted  there must be adequate guidelines and oversight to properly confine its use       That should be our guiding principle in these discussions      After the vicious attacks of September 11th  Members of Congress came together on both sides of the aisle  We agreed on the need to give law enforcement and intelligence officers stronger powers to investigate and prevent terrorism  to stop terrorists from entering the country  and to achieve full coordination between law enforcement and the intelligence communities  At the same time  we understood the critical importance of protecting basic rights and liberties is an essential part of our democracy    That s why continued sunsets are such an important part of the Act  Congress committed itself to re examining the Act this year  a non election year  and to assess which powers should be retained  which should be revised  and which should be repealed  I strongly support the inclusion of sunset provisions and increased reporting in this reauthorization  Without it  Congressional oversight will be weakened and meaningless    This compromise bill improves the provisions in the original legislation  None of these changes will impede the ability of law enforcement and intelligence officials to investigate and prevent terrorism  But in retaining the expanded powers of the PATRIOT Act  this bill also maintains and improves the constitutional safeguards that are indispensable to our democracy  These safeguards are a continuing source of our country s strength  not luxuries or inconveniences to be jettisoned in time of crisis    Four years ago  many of us on the committee had significant concerns that the powers sought by the Administration went too far  We worked hard to achieve a bipartisan agreement  but we need to monitor the implementation of these powers  There has been a great deal of careful effort put into this reauthorization bill and I appreciate the commitment that my colleagues here on the Committee have made to oppose any efforts to undermine our agreement as the bill moves to the floor    Since the enactment of the PATRIOT Act  there s been increasing bipartisan concern about its effect on civil liberties  Seven states and nearly 400 communities have passed resolutions to protect the civil liberties of their citizens    with hundreds of more resolutions in progress  Libraries and bookstores have campaigns  In a famous address twenty years ago  President Ronald Reagan observed  To a tired and disillusioned world  we ve always been a New World and  yes  a shining city on a hill where all things are possible  President Reagan believed the United States should be a beacon to the world  Let s not dim it under a veil of secrecy    Now  more than ever  it s wrong to rubberstamp such important legislation  It s our responsibility to the Constitution and the American people to get this right  not just turn a blind eye to the obvious potential for abuse  With the same spirit of consensus and bipartisan cooperation that brought the Congress together in 2001  this improved reauthorization bill reflects important changes and follows the spirit of the Commission s recommendations     Let s maintain our commitment to enhance security and protect civil liberties when we take this bill to the floor     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
