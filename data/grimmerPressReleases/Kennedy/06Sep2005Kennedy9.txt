Edward M  Kennedy met with relief organizations working to provide support to Hurricane Katrina victims  The participants  among whom Michael Casserly  Executive Director  Council of Great City Schools and Dr  Georges Benjamin  Executive Director of the American Public Health Association met with the legislators today to discuss the situation in the gulf coast and the best ways to implement relief and support services for those affected    Dozens of representatives from nationwide relief organizations met with Kennedy this morning and relayed their experiences and recommendations for meeting the challenge of providing support services to a region severely hit with health care  education  economic and structural devastation  These recommendations  along with initial proposals put forth by Kennedy and Chairman Mike Enzi  will result in legislation to assist Hurricane Katrina victims     Senator Kennedy  ranking member of the United State Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  will propose legislative remedies to ensure that hurricane victims will receive critical support in the days and months ahead    Among the proposals offered are initiatives in health care  education and economic relief  Addressing the health care challenges is a top priority as curbing infectious disease in the region and providing mental health outreach and support are immediate concerns that have the ability to affect long term relief efforts  Senator Kennedy believes that persons affected by the hurricane should be eligible for Medicaid with full Federal reimbursement and waived co payments  in addition to HHS waiving the income and residency requirements for Medicaid  Kennedy is also working with the mental health community to ensure that evacuees have the resources they need to cope with this disaster     Many of those affected by the hurricane are children and students pursuing higher education  Kennedy will seek  2 500 per child to school districts who receive displaced children  as well as freezing student debt repayment for six months  Displaced students receiving student aid should continue and matching for campus based aid programs should be waived for those universities accepting displaced students    Economists predict that up to one million people will be left jobless as a result of the hurricane  Proposals to provide economic aid to evacuees include providing disaster unemployment assistance for unemployed workers  allowing people to withdraw funds from 401  k s and IRA s penalty free and allowing the postponement and payment deadlines for pension plans    Kennedy said  Hurricane Katrina and the destruction it caused in multiple southern states is a national tragedy  and the national government needs to lead in the months and years ahead  We can t rest until we ve rebuilt these communities and until we ve restored hope in the hundreds of thousands of American citizens who find themselves homeless  jobless  and without any idea of what the future holds for them    The Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee will convene on Thursday to discuss and put into motion the proposals outlined today           SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS   Labor  Pensions  Disaster Unemployment Assistance  Legislation is needed to correct flaws in the DUA program that keep it from helping as many disaster victims as it should  In addition  the Department of Labor should suspend regulations that impose barriers to people receiving DUA     Pensions and IRAs  There is a provision in the Enzi Kennedy pension reform bill that gives the Secretaries of Labor and Treasury and the PBGC authority to postpone filing and payment deadlines for pension plans affected by Katrina  The rules for 401 k  plans should be relaxed for Katrina victims to allow them to withdraw money  and allow loans from IRAs for living expenses and home rebuilding    Education  Funding for school districts near the disaster zone  Grants should be provided to communities that have accepted refugees to help them cope with an upsurge in new students      Assistance to students  Students from the areas affected by Katrina should receive deferments on their need to repay student loans and or financial assistance in transferring to another institute of higher education if needed      Flexibility in administering programs  Income requirements should be waived for access to Head Start in the affected areas  HHS should grant flexibility under CCDBG on child care subsidy payments  NCLB requirements should similarly be applied flexibly in affected areas      Funds for rebuilding  Communities affected by Katrina should receive funding for rebuilding their education and healthcare infrastructure     Health  Disease surveillance and control  Funding should be provided for measures to control epidemics in the affected areas  In the long term  the health of refugees should be studied and care should be provided if exposure to toxic chemicals from flood water increases refugees  risk of chronic illnesses  Diseases will spread quickly in cramped refugee camps  Temporary housing needs to be built immediately not only to prevent infectious diseases but to restore hope     Mental health  Funding is needed to deal with the mental health consequences of the disaster  Legislation to support children s mental health should be strengthened and reauthorized and the overall provision of mental health services to victims of the storm should be federally facilitated      Disabilities  Allow flexible use of funds under the Developmental Disabilities Act to help support people with disabilities and their families at the local level who are victims of the storm     Eligibility for care   Refugees should receive 100  Medicaid reimbursement       De politicizing decision making  CDC and FEMA should be able to directly request support and funding without having to clear decisions through the political bureaucracies at HHS and DHS  respectively     RELIEF ORGANIZATION PARTICIPANTS   Warlene Garry  Executive Director of National PTA  not confirmed     Linda Smith  Executive Director of National Child Care Resource
