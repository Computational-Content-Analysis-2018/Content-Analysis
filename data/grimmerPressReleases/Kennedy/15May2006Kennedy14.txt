         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    I want to thank Senator Reid and Senator Frist for working so hard to bring comprehensive immigration reform back to the Senate floor  And I am grateful  too  for the opportunity to work with Senator McCain to bring forward this reform bill  and for the work of Senator Hagel  Senator Martinez  and so many others in bringing us to this point     This debate reminds us once again that we are truly a nation of immigrants  We recall that throughout our history  courageous immigrants have provided the hard work  the strong families  and the love of our country which define the American spirit  They dug our canals and built our railroads  They advanced our science and fostered our innovation  They fought in our wars  and 60 000 have served our colors with pride in Iraq and Afghanistan  They became part of the American dream  Immigrants have been the heart and the muscle that have moved this country forward for 400 years  and helped make America the envy of the world    Last month  we were reminded in a very personal way of the contributions of immigrants through the moving stories related by Senator Domenici and Senator Martinez     Senator Domenici told how his parents came from Italy with nothing  His father earned his citizenship through his service in the U S  Army in the First World War  His mother was here for many years before gaining her legal status  once facing deportation  but later becoming an American citizen  The Domenicis worked hard  learned English  built a successful grocery business  and one of their children went on to become a distinguished and respected United States Senator     Senator Martinez of Florida told us about his family s flight from Cuba to begin new lives in America  Young Mel Martinez was 15 years old when his family escaped from Cuba to seek a new life of freedom  Like millions before him  his family worked hard  learned English  and earned their success in Florida  And today  Mel Martinez not only was a cabinet secretary in the Administration  but was elected by the people of Florida to serve as their United States Senator  This is the immigrant story  We are a great people because that story has been repeated millions of times over many generations    Just as in the past  today s immigrants are tomorrow s Americans  Regardless of where they came from or how they got here  they and their children and grandchildren will contribute anew to our national life     But today  every American knows that our immigration system is broken  It falls short in meeting our security needs  strengthening our economy  and upholding our values  What we have tried in the past no longer works today  There was a time when oceans and borders protected us and enabled us to better control immigration  That is no longer the case today  In the past decade  we have spent more than  20 billion to triple our border patrols and build fences  But we have learned that border enforcement alone will not work  Just building fences and putting more agents on the border is doomed to fail  It is a strategy that will make us weaker  not stronger  in dealing with immigration     We need an immigration program for the 21st century that is worthy of our heritage as a nation of immigrants    one that is tough and smart and fair    one that sees to our security and reflects our humanity  And I believe the compromise legislation before us meets that test    First  it mandates very tough enforcement  It doubles our border patrols  builds more fences and barriers along the border  and requires state of the art technology in fighting illegal immigration  It increases enforcement against employers who hire undocumented workers  and requires tamper proof immigration documents so that employers can determine who can and cannot work in America  It fully implements a system for keeping track of who comes to our country and when they leave  It establishes new penalties against digging tunnels under the border and for evading immigration officials  and sets up a massive new effort to shut down criminal syndicates that smuggle immigrants into the country  It expands the capacity of our immigration detention facilities and grants new authority to detain dangerous immigrants  It provides vast new authorities to identify and remove terrorists and criminals    These are just some of the new enforcement tools that our bill provides    But these steps alone are not enough  Therefore  the second step in our bill acknowledges that the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are already here not only are not going away  but they also have something to offer to our communities and to our country  Common sense says that we cannot and should not embark on a massive deportation program  That would disrupt communities and businesses  uproot families  cost billions and billions of dollars  and require a caravan of buses stretching from Alaska through California    Instead we should recognize the desire of these immigrants to contribute to America  Our bill provides a means for them to earn the privilege of American citizenship  They must work  pay taxes  pay a penalty for coming illegally  learn English  and obey our laws    all over the course of several years    Third  our bill recognizes that we must provide legal channels for future immigrants  so that employers are not tempted to hire illegal immigrants in the future  The reality is that immigrants will come and employers will hire them  even if we erect miles and miles of new fences  It s far better for future immigrants to be here legally so that they are out of the shadows and protected by our laws  rather than used illegally to undermine American wages and American jobs  For that reason  our bill establishes a program to allow workers to come here legally  to work here temporarily  with the prospect of earning their way to permanent immigration status in the future    That is our program  It has been embraced by employers  workers  Republicans  Democrats  civil rights groups  immigration experts  immigrant groups  and more  And we re all waiting to hear what the President has to say about it in his national immigration address tonight     President Bush is to be commended for his courage and leadership in advancing the immigration debate in our nation  As a former governor of a border state  he understands the issues  he appreciates what s at stake  and he knows the many contributions of immigrants to our nation  So tonight  we need President Bush to speak in a clear  strong voice in favor of this comprehensive  bipartisan  common sense immigration plan  Each of its three elements is necessary to fix our broken system  None will work in isolation from the others  All three steps must be implemented at the same time if we are to restore the integrity of American immigration  The President must state unequivocally that enforcement only approaches are a failed strategy  And enforcement first may make a tidy bumper sticker slogan  but it is not a strategy for success    However  I urge the President not to distract the nation from the urgent work of immigration reform  This is no time to promote the deployment of the National Guard along the border  The Administration must resist its first impulse to address every challenge by calling in the troops  The National Guard already is stretched to the limit by repeated tours in Iraq and Afghanistan  as well as from providing disaster assistance in their own states  Instead  we need a laser like focus on the great task at hand  Our national attention and valuable tax dollars should be spent on hiring and training the border patrol agents and immigration officers needed to meet our needs along the border  deepening cooperation with Mexico and other countries to halt illegal immigration before it begins  and improving coordination among US law enforcement agencies     In a way  the reform debate is much larger and far reaching than the issue of immigration alone  It is about the kind of America we have been and the even stronger America we hope to become  It is about a land whose greatest strength is the way we treat our neighbors and care for our fellow citizens  It is about opening doors of opportunity to unleash the talents and strengths of everyone in the land  regardless of color or creed  so that we face the future with hope and determination    That s what this debate is all about  We see it in the faces of the hundreds of thousands who have marched for opportunity in cities across our land  We see it with our employers who know that a skilled  diverse workforce is essential to our competitiveness in the global economy  We see it with our military leaders who are recruiting a diverse fighting force to think in new ways as we deal with our dangerous world    Just as in the past  this debate comes with controversy  That has always been the case throughout our immigrant history  just as it was with the struggle for civil rights in the 1960s  But who today would argue that Italian or Irish or Catholic or Jewish immigrants should be excluded  Just as who would argue that African Americans should be excluded from our schools or that discrimination against the hiring of Latinos is acceptable in America today    Similarly  over the next several days that the Senate debates immigration  there will be strongly felt discussion  and hotly contested amendments  Many of these amendments  if adopted  would end the prospects for comprehensive reform  The outcome of these amendments will determine which vision of America we will pursue    one mired in fear that seeks to preserve the status quo  or one anchored in hope that looks with optimism to America s future    Again  I thank Senator Reid and Senator Frist for their courage in proceeding with this debate   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
