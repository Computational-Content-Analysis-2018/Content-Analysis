         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  DC    Today Senator Kennedy issued the  following statement in response to the State Departments announcement that they  will soon propose legislation on Iraqi refugees   Kennedy  Chairman of the  Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration  Border Security  and Refugees   held the first Congressional hearing on Iraqi refugees in February and has lead  the charge for the U S  to help solve this emerging crisis               For too long  the Administration has let down those  brave Iraqi men and women who have risked their lives to work with us and  millions of others who have fled their homes as a result of the civil war in  Iraq    Just like in every other crisis weve faced in Iraq  the response has  been late  timid and incomplete   As they craft a proposal on Iraqi refugees  I  urge the Administration to be bold and generous   Refugees are in need  and  people are dying   We cannot take every refugee into this country  but we need  to show decisive leadership   Those who translated for our military and who  qualify for the existing translator program ought to be at the top of the list    Already  nearly 500 Iraqis who fought with American soldiers and who saved  American lives have been recommended by the military   At a minimum  we need to  change the program to allow them to come to the United States immediately      They have a target on their back because of their work with the U S   Military  and they should not be told to wait in line for three  years    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202 224 2633
