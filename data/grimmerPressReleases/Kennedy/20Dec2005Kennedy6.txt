         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  This afternoon  at approximately 4 30  Senator Kennedy will speak on the Senate floor about the amendment he has offered to the Intelligence Authorization bill requiring the Administration to provide the Presidential Daily Briefs  PDBs  on Iraq to Congress  beginning with the last term of the Clinton Administration and ending on first day of the war in Iraq in 2003  An unidentified Republican Senator has put a hold on the bill over objections to Kennedy s PDB measure and two amendments related to secret detainee facilities  As a result  the entire bill has been stalled  despite the agreement from Chairman Roberts to accept Kennedy s amendments  All the while  President Bush continues to contend that Congress had the same intelligence as he had    a claim he made 98 times in the months leading up to the 2004 campaign     It s bad enough that the Administration distorted the intelligence on the need for the war  Now they re blatantly distorting the facts about how much access Congress had to the intelligence  America can do better  Senator Kennedy said  To prevent debate on this all important issue  the Republican majority is apparently willing to let the whole intelligence bill fail  I don t agree with that tactic  It s a blatant cover up    Kennedy believes that it is essential to get to the bottom of the rush to war in Iraq not only to get the truth  but also because there are other threats on the horizon including in Iran and North Korea  Kennedy s amendment would require the Director of National Intelligence to provide the pre war PDBs on Iraq to Congress so that Phase II of the Intelligence Committee s investigation has all the necessary information to make an informed judgment about what was or wasn t manipulated  For Phase I  the Senate wasn t provided with the Presidential Daily Briefs despite efforts to get them    Attached is a chart on the request for PDBs and below is Senator Kennedy s floor speech  as well as the a list of the times that President Bush has claimed that Congress had the same intelligence     STATEMENT BY SENATOR KENNEDY AMENDMENT ON PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEFS DECEMBER 20  2005         AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY    Mr  President  many of us had hoped the Senate would take up the Intelligence Authorization Bill and allow us to offer an amendment to require the Director of National Intelligence to make the Presidential Daily Briefs on Iraq available to the Intelligence Committees of the Senate and House  beginning with the last term of the Clinton Administration and ending on first day of the war in Iraq in 2003     Unfortunately  an unidentified Republican has a hold on the bill to prevent Senate action unless the amendment is withdrawn along with two other amendments on secret detention facilities    It s obvious that some of our Republican colleagues are bent on avoiding the truth about the war  To prevent debate on this all important issue  the Republican majority is apparently willing to let the whole intelligence bill fail  I don t agree with that tactic  It s a blatant cover up    President Bush has repeatedly claimed in recent weeks that Congress had access to the same intelligence he did in deciding to go war in Iraq  As President Bush specifically stated in his Veteran s Day address in Pennsylvania last month   more than a hundred Democrats in the House and Senatewho had access to the same intelligencevoted to support removing Saddam Hussein from power     He repeated the claim on November 14  November 17  and again in his December 14 address to the nation on the war in Iraq  In fact  he had made the same statement 98 times between March and October 2004  when his decision to go to war was under serious challenge in the Presidential election that year  It s hardly surprising  therefore  that the President is now dusting off the same talking points today  when his decision to go to war is again under serious challenge    Vice President Cheney and National Security Advisor Hadley have made similar claims      How they could all make such an obvious false claim is beyond belief  It s bad enough that they distorted the intelligence on the need for the war  Now they re blatantly distorting the facts about how much access Congress had to the intelligence    Someone on the White House staff obviously needs to correct the President s talking points before he parrots them in another speech     President Bush should have taken a close and comprehensive look at the intelligence  rather than building a case for war based on cherry picked intelligence  It s not enough to recognize now that the intelligence was not accurate  Whatever flaws existed in the intelligence were far outweighed by the devious way the Administration manipulated the intelligence to support its preconceived desire for war and ignored the serious doubts that we now know undermined the intelligence    The Administration claims the intelligence wasn t deliberately distorted to justify the war  But how can they possibly pretend that Congress had access to that intelligence     The White House has access to thousands of intelligence documents that Congress never sees  According to a December 14 report by the Congressional Research Service  The President  and a small number of presidentially designated Cabinet level officials  including the Vice President    in contrast to Members of Congress    have access to a far greater overall volume of intelligence and to more sensitive intelligence information  including information regarding intelligence sources and methods  They  unlike Members of Congress  also have the authority to more extensively task the Intelligence Community  and its extensive cadre of analysts for follow up information     But  the principal document that Congress doesn t see is the Presidential Daily Briefthe so called PDB  which is prepared specifically for the President  It contains very important classified intelligence  and equally important information about the credibility of the intelligence  It s therefore an extremely valuable document     President Bush receives the PDB every morning and is given an oral briefing on it by top intelligence officials  The practice began in the Johnson Administration  and is intended to give each President a detailed overall view of national security concerns  including terrorist threats against the United States    As the Administration well knows  members of Congress certainly do not receive this daily briefing document  In fact  when Congress has sought copies of PDBs  the requests have been denied     In the case of Iraq  as part of its investigation of the pre war intelligence  the Senate Intelligence Committee specifically asked to review the PDBs relevant to the key issues of Iraq s weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein s links to terrorists  The White House flatly denied the request    The Committee is now working on the second phase of its investigationwhich is whether the Administration distorted the intelligence on Iraq in order to strengthen the case for war     So far  however  instead of providing the PDBs as part of an effort to find the truth  the White House continues to hide behind a veil of secrecy by refusing to disclose these briefs  It is difficult to believe that there is any sound national security reason for the Administration to continue stonewalling Congress by denying access to these PDBs  The obvious explanation is cover up    Members of the Silberman Robb Commission appointed by the President to examine pre war intelligence were given broad access to the PDBs on Iraq s weapons of mass destruction  Four of the ten members of the 9 11 Commission were given every PDB they requested  If these Commissioners were given access  Congress should have been given access as well for its own investigation of the all important questions about why we went to war and the way we went to war    The Administration s drumbeat for war in Iraq began at the end of the summer in 2002  It was carefully staged  As White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card said on September that year about the plan for war  From a marketing point of view  you don t introduce new products in August     Hardly by coincidence  the timing of the war also coincided with the final phase of the Congressional election campaigns that year     One further point deserves mention  Initially  in the run up to the war in 2002  the Administration did not give Congress a National Intelligence Estimatea document summarizing the collective expert wisdom of the intelligence community to support its claims about Iraq s involvement with Al Qaeda and its development of nuclear  chemical  and biological weapons of mass destruction  When Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee insisted on such an Estimate  it was finally providedon October 1  2002  two days before the Congressional resolution authorizing the war was brought before the Senate for debate  The Estimate itself buried important dissenting views in the footnotes     The Senate adopted the war resolution on October 11  the day after it passed the House of Representativesand after six weeks of an aggressive White House campaign replete with images of mushroom clouds over America  in a brazen attempt to pressure Congress to give the President the blank check he wanted for the war  and to do so before adjourning for the November elections    As we now know all too well  Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction and no ties to Al Qaeda  150 000 American troops are bogged down in a quagmire in Iraq in a war that America never should have fought  that has seriously undermined our respect in the world  and that has made the real war on terrorism far harder to win    It is time for the Administration to come clean and provide the PDBs to the Congress      This is not a meaningless debate about documents  The issue is the quality and quantity of intelligence the President was looking at when he made the decision to go to war    It s essential to get to the bottom of the rush to war   not only to get the truth  but also because there are other threats on the horizon as wellin Iran  North Korea and elsewhere  America must get it right next time  and access to the PDBs is an essential part of doing so    President Bush has said that the Congress saw the same intelligence about Iraq more than 100 times in less than two years  Isn t it time the Congress saw what he says we saw      102  Some of the most irresponsible comments about manipulating intelligence have come from politicians who saw the same intelligence we saw  and then voted to authorize the use of force against Saddam Hussein  President Bush  December 14  2005 Woodrow Wilson Center  Washington D C      101  It is irresponsible to say that I deliberately misled the American people when it came
