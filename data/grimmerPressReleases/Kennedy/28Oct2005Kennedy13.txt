         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Today is an ominous day for the country  signifying a new low since Watergate in terms of openness and honesty in our government  This is far more than an indictment of an individual  In effect it s an indictment of the vicious and devious tactics used by the Administration to justify a war we never should have fought  It s an indictment of the lengths Administration officials were willing to go to cover up their failed intelligence  their distortion on Iraq s weapons of mass destruction  and their serious blunders on the war  It is an indictment of their vindictive efforts to discredit anyone who challenge their misrepresentations   The American people know the high cost of this misguided war    2 000 U S  soldiers dead  more than 15 000 wounded  hundreds of billions of dollars spent with no end in sight  and a continuing shameful effort by the White House to silence those who try to tell the truth about the war  Dissent is the ultimate form of patriotism  and it s time we return to having an honest discourse in this country about changing direction and paying attention to the needs of the American people  The President should take this opportunity to do everything he can to heal the country by not interfering with the prosecution of this case or the continuing investigation  and by cleaning house at the White House to immunize the country against any further corruption and dishonesty  As the President promised  anyone still in the White House who had anything to do with this scandalous plot or the cover up should be dismissed immediately  whether or not they have been indicted  Something has to give  America can t stand three more years of this failed Bush presidency   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
