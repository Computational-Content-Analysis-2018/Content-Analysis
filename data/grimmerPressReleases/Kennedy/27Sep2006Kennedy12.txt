         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on military tribunal legislation   In times of war  our obligation is to protect our nation and to protect those men and women who risk their lives to defend us  This bill fails that duty  By failing to renounce torture  it inflames an already dangerous world and makes for America new enemies in our war against terror  This puts our cause  our people and our troops at greater risk  That is why so many respected military leaders oppose this bill    I supported the Armed Service Committee bill that while not perfect  preserved our commitment to the Geneva conventions  limited the possibility that detainees would be treated abusively and set up procedures for military tribunals that generally respected the fundamental requirements of fairness  But instead  the bill that has reached the floor would diminish the security and safety of Americans everywhere   There is no question that the rush to pass this bill    which is the product of secret negotiations with the White House    is about serving a political agenda  That is no way to produce careful and thoughtful legislation on profound issues of national security      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
