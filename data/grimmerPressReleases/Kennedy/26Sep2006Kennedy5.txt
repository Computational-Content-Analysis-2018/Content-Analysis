         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Washington  D C   Today  Senators Edward M  Kennedy  John McCain  Ken Salazar  and Lindsey Graham joined religious leaders at a press conference to discuss the status of comprehensive immigration reform and the need to finalize legislation in this Congress   Religious leaders including Dr  Richard Land  president of The Ethics  Religious Liberty Commission  Rabbi David Saperstein  Director of the Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism  Rev  Jamie Soto  Bishop of Orange  California  and Rev  Dr  Derrick Harkins  pastor of the historic Nineteenth Street Baptist Church joined senators to urge Congress to enact tough  but fair immigration legislation   There is still time in this Congress for us to enact a tough but fair immigration law   These religious leaders know more than most that immigration reform is about our security  but it also must be about our humanity   There are few issues more basic to our faith than how we treat others  not just our fellow citizens  but immigrants as well  Senator Kennedy said   In the last year  I have seen again and again how people of faith have illuminated the moral issues that are at the heart of the immigration debate  They know that this debate should not be about politics but about people    Below are Senator Kennedys remarks as prepared for delivery followed by background information on the religious leaders in attendance   SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY REMARKS PRESS CONFERENCE WITH RELIGIOUS LEADERS ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM  AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY   I am honored to be here today with these distinguished people of faith to emphasize the continuing importance of comprehensive immigration reform   There is still time in this Congress for us to enact a tough but fair immigration law   As these religious leaders make clear  immigration reform is about our security  but it is also about our humanity   There are few issues more basic to our faith than how we treat others  not just our fellow citizens  but immigrants as well   Leviticus teaches us that  The alien living with you must be treated as one of your native born   Love him as yourself  for you were aliens in Egypt   And we remember the words of Christ from St  Matthews Gospel that we are not only to feed the hungry and care for the sick  but to welcome the stranger   And Thomas Merton took that further when he reminded us that we are wiser as people when we not only welcome  but we listen  to the voice of the stranger   That has been our tradition   That has been our faith   And now it is our calling   In the past year  we have seen again and again how people of faith have illuminated the moral issues that are at the heart of the immigration debate   They know that this debate should not be about politics  but about people   They see in their churches that the vast majority of immigrants coming here are hardworking  honorable men and women who contribute to our economy and seek to provide for their families     Without question  our immigration system is broken   But how we fix it has enormous implications for our national security  for our economic vitality  and for who we are as a people and as a nation    The Senators here too deserve great credit for their tenacity in keeping this issue alive  We will not give up until we enact a law that is just and fair   I thank these leaders of faith for their commitment   They  like Isaiah  are the prophets for our time  anointed to preach good news to the poor  bind hearts that are broken  proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners   I thank them for their voice on this issue and I look forward to working with them in the critical days ahead     Dr  Richard Land  Dr  Richard Land is
