         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   D C   Tonight  Senators Pete Domenici and Edward M  Kennedy announced Senate passage of the Mental Health Parity Act  S 558   The new legislation will provide help to more 113 million Americans  and represents a major agreement between the health care community  business leaders  and insurance industry       Senator Domenici said  Extraordinary effort went into getting us to this point   Senate passage of this bill is significant  and I believe sets the stage for us to enact a national policy that will ensure individuals with mental illness have parity between mental health coverage and medical and surgical coverage   It is a matter of simple fairness      Senator Kennedy said  The passage tonight of the Mental Health Parity bill underscores our commitment to treat all patients facing all diseases with the dignity and respect they deserve  This new legislation will bring dramatic new help to millions of Americans who today are denied needed mental health care and treatment  This bill represents a major breakthrough for those with mental health needs  ensuring their access to fair and equitable health insurance           The Mental Health Parity Act of 2007  Summary     This bill will protect over 113 million people across the United States  including the 82 million individuals enrolled in ERISA group health insurance plans who are not protected by State parity laws          This bill expands the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 by ensuring parity for mental health benefits that goes beyond annual and lifetime limits  Under this bill  a group health insurance plan that offers mental health coverage       1   must ensure that the financial requirements applied to mental health benefits are no more restrictive than the financial requirements applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits that the plan covers  Such financial requirements include deductibles  copayments  coinsurance  out of pocket expenses  and annual and lifetime limits  The plan may not establish separate cost sharing requirements that are only applicable to mental health benefits   AND  2   must ensure that the treatment limitations applied to such benefits are no more restrictive than the treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits that the plan covers  Such treatment limitations include limits on the frequency of treatment  number of visits  days of coverage  or other similar limits on the scope and duration of treatment      In and Out of Network     This section is targeted to the ERISA portion of the bill  There is no preemption of State regulated out of network requirements  explicit and implicit  or contractual arrangements  This bill requires that if a group health insurance plan provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health benefits  including substance abuse treatment   and provides such benefits on both an in  and out of  network basis pursuant to the terms of the plan  or coverage   then the group health insurance  plan must ensure that the requirements of this bill are applied to both in  and out of network services by comparing in network medical and surgical benefits to in network mental health benefits and out of network medical and surgical benefits to out of network mental health benefits    Scope of Coverage  The mental health parity requirements apply to group health plans with more than 50 employees  Group health insurance plans with 50 or fewer employees are still under applicable State law      There is a small business exemption  which means that employers with 50 or less employees are exempt from this Act  but are still under the applicable State Law   State insurance laws relating to employers in their State who employed an average of at least 2  or 1 in the case of an employer residing in a State that permits small groups to include a single individual   but not more than 50 employees  are not preempted        Markets Exempt  1       The individual market  2       Small Business market  50 or less employees      Cost Exemption     Group health insurance plans could not permanently opt out of complying with the parity standard  They can only elect to be exempt from parity under this Act for the following plan year if it is projected that the health plan will experience increased actual total costs of coverage under the plan that exceed 2  of the actual total plan costs during the first plan year or exceed 1  of the actual total plan costs each subsequent year  It should be noted that the exemption under this section only applies for one plan year and then the employer must comply with the parity standard again  It should also be noted that an employer may still elect to continue to apply mental health parity even if it meets the threshold for cost exemption      2  cost exemption during the 1st year       1  cost exemption after the initial start up year   Definitions    Mental Health Benefits    means benefits with respect to mental health services  including substance use disorder treatment  as defined under the terms of the plan or coverage  and when applicable  as may be defined under State law to health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan  This definition comes from the 1996 definition of the Mental Health Parity Act  which has been strengthened to reflect that State law definitions will govern when applicable and substance use disorder treatment is included in the definition of mental health benefits   Preemption of State Mental Health Parity Laws  At the State level   financial requirements and treatment limitations with regard to mental health benefits would be preempted by the federal standard so that they are not treated more restrictively than those financial requirements and treatment limitations that are applied to medical and surgical benefits     thus the HIPPA floor is maintained  There is no longer any preemption provisions in this legislation   Audits  The Secretaries of Labor and Health and Human Services must each ensure that random audits of health plans are conducted in order to determine whether health plans are in compliance with this Act   Enforcement  Enforcement is generally the same as it is under current law  Department of Labor  Department of the Treasury  and the Department of Health and Human Services have jurisdiction to enforce this Act  DoL generally makes sure that group health plans are in compliance with the Act  DoT can penalize the employer by imposing an excise tax of  100 for each day with respect to each individual for each act of noncompliance  DHHS can penalize the insurance issuers with a fine that mirrors the excise tax imposed by DoT on employers  but only if a State fails to adequately enforce the bill  Participants in the plan can always bring a claim for injunctive relief against issuers under ERISA  which means that they can try to get the value of benefits under the plan or force the plan to do what it was required to do under law    Effective Date  With respect to group health plans   Beginning in the first plan year that begin on or after January 1 of the first calendar year that begins more than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act    With respect to a State  Effective the same date as it is effective with respect to group health plans    Group Health Plan Ombudsman  Both DoL and DHHS must designate a person within their respective agencies to serve as the group health plan ombudsman whose primary duties is to serve as an initial point of contact to permit individuals to obtain information and provide assistance concerning their coverage of mental health services under group health insurance plans   Government Accountability Office Study   The GAO Study requires the Comptroller General to conduct a study and prepare and submit a report within two years of enactment of this Act  which evaluates the effect that the implementation of this Act has on the cost of health insurance coverage  access to health insurance coverage  including the availability of in network providers   the quality of health care  impact on benefits and coverage for mental health and substance use disorder  the impact of any additional costs or savings to the plan  the impact on out of network coverage for mental health benefits  including substance use disorder treatment   the impact on State mental health benefit mandate laws  other impact on the business community and the Federal Government  and other issues as determined appropriate by the Comptroller General    Regulations  The Secretaries of Labor and Health and Human Services must jointly promulgate regulations within one year after the date that the Act is enacted   Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
