         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner September 26  2006        202  224 2633    Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on Secretary Spellings remarks on the report of the Commission on the Future of Higher Education   I applaud Secretary Spellings call to address the skyrocketing cost of college  Step one of her plan should be to convince the President to immediately increase the Pell Grant to  5100  as he has promised to do repeatedly  Im disappointed  though  that neither the Secretary nor the Commission put forward ideas to reform the most troubling aspect of higher education today  our dysfunctional student loan system  That system squanders billions each year to provide corporate welfare to big lenders  rather than serving the best interests of our students    No conversation about the future of higher education can move forward effectively without addressing this urgent problem  Its time to throw the money changers out of the temple of higher education    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
