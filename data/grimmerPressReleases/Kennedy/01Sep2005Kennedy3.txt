         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy praised Secretary Spelling s decision regarding tutoring and supplemental services under the No Child Left Behind Act  The Department of Education will now allow the Chicago Public Schools to continue on its course to provide quality tutoring and other help to its students  despite the Department s own rule under the No Child Left Behind Act that prohibits schools from being direct providers of these services to the students if the school district fails to meet district wide targets for academic achievement  Senator Kennedy has opposed the Department s NCLB regulation and introduced legislation in September of last year to correct the policy     Senator Kennedy said  I m pleased that Chicago was granted this special consideration  This change will make an enormous difference to Chicago s school children and parents seeking good tutors in school  and I commend Secretary Spellings for taking this action  The next step should be to lift the ban altogether and allow states to pave the way for a greater number of quality school based tutoring programs and greater options for students and parents    In 2002  the U S  Department of Education issued rules under the No Child Left Behind Act to prohibit all schools in a district from serving as tutoring providers under the law  if the school district fails to meet state targets for progress for two consecutive years  The No Child Left Behind Act requires states to select eligible tutoring providers and monitor programs for quality  and the law allows schools to act as tutoring providers  But under the Department s regulation  even a high performing school in a low performing district was barred from providing tutoring services    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
