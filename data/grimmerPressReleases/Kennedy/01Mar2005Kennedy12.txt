         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  we have a lot of urgent problems pressing this nation and this Congress  We have urgent problems with joblessness  We have urgent problems with healthcare  We have urgent problems with education  We have urgent problems dealing with poverty  We have problems that go to the heart of fairness and opportunity in this nation  These are real problems of real people  They test whether our commitment to America s core values is as important to us as we say it is   But we aren t spending this month on any of those issues  We are spending most of the time between now and the March recess on a bill that does nothing about any of these problems  that does nothing for Americans facing job problems and health problems and education problems  We are spending our time on a bill that was written by the credit card industry for the benefit of the credit card industry  We are spending our time on changes in the bankruptcy laws which were opposed by the two distinguished National Commissions which studied those laws during the 1970 s and 1990 s   This is a bill which is opposed by a long list of organizations representing many  many millions of real people  Organizations representing workers  Organizations representing retired Americans  Organizations representing consumers  women s organizations  civil rights organizations  a large group of distinguished law professors  1 700 prominent doctors around the country and even some financial service organizations who are truly responsible lenders and care about their customers   People like the CEO of I N G  Direct  the sixth largest thrift institution in the nation and people like the CEO of the second largest credit union in the U S   the North Carolina State Employees Credit Union   Here is what the CEO of I N G  Direct told the Committee about the bill   The one sided provisions of this bankruptcy legislation are bad news for consumers  But they are also bad news for the financial services industry  Consumers are our customers  By creating a form of debt imprisonment  this bill will hobble the most important player in the world economy    the American consumer   And Jim Blaine  the CEO of the North Carolina State Employees Credit Union has said about this bill  This bird is a turkey   So why are we here  Why are we spending our time on this suppose solution to this non existent problems rather than addressing real problem that the nation faces   It can t be because the credit card industry needs help  The credit card industry is doing fine  thank you  The profits of the credit card industry rose from 6 4 billion dollars in 1990 to 20 5 billion dollars in 2000  By last year those profits had increased another 50 percent to over 30 billion dollars  Let me say that again  credit card company profits have gone from 6 4 billion dollars in 1990 to 30 2 billion dollars last year  So why are we spending our time on legislation designed to further enrich what is already one of the most profitable industries in America at the expense of middle income Americans in financial distress  in most cases through no fault of their own   This is supposed to be a bill about spendthrifts  about people who abuse the credit system and abuse the bankruptcy system  If that were really what the bill was about  maybe there would be some reason for us to be here   If this were a bill that dealt with the truly incredible abuses of the bankruptcy system that we have seen in the Enron case  in the Worldcom case  in the Adelphia case and the Polaroid case in my own state  then maybe there would be a reason to be spending out time working on this bill   Just look at the Polaroid case in my home state of Massachusetts  Polaroid  filed for bankruptcy in 2001  In the months leading up to the company s filing  the corporation made  1 7 million in incentive payments to its chief executive Gary DiCamillo on top of his  840 000 base salary  The company also received bankruptcy court approval to make  1 5 million in payments to senior managers  to keep them on boardthese managers collectively received an additional  3 million when the company s assets were sold off   By contrast  just days before Polaroid filed for bankruptcy  it canceled health and life insurance for more than 6 000 retirees  and canceled health insurance coverage for workers on long term disability  It also stopped severance benefits for thousands of workers who were recently laid off   Polaroid workers had been required to put 8  of their pay into the company s Employee Stock Ownership Plan  ESOP   When the company declined  their retirement savings were virtually wiped out   That s a real abuse of the bankruptcy system   But this bill is not about consumers who abuse the system  And it is not about corporate executives who have exploited the system to line their own pockets   This is a bill through which the credit card industry hopes to squeeze an extra few hundred dollars a month out of Americans who are down on their luck  people who have been hit hard by medical disasters  guardsmen and reservists who have suddenly been called to duty to serve their nation  forcing them to leave their families and businesses behind  people who were fired after years of hard work because their employers sent their jobs abroad   This not what the U S  Senate should be doing  This legislation is not worthy of the U S  Senate  Our time should be spent helping  not hurting the working families most in need   This bill does nothing to protect those hard working Americans who did everything they could to stave off bankruptcy  but were left with no other choice after exhausting their own resources  Yet this Republican bill actually makes it more difficult for good citizens like these to get the fresh start that the bankruptcy laws are intended to offer   The idea of a fresh start lies at the heart of our bankruptcy law  In 1833  Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story  one of the great legal scholars in our history  explained why  Bankruptcy laws  he said  were intended to divide debtors  remaining assets among their creditors  when they could not pay all their debts  But the purpose was also to relieve unfortunate and honest debtors from perpetual bondage to their creditors  Bankruptcy legislation  he said  should relieve the debtor from a slavery of mind and body  which  robs his family of the fruits of his labour   One hundred years later  the Supreme Court emphasized Justice Story s views  The Bankruptcy Act  it said  is intended to relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness  and permit him to start afresh free from the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes  The power to earn a living  the Court said  is a personal liberty  and from the viewpoint of the wage earner there is little difference between not earning at all and earning wholly for a creditor   In short  the same fundamental values which led this nation to abolish debtors  prisons  also led us to offer debtors a fresh start  They would be required to use their available assets to pay as much of their debt as they could  but no more  They would have full rights to their own future earnings  so that they would not have to live in perpetual bondage to their past debtors   That is the essence of our free enterprise system  We encourage entrepreneurs  People can borrow money for a car to go to work  for equipment to start a small business  for a tractor to run a farm  for a boat to start a fishing business  When decent people run into financial trouble  we don t write them off forever  We help them get back on their feet so they can provide for their families and contribute to our economy once again  Otherwise  few in America take the risks that our free enterprise depends on  There s a safety net to stop a free fall   Yet this legislation turns its back on that spirit of American entrepreneurship  It tells our citizens that they cannot get that fresh start unless they can maneuver  through a maze of procedural obstacles created by the credit card companies and debt collection agencies  It imposes paperwork burdens that bankrupt Americans can t afford  It forces them to pay for credit counselors  who may be predatory themselves  It forces them to miss work to go to audits of their meager assets  It requires them to hire a lawyer to navigate this maze  but then tells the lawyer that any error will make the lawyer personally liable   In short  this bill does everything the mind of the purveyors of predatory plastic could think up to make their cardholders pay in full  and prevent them from getting the fresh start that bankruptcy offers them  Its purpose is to keep the credit card payments rolling in  and prevent that money from being used to feed their children or pay their hospital bills or make their mortgage payments  It labels them as abuses of the system   Just listen to the words in the summary of the key standard for the means test that lies at the heart of this bill  According to this summary  prepared by the Congressional Research Service  you are presumed to be an abuser of the system  if current monthly income  excluding allowed deductions  secured debt payments  and priority unsecured debt payments  multiplied by 60  would permit a debtor to pay not less than the lesser of  a  25  of nonpriority unsecured debt or  6000  or  100 a month   whichever is greater  or  b   10 000   Maybe some people can figure that out    most can t  But that convoluted paragraph determines whether your debts can be discharged in bankruptcy  or not   This bill is flawed from top to bottom  That is why  since it was first presented to Congress by the credit card industry  it has been opposed by bankruptcy judges  legal scholars  consumer advocates  labor unions  and civil rights groups  They all recognize that its harsh and excessive provisions will have a devastating effect on working families   It allows credit card companies to put their profits ahead of the well being of our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  Since 9 11 about half a million reservists and members of the National Guard have been called to active duty  half a world away from their homes and businesses  Many of their families are suddenly facing economic hardship  and their creditors keep calling  They re serving far away  and the small businesses they ran are running into trouble  This bill does nothing to protect the men and women who are fighting for us   When one reservist left home  his wife had to start leading his construction company  and the company ran into trouble  Their family income plummeted by 80   They lost their savings  lost their credit  and the business is on the rocks    all because a soldier served his country  The troubles of families like that will be even more serious under this bill  Instead of helping to ease the burden  it treats that family like tax evaders or defrauders   This Republican bill also penalizes innocent victims of today s economy  We re still recovering from the 2001 recession  Nearly 8 million Americans are still unemployed  One in five of those workers has been out of work for more than six months  The unemployment insurance safety net they rely on hasn t been updated to meet today s demands  Jobs in health care  financial services  and information technology are being shipped overseas   Workers who lose their jobs today have great difficulty finding a new job with comparable wages  benefits  hours  and overall quality  Part time jobs don t begin to provide the same financial stability    yet today s companies are relying more and more on part time workers to cut costs  The average part time worker earns  4 an hour less than a regular full time worker  Few part time workers have a health insurance plan or a pension plan   Huge numbers of working families are being squeezed hard by the current economy  Their ability to live the American dream is increasingly out of reach with each passing year  They find it harder and harder to earn a living    to pay the mortgage    pay the rent    pay their medical bill    pay their food bill    pay their gasoline bill    pay the college bill  Yet the cost of getting by continues to rise faster than family income   Health care costs are out of reach  Health insurance premiums have soared 59 percent in the past four years  Drug costs have soared 65 percent   Housing costs rose 33 percent in the last four years  Child care can often cost up to  10 000 a year for one child    more than the cost of tuition at a public college  College costs are rising at double digit rates  Tuition at public colleges has risen 35 percent in the last four years   Today  hardworking families are balancing on a precarious tower of bills that keep piling  Inevitably  many topple over  They go into debt just to get by  The average family now spends 13 percent of its income to pay debts  the highest percentage since 1986  The average household is now more than  8 000 in credit card debt  More than half of all Americans acknowledge they have too much debt  Three quarters of them say that debt is a major reason it s harder to achieve the American dream today  It s no wonder so many families face bankruptcy   This year  more people will end up in bankruptcy than suffer a heart attack  More people will file for bankruptcy than graduate from college  More children will grow up in families facing bankruptcy than in families facing divorce   Many of us feel the Bush Administration is bankrupt in more ways than one  Its reckless policies are bankrupting the economy and literally bankrupting millions of families  Bankruptcy is up 33 percent since President Bush took office  An American now goes bankrupt every 19 seconds  In Massachusetts  there s a bankruptcy every half hour   One of the greatest weaknesses of this bill is its failure to address the issue of bankruptcies caused by serious illness or injury  Illness is bankrupting millions of Americans who ve done everything right  They ve worked hard  played by the rules  earned a good salary  saved their money  even purchased health insurance    only to find all that is not enough   More than half of all families facing bankruptcy today are facing it because of overwhelming medical costs  They re not irresponsible spendthrifts who bought too much at the mall  or were enticed to go in over their heads in debt by a credit card solicitation they couldn t say no to  They re facing bankruptcy because of a sudden serious illness or a severe injury that caused a mountain of debt they couldn t afford   The average American facing a serious illness is burdened with more than  13 000 of out of pocket expenses  even though they have health insurance  If you have cancer  it s  35 000  That s money you have to pay out of your own pocket for expenses not covered by your health insurance   If the bill before us passes  those fellow citizens will be penalized twice    once by the failure of the health care system and a second time by the failure of the bankruptcy laws  This bill will only make the second failure even worse   We need to make sure that bankruptcy continues to be available as a safety net for those Americans    men and women who have spent down their savings on a serious injury or illness  who face huge doctor and hospital bills their insurance didn t cover  who are unable to go back to work after suffering serious medical problems   They are people like April Wetherell  a 50 year old woman from Toms River  New Jersey  who went back to school after raising her children and received her Masters Degree in Social Work  She was serving as a visiting nurse two years ago  when she suffered a stroke while recovering from knee surgery  The stroke left her unable to speak  work  or care for her own needs  At the time  April still owed  25 000 in student loans  She had been making payments faithfully on her student loans until her illness left her unable to return to her job  Her health insurance didn t cover all her medical costs  and she was left with more than  20 000 in unpaid medical bills  At the time of her stroke  she had about  7 000 in credit card debt  which she had been paying off on time  Even though she had done all the right things  she was forced into bankruptcy because of her serious  incapacitating illness   Walton Pinkney of Frederick  Maryland  has been an electrician for more than 10 years  He changed jobs in 2000  and his new employer did not provide health benefits for the first 90 days of employment  Sadly  Walton suffered heart failure during his first month on his new job  His new health plan had not yet taken effect  and he was responsible for more than  45 000 in medical expenses for his heart condition  He tried to return to work  but his employer said his health was too uncertain for him to return  Faced with large medical bills he could not pay after he lost his job  he had to file for bankruptcy in 2003   Zoraya Marrero is a single mother with three children from Woodbridge  Virginia  Her oldest child suffers from spina bifida  She received state disability benefits and medical coverage for her child due to the illness  After moving to another state five years ago  she no longer qualified for new benefits  and she also had to pay back  60 000 for benefits she had already received  She has been fighting the  60 000 claim and paying her own medical expenses while working in a doctor s office  She can t afford private insurance  and can t afford to pay for her son s costly medical care  Overwhelmed by debt  she filed for bankruptcy   These people had no intention of seeking relief in bankruptcy  They were not gaming the system to avoid their responsibilities  They and millions of other Americans in similar circumstances filed for bankruptcy but only after they d exhausted all the other options    not because they wanted to  but because they had to   In fact  before declaring bankruptcy  they had spent at least two years  on average  making very real sacrifices in a futile effort to pay for their health care and make ends meet  One in five went without food  Almost one third had their electricity shut off  Almost half lost their phone service  And many more went without needed medical care  Some even moved their elderly parents to less comfortable nursing homes   We often talk in America about safety nets  Social Security is a safety net to guarantee financial security for senior citizens  Poverty programs are safety nets for children and families  Our bankruptcy laws are a safety net for millions of families too   Americans who live responsibly  do everything right  and still suddenly fall on hard times deserve a second chance  and the bankruptcy laws give them that chance  They can make a fresh start  and pull themselves back up  They have renewed hope for the future   Unexpected financial setbacks for families should not mean the end of their American dream  They should not lose all hope for themselves and their children  It s the old cowboy up philosophy    when you fall off your horse  you pick yourself up  dust yourself off  and start all over again   When disaster strikes  when storms buffet a community  Americans respond  We see the images on television and immediately we send a donation to help out  That s the American spirit   But when financial disaster strikes a family    when a business collapses  when medical bills pile up  when a reservist is called up for extended active duty  when workers lose their jobs because of a plant closing or outsourcing    these economic catastrophes can be hidden from view  That s where our bankruptcy laws come in  We got rid of debtors  prisons almost two centuries ago for a reason  It s the American spirit to help these families through financial disasters   But this bill will destroy that financial safety net for many  many citizens who deserve help   It s so typically Republican  They refuse to provide unemployment benefits to workers who have been laid off and are looking for new jobs   They refuse to raise the minimum wage  They don t agree that no one who works for a living should have to live in poverty   They allocate billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthy  but they look the other way when hard working families are struggling to send their children to college  or struggling to pay the high cost of health care   Now  our Republican colleagues want to remove a key part of the safety net for millions of our fellow citizens    the ability to start over when life deals you a serious financial setback   This legislation is a bonanza for banks and credit card companies  and a nightmare for millions of average Americans  It rewrites the bankruptcy laws in a way that kicks average families while they re down  in order to pad the already high profits of the credit card industry and other lenders  It s greed  pure and simple   Predatory credit card companies are doing all they can to urge unsuspecting citizens to pile up huge debts on their credit cards  They especially target the elderly  college students  and the working poor  They advertise nationwide  They send out billions of solicitations every year to entice more people to sign up for their cards  The bold type talks about the minimum monthly payments    but you have to read the fine print to see the exorbitant interest payments that inevitably result   You cannot go to any college campus  any sporting event  or your mailbox without being solicited for another credit card  no matter how many you already have  Young students  still in their teens  are greeted with a deluge of offers from credit card companies  Before they buy books and find the cafeteria  they see credit card offers with credit limits in the thousands of dollars   So  in many cases  the very same companies that have been trying to get a bill like this passed for decades and had their lobbyists write this bill for them in 1997  are the ones who caused the indebtedness that they now complain about   A lot has changed since the Senate last looked at this bill four years ago  Health costs are way up  health insurance protection is less obtainable and less affordable  hundreds of thousands of families have suffered economically from military call ups  unemployment insurance has not been updated  The economy is still working its way out of a serious down turn and corporate mismanagement and fraud have become a way of life in the highest echelons of corporate America   So I say to each of my colleagues  please consider who wrote this bill  and why  Please think about your hard working constituents who will be dealt a double whammy by this bill if they fall upon hard times  Please think about what has happened since we last considered this bill  Please keep an open mind as we discuss the serious problems with this bill and the need for many substantial revisions and additions before it is ready even to be considered for adoption by this body   We do not work for the credit card companies  we work for our constituents  We can do better than this bill for our constituents  we must do better than this bill for our constituents   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner
