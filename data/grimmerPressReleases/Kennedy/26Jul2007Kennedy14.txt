         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  DC Yesterday  Senators Kennedy  Snowe  Rockefeller  Warner  and Cantwell introduced a bill to encourage states to modernize their unemployment insurance systems  The Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act would make  7 billion in incentive payments available to states to encourage them to expand eligibility for benefits and provide training to workers struggling with long term unemployment In todays insecure economy  too many working families are just one pink slip away from falling into poverty  While our unemployment insurance program has always been a bedrock of security for working families in troubling times  the system has not kept pace with our changing economy  It leaves many workers  especially low wage workers  out in the cold  unable to collect benefits  Senator Kennedy said  Our bill would encourage states to update their unemployment insurance systems to address the new challenges facing workers  It would help long term unemployed workers get the training they need to find new jobs  And it would give states the resources and flexibility they need to revitalize their programs and better serve working families The Unemployment Insurance Program is vital tool that provides millions of American workers with benefits each year and we must ensure that this system evolves over time to take into account major changes in our economy  said Senator Snowe  This legislation is a critical investment to help families in Maine and across the country get the help they need in periods of instability  By modernizing the UI Program  we are encouraging states to improve resources and increase flexibility to help American workers stay on their feet and support their families Unemployment insurance is a crucial safety net for those who have lost their jobs  More than anything it provides valuable peace of mind to families that they can continue to make ends meet  put food on their table and take care for their kids  Senator Rockefeller said  But the program is more than just financial assistance  its also about training and education programs  Our legislation will provide states with the resources needed to update their programs so they better reflect the challenges of our modern economy Senator Warner said  In periods of unemployment  workers need a sound program of training and benefits to find new and rewarding opportunities  This bill will provide important resources to states like Virginia  as they improve their programs to help workers and their families in times of need Senator Cantwell said  We have an obligation to provide families with a safety net that meets the demands of todays changing economy  Too many people today are struggling to make their house payments and put food on the table while they worry about where the next paycheck will come from  This legislation gives states the federal resources they need to modernize the nations unemployment system so we can provide critical support to families during these economic times Below is a summary of the bill  The Unemployment Insurance Modernization ActThe Unemployment Insurance  UI  program must be reformed to address fundamental shifts in the economy  The UI system provides needed benefits to millions of U S  workers each year  But the system needs to be updated to better assist todays more highly mobile workforce and long term unemployed workers left behind by declining industries  Today  many unemployed workers do not qualify for benefits because their most recent work is not taken into account  Others exhaust their benefits before finding work  joining 1 1 million long term unemployed workers and an additional 1 5 million discouraged job seekers struggling to get by  For these reasons  only 35  of unemployed workers currently collect unemployment benefits  The UI Modernization Act uses  7 billion in incentive payments to encourage states to update their UI systems  The bill rewards states for   1  removing barriers that block coverage for low wage and part time workers   2  ensuring a more family friendly UI system  and  3  helping dislocated workers increase their skills  It also provides  500 million in funding to states to improve the administration of their unemployment compensation systems  The incentive and administrative payments are both fully paid for from the UI trust fund and through an extension of the existing FUTA surtax  assumed in the Presidents budget  The UI Modernization Act would give states the resources and flexibility they need to pass important reforms  Each state would have a chance to receive a share of the  7 billion set aside for incentive payments  To receive one third of its allotted funds  a state must adopt an alternative base period allowing workers to meet eligibility requirements by counting their most recent wages  This makes the system  which has traditionally relied on wage data that is up to six months old  more accurate and helps workers who have recently satisfied earnings requirements to collect the benefits they deserve  States that have already adopted such a system would also receive these incentive payments States that adopt or have adopted two of the following reforms benefiting workers will receive the additional two thirds of their share of funds  Family related needs  Providing unemployment compensation for workers who have voluntarily left their jobs due to the illness or disability of an immediate family member  the relocation of a spouse for employment  or domestic violence  Job training  Providing training benefits to unemployed workers laid off from a declining occupation who are enrolled in a state approved training program for entry into a high demand occupation  Part time work  Providing unemployment compensation benefits to individuals seeking part time work   Uniform 26 weeks  Raising maximum compensation caps so that all long term unemployed workers can receive a full 26 weeks of benefits  Child Assistance  Paying unemployed workers at least an extra  15 per week for each of the workers dependents      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
