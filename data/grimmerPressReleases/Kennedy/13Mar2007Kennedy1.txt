Making  an example of New Bedford workers doesn t solve the problemBy Senator  Edward M  KennedyAs it appears in The New Bedford Standard TimesTuesday   March 13  2007 On Sunday afternoon  in the basement of Our Lady of  Guadalupe in New Bedford  I saw first hand the pain and suffering of the  families and community ripped apart by the actions of the Department of Homeland  Security  In my 45 years of public life  this was one of the most heartbreaking  scenes I have ever witnessed  Babies were screaming for their mothers  Wives  were desperately searching for information about their husbands  One father  tearfully described the agony and sleeplessness of his young children who  couldn t understand why their mother had disappeared  Shock  confusion and  despair were the order of the day  I was reminded of the tragedy and  human suffering that we all witnessed after the devastation wreaked by Hurricane  Katrina  Such human tragedy is heartbreaking when it is caused by a natural  disaster  But when it is the product of a government agency s failures  it is  utterly unconscionable  These men and women had not harmed anyone  They  were victims of exploitation  forced to work under barbaric conditions by an  employer who knew that they could not afford to complain  Their children  many  of whom are United States citizens  had done nothing wrong at all  None of them  had any reason to expect that the Department of Homeland Security would decide  to make an example out of them  This is the haphazard way DHS handles  the problem of illegal immigration  They have said that they had planned this  raid for months  but had made no provision to house the workers they arrested   Instead  the workers were rounded up and immediately transported by DHS to Texas  and other states  far from their families  without even an opportunity to say  goodbye  The DHS knew that many of these workers had children at home  but they  did not do nearly enough to protect them  As a result  children came back to  empty homes  at least one nursing baby went to the hospital with dehydration   and hundreds cried themselves to sleep  wondering where their loved ones were  and why they had disappeared  The treatment of these workers is sharply  different from the treatment given so far to the owner of Michael Bianco  Inc   His factory abused undocumented workers for years  and he reaped lucrative  government contracts made even more profitable by underpaying and overworking  the undocumented  However  he is now free on bail and was free to take a trip to  Puerto Rico  There is no clearer proof that our immigration system is badly  broken  It is swift to punish a handful of exploited workers  but slow and  uncertain in addressing the employers who exploit them  Clearly  the time has  come to address these inequities  We must enforce our nation s  immigration laws  But the raids in New Bedford and elsewhere are merely a  stopgap solution that unfairly penalizes vulnerable workers in an already flawed  system  There are 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States   Arresting 300 of them may generate some headlines for DHS  but such raids do not  begin to solve the immigration issue  To make real progress  I have  proposed comprehensive immigration reform  That legislation will create a  program whereby undocumented workers who are already in the United States can  earn legalization by working and paying taxes over many years  It will also hold  employers accountable for verifying the immigration status of the workers they  hire  and significantly increase penalties against employers who hire and  exploit undocumented workers  Such legislation offers a practical alternative to  the chaos of the current system  Today  we must pull together just as we  did in the wake of Hurricane Katrina  The administration must not flee the scene  of this disaster  Instead  DHS must be held accountable for its failure to take  adequate steps to protect innocent children from the fallout from this raid  We  owe that much to our neighbors in New Bedford  and to workers in communities  across the country who have experienced similar raids  I have also asked DHS to  meet with me  the rest of the Massachusetts congressional delegation  Governor  Deval Patrick and Mayor Scott Lang this week to explore immediately what can be  done to reunite families and restore some order to their lives  These workers  may lack documents  but they do not lack dignity  and they do not lack  friends   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
