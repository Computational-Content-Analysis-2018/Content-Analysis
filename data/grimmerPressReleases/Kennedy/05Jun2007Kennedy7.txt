         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Gang violence is a serious problem in many communities across the nation  and it deserves a serious response by Congress  We need a range of initiatives including aggressive steps to take guns out of the hands of criminal gang members and other violent offenders  and effective prevention programs that discourage gang membership and provide realistic alternatives for at risk youth  Today  the Committee hears testimony from one of my constituents who is a leading expert with extensive experience on this issue   Gregg Croteau  the first Executive Director of the United Teen Equality Center in Lowell  Massachusetts  The Center serves over 150 teens every day in a community where there are over 25 30 active locally based gangs  Working with state and city leaders  the Center created a Streetworker Peacemaking Project to bring rival gang members together for Peace Summits  These Summits have provided an unprecedented opportunity to bring teens together to build the relationships necessary to end the ongoing violence and move forward in a more positive direction individually and together  In 2006  Gregg Croteaus leadership resulted in national recognition by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation  The same year  he received the Fernando Miranda Award as the Massachusetts Outreach Educator of the Year  Reflecting the continuing commitment of the Center as a youth led organization  Gregg is joined here by his staff members Juan Carlos Rivera  the Director of Streetworker Operations and two young people directly affected by gang violence and now working to make a difference  Sako Long  who now acts as a Streetworker Supervisor and Ricky Le  who recovered from his own experience with gang violence to become an inspiring ambassador for preventing itGreggs testimony  and the compelling experiences of those involved with the Center  demonstrate the need for Congress to give equal attention and funding to prevention and intervention measures along with any suppression oriented approaches  As another example of what works  I urge my colleagues to consider the innovative  cooperative crime fighting strategy developed in Boston during the 1990s  It engaged the entire community  police and probation officers  clergy and community leaders  even gang members  in a united effort to reduce gang violence  strengthen after school prevention programs  and take guns out of the hands of juvenile offenders  The strategy also established new and effective channels of communication between the police and neighborhood leaders  The strategy was very successful  juvenile homicides dropped 80 percent from 1990 to 1995  It succeeded without prosecuting more juveniles as adults  without housing nonviolent juvenile offenders in adult detention facilities  and without spending large sums of money on new juvenile detention facilities  Over the next decade  Boston  like many other cities across the country  struggled to maintain funding for these effective programs  Yet the current Administration made dramatic cuts in funding for local law enforcement  and even suggested cutting off funds to the Community Oriented Policing Services program entirely  The resulting decline in federal and state and local law enforcement undermined the ability of Massachusetts and other states to combat violent crime  Now  Boston is working constantly and creatively under the leadership of Mayor Menino to revive these programs  Hopefully  we will receive funding in this Congress to support the COPS program and other federal programs that provide the assistance that state and local law enforcement need A report by the Massachusetts Legislatures Joint Committee on Public Safety in 2006 concluded unequivocally that successful anti gang programs depend on a wide variety of solutions  Relying on recommendations by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention  the report noted that preventing youth from joining gangs is the most cost effective long term strategy  Reflecting input from an investigative hearing and a working group of ten mayors in metropolitan Boston  the report recognized that there is no silver bullet for combating gang violence  For this reason  it is misguided for Congress to enact measures that do not recognize the need for flexible and creative solutions to crime in our neighborhoods  Congress cant ignore these successful efforts to stop gang violence  Since different communities find different ways to combat these difficult issues  we should not adopt a one size fits all approach that will only make the current problem of gang violence worse  Instead of ignoring the primary role of state and local governments in fighting violent gang crimes in their communities  Congress should give local law enforcement and prosecutors the resources they need by authorizing grants for units of local government  along with community based programs  For this reason  I urge the Committee to authorize grants to support comprehensive strategies to improve prevention  intervention  diversion and re entry for youth  including alternative programs for first time nonviolent offenders  penalties such as mandated participation in community service  restitution  counseling  and education prevention programs  We also need regional  multi disciplinary approaches to combat gang violence through coordinated programs for prevention and intervention  coordinated law enforcement  and regional gang task forces and crime mapping strategies  including focused prosecutions and reintegration strategies for offender reentry  All of these approaches should be essential parts of any legislation dealing with federal responses to gang violence Witness relocation and protection are also important  The urgency of preventing witness intimidation in gang related cases cant be overstated  Effective prosecution of such violence depends upon it  Congress should respect the primary role of state and local governments in fighting street crime  while recognizing that violent gangs can have a substantial impact on federal interests  According to the most recent National Drug Threat Assessment  criminal street gangs are responsible for the distribution of much of the cocaine  methamphetamine  heroin  and other illegal drugs distributed in communities throughout the United States  Such gang activity interferes with lawful commerce and undermines the freedom and security of entire communities  I commend the important decision by Senator Feinstein and the co sponsors of this legislation to avoid increasing mandatory minimum sentences or unnecessarily expanding the federal death penalty to include state murder offenses in the bill introduced in this Congress  Its also very significant that she has removed the troubling provision from her previous bills that would have changed federal laws governing the transfer of juveniles into adult court  We must not forget that the federal government still has the ability to prosecute youths as adults  despite what we know about the need for different standards and procedures for juvenile offenders Just over a century ago  the nations first juvenile court was opened by reformers in Chicago were concerned about the incarceration of juveniles with adults  From the start  the juvenile justice system was founded on the basic principle that troubled children are not just little adults  They have different needs than adult prisoners  So our nation made a commitment that has endured across generations  to provide treatment and rehabilitation  as well as safe conditions of confinement  to vulnerable and troubled youth in our society  Twenty years ago  Congress passed a law removing young people from adult jails  We have respected the important role of judges in deciding the best course of action for each young offender  But today  this progress is at risk  too  Many states are reducing the discretion of judges in juvenile cases  At least 29 states have enacted statutes that exclude large categories of cases from the jurisdiction of juvenile courts  As a result  more and more children are being forced into the adult system  More than 7 000 child prisoners now live alongside adult criminals  The number of youths under 18 in adult jails has nearly tripled in the last fifteen years  When confined with adults  however  juveniles are five times more likely to be victims of sexual assault than in juvenile facilities  The suicide rate of children in adult prisons is seven times higher  We all want to be keep our communities safe  and no one wants dangerous criminals roaming the streets  whether they are adults or juveniles  But the record is very  very clear  The best way to ensure that young offenders will remain harmful to society upon release is to lock them up with adults   A few weeks ago  the Senate recognized the 40th anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision of In re Gault in 1967 declaring that children accused of delinquent acts have a constitutional right to counsel  Before that decision  children accused of delinquency had virtually no legal rights  They were at the mercy of a legal system that often led to unjust results  In that decision  the Court recognized  for the first time    that the constitutional protections of due process give juveniles the right to fundamental procedural safeguards in juvenile courts  including the right to advance notice of the charges against them  the right to counsel  the privilege against self incrimination  and the right to confront and cross examine witnesses  Today  too many children still appear in court without the benefit of well funded and well trained legal counsel  and too many appear in court with no counsel at all  The federal government should support strategies to improve the juvenile justice system that recognize the unique nature of childhood and adolescence in order to meet the goals set forth in the Gault decision  We should also renew our commitment to continuing and building on the legacy of Gault by addressing the disparities that remain  Im not convinced that changes in the current federal penalties would be necessary and effective  I havent heard any adequate justification for expanding federal prosecutions and incarcerations  without any careful analysis of what the impact of a new federal gang crime would mean  Every week  the Department of Justice sends out notices of gangs being prosecuted under RICO  Im concerned about efforts to create new gang crimes outside of the existing RICO statute  As Acting United States Attorney George S  Cardona stated in a Drug Enforcement Administration press release last year  The RICO statute has proven to be the perfect tool to take the leadership of the Vineland Boys off the streets and put them into federal prisons  With criminal street gangs gaining sophistication and extending their reach across international borders  law enforcement must react with increasingly strong tools to combat their criminal acts and senseless acts of violence  The RICO statute has  in this case  been used to make dramatic changes in our neighborhoods It is wrong to put all our eggs in one basket  Any federal legislation considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee on this issue should provide authorization for appropriations for gang prevention and intervention  not just additional authorizations for prosecutions  I urge the my colleagues on the Committee to support approaches that put equal emphasis on prevention of gang violence  and to focus also on the root causes of poverty  racism and poor education that are at the core of violence in our communities  We should all be very concerned about any suggestion that we need to federalize our state and local juvenile justice systems  or that new gang crimes are really necessary as a solution to the complex problem       Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
