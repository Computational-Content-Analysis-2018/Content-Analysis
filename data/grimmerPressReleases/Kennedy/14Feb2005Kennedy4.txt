         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Washington  DC  Senator Edward M  Kennedy joined 29 other senators to denounce the Bush Administration s decision to stop collecting data on women workers  The Bush Administration has announced that they are eliminating the most reliable source of employment data on women workers by removing the women worker series from the Current Employment Statistics program at the Bureau of Labor Statistics  The senators  including three Republicans  expressed in a letter that this employment information on women is vital to end the long standing economic discrimination against women in our society     Kennedy believes the Administration continually hides the facts in order to make the economy seem stronger  this decision is just par for the course  They recently announced that they will no longer collect data on migrant farm workers and will stop collecting separate data on the employment and wages of managers and non managers  After 2001 they stopped collecting data on temp workers  part time workers  and independent contractors  and in 2002 they tried to stop collecting data on workers who lost their jobs in mass layoffs or plant closings  and only continued collecting the data after Congress forced them to do so  And last August  they released the Census Bureau s poverty and health insurance numbers a month early to avoid delivering bad economic news during the fall election campaign    In addition to the letter below Senator Kennedy issued the following statement     Congress will not allow the Bush Administration to continue to pull the wool over Americans  eyes  They perpetually cover up the truth or stop the collection of key data in order to paint a rosier economic picture  This latest decision is another indication of the Bush Administration s disregard for working women and the discrimination they face in the workplace  Instead of working to eliminate gender inequality  the Administration is trying to obscure from the public the position of women in the American workforce  Congress and the American people won t stand for it  we urge the Administration to reconsider its decision        The Letter follows        February 9  2005   Kathleen P  Utgoff   Commissioner   U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics   Postal Square Building   2 Massachusetts Ave NE   Washington  DC 20212 0001    Dear Commissioner Utgoff    We are writing to express our concern about the Bureau s plans to discontinue the gender series in the Current Employment Statistics  CES  program  We strongly urge you to continue to collect these data     Comprehensive and accurate gender employment information is vital to end the long standing economic discrimination against women in our society  Women today earn 76 cents for every dollar earned by men  They work disproportionately in lower paying occupations  and have far lower lifetime earnings than men  Congress  researchers  and policymakers across the country need the CES data to understand gender inequality in the workforce  and guide us in our efforts to eliminate it    The recent recession marked the start of the only period of sustained job loss for women in the last forty years  At a time when women s employment may be changing in fundamental ways  we should be expanding    not limiting    our ability to understand the evolving role of women in the nation s labor force    The CES data are the best available data on employment trends  and are indispensable to policymakers and researchers on the issue  The Current Population Survey is not an adequate substitute  Economists widely agree that the Bureau s Payroll Survey provides a far more accurate view of general employment trends than the Population Survey  As you yourself testified to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee in 2003  the payroll survey provides more reliable information on the current trend in wage and salary employment than the household survey  because the payroll survey has a larger sample and is linked to the total employment count based on records of the unemployment insurance tax     You have indicated that eliminating the gender series is necessary so that the Bureau can reduce the burden of the survey on employers  But that benefit is miniscule compared to the significant loss caused by the elimination of the data series  The gender series is only a small portion of a survey that  by your own estimate  takes only seven minutes to fill out  Companies with 100 or more employees already have to submit EEO 1 forms detailing the gender breakdown of their workforce  In smaller companies  it is little burden to see the number of male and female employees      In light of the special importance of the gender series  we urge you to continue to collect and provide these needed data         Sincerely      Edward M  Kennedy         Olympia J  Snowe    Richard J  Durbin   Susan Collins   Tom Harkin          Lisa Murkowski   Christopher J  Dodd         Barbara A  Mikulski
