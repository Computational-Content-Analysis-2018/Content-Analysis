         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I applaud Mayor Menino s efforts to address the growing health disparities in our communities  This nation is facing a health care crisis  All Americans wonder whether the next illness will send them into bankruptcy  or leave a loved one without the care they need  Minority Americans are often not just left wondering  but actually living this crisis each and every day  This is America  where all citizens are equal  Today s commitment to understanding the challenges in minority communities is a key step toward ensuring that everyone in Massachusetts has access to quality and affordable health care and will continue to put this nation on the course of full equality for all Americans   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
