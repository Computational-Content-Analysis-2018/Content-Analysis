         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  Senate Democrats led by Senators Edward M  Kennedy and Jack Reed offered an amendment to the Tax Reconciliation bill to provide 2 92 billion dollars in federal assistance to low income and elderly residents for energy assistance  The funding would be paid for by using windfall profits from oil companies seeing record profits this year  This is the fourth amendment this year that Senator Kennedy has offered in support of providing energy assistance dollars to America s low income and elderly residents in preparation for the long winter months ahead     LIHEAP  the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  grants aid to low income families who can t afford the steep cost of energy  The number of households receiving this assistance has increased from 4 million in 2002 to 5 million this year  the highest level in ten years     Providing energy assistance to the poorest citizens of this country during the harsh winter months should be America s top priority  but sadly the Administration continues to focus on misplaced priorities  Senator Kennedy said  In spite of Katrina  the Administration continues to close their eyes to the long term needs of the poor    Families throughout the nation are likely to face higher heating bills this winter  On average  households heating primarily with natural gas will pay about  350  48 percent  more this winter for heat  and those relying primarily on oil will pay about  378  32 percent  more  Forecasts of a cold winter and high fuel costs mean that the elderly  the disabled  and many others will be forced to make painful choices between heating their homes and paying for food  health care  and rent    unless we act now    The Bush Administration has closed their eyes to the long term needs of the poor  freezing LIHEAP funds and cutting the Community Services Block Grant  According to ABCD  a community action agency in Massachusetts whose neighborhood network handles the outreach and application process for LIHEAP  the cut in Community Services Block Grant funding through the Continuing Resolution means that access to this critical survival resource will shrink by more than 70   Up to 10 500 householdsout of a current total of 15 000 recipients  may not get their benefits    Senator Kennedy Floor remarks in support of the amendment follow  as well as statistics on how LIHEAP assistance affects Americans     Statement of Senator Edward M  Kennedy on LIHEAP November 17  2005  As prepared for delivery    While our Republican colleagues propose to slash low income programs even further to pad the pockets of the wealthy  Democrats continue to focus on the urgent needs of the most vulnerable in our society     LIHEAPthe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Programis a case in point  Time and time again  Democrats have voted overwhelmingly to increase funds for LIHEAP  and time and time again  our Republican colleagues have voted no    Winter is coming  and it could easily become a perfect storm of high energy prices  bitter cold  and too little heat for those in need  Unless we act now  the poor across the country may well become the victims of a major aftershock from the Hurricanes in the Gulf    Unfortunately  it s clear that Republican priorities do not include the needs of the poor  In October  OMB Director Joshua Bolten held a press conference to discuss the President s plans for a supplemental appropriations bill  When asked if the President planned to include funds for low income home energy assistance in his supplemental package  Director Bolten replied  Gee  I forget what LIHEAP stands for  but the heating and energy assistance program  I guess    there is not a request contained in this reallocation for that purpose     There s no excuse for the Bush Administration and the Republican Congress to look the other way in the face of worsening povertybut they do  They haven t even taken the time to learn the name of the program that could keep millions of Americans warm this winter if it s properly funded    LIHEAP was created over 20 years ago to prevent low income families from making impossible choices between heat  food  health care  or rent  But federal funding for LIHEAP has been stagnant for over a decade  even as the need for assistance has risen constantly  As a result  the purchasing power of LIHEAP this year  adjusted for inflation  is now only a little over half what it was when LIHEAP was created in 1982     33 million households are now eligible for this assistance  These households will spend nearly  55 billion in energy costsand LIHEAP is funded at only  2 billion    According to the National Energy Assistance Directors  Association  LIHEAP now reaches 5 million familiesthe highest level in ten years  but only 15 percent of the eligible population     In Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves 134 000 families  but 867 000 families are eligible for assistance  I recently heard from Patsy Lewis  the Executive Director of the Worcester Community Action Council  which has 3 500 households eligible for LIHEAP assistance  That s up from last November when the number was 2 500     Patsy Lewis said that under this year s program  the maximum benefit is only  765 for the heating season  for a household at 100 percent of the poverty levelenough for only about one tank of oil for the winter    Our failure to increase LIHEAP funds continues to put millions of our fellow citizens at risk  But the Bush Administration and the Republican Congress are telling the elderly  the disabled  and children across America that it doesn t matter if they have no heat this winterthey aren t a priority  Earlier this year  the Taunton Gazette reported on a couple applying for LIHEAP funds  Rebecca  who has an 11 month old son and is four months pregnant  walked into the Citizens for Citizens office in Massachusetts with tears streaming down her face  and asked for help  Her husband is a construction worker who usually makes about  35 000 a year  but the bad weather has heavily reduced his work load  and now he s struggling to support his family on a much lower budget  Rebecca has thought about taking on a job again  but because of her pregnancy she knows a prospective employer would be reluctant to take her on for just a couple of months  We re trying to keep our heads up  Rebecca said  It can t keep going on like this  Rebecca and her family are playing by the rules  But even though they ve done nothing wrong  they aren t a priority for the Bush Administration or the Republican Congress    The need for LIHEAP is increasing  because home heating bills are sky rocketing  yet Congress refuses to provide enough funds for LIHEAP to even keep up with inflation  That s why I support this amendment  It will increase LIHEAP funds to  5 1 billionthe level authorized in the Energy Policy Act    LIHEAP is indispensable  It s wrong for Congress to shortchange millions of families who need our help the most  It s especially irresponsible to deny help now  when the need is so obvious for all to see  We ve got to stop condemning millions of our fellow citizens to the silent slavery of poverty  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment          FACT SHEET ON ENERGY COSTS AND LIHEAP     MASSACHUSETTS    In Massachusetts  LIHEAP serves approximately 130 000 householdsbetween 14 000 and 15 000 in Boston      And the need for LIHEAP is increasing  So far Massachusetts has taken 81 400 applications for assistance compared to the 70 500 last yearand increase of almost 11 000     The maximum benefit for Massachusetts is only  765 for the heating season  for a household at 100 percent of the poverty levelenough for only about one tank of oil for the winter     In Massachusetts  the average price of heating oil     which nearly 40 percent of households use to heat their homes     is 20 percent more than it was a year ago      The average household that uses natural gas to heat their homes     as 40 percent of Massachusetts households do     will see their bills grow by 30 percent this year     And given that nearly 40 percent of the New England region s electrical capacity is generated by natural gas  the 20 percent of households in Massachusetts that use electricity to heat their homes could be in for a price shock as well     Even the cost of a cord of wood for wood burning stoves is higher this year  by about half     FACT SHEET ENERGY COSTS AND LIHEAP    NATIONAL OUTLOOK    According to the Energy Information Administration  on average  households heating primarily with natural gas will pay about  306  41 percent  more this winter for heat  and those relying primarily on oil will pay about  325  27 percent  more     Federal funding for the LIHEAP program has been stagnant for over a decade  If you adjust for inflation  the purchasing power of LIHEAP funding this year is only a little over half of what it was in 1982   Which amounts to a cut of  1 6 billion      The number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance has increased from 4 2 million in FY02 to close to 5 million this year  the highest level in 10 years  Yet  the program only serves about 15 6 percent of eligible recipients     33 million households are eligible for LIHEAP assistance  Combined  these houses will spend nearly  55 billion  compared to the  2 billion available for LIHEAP     94 percent of household served by LIHEAP funds have at least one member who is elderly  disabled  a child under 18  or has a single adult living with one or more children     The average LIHEAP household has an income of less than  10 000     Households in poverty will owe an average of 25  of their entire annual income for their energy bills     At the projected level of family expenditures needed to keep LIHEAP eligible homes normally warm or cool with their essential appliances running  an average of about  1936 in FY06   the 2005 LIHEAP average benefit of  318 would cover less than 15 percent of the average bill   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
