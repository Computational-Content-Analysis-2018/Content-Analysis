         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on his vote to confirm Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense Although I voted against the nomination of Robert Gates to head the CIA in 1991  I supported his nomination today to be Secretary of Defense because he assured the Committee in todays hearings that he would be an independent thinker and give candid and frank advice to the President about a way forward in Iraq  The American people have been clear  We need a new policy in Iraq that is worthy of the valor  commitment  and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform  As Dr  Gates acknowledged  we must meet this high standard We all hope the Administration will quickly set a new course that will enable our troops to begin to come home  We need more than a new face  we need a new policy Our men and women in uniform who are making the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq deserve no less   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
