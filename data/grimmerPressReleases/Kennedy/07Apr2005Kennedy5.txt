         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  D C     On World Health Day today  Senators Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Olympia J  Snowe  R ME  introduced a bill to preserve and protect the effectiveness of medically important antibiotics used in the treatment of human and animal bacterial diseases  The Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act  PAMTA  addresses the overuse of antibiotics in agriculture and its contribution to the increasing threat from drug resistant bacteria  Cosponsors of this bill include Senators Susan Collins  R ME   Mary Landrieu  D LA  and Jack Reed  D RI      Antibiotics are among the greatest miracles of modern medicine  yet we are destroying them faster than the pharmaceutical industry can create replacements  If doctors lose these critical remedies  the most vulnerable among us will suffer the most    children  the elderly  persons with HIV AIDS  who are most in danger of resistant infections  There is no question that the nation stands at risk of an epidemic outbreak of food poisoning caused by drug resistant bacteria  It is time to put public safety first and stop the abuse of drugs critical to human health  Senator Kennedy said     While we are working to do all we can to fight infectious diseases  we are  in fact  working against ourselves by using antibiotics in huge quantities for no treatment purpose whatsoever  said Snowe  We must not jeopardize the effectiveness of these medicines  and we should make the problem of bacterial resistance a public health priority    Today five major medical and environmental groups    the American Academy of Pediatrics  the American Public Health Association  Environmental Defense  the Food Animal Concerns Trust and the Union of Concerned Scientists   filed a formal regulatory petition with the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  urging the agency to withdraw approvals for seven classes of antibiotics which are used as agricultural feed additives  They reinforced a point that many clinicians have been making for years    that antibiotics that are crucial to human health should never be used except for their intended purpose    to treat infectious disease     In a study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine  researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 17 percent of the drug resistant staph infections had no apparent links to health care settings  Nearly one in five of these resistant infections arise in the community  not just in the health care setting  The study suggests that we do more to address overuse in both medicine and agriculture     PAMTA phases out the non therapeutic uses of critical medically important antibiotics in livestock and poultry production  unless their manufacturers can show that they pose no danger to public health  The same tough standard will apply to new applications for approval of animal antibiotics  The Act provides Federal payments to small family farms to defray their costs  and it also authorizes research and demonstration programs that reduce the use of antibiotics in raising food producing animals  It does not restrict the use of antibiotics to treat sick animals or to treat pets and other animals not used for food  The Act also requires data collection from manufacturers so that the types and amounts of antibiotics used in animals can be monitored                The Kennedy Snowe legislation would     Require the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw the approval for non therapeutic use of the eight classes of antibiotics  or any others used in humans  in food producing animals after two years if the use has not been proven harmless in that time     Authorize payments to defray the cost to farms that are transitioning from the use of non therapeutic antibiotics and gives priority to family farms and small farms in receiving aid during this transition  Authorize grant awards to colleges and universities to establish research and demonstration programs for phasing out non therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics and informing meat and poultry producer of methods for accomplishing this      Require that manufacturers of the animal drugs or feed that contains the drugs make available the records of their sales quantities  within certain confines of confidential business information  Centers for Disease Control and the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System will have better usage data for tracing emerging antimicrobial resistance and can establish a baseline for current resistance    Laura Capps  Kennedy  202 224 2633 Antonia Ferrier  Snowe   202 224 1304
