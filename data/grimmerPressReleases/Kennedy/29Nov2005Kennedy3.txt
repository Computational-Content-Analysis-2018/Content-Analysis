         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     BOSTON  MA     Senator Edward M  Kennedy visited the Dana Farber Cancer Institute  Harvard Cancer Center in Boston  Massachusetts to announce a  4 3 National Institutes of Health federal grant for the Comprehensive Minority Institution Cancer Partnership with UMASS Boston and The Dana Farber Cancer Institute   Harvard Cancer Center     Senator Kennedy said  This partnership marks the beginning of a bold new effort to solve one of health care s most troubling problems  the health disparities that affect so many Americans because of their backgrounds  Today  the nation has 45 million citizens without health insurance  and its an ongoing crisis that disproportionately affects minorities  20 percent of African Americans are uninsured and 32 percent of Hispanic Americans have no insurance  This partnership offers real hope of reducing these disparities    This partnership addresses health disparities in minority populations  and helps to improve research  training and outreach opportunities for minority students  nurses and scientists  Together  UMASS Boston and The Dana Farber Cancer Institute   Harvard Cancer Center develop interdisciplinary programs of collaborative research that stimulate basic cancer research  as well as promote and enhance minority involvement within medicine and the education of medicine    The federal grant totaling  4  3 million will go to the four research programs and projects which include developing interdisciplinary programs for cancer research that address health disparities  increasing health care training opportunities for minority students  increasing community outreach and cancer education and developing shared mechanisms for minority faculty recruitment and career development  These projects  with the help of this funding  will help to stimulate cancer research and education as well as promote a focus upon minorities            Remarks of Senator Edward M  Kennedy at the  UMASS Boston Dana Farber NIH Grant Announcement November 29  2005    As prepared for delivery    Thank you  Ed Benz  for that generous introduction  It s an honor to be here  and I commend you  President Jack Wilson  Chancellor Michael Collins  and all of you for all you ve done to make this day a reality    We re also fortunate to have Erick Kamau with us today  a dedicated student who we know will be a wonderful physician and continue our city s leadership in medicine in the years ahead     This grant announcement is especially significant  It recognizes the extraordinary partnership between one of the world s premier research institutions in Dana Farber  and UMASS Boston    our city s great public research university     It s the kind of partnership that we need to keep Boston in the forefront in this new century of the life sciences  It means more Boston students can be trained in cutting edge medical research at home  without having to go elsewhere    It s a strong investment in the future of our city  and we re proud of all or you for pulling it together  I commend the National Institutes of Health for recognizing the high quality of the work you do    It also marks the beginning of a bold new effort to solve one of health care s most troubling problems    the health disparities that affect so many Americans because of their backgrounds    It s high time we eliminated these disparities    and I m proud that Dana Farber and UMASS Boston are stepping up to lead the effort     Today the nation has 45 million citizens without health insurance  and the effects can be devastating  Sick children can t learn at school  Sick workers can t earn on the job  It s an ongoing crisis that disproportionately affects minorities    20 percent of African Americans are uninsured and 32 percent of Hispanic Americans have no insurance    In addition  minorities also encounter higher rates of disease and death than their fellow citizens    The statistics are particularly grim for cancer  Nearly everyone s family has been touched by cancer    including my own  It s a true blessing that our family has been able to obtain the quality of care we needed    and obtain it early on    and it s essential that we get that quality of care for all American families    The problem is especially severe for minorities  African American women have the highest rates of colon cancer and lung cancer    and the highest death rates from breast cancer  African American men are more likely than any other group to suffer and die from cancers of the lung  prostate  and colon    Hispanic women have higher death rates from cervical cancer than any other group  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have high death rates from liver and stomach cancers  American Indians suffer from high lung cancer death rates  Sadly  the list goes on and on    Your partnership offers real hope of reducing these disparities in several key ways    It encourages basic research in cancer treatment and early detection    the key to greater rates of cancer survival     It will train minority students  nurses  and scientists  African Americans  Hispanics and American Indians now account for only 6 percent of the nation s doctors and 7 percent of the nurses and dentists  even though they represent nearly one third of the U S population     This lack of representation within the health professions can lead to cultural and language barriers that can affect patient care and comfort    despite the best efforts of medical personal  It needs to be eliminated if we are to improve the quality of care for different ethnic and minority groups   In addition  minority researchers can bring new and fresh perspectives to the analytical research that is needed to determine the causes of low cancer survival among various ethnic groups     This bold partnership also includes a fast track PhD program for minority nursing students  new opportunities for minority students in research labs  and outreach to improve clinical care in underserved communities    Through leadership like this  we ll raise the awareness and availability of better health care in underserved communities throughout the city  and encourage people to obtain the care they need when they need it    So congratulations to all of you for this well deserved grant  Hopefully  you ll be a model for the nation in dealing more effectively with these seemingly intractable issues  and I look forward very much to the results to come     Well done           Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner
