         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Iraq is the overarching issue of our time  American lives  American values  and Americas role in the world is at stake As the November election made clear  the American people oppose this war  and an even greater number oppose sending more troops to Iraq The American people are demanding a change in course in Iraq  Instead  the President is accelerating the same failed course he has pursued for nearly four years  He must understand that Congress will not endorse this course  The Presidents decision to send more American troops into the cauldron of civil war is not an acceptable strategy  It is against the advice of his own generals  the Iraq Study Group  and the wishes of the American people and will only compound our original mistake ingoing to war in Iraq  Just this morning  the Secretary of State testified that the Iraqi government ison borrowed time  In fact  time is already up  The Iraqi government needs to make the political compromises necessary to end this civil war  The answer is not more troops  its a political settlement  The President talked about strengthening relations with Congress  He should begin by seeking authority from Congress for any escalation of the war  The mission of our armed forces today in Iraq no longer bears any resemblance to the mission authorized by Congress in 2002  The Iraq War Resolution authorized a war against the regime of Saddam Hussein because he was believed to have weapons of mass destruction  an operational relationship with Al Qaeda  and was in defiance of U N  Security Council Resolutions  Not one member of Congress would have voted in favor of the Resolution if they thought they were sending American troops into a civil war  The President owes it to the American people to seek approval for this new mission from Congress  Congress should no longer be a rubber stamp for the Presidents failed strategy  We should insist on a policy that is worthy of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform  President Bush has been making up his mind on Iraq ever since the election  Before he escalates the war  the American people deserve a voice in his decision Hes the Commander in Chief  but hes still accountable to the people  Our system of checks and balances gives Congress a key role in decisions of war and peace We know an escalation of troops into this civil war wont work  Weve increased our military presence in the past  and each time  the violence has increased and the political problems have persisted  Despite what the President says  his own generals are on the record opposing a surge in troops  Last November 15th  2006  General Abizaid was unequivocal that increasing our troop commitment is not the answer  He said  Ive met with every divisional commander  General Casey  the corps commander  General Dempsey  we all talked together  And I said  in your professional opinion  if we were to bring in more American troops now  does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq  And they all said no  On December 29  General Casey said  The longer we in the U S  forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraqs security  it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militiasThey can continue to blame us for all of Iraqs problems  which are at base their problems Time and again  our leaders in Vietnam escalated our military presence  and each new escalation of force led to the next  We escalated the war  instead of ending it  Like Vietnam  there is no military solution to Iraq  The President is the last person in America to understand that  We must not only speak against the surge in troops  we must act to prevent it
