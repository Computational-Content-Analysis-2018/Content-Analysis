         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on the Bush Administration s third bird flu plan    Yesterday  the Bush Administration released its belated plan for responding to an outbreak of pandemic influenza  Other nations have been implementing their plans for several years  but we re only now beginning to take the first steps  and it s far from clear that after so much delay  the Administration is handling this dangerous threat with the competency it needs     The plan offers guidance  but clearly falls short on support  It passes the buck for national preparedness from the federal government to state and local governments and the private sector  It fails to provide the financial resources that will be urgently needed when a pandemic hits     First responders need supplies to contain any outbreak and prevent the flu from spreading further  Health professionals need vaccines  life saving drugs  and specialized equipment to treat the potentially huge number of persons infected  Doctors will have to treat the insured and the uninsured alike  because the virus doesn t take anyone s health plan into account  But the Administration s plan doesn t explain how the needed vaccines and other drugs and treatments will be paid for    We can t ask hospitals  doctors  and first responders to bankrupt themselves to save the nation from a public health disaster  The federal government has a responsibility to protect the nation in national emergencies like this  We can t keep passing the buck to mayors  first responders  and local doctors     Unfortunately  under this Administration and its widening competence gap  the buck isn t allowed to come any where close to the White House  Hopefully  Congress will step up to the plate and fill the gap   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
