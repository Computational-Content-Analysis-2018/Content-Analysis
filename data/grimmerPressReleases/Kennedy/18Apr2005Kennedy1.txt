         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     It s a privilege to join Senator Craig in offering the Agricultural Jobs  Opportunity  Benefits  and Security amendment      America has a proud tradition as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws  but our current immigration laws have failed us  Much of the nation s economy today depends on the hard work and the many contributions of immigrants  The agricultural industry would grind to a halt without immigrant farm workers  Yet  the overwhelming majority of these workers are undocumented    and are therefore easily exploited by unscrupulous employers who can get away with paying shamefully low wages and forcing them to work in unacceptably dangerous conditions    Our AgJOBS bill corrects these festering problems  It gives farm workers and their families the dignity and justice they deserve  and it gives agricultural employers a legal workforce     Our bill reflects a far reaching and welcome agreement between the United Farm Workers and the agricultural industry to meet this urgent need  and Congress should make the most of this unique opportunity for progress     Our bill has strong support from business and labor  civic and faith based organizations  liberals and conservatives  trade associations and immigrant rights groups  More than 500 organizations across the country support it  They include farm worker advocates such as the United Farm Workers  the Farm Labor Organizing Committee  the Farmworker Justice Fund  and agribusiness groups such as the National Council of Agricultural Employers  and the American Nursery and Landscape Association  It also has the support of civil rights groups such as the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights  Latino organizations such as the National Council of La Raza  the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  and the League of United Latin American Citizens  business groups such as the U S  Chamber of Commerce  and the labor movement  led by the AFL CIO  The American people want common sense solutions to real problems like immigration  They want neither open borders  nor closed borders  They want smart borders  They are neither anti immigrant nor anti enforcement  Instead  they are anti disorder and anti hypocrisy  They want the federal government to get its act together  to set rules that are realistic and fair  and to follow through and enforce these realistic rules effectively and efficiently  They want immigration laws that protect our nation s security  respect its ideals  and honor America s heritage and history as a nation of immigrants     AgJOBS meets these goals  It addresses our national security needs  reflects current economic realities  and respects America s immigrant heritage     The status quo is untenable  In the last 10 years  the U S  government has spent more than  20 billion to enforce our immigration laws  We have tripled the number of border patrol agents  improved surveillance technology  and installed other controls to strengthen border enforcement  especially at our southwest border  None of these efforts have been adequate  Our border enforcement strategy has diverted migration flows to the harsh desert and mountain regions along the border  causing countless deaths  quadrupling profits for smugglers  and increasing the danger of violence to border patrol agents  border communities  and the migrants themselves     Illegal immigration continues  The proof is in the numbers  Between 1990 and 2000  the number of undocumented immigrants doubled from 3 5 million to 7 million  Today  that number is nearly 11 million  with an average annual growth of almost 500 000  Those already here are not leaving  and new immigrants keep coming in  A significant part of the workforce in many sectors of the economy  especially agriculture  is undocumented  Massive deportations are unrealistic as a policy  impractical to carry out  and unacceptable to businesses that rely heavily on their labor     Obviously  we must control our borders and enforce our laws  but we first need realistic immigration laws that we can actually enforce  The AgJOBS bill is a significant step  Close to 70 percent of agricultural workers are undocumented  By bringing these illegal workers out of the shadows  we will enable law enforcement to focus its efforts on terrorists and violent criminals  We ll reduce the chaotic  illegal  and all too deadly traffic of immigrants at our borders  by providing safe and opportunities for farm workers and their families to enter the country    In a post 9 11 world  we can no longer ignore the fact that so much of today s agricultural workforce is undocumented  The AgJOBS bill enhances our national security and makes our communities safer  It brings undocumented farm workers and their families out of the shadows and enables them to pass through security check points  It shrinks the pool of law enforcement targets and enables our officers to train their sights more effectively on terrorists and criminals  It will make our communities safer  because when immigrants  fears of deportation are eliminated  they are far more likely to report criminals and terrorists to law enforcement officers     Reducing the size of the undocumented population reduces the ability of suspected terrorists to hide  The undocumented farm workers eligible for this program will undergo rigorous security checks as they apply for legal status  Future temporary workers will be carefully screened to meet security concerns  Enforcement action will be more effectively focused on the highest risks  The AgJOBS amendment provides a fair and reasonable way for undocumented agricultural workers to earn legal status  It reforms the current visa program  so that agricultural employers unable to hire American workers can hire needed foreign workers  Both of these components are critical  They serve as the cornerstone for comprehensive immigration reform of the agricultural sector     Undocumented farm workers are clearly vulnerable to abuse by unscrupulous labor contractors and growers  They are less likely than U S  workers to complain about low wages  poor working conditions  or other labor law violations  Their illegal status deprives them of bargaining power and depresses the wages of all farm workers  These workers are already among the lowest paid of all workers in America  According to the most recent findings of the National Agricultural Workers Survey  issued last month  their average individual income is between  10 000 and  12 500 a year  The average annual family income is  15 000 to  17 500  Thirty percent of their households live below the poverty line  Only half of them own a car  and even fewer own a home or even a trailer     To improve the wages and working conditions of all agricultural workers  we need dramatic reform in our laws  Our bill provides fair solutions for undocumented workers who toil in our fields and harvest our fruits and vegetables under harsh and unacceptable conditions  By legalizing these farm workers  the threat of deportation is removed  They will be on equal footing with U S  workers  and the end result will be higher wages  better working conditions  and upward job mobility for all workers  These workers will be able to come forward  identify themselves  provide evidence that they have been employed in agriculture  and continue to work hard and play by the rules    Opponents of reform continually mislabel any initiative they oppose as Aamnesty in a desperate attempt to stop any significant reform  Instead of proposing ways to fix our current broken system  they are calling for more of the same    increased enforcement of broken laws  However  enforcing a dysfunctional system only leads to greater dysfunction     The AgJOBS bill is not an amnesty  The program requires farm workers to earn legal status  They must demonstrate not only past work contributions  but also a substantial future work commitment before they earn the right to remain in our country  First  they will receive temporary resident status  based on their past work experience  They must have worked for at least 100 work days in agriculture by December 31  2004  To earn permanent residence  they must fulfill a prospective work requirement  They must work at least 360 days in agriculture during a six  year period  At least 240 of those 360 work days must occur during the first 3 years  Temporary residents who fail to fulfill the prospective agricultural work requirement will be dropped from the program and required to leave the country     It s not amnesty if you have to earn it  AgJOBS offers farm workers a fair deal  if they are willing to work hard for us  then we re willing to do something fair for them  It s the only realistic solution     Contrary to statements made by its critics  AgJOBS does not provide a direct path to citizenship  Farm workers would first earn temporary residence if they provide evidence of past work in agriculture  The next step would be permanent residence  but only after they have completed thousands of hours of back breaking work in agriculture    a process that could take up to 6 years  Once they earn permanent residence  these farm workers would have to wait another 5 years to be able to apply for citizenship  At that point  they would have to pass an English and civics exam  and go through extensive backgrounds checks  This process is long and arduous  as it should be  There is nothing direct about it     To be eligible for legal status  applicants must be persons of good moral character and present no criminal or national security problems  Whether they are applying here or at U S  consulates abroad  all applicants will be required to undergo rigorous security clearances  Like all applicants for adjustment of status  their names and birth dates must be checked against criminal and terrorist databases operated by the Department of Homeland Security  the FBI  the State Department  and the CIA  Applicants  fingerprints would be sent to the FBI for a criminal background check  which includes comparing the applicants  fingerprints with all arrest records in the FBI s database     Contrary to arguments made by detractors of AgJOBS  terrorists will not be able to exploit this program to obtain legal status  Anyone with any ties to terrorist activity is ineligible for legal status under our current immigration laws  and would be ineligible under the AgJOBS bill  Our proposal has no loopholes for terrorists     Opponents of AgJOBS claim that this bill is soft on criminals  Wrong again  AgJOBS has the toughest provisions against those who commit crimes    tougher than current immigration law  Convictions for most crimes will make them ineligible to obtain a green card  Generally  these convictions include violent crimes  drug crimes  theft  and domestic violence  AgJOBS goes even further  Applicants can be denied legal status if they commit a felony or three misdemeanors  It doesn t matter whether the misdemeanors involve minor offenses    three misdemeanors and you are out  no matter how minor the misdemeanors  In addition  any one convicted of a single misdemeanor who served a sentence of 6 months or more would also be ineligible  These rules are additional requirements that do not apply to other immigrants and they cannot be waived by DHS     There are those who would prefer to disqualify a farm worker who commits even a single minor misdemeanor  with no jail time  But that goes too far  In some states  it s a misdemeanor to put trash from your home into a roadside trash can  It s a misdemeanor to park a house trailer in a roadside park  or have an unleashed dog in your car on a state highway  or go fishing without a license     If we re serious about this proposal  minor offenses like these shouldn t have such harsh consequences  We d be severely punishing hard working men and women for minor mistakes  and tearing these immigrant families apart     It s hard to imagine any public purpose that would be served by such a severe punishment  But it s easy to imagine all the heart wrenching stories and nightmares created by this proposal for people caught by its provisions  Many of these farm workers have lived in America with their families for many years  They ve established strong ties to their communities  paid their taxes  and contributed to our economy  They deserve better than a punishment out of all proportion to their offense    Opponents of AgJOBS also claim that it will be a magnet for further illegal immigration  Once again  they are wrong  To be eligible for the earned adjustment program  farm workers must establish that they worked in agriculture in the past  Farm workers must have entered the United States prior to October  2004  Otherwise  they are not eligible  The magnet argument is false  New entrants who have not worked in agriculture won t qualify for this program     Hard working migrant farm workers are essential to the success of American agriculture  We need an honest agriculture policy that recognizes the contributions of these men and women  and respects and rewards their work     Our bill will modify the current temporary foreign agricultural worker program  while preserving and enhancing key labor protections  It strikes a fair balance  Anything else would undermine the jobs  wages  and working conditions of U S  workers     For many employers  the current program is a bureaucratic nightmare  Few of them use they program  because it is so complicated  lengthy  uncertain  and expensive  Only 40 000 50 000 guest workers are admitted each year barely 2 to 3  of the estimated total agricultural work force     To deal with these problems  the bill streamlines the H 2A program s application process by making it a labor attestation program similar to the H 1B program  rather than the current labor certification program  This change will reduce paperwork for employers and accelerate processing     Employers seeking temporary workers will file an application with the Secretary of Labor containing assurances that they will comply with the program s obligations  The application will be accompanied by a job offer that the local job service office will post on an electronic job registry at least 28 days before the job begins  In addition  the employer must post the position at the work site  notify the collective bargaining representative if one exists  make reasonable efforts to contact past employees  and advertise the position in newspapers read by farm workers     Long standing worker protections will continue in force  For example  the three fourths minimum work guarantee will remain in effect  Employers will be required to guarantee work for at least three quarters of the employment period or pay compensation for any shortfall  The 50  rule will also continue  Qualified U S  workers would be hired as long as they apply during the first half of the season  No position could be filled by an H 2A worker that was vacant because of a strike or labor dispute  Employers will continue to reimburse workers for transportation costs and provide workers  compensation insurance coverage  Employers will be prohibited from discriminating in favor of temporary workers     The bill will modify some current requirements in important ways  Employers must provide housing at no cost  or a monetary housing allowance in which the state governor certifies that sufficient farm worker housing is available  Employers will also be required to pay at least the highest of the state or federal minimum wage  the local prevailing wage for the particular job  or an adverse effect wage rate     For many years  the adverse effect wage rate has been vigorously debated  with most farm worker advocates arguing that the rate is too low  and most growers complaining that it is too high  The bill will freeze adverse effect wage rates for three years at the 2003 level  while studies and recommendations are made to Congress by the GAO and a special commission of experts  If Congress fails to enact an adverse effect wage rate formula within 3 years  this wage rate will be adjusted in 2006  and at the beginning of each year thereafter  based on the change in the consumer price index     The Secretary of Labor will establish an administrative complaint process to investigate and resolve complaints alleging violations under the H 2A program  Violators will be required to pay back wages  and can also be given civil money penalties and be barred from the program     In addition  the bill provides a significant new protection for H 2A workers    a private right of action in federal court  Currently  these workers lack this right  and can seek redress in state courts only under state contract law  Such workers are also excluded from the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act  which provides U S  workers with protections and remedies in federal court  Although the exclusion continues  our bill will permit workers to file a federal lawsuit to enforce their wages  housing benefits  transportation cost reimbursements  minimum work guarantee  motor vehicle safety protections  and other terms under their job offer     Our bill will also unify families  When temporary residence is granted  a farm worker s spouse and minor children will be able to remain legally in the United States  but they will not be authorized to work  When the worker becomes a permanent resident  the spouse and minor children will also gain such status     AgJOBS is a bi partisan compromise reached after years of negotiations  Both farm workers and growers have made concessions to reach this agreement  but each side obtained important benefits     In contrast  Senator Chambliss  amendment is a partisan  one sided proposal that has failed to win the broad support that AgJOBS has achieved  I urge my colleagues to oppose it     The Chambliss amendment vastly favors employers at the expense of farm workers  It makes harsh revisions to the current agricultural guestworker program and creates a new blue card program for undocumented workers without a path to permanent residence  and without any meaningful governmental oversight to prevent labor abuses     Agricultural employers would have the freedom to avoid hiring U S  workers  displace U S  workers already on the job  and force both U S  workers and guestworkers to accept low wages  They could do all this by claiming they can t find any U S  workers  Even when the few labor protections are violated  workers would have no meaningful ability to enforce their legal rights  This proposal would return us to the dark and shameful era of the Bracero Program  where abuses were rampant and widely tolerated  That s unacceptable  We must learn from our mistakes  not repeat them     The Chambliss amendment also ignores the needs of many growers and farm workers  It offers no solution to the basic problem faced by agricultural employers    the problem that an overwhelming majority of the workers are undocumented  By offering no path to permanent residence for these undocumented workers  none of the guestworkers  no matter how long they worked  will ever be eligible to earn permanent status     Perhaps most troubling is the amendment s repeal of the longstanding adverse effect wage rate under the current program  This wage rate was created during the Bracero Program as a necessary protection against the depression in wages caused by guestworker programs  The Chambliss proposal would replace it with a prevailing wage standard substantially lower than the adverse effect wage rate  It could be based on the employers  own survey of prevailing wages  rather than Labor Department surveys  Farm workers who are already the lowest paid workers in the U S  would see their wages drop even lower     In contrast  the AgJOBS bill preserves the adverse effect wage rate while recommendations are made to Congress to resolve these long contested pay issues    The Chambliss amendment also eliminates the key provision that gives U S  workers a job preference by employers who request guestworkers  It would end the longstanding 50  rule which requires employers to hire qualified U S  workers who apply during the first half of the season  Studies have shown that this rule is a valid protection     In addition  the Chambliss amendment would end positive recruitment     the obligation of employers to look for U S  workers outside of the government job service  which currently provides few farm workers with agricultural jobs    This proposal creates a new guestworker program for the undocumented that would offer them visas that would be valid only for three years  and renewable for up to six additional years  They would have no opportunity to earn a green card  no matter how many years they worked in the U S  In fact  they would actually lose their status if they merely filed an application to become a permanent resident    Senator Chambliss believes that undocumented farm workers will come out of the shadows and sign up for such a temporary worker program  But they re highly unlikely to do so  if the vast majority will be deported after their temporary status expires  Many of them are persons who have already spent several years in this country  working hard  paying taxes  raising their U S  citizen children  and contributing significantly to the strength of our country  Registering as the first step toward deportation is unfair and won t work    In contrast  the AgJOBS bill offers farm workers a genuine earned adjustment program that will put these workers and their families on a path to permanent residence  Hard working  law abiding farm workers will be able to come out of the shadows  Our communities will be safer  and we will all benefit as a nation    The Chambliss amendment is far less satisfactory than the AgJOBS proposal and I urge my colleagues to oppose it     Opponents of the AgJOBS bill claim that we are rushing this bill through Congress  without full and careful consideration  This claim is without merit  Since 1998  the Immigration Subcommittee has held 3 hearings that have fully examined our agricultural work force problems and the need to reform our immigration laws  Last year  we considered the issue once more as the Immigration Subcommittee evaluated all temporary worker programs     Legislation to address this problem has been introduced by both Republicans and Democrats in every Congress since 1996  In 1999  under the leadership of Congressman Howard Berman  the United Farm Workers and the growers agreed to meet and negotiate a bill  Until then  the UFW had opposed legislation favored by the growers to expand the existing visa program  and the growers had rejected a legalization program for undocumented farm workers  In September 2000  a breakthrough occurred and both sides agreed to support compromise legislation that won broad bi partisan Congressional support  Unfortunately  attempts to enact it were blocked in the lame duck session that year    The election of President Bush in 2000 changed the dynamics of the agreement  and the compromise fell apart  In 2001  Senator Craig and I introduced competing bills  but  the terrorist attacks on September 11 meant that all immigration reforms needed to be reassessed  Through 2002 and most of 2003  discussions continued  but agreement stalled over several important issues     A compromise was finally reached in September 2003  which led Senator Craig and me to introduce the AgJOBS bill  Congressman Berman and Congressman Cannon introduced the companion bipartisan bill in the House  Last Congress we had 63 Senate co sponsors  nearly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans  Despite such strong bipartisan support  the Senate Republican leadership last year blocked our attempt to obtain a vote on the legislation  This is the second Congress in which Senator Craig and I have introduced the AgJOBS bill  Congress has had extensive discussions of this legislation in the past  and it is long past time for us to act   Opponents of our amendment have offered no workable solutions  We can t be complacent any longer  It s time for a new approach     Impressive work has been done by many grassroots organizations to make the AgJOBS bill a reality  They have demonstrated true statesmanship by putting aside strongly held past differences to work together for the common good  We have our own responsibility to join together in a similar way to approve this needed reform that is years overdue  It is well designed to improve the lives and working conditions of all farm workers  I commend Senator Craig and Congressmen Berman and Cannon for their leadership  I urge my colleagues to wholeheartedly endorse the AgJOBS bill    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
