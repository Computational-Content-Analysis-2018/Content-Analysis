         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  As I said when we began our debate this morning  our nation has always looked to education as the pathway to progress and prosperity  After John Adams recognized education as a fundamental right in the Massachusetts constitution  we embraced this view in my home state by creating the first college and first public school in the nation  A few decades later  legendary reformers such as Horace Mann  first recognized that public schools would be the great equalizer that delivers opportunity for all to fulfill their potential  At the height of the Civil War  Abraham Lincoln signed the legislation creating the land grant colleges and made a commitment on behalf of the nation to the education of the children of our country  During the Industrial Revolution  we rose to the challenge once again  We established free public schools  At the turn of the last century  we founded public high schools to enable the nation to move forward And after the Second World War  we passed the GI Bill to enable those who served in war to rebuild their lives at home  For every dollar we invested  the Greatest Generation returned  7 for our economic growth The landmark success of the GI Bill shows us what a difference higher education makes  The bill granted World War II veterans up to  500 each term  the equivalent of  5 600 today  It swung the gates to college wide open  and half of all veterans went through those gates determined to create a new life for themselves and their families  More than five million veterans received vocational education or job training  and more than two million attended college  In 1940  the average GI was just 26 years old and had attended only one year of high school  The bill even enabled many of these GIs  who had served the country so magnificently  to become professionals  In 1957  we were called to action once again  The Soviet Union began a new Space Age with the launch of Sputnik  We rose to the challenge by passing the National Defense Education Act  and by inspiring the nation to land on the moon  We doubled the federal investment in education  Today  we need a similar bold new commitment to enable the current generation of Americans to rise to the global challenges we face  The Higher Education Conference Report we consider today makes that commitment  Today  well help millions of students achieve the American dream by providing  20 billion in new college aid  the biggest increase in student aid since the GI Bill Just a few weeks ago  the Senate overwhelmingly voted to approve this bill  Lets look at what the Senate bill did   It provided a historic increase in need based grant aid  by raising the maximum Pell Grant by almost  1 100 over the next five years  to  5 400 from  4 310 today  It provided new student loan repayment options that allow borrowers to cap their loan payments at 15 percent of their monthly discretionary income  It offered loan forgiveness to borrowers who work for 10 years in a variety of public service jobs  This includes public school teachers  law enforcement and emergency management professionals  social workers  librarians  prosecutors and public defenders  public health doctors and nurses  and child care workers  It protected working students by not penalizing their earnings  by raising the income protection allowance from  3 000 to  6 000 for dependent students  and increasing it by 50 percent for independent students  It initiated a new program that provides matching grants to states so they can provide more college access activities to students Our Senate bill provided all these benefits at no cost to the taxpayer  by cutting the outrageous subsidies the government gives to lenders  We gave that money to the students  where it belongs The Conference Report we consider today maintains all these benefits to students  But it does even more for students  In addition to the benefits Ive just described  the College Cost Reduction and Access Act  Cuts interest rates on new subsidized Stafford loans for undergraduates from 6 8 percent to 3 4 percent by 2011  a step which will help millions of students manage their student loan debt more effectively  It provides scholarships of  4 000 per year to high achieving college students who commit to teaching high need subjects like math and science in high need schools  It provides more than  500 million to support Historically Black Colleges and Universities  Hispanic Serving Institutions  and other colleges that serve minority students  It increases funding for the Upward Bound program by more than  200 million  which will help provide tutoring and other support services to help disadvantaged high school students prepare for  apply to  and succeed in college  This is the bold commitment that our students and families deserve  and it couldnt come at a better time  We all know that a college education is more important than ever  but its never been more expensive  The cost of college has tripled in the last 20 years  Yet  family incomes are not keeping up with rapidly rising college prices  Last week  the Census Bureau released new data showing that median household income in America increased just seven tenths of one percent last year  Meanwhile  the cost of college increased 6 percent In fact  over the last twenty years  the cost of college has increased more than twice as fast as median household income  Since 1986  costs have increased by 216 percent at public colleges  and 208 percent at private colleges  But median household income has gone up just 93 percent over that same time During the same period  grant aid has not kept up pace with increasing costs  Twenty years ago  the maximum Pell Grant covered 55 percent of costs at a public four year college  Today  it covers only a third of those costs  The gap between the maximum Pell grant and the cost of attendance at 4 year public colleges has increased almost  3 500 since 2001 2002  Today the gap is  8 746  For years  under Republican control of Congress  the maximum Pell Grant was stuck near  4 000  Earlier this year  Democrats increased the maximum grant to  4 310  But thats far from enough  Increasing costs and stagnant grant aid are closing the doors to college for many middle income and low income students and families  The lowest income students on average have an unmet need of  5 800   CHART  Each year  400 000 students dont attend a 4 year college because they cant afford to do so  Its shameful that low income students  even those who have worked hard and done well in high school  are less likely to attend and complete college than high income students  Just one fifth of low income eighth graders will graduate from college  But 68 percent of high income students will do so  Thats unacceptable  By providing the biggest increase in student aid since the passage of the G I  Bill  our bill will help close these gaps  Of the  20 billion in college aid that our bill provides overall   11 4 billion is allocated for additional grant aid Our bill immediately increases the maximum Pell grant by  500 next year  to  4 800 from  4 310  By 2012  the maximum Pell Grant will increase to  5 400  Who will be helped by this bill  It will help students like Sara  who was a first generation college student  She graduated from Norfolk State University and earned her Masters degree with the help of the Pell Grant and other aid programs  Sara says that the Pell program helped her family know that a better day was coming for them  This bill will help students like Natalie  from Massachusetts  whos a single mother enrolled in college for the first time  She says that without Pell grants  she would be stuck in this way of life  with no light to look forward toknowledge is power and education is key  More than 5 million students rely on the Pell grant  5 million  This bill provides the help and assistance that millions of Americans need in order to access and afford a college education  This increase in aid is long overdue  But we cannot stop there  Students and families also need our help to manage the crushing burden of student loan debt As the cost of college continues to rise  the crisis of student loan debt is growing worse  In 1993  fewer than half of all students took out loans to finance their education  But today  more than two thirds of students borrow for college  Today  the average student leaves college with more than  19 000 in student debt  This mountain of debt is distorting the basic life choices of countless Americans  Its forcing them to delay getting married  delay buying a home  and delay starting a family  Its discouraging many young people from choosing careers in fields such as teaching  social work and law enforcement  the low paying but vital jobs that bring large benefits to our society No student should have to mortgage their future in order to pay for higher education  That is why our bill also cuts interest rates in half  to 3 4 percent from 6 8 percent  on new subsidized Stafford Loans for undergraduates  which goes to the neediest students  By cutting the rates in half  we reduce the interest rate on these loans to some of the lowest levels ever in the history of the federal student loan program  These reductions will provide much needed help to the 5 5 million students who take out subsidized student loans each year  Reducing interest rates will clearly help students  Under a standard 10 year repayment plan  a borrower with  18 000 in subsidized loans will have their interest payments reduced by 35 percent  from almost  6 900 to less than  4 500  That student will save almost  2 400 in interest payments Borrowers who consolidate their subsidized loans will save even more  For example  a borrower with  13 800 in subsidized student loan debt  the average amount  will save  4 400 over the life of their loan  Our income based repayment plan  which gives borrowers the option of capping their loan payments at 15 percent of their monthly discretionary income  will help save borrowers even more And when its combined with our public service loan forgiveness plan  the help well provide to students will be truly remarkable  Teachers  emergency management technicians  law enforcement professionals  public health doctors  nurses  social workers  librarians  public interest lawyers  early childhood teachers  and many others  will be eligible for loan forgiveness  Take  for example a starting teacher in Massachusetts who makes a salary of  35 421  If that teacher graduated with the average loan debt for the State   18 169  he or she will have a monthly payment of  209  Under the income based repayment plan  that monthly payment would be reduced to  148 instead   61 less  Over the course of the year  that teacher would pay  732 less than under the standard repayment plan If the teacher stays in the job for 10 years  the remaining debt would be cancelled altogether in this case  a benefit of over  10 000 Or lets consider a starting legal services attorney  who makes  36 000 a year  If that student graduated with the average loan debt for lawyers for the State   51 056  he or she will have a monthly loan payment of  588  Under the income based repayment plan  those monthly payments would be  259  thats  329 less  Over the course of the year  that legal aid attorney would pay  3 948 less than he or she would have paid under the standard repayment plan And if the legal aid lawyer stayed in the job for 10 years  the remaining debt would be cancelled  in this case  a benefit of over  50 000 Or lets consider the example of a police sergeant with a child in Arkansas  who makes  28 289 a year  If that sergeant graduated with the average loan debt for students for the Arkansas     17 000  he or she will have a monthly loan payment of  196 Under the income based repayment plan  because the sergeant is supporting a child  those monthly payments would be reduced to  97  Over the course of the year  the sergeant would pay  1 185 less than he or she would have paid under the standard repayment plan And if he or she stayed in law enforcement for 10 years  the remaining debt would be cancelled  in this case  a benefit of over  14 800 Our bill pays for these valuable measures  not by increasing the burden on taxpayers  but by reducing unnecessary subsidies for lenders who take part in the federal student loan programs  Today  thousands of lenders offer college loans  The largest  Sallie Mae  is so profitable that a group of investors recently offered to buy it for  25 billion  more than 40 percent above the value of its stock  The lenders claim that if Congress reduces their subsidies  it wont be profitable for them to make student loans anymore  and theyll leave the business  But when Congress has reduced subsidies in the past  the lenders profits have still gone up  not down Heres a chart that Sallie Mae itself produced  It shows that even though Congress has reduced subsidies several times in the past  the companys profits have continued to go up and up  In 2006  Sallie Mae made  1 1 billion in overall profits  Obviously  theres still plenty of room to reduce lender subsidies further Lenders also claim that if we reduce their subsidies  theyll be forced to reduce the benefits they offer to borrowers on student loans  But what they dont tell you is that many of the benefits they offer are phantom benefits that few borrowers ever receive  According to an independent analysis by Finaid org  the average borrower saves only  118 through borrower benefits offered by private lenders  By contrast  the Pell grant increase in our bill will provide an additional  2 360 in grant aid over the next four years  which translates to  3 260 in lower loan payments  When fully phased in  the increase will provide an additional  4 360 per student  which means over  6 000 less in loan payments over the life of the loan  If lenders wanted to offer a comparable benefit  they would have to provide over forty times the level of benefits they now provide  Finally  lenders claim that if we cut their subsidies  small lenders will be forced out of the FFEL program  restricting borrower choice and leaving only the big banks in business Smaller lenders have made this argument before  But when Congress has made sensible cuts in the past  the number of lenders has risen  not fallen  Right now  more than 3 500 lenders make federal student loans  the highest number ever in the history of the student loan program Lets be clear about what smaller lenders typically do  Most of them simply sell the loans to the larger lenders  soon after the loans are made  Thats why the biggest lenders hold so many loans As this chart shows  the 10 largest lenders originate 53 percent of all Federal Family Education program loans  However  they hold 71 percent of all those loans  and service more than 86 percent  The reason the numbers grow is because smaller lenders sell off their student loans to the big lenders Lenders will no doubt continue to complain that the cuts in this bill are too deep  but the reality is that our bill restores the balance to this grossly unfair student loan system by directing funds to the students  not to the banks  It will also encourage long term reform of the student loan system by creating a pilot program in which an auction will be used to see what subsidies are necessary to keep banks involved in the student loan program  For years  the federal government has used auctions to determine prices on everything from broadcast spectrum rights  timber cutting rights  oil and gas drilling rights  even the price of infant formula delivered through the WIC program  Theres no doubt we can use auctions to operate the student loan programs more efficiently  The money we save through this pilot program will be sent back to where it is needed most    to increase access to college for students through a state matching grant program I also want to reiterate my commitment to the Higher Education Reauthorization bill  Just a few weeks ago the Senate voted unanimously for this bill  Its critical that we complete work on it this year   The reauthorization bill takes steps to ensure that the student loan system is working in the best interest of students  by pursuing needed ethics reforms in the student loan industry   It simplifies the federal financial aid application and delivery process  to ensure that this complex system does not work as a barrier to access for low income students   It demands that colleges do their part to keep college costs down  If we do our part to provide needed student aid  they must do their part to keep their tuition and fees reasonable   And it reforms and improves our teacher preparation system  Teachers are the backbone of our schools  The reauthorization bill promotes high quality teacher preparation programs  and helps recruit and retain high quality teachers in high need schools  The Higher Education Reauthorization bill goes hand in hand with the legislation before us today  Senator Enzi and I look forward to working with our colleagues in the House to ensure that it is also enacted before the end of this session  For many years  Congress was guided by one clear principle with respect to higher education  that no qualified student should be denied the opportunity to attend college because of the cost  I know how important that principle was for President Kennedy  My brother believed very strongly that if you work hard  study hard  and are accepted to college  you should be able to attend the college of your choice  without regard to cost  That view resonated powerfully with students and families  and it helped create the groundswell that led to the creation of the Higher Education Act of 1965  Weve lost sight of that principle in recent years  but with this bill  we will renew it once again Im grateful to my colleague Senator Enzi  and to all the Members of our Committee who helped shape this important legislation  Because of their able work  the Senate approved the legislation earlier this summer with a resounding bipartisan vote  and I look forward to final passage of this bill by a similar strong bipartisan majority       Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
