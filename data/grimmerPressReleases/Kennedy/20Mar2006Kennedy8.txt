         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   WASHINGTON  D C     Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on President Bush s speech on Iraq  We all hope for success in Iraq  but the President s 2006 version of the Mission Accomplished strategy is hardly reassuring  The President seems blinded from reality by his misguided optimism He continues to justify his incomprehensible decision to go to war  when all available evidence proves that the decision was a colossal mistake that has been followed by blunder after blunder He failed to act against the Iraqi insurgency before it was too late  He waited a year to begin training the Iraqi security forces  He failed to see the danger of improvised explosive devices and sent our troops into battle year after year without proper protection Now he fails to see the very real possibility that Iraq will continue the downward spiral into full scale civil war  Three months after the election  there is still no new Iraqi government  The President should work with the Arab League and the United Nations to convene a high level summit that will bring the Iraqi political factions together to form a broad based government Our men and women in the armed forces are serving with great skill and courage  and they deserve no less    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
