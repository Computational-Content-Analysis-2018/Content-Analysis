         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy   202  224 2633    Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Governor Mitt Romney  Senator John F  Kerry  and Congressman William D  Delahunt said new calculations show that the Department of Defense seriously overstated the estimated savings to be achieved by closing Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod by half a billion dollars  The new calculations correct a Defense Department error first brought to light on July 18th by U S  Comptroller General David Walker who heads the Government Accountability Office    According to the new calculations  which have been provided by the Massachusetts Air National Guard to the BRAC Commission  closing Otis will cost the federal government  163 million over the next 20 years  compared to the  336 million in savings that the Defense Department claimed it can achieve if Otis is closed    In his July 18th testimony to the BRAC Commission in Washington  Walker testified that the Defense Department had exaggerated the savings from reducing personnel  since the personnel will be transferred to another defense facility rather than dropped from the force  As Walker stated  If an increase in end strength is not planned and you are simply redirecting the freed up resources to another area of need  it should be viewed as enhancing capabilities and achieving more effective utilization of resources but not as dollar savings  This is simple math     Since the Air National Guard is not planning any reduction in personnel as a result of BRAC  and since other federal agencies remaining at Otis after the Air Guard leaves must pick up the Guard s share of general maintenance expenditures for the base and since the Guard must train new pilots and new maintenance if the base is closed  their adjustments totaling  499 million must be made in the Department s estimates of savings    Department s estimate in net present value   184 million from overstated personnel related savings    250 million in costs transferred to other federal agencies at Otis  and  65 million to train new pilots and maintenance personnel to fly the Guard s F 15s after they leave Otis    Senator Kennedy said  The cost savings were the heart of the Administration s rationale for closing Otis  in spite of the obvious disadvantage for national security  The new calculations make a strong case for measuring Otis  and I m optimistic that both the Pentagon and the Commission will agree    I have always believed we have a very strong case to make to the BRAC Commission for keeping Otis open  The new calculations on cost savings are additional pieces of direct  hard evidence that underscore the fact Otis should never have been on the list of recommendations for closure  said Governor Romney     We have known all along how valuable Otis is to homeland defense  These latest figures demonstrate how costly it would be in strictly monetary terms to close Otis  Whether we re talking about cost  mission  or the courage and skill of the men and women who serve there  Otis should remain open  said Senator Kerry     We have made the case that closing Otis makes no sense in terms of homeland security  and Coast Guard operations  Congressman Delahunt said  Today  we now have the hard evidence to also show that closing Otis provides the taxpayers with no real savings and will in the long run be far more costly to our nation    The BRAC Commission will hold hearings on Thursday  in Washington on the Air National Guard recommendations  The Commission s final deliberations will begin the week of August 22nd  and its recommendations to the President must be submitted by September 8th   Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy   202  224 2633
