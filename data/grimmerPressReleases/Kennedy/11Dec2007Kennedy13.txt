         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to the United States Sentencing Commissions decision to apply retroactivity for crack cocaine offenders sentences      I commend the Commission for retroactively applying reduced sentences for crack cocaine  Nearly 20 000 non violent  low level drug offenders will be eligible for a reduction in the excessive prison terms they received in the past because of the unacceptable disparity in the sentencing guidelines between crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses      Those who break the law deserve to be punished  but our system says that punishment must be proportionate and fair  The current sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine is neither     Senator Kennedy sent a letter to Judge Richardo H  Hinojosa  Chairman of the United States Sentencing Commission  urging retroactivity  The text of the letter is below         November 9  2007    The Honorable Ricardo H  Hinojosa  Chairman  U S  Sentencing Commission  One Columbus Circle  N E   Washington  D C   20002 8002    Dear Judge Hinojosa     The American criminal justice system is built on a tradition of rational  principled judgment  Those who break the law deserve to be punished  but our system says that punishment must be proportionate and fair  The current sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine is neither      I commend the Commissions decision to eliminate unwarranted disparities in the federal crack and powder laws  Reducing the sentencing range  even moderately  will affect 78  of federal defendants  I strongly urge the Commission to go further  and make the amendment retroactive     The Amendment meets the three conditions the Commission has identified as justifying retroactivity  it would make the guidelines more proportionate  would be of significant magnitude  and could be formulaically applied      In the 21 years that the disparity in sentencing has been in effect  it has overstated the relative danger of crack cocaine to powder  contributed to the rapid growth of our prison population  disproportionately affected African Americans and the urban poor  and used limited federal resources on low level street dealers rather than on major drug traffickers  Equally significant  according to the Commissions own analysis  the disparity and its impact  no matter how unintended  have created both real and perceived injustices that undermine public faith in the legal system     The Commissions own analysis suggests that if the amendment is made retroactive  nearly 20 000 non violent  low level drug offenders will be eligible for a reduction in their sentences  sentences so harsh that they will no longer be imposed on people who commit the very same offenses in the future  Fairness alone dictates that the Commission make the Amendment retroactive      The decision to make the amendment retroactive would be based in precedent  In the past two decades  the Commission has made every amendment that modifies the calculation of drug sentences retroactive  The principles of consistency and proportionality should likewise lead the Commission to make the Amendment retroactive Im prepared to indicate our support for a decision publicly in favor of retroactivity  and will work with all interested parties to build public and Congressional support for such a decision         With respect and appreciation       Edward M  Kennedy           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
