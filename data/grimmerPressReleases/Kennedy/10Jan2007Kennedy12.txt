         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to President Bushs address tonight The American people are demanding a change in course in Iraq  Instead  the President is accelerating the same failed course he has pursued for nearly four years  He must understand that Congress will not endorse this course  The Presidents decision to send more American troops into the cauldron of civil war is not an acceptable strategy  It is against the advice of his own generals  the Iraq Study Group  and the wishes of the American people and will only compound our original mistake in going to war in Iraq  The President talked about strengthening relations with Congress  He should begin by seeking authority from Congress for any escalation of the war  The mission of our armed forces today in Iraq no longer bears any resemblance to the mission authorized by Congress in 2002  The Iraq War Resolution authorized a war against the regime of Saddam Hussein because he was believed to have weapons of mass destruction  an operational relationship with Al Qaeda  and was in defiance of U N  Security Council Resolutions  Not one member of Congress would have voted in favor of it they thought they were sending American troops into a civil war  The President owes it to the American people to seek approval for this new mission from Congress  Congress should no longer be a rubber stamp for the Presidents failed strategy  and should insist on a policy that is worthy of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform   Laura Capps Melissa  Wagoner 202 224 2633
