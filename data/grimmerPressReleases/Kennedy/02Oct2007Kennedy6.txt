         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement on the introduction of the Public Safety Employer  Employee Cooperation Act      This bipartisan legislation will ensure that the men and women on the front lines of our effort to keep America safe    our firefighters  police officers  and emergency medical personnel    will have the voice they need to remain safe at work and protect our communities  It s a matter of basic fairness that will ensure that these first responders can continue their essential work and maintain strong working partnerships with the communities they serve      As Prepared for Delivery     It is a privilege to join Senator Gregg today in reintroducing the Public Safety Employer Employee Cooperation Act  to guarantee that all firefighters  police officers  emergency medical personnel  and other first responders across the country have fundamental collective bargaining rights  The issue is one of basic respect for this valuable workforce  and I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill     The first responders of our state and local governments are on the frontlines of the effort to keep America safe  They perform difficult  exhausting work  day and night  to preserve and protect our communities  In this post 9 11 era  they have an indispensible role in homeland security as well  It is vital to our national interest to ensure that these essential public services are carried out as effectively as possible     Strong partnerships between first responders and the cities and states they serve are vital to public safety  Studies show that cooperation between public safety employers and employees improves the quality of services communities receive and reduces worker fatalities  These strong  cooperative partnerships are built on bargaining relationships  Every New York City firefighter  emergency medical technician  and police officer who responded to the disaster at the World Trade  Center on 9 11 was a union member under a collective bargaining agreement  and those agreements strengthened their ability to respond in that time of crisis     Unfortunately  many first responders across the country do not have basic workplace protections  29 states and the District of Columbia guarantee all public safety workers the right to bargain collectively  but 21 states deny some or all of their public safety workers this fundamental right     Our nations first responders have earned the right to be treated with respect  The Cooperation Act will ensure that they receive that respect  and will benefit from the same protections enjoyed by many other workers across the country  The bill gives public safety officers the right to bargain over wages  hours  and working conditions  and ensures that these rights are enforceable in state court  It also provides an efficient and effective means to resolve disputes in labor management conflicts     The Cooperation Act accomplishes these important goals in reasonable  moderate ways  States that already have collective bargaining in place for public safety workers are not affected by the bill  States that do not currently provide these protections may establish their own collective bargaining systems  or ask the assistance of the Federal Labor Relations Authority in doing so  This approach respects existing state laws  and gives each state full authority to decide how it will comply with the basic standards     Americas public safety workers are prepared to put their lives on the line for their community each and every day  They deserve a voice at the table in the life and death decisions about their work  Its essential for their safety  the safety of our communities  and the safety of our entire nation  Its a matter of basic fairness for these courageous men and women to have the same rights that have long benefited so many other Americans  I urge Congress to act quickly to provide these fundamental protections          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
