         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Despite the latest White House sales campaign  the American people have rightly lost confidence in President Bush s disastrous handling of Iraq  He misled the American people about the need for war  and mishandled the insurgency as it began to erupt  and shamefully failed even to supply our troops with the basic armor they needed to protect themselves from roadside explosives  America doesn t need a salesman for a dangerously incompetent policy    we need leadership and a policy that can succeed   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
