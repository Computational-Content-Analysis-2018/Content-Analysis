         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     The sad anniversary of the Abu Ghraib torture scandal is now upon us  It s an appropriate time to reflect on how well we ve responded as a nation    The images of cruelty  and perversion are still difficult to look at a year later  An Iraqi prisoner in a dark hood and cape  standing on a cardboard box with electrodes attached to his body  Naked men forced to simulate sex acts on each other  The corpse of a man who had been beaten to death  lying in ice  next to soldiers smiling and giving a thumbs up sign  A pool of blood from the wounds of a naked  defenseless prisoner attacked by a military dog    These images are seared into our collective memory  The reports of widespread abuse by U S  personnel were initially met with disbelief  then incomprehension  They stand in sharp contrast to the values America has always stood forour belief in the dignity and worth of all peopleour unequivocal stance against torture and abuse    our commitment to the rule of law  The images horrified us and severely damaged our reputation in the Middle East and around the world    On December 4  2003  President Bush had proclaimed to the world that the capture of Saddam Hussein brought further assurance that the torture chambers and the secret police are gone forever  The photos of Abu Ghraib made all too clear that torture continued in occupied Iraq    Where are we a year later  Has this problem been resolved  Has the moral authority of the U S  been restored  Have we recovered from what is perhaps the steepest and deepest fall from grace in our history    Sadly  the answer is no  because at every opportunity  the Administration has tried to minimize the problem and avoid responsibility for it    The tone was set at the very start  Senior level military commanders knew about the problems much earlier  They knew about Abu Ghraib photos as early as January 2004  General Taguba submitted his scathing report on February 26th  Yet rather than deal with the problem honestly  Pentagon officials persuaded CBS News to delay its report while they developed a damage control plan     The plan included an effort to minimize the abuse as the work of a few bad applesall conveniently lower rank soldiersin a desperate effort to emphasize the role of senior military officials in exposing the scandal and insulate the civilian leadership from responsibility    It was clear from the start that further investigation of the abuses was needed  The American people deserved a thorough review of all detention and interrogation policies used by military and intelligence personnel abroad  and a full accounting of all officials responsible for the policies that allowed the abuses to take place    What we got instead were nine incomplete and self serving internal investigations by the Pentagon  None of the assigned investigators were given the authority to challenge the conduct of the civilian command  For example  the Schlesinger Panel s report found that abuses were widespread and that there was both institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels  but Secretary Rumsfeld did not authorize the panel to address matters of personal accountability    The assigned investigators were also denied the cooperation of the C I A   which had a central role in the torture scandal  General Fay found that C I A  practices led to a loss of accountability  abuse and poisoned the atmosphere at Abu Ghraib  His efforts to fully uncover the agency s role  however  were stymied by their refusal to respond to his requests for information  Indeed  no investigation  Congressional or otherwise  has gotten full cooperation from the C I A    With respect to matters under the Defense Department s control  the answers we ve received have been inconsistent and incomplete     In May 2004  General Sanchez categorically denied to the Senate Armed Services Committee that he had approved the use of sleep deprivation  excessive noise  and intimidation by guard dogs as interrogation techniques in Iraq  A memorandum uncovered last month by the ACLU  however  showed that he had in fact approved the use of these techniques    Secretary Rumsfeld told the Committee that the military received its first indication of trouble at Abu Ghraib when a low ranking soldier came forward in January 2004  Only later did we learn from press reports that throughout 2003  the Red Cross had provided the military with detailed reports about torture and other abuses at the prison and elsewhere in Iraq  The State Department and the Coalition Provision Authority also appealed to top military officials to stop the abuse during 2003    The Church Report  released last month  rejected any connection between the official interrogation policies in Iraq and the abuses that occurred  The Fay Report  by contrast  blamed the abuses at Abu Ghraib on a number of systemic problems that included inadequate interrogation doctrine and training and the lack of clear interrogation policy for the Iraq Campaign    Other parts of the Church Report    including those on the role of General Counsel William Haynes in adopting the radical legal reasoning of the Justice Department s Bybee Memorandum  over the vigorous objections of experienced JAG officers    have been wrongly classified  In fact  the Defense Department has repeatedly abused its classification procedures to hide critical information from Congress and the public  Similarly  the Justice Department has gone to extremes to withhold from public scrutiny legal memos it considers too embarrassing to reveal    Even Congress has been remiss in its responsibilities to oversee this scandal  As Senator Rockefeller  the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence said  More disturbingly  the Senate Intelligence Committee    the Committee charged with overseeing intelligence programs and the only one with the jurisdiction to investigate all aspects of this issue    is sitting on the sidelines and effectively abdicating its oversight responsibility to media investigative reporters    A year after Abu Ghraib  new revelations about abuse committed by U S  personnel are still being reported frequently  The military has confirmed 28 acts of homicide committed against detainees in U S  custody in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2002  Only one of these deaths took place at Abu Ghraib    The Red Cross has documented scores of abuses at U S  facilities across Iraq and Afghanistan and at the naval base at Guantanamo    F B I  agents have reported torture techniques at Guantanamo  including techniques that senior Pentagon officials had specifically denied were being used    Top officials in the Administration have endorsed interrogation methods that we ve condemned in other countries  including binding prisoners in painful stress positions  threatening them with dogs  extended sleep deprivation  and simulated drownings    The Administration has also increased the practice of rendering detainees to countries like Syria  Egypt  and Jordan    countries that the State Department condemned in its most recent human rights reports because of their use of torture  The practice of rendition    described by a former C I A  official as finding someone else to do your dirty work    is a clear violation of our treaty obligations under the Convention Against Torture    We know that many of these harsh techniques are no more effective at obtaining reliable information than traditional law enforcement techniques  After considerable debate with the FBI  the military acknowledged that its methods were no more successful during interrogations at Guantanamo Bay than the FBI s methods  General Miller  the former commander at Guantanamo  testified that the Army Field Manual provided sufficient tools for intelligence gathering     As Ambassador Negroponte  our nation s new intelligence czar said  Not only is torture illegal and reprehensible  but even if it were not so  I don t think it s an effective way of producing useful information  Stripped to its essence  torturing prisoners is morally wrong and unproductive    Yet  political leaders made a deliberate decision to throw out the well established legal framework that has long made America the gold standard for human rights throughout the world  The Administration left our soldiers  case officers  and intelligence agents in a fog of ambiguity  They were told to take the gloves off without knowing what the limits were    In a series of secret memos and correspondence    some of which have still not been provided to Congresstop level Administration lawyers engaged in a wholesale rewriting of human rights law     They redefined torture so narrowly as to be meaningless      They adopted a concept of Presidential power so expansive that it denied the authority of Congress to pass laws prohibiting acts of torture    even in the Uniform Code of Military Justice     They approved long discredited defenses to torture like necessity  self defense  and superior orders    defenses that have been rejected since the Nuremberg Trials following World War II     They argued that contrary to longstanding precedent  international law does not bind any U S  official      They reinterpreted our treaty obligations in order to authorize the C I A  to engage in cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment  to remove protected persons from Iraq for interrogation  and to render persons to countries known to practice torture    In rewriting our human rights laws  the Administration consistently overruled the objections of experienced military personnel and diplomats  As Secretary of State Colin Powell warned the White House  It will reverse over a century of U S  policy and practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine the protections of the law of war for our troops  Senior Defense officials were warned that changing the rules could lead to so called force drift  in which  without clearer guidance  the level of force applied to an uncooperative detainee might well result in torture    When leaders didn t like what they heard  they cut off the criticism  When Secretary Powell raised concerns about the decision not to apply the Geneva Conventions to the conflict in Afghanistan  White House Counsel Gonzales cut him out of the process  When lawyers objected to the radical views in the Bybee Torture Memorandum  Defense Department General Counsel Haynes cut them out of the process and made the memo official policy for the entire military    What happened here was not a reasoned response to 9 11    an objective reassessment of our rules and policies to account for the rise in terrorism  Instead  the leaders used 9 11 to undermine any constraints on the power of the President  and the country has been paying a high price for their arrogance ever since    Dozens of Administration memoranda involving post 9 11 detention and interrogation have come to light in the past year  Yet in not one of these memos is there an appreciation of how well the existing rules served the nation in past conflicts  Not one of them explains why the Army s interrogation manual  which discusses dozens of effective techniques that comply with domestic and international law  no longer serves America s interests  Not one of them comments on how compliance with the Geneva Conventions protects U S  soldiers    Clearly  the civilian lawyers in the Defense Department  the Justice Department  and the White House Counsel s office have been on an ideological mission  Their goal was not to reassess the current rules on detention and interrogation in light of the 9 11 attacks  their goal was to destroy them  and to a large extent  they succeeded    The military was set adrift from its longstanding rules and traditions  The Bybee Torture Memorandum was eventually repudiated by the Justice Department  but the Pentagon s Working Group Report of April 2003  which incorporated the Bybee Memorandum nearly verbatim  has still not been explicitly superceded  and no new guidance has gone to the field     Our men and women in the military are still not clear whether and to what extent they should consider themselves bound by the Convention Against Torture  the federal law prohibiting torture  or even the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that prohibit torture and cruel treatment  The basic validity of the military s golden rule    treat captured enemy forces as we would want our own prisoners of war to be treated    is in doubt    The President has directed the military to treat detainees humanely  but this directive has not provided adequate guidance to our troops  General Counsel Haynes himself advised Secretary Rumsfeld that simulated drowning  forced nudity  the use of dogs to create stress  threats to kill a detainee s family  and other extreme tactics all qualified as humane  When the Pentagon s top civilian lawyer shows so little respect for human dignity  how can we expect more from our soldiers serving in the field    As for the C I A   it was conspicuously excluded from the President s directive on humane treatment  More recently  we ve learned that the Administration does not believe that the prohibition against cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment applies to foreigners held by our government agencies abroad  The C I A  concealed detainees from the Army and the Red Cross  It continues to send dozens of detainees to countries known to practice torture  It says it s conducting its own investigation into the abuses  but it refuses to provide a timetable or any preliminary findings  No agency should be above the law  The C I A  must answer for its activities     Accountability for the torture scandal continues to be lacking    We know about the prosecutions of the low level  bad apple soldiers involved in the abuse at Abu Ghraib  But prosecutions have been declined for other soldiers  including 17 implicated in the deaths of three prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan  Not a single C I A  official has been charged  although one private contractor is awaiting trial for the killing of a detainee in Afghanistan    Even more disturbing  no action    criminal  administrative  or otherwise    has been taken against the high civilian officials responsible for the authorization of torture and mistreatment by U S  officials in Iraq  Afghanistan  Guantanamo  and elsewhere  We know about the actions that have been taken against Charles Graner and Lynndie England  But what about William Haynes  Alberto Gonzales  Jay Bybee  John Yoo  David Addington  Douglas Feith     These officials were warned of the consequences of undoing the rules before they changed them  They were informed of the objections to use of these harsh techniques  The FBI  the Naval Criminal Investigative Service  and the British all refused to participate in interrogations because they had such grave concerns about the brutal methods  Finally  one brave soldier  Joseph Darby  acknowledged that what was happening was wrong    Far from being held accountable  some of these officials have been promoted  Bybee  who signed the notorious Justice Department memorandum redefining torture  was confirmed to a lifetime judgeship on a federal appellate court  Haynes  the General Counsel who made the Bybee Memorandum official policy for the military  has been re nominated for another appellate judgeship  Gonzales now serves as the nation s Attorney General     Last weekend  the Army s Inspector General revealed he had exonerated almost all of its top officers of any responsibility for abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib  even though one of them  Lieutenant General Sanchez  explicitly approved the use of severe interrogation practices  and even through a review by former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger found that General Sanchez and his deputy failed to ensure proper staff oversight of the operations at Abu Ghraib    What signal does this pattern of prosecutions for low ranking soldiers  exonerations for generals  and promotion for civilians send to our men and women in the armed services  and to our veterans    The torture scandal is not going away on its own  Our nation will continue to be harmed by the reports of abuse of detainees in U S  custody  the failure by top officials to take action  and the abandonment of our basic rules and traditions on human rights    The scandal directly endangers U S  soldiers and U S  civilians abroad  We no longer demand that those we capture in the war on terrorism be treated as we treat prisoners of other wars  What will we say to a country that justifies its torture of a U S  soldier by citing our support for such treatment  How we can we hold other nations accountable for their own human rights violations  when we continue to hold prisoners for years  without charging them or convicting them of anything     The nation s standing as a leader on human rights and respect for the rule of law has been severely undermined      We cannot simply answer  as some have done  that the behavior is acceptable because terrorists do worse  By lowering our standards  we have reduced our moral authority in the world  The torture scandal has clearly set back our effort in the war on terrorism  It is fueling the current insurgency in Iraq  Even our closest allies  such as Great Britain  have raised objections to our treatment and rendition of detainees    Al Qaeda is still the gravest threat we face  The widespread perception that the U S  condones torture only strengthens the ability of Al Qaeda and others to create a backlash of hatred against America around the world  If we do not act to locate official responsibility for Abu Ghraib  we will condone a new status quo in which our policy toward torture is technically one of zero tolerance  while de facto our officials tolerate and commit torture daily    Many of us were struck by the rhetoric in President Bush s Inaugural Address  From the day of our founding  he said  we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights  and dignity  and matchless value  because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth  Many of us would like to work with the President to develop a foreign policy that advances these important values  But rarely has the gulf between a President s rhetoric and his Administration s actions been so wide  It is simply not possible to reconcile his claim that America s belief in human dignity will guide our policies with the barbaric acts that have been committed in America s name     We must not allow inaction to undermine two bedrock principles of human rights law that we worked hard to establish at Nuremberg  that higher officials cannot escape command responsibility and lower officials cannot excuse their actions by claiming that they were just following orders    It is time to come to terms with the continuing costs of the torture scandal  and respond effectively  We need to fully restore the nation s credibility and moral standing  so that we can more effectively pursue the nation s interests in the future    First  we must acknowledge that the rule of law is not a luxury to be abandoned in time of war  or bent or circumvented at the whim and convenience of the White House  It is a fundamental safeguard in our democracy and a continuing source of our country s strength throughout the world    Sadly  a recent National Defense Strategy policy contained this remarkable statement  Our strength as a nation state will continue to be challenged by those who employ a strategy of the weak using international fora  judicial processes  and terrorism  Who could have imagined that our government would ever describe judicial processes as a challenge to our national securitymuch less mention it in the same breath as terrorism  Such statements do not reflect traditional conservative values  and they are clearly inconsistent with the ideals that America has always stood for here and around the world     Second  we must acknowledge and apply the broad consensus that exists against torture and inhumane treatment    Never before has torture been a Republican versus Democrat issue  Instead  it s always been an issue of broad consensus and ideals  reflecting the fundamental values of the nation  and the ideals of the world    President Reagan signed the Convention Against Torture in 1988  The first President Bush and President Clinton supported its ratification  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee  led by Senator Jesse Helms voted 10 0 in 1994 to recommend that the full Senate approve it  The Clinton Administration adopted a zero tolerance policy on torture  Torture became something that Americans of all political affiliations agreed never to do    9 11 didn t nullify this consensus  We did not resolve as a nation to set aside our values and the Constitution after those vicious attacks  We did not decide as a nation to stoop to the level of the terrorists  and those who did deserve to be held fully accountable   Americans continue to be united in the belief that an essential part of winning the war on terrorism and protecting the country for the future is safeguarding the ideals and values that America stands for at home and around the world    That includes the belief that torture is still beyond the pale  The vast majority of Americans strongly reject the cruel interrogation tactics used in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo    including the use of painful stress positions  sexual humiliation  threatening prisoners with dogs  and shipping detainees to countries that practice torture  The American people hold fast to our most fundamental values  It is time for all branches of the government to uphold those values as well  It is clear beyond a doubt that we cannot trust this Republican Congress or this Republican Administration to conduct the full investigation that should have been conducted long before now  We ve had enough whitewashes by the Administration and Congressional Committees     Finally  to implement these values  we need a full and independent investigation of our current detention  rendition  and interrogation policies  including an honest assessment of what went wrong in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo     The investigation will require genuine candor and cooperation by all officials and agencies in the Bush Administration  full accountability  a clear statement of respect for human rights  and a plan for protecting those rights throughout the government  Only a truly independent and thorough investigation can restore America s reputation and put us back on the right path to the future    The challenges we face in the post 9 11 world are obvious  and the stakes are very high  Working together  we have met such challenges before  and I m confident we can do so again  I urge all of my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle  to join together to protect the rule of law  protect our soldiers serving abroad  and restore America s standing in the world   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202
