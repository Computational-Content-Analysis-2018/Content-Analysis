         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I strongly support this bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act  Thirteen months have passed since our Committee first approved the bill  and I commend Chairman Enzi for his leadership and perseverance in bringing it before the Senate today  The reauthorization renews our commitment to raising the skills of the American workforce and helping workers compete in the job market  The bill will increase opportunities for workers to find new or better jobs  enable them to hold the good jobs of the future  and help the nation maintain its leadership in the global economy  The bill strengthens the so called One Stop system  which is a comprehensive service delivery system for job seekers and employers  The system is a lifeline for workers who have lost their jobs and need assistance and training to get back on track  It creates stronger partnerships with businesses to recruit new workers and train current workers  so that many more people can be served  It improves opportunities for career ladders and enables job training centers to work with local leaders and businesses to meet the changing needs of their community  The services that one stops deliver are needed now more than ever as Americans struggle to adjust to the forces of globalization transforming our society and our workforce  The bill also encourages local service providers to continue their training programs until employees are self sufficient  so that a support system will be in place to help workers qualify for better paying jobs that will enable them to provide for themselves and their families  In addition  the youth program in the bill will continue to work with both in school and out of school youths to help them obtain the education and the job experience they need to succeed in the future The bill pays particular attention to the needs of people with disabilities  Workforce training programs must coordinate with vocational rehabilitation programs to provide many more opportunities for those with physical or mental challenges  Through vocational rehabilitation  they can obtain the training  counseling  support and job opportunities they need in order to have independent  productive  and fulfilling lives  For millions of these Americans  vocational rehabilitation is the difference between dependence and independence  between lost potential and a productive career  The bill also contains the Adult Literacy Act  which funds critical programs for states to assist adults in obtaining the basic reading  writing and English language skills they need in order to participate fully in the workforce and in society  In December  the Department of Education released the results of the most recent National Assessment of Adult Literacy  and the facts are alarming  Only a quarter of college graduates could read a document well enough to be considered proficient  Adults in Massachusetts are struggling  26  scored at or below basic the level in document literacy and 46  scored at the lowest levels in quantitative literacy  Improving these skills is a key component of job training  and we need to do more to for those who recognize their need to improve these skills in order to improve their lives The Workforce Investment Act has improved the quality of job training and strengthened connections between employers and training providers  In 2004  every state met or exceeded its performance level for getting participants into employment  The national average was 80 percent of job seekers who entered employment  Currently  there are not enough skilled workers in Massachusetts in key industries such as health care  education  community and social services  and the sciences  Workforce investment boards across the state have been doing their part to fill these needs  For example  the Northshore Workforce Investment Board works with 15 long term care facilities in the region to train workers in basic and clinical skills  Statewide  the Extended Care Career Ladder Initiative has trained over 6 500 workers in over 140 facilities  Wages increase as these workers move up the ladder  and the facilities are able to retain skilled employees and save on personnel costs With the extraordinary needs of people looking for jobs  people struggling to keep their jobs and the new needs of employers  the Workforce Investment Act and the services it provides are in high demand  Unfortunately  the Bush Administration has continued to underfund and undermine these programs  We need to invest adequate amounts in job training  so that more Americans can take advantage of these opportunities The Senates passage of this reauthorization today is a strong sign of support for the workforce system and the programs that help millions of American workers find new and good jobs  Our bipartisan effort in the Senate enabled us to reach a worthwhile consensus on these provisions  and I urge our colleagues in the House to pass this bipartisan package as well  Todays skill deficiencies and the skill demands of tomorrow will require a significant new investment in education and job training  This bill will help workers obtain the training they need to meet the employment priorities of their community  and in doing so will strengthen the entire American workforce and its ability to compete in the global marketplace  It deserves to be enacted as soon as possible   Laura Capps Melissa  Wagoner 202 224 2633
