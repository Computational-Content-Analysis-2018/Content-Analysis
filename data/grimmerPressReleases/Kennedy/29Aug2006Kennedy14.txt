         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner August 29  2006         202  224 2633    Washington  D C Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   and 32 Congressional colleagues have urged Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to eliminate the backlog of immigration applications by retaining approximately 1 100 term employees hired since 2002  The letter was sent on Friday  August 25   Senator Kennedy said  This is no time to cut back on our commitment enforcing our immigration laws and ensuring that our national immigration priorities are met  Screening immigrants is every bit as vital to our national security as putting agents on the border  as we must welcome those who would contribute to our nation and keep out those who would harm us  We should continue our progress rather than go back to days of providing insufficient resources for a job that is so vital to the nations future   The Departments U S  Citizenship and Immigration Service hired more than 1 100 term employees since 2002  These employees helped reduce a backlog of immigration applications from its height of 3 8 million pending applications in January 2004 to approximately 600 000 today  However  CIS has announced that it will not extend the terms of these employees beyond their current expiration dates   between September 30  2006 and January 2007    A 2005 GAO report  GAO 06 20  states that USCIS has made progress in reducing the backlog of benefit applications primarily by increasing and realigning staff    CIS has established a goal of eliminating the backlog by the end of this fiscal year  but GAO states that it seems unlikely that CIS will meet its backlog elimination goal    The bicameral letter urges the Department to reverse its policy and either extend the term employees contracts or permanently hire them  The letter was cosigned by  Senators Daniel Akaka  Max Baucus  Jeff Bingaman  Barbara Boxer  Maria Cantwell  Hillary Rodham Clinton  Mark Dayton  Mike DeWine  Richard Durbin  Russell Feingold  James Jeffords  John Kerry  Frank Lautenberg  Carl Levin  Robert Menendez  Barbara Mikulski  Barack Obama  Paul Sarbanes  Charles Schumer  Debbie Stabenow  and Representatives Nancy Pelosi  Tom Allen  Joe Baca  Elijah Cummings  Chaka Fattah  John Lewis  Stephen Lynch  Jim McDermott  Jerrold Nadler  Adam Schiff  Lee Terry  and Maxine Waters       Dear Secretary Chertoff      Were writing to respectfully request that the U S  Citizenship and Immigration  Service retain its term employees whose contracts expire at the end of this fiscal year  These  employees have expertise in processing immigration applications and petitions  and CIS  should not risk delays in those services by allowing their contracts to expire     Since 2002  more than 1100 employees were hired on a term basis to reduce the growing backlog of immigration applications and to process incoming applications  Since  then  the backlog has been significantly reduced with CIS granting contract extensions   sometimes for as many as four years    to its term employees  We urge CIS to allow this  progress to continue by either further extending the employees terms or making them permanent employees as quickly as possible    The Department has invested significant resources in the term employees training and security clearances  and these employees have developed expertise in processing immigration benefits claims  They are vital to the fulfillment by CIS of its mission to fairly and efficiently process immigration applications  However  CIS will be at risk of again  falling behind on processing applications unless the Department acts to retain the employees  whose current terms will expire on September 30  2006     As you know  Congress is considering immigration reform legislation  The Senate has already passed a comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform that has the support of President Bush  Passage of this legislation would make retaining these term employees particularly important  and we urge you to do so now     With respect and appreciation  and we thank you for your consideration of this  request   Sincerely
