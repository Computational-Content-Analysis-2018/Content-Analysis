         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy led the NSA domestic surveillance hearings by questioning Attorney General Gonzales on the effectiveness of the program  Senator Kennedy  the principal author of FISA believes our national security is weakened when the country is divided  The country is stronger and safer when we are protecting those intelligence officials working to protect us  Senator Kennedy underscored how willing Congress was and is to give the President the necessary tools to fight the war on terror because the Administration s actions also jeopardize current and future cases brought against suspected terrorists who may challenge the legality of the program     Today  there may be disagreement over the strength of the Administration s legal claims  But our successes of the past show that one point is clear  the Administration could have worked constructively with Congress to obtain the tools it needs to make our nation safe  but chose instead to take the riskier course of going it alone     Kennedy questioned Gonzales on his departure from past practice by circumventing the constitutionally required system of checks and balances  He proved how Congress has historically worked with Republican Presidents  pointing to the documents from the Ford Library detailing Kennedy s unique role  as the principal author of FISA   including 1  Kennedy s statement on the Administration s desire to have support of key Senators  including Antonin Scalia who was Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel from 1974 1978  2  support of past Attorney Generals for a close collaboration with Congress on national security laws involving wiretapping and 3  the importance of bipartisanship on matters of national security  highlighted by the Administration s efforts to secure the support of Senator Kennedy     Experts agree that the Bush administration s defense of its NSA domestic spying program lacks any plausible legal authority  On December 22  2005  a group of fourteen prominent constitutional experts     including a former Director of the FBI  a former Deputy Attorney General  a former Acting Solicitor General  two lawyers who worked in the executive branch under President George W  Bush  the Deans or former Deans of Yale  Stanford  and University of Chicago Law Schools  and a prominent conservative scholar and fellow at the Hoover Institution    wrote to Congress expressing their concerns     On January 9  2006  the group released another letter to Congressional leaders  The letter  which was addressed to Congressional leaders  responds to a December 22 Justice Department letter that sought to offer a legal defense of the program  The experts  letter makes three basic points    First  it rejects the Bush administration s first argument    that the Authorization to Use Military Force  AUMF  implicitly authorized warrantless domestic wiretapping  The authors note that the AUMF is silent on wiretapping  and that Congress has specifically stated in another statute that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA  and the criminal code    both of which require probable cause and a judicial order for wiretaps   are the exclusive means for electronic surveillance in the US     Second  the letter rejects the administration s contention that barring domestic warrantless wiretapping would raise a potential conflict with the President s Article II role as Commander in Chief  To say the President has inherent power to act in the absence of Congressional action  the authors note  does not mean that he has the power to act contrary to express statutory dictates where Congress has acted  Here  Congress and the President together enacted a law  FISA  that specifically addresses the topic  and President Bush is bound to follow that law    Third  the letter notes that warrantless domestic wiretapping raises serious questions under the Fourth Amendment  The Supreme Court has never upheld domestic wiretapping without probable cause and a warrant  And as FISA demonstrates  a warrant process can accommodate foreign intelligence searches     The letters  the Ford library documents  and Kennedy s opening remarks are attached     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
