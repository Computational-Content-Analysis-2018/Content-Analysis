         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  joined by his colleagues Senator John F  Kerry and Congressmen Barney Frank and James McGovern  sent a letter to Secretary Chertoff urging him to come in person to Fall River to see the implications of the proposed Liquefied Natural Gas  LNG  terminal  FERC  the federal agency with jurisdiction over the siting of such facilities  has already released its final Environmental Impact Statement that approves the site in Weavers Cove at the mouth of the Taunton River Kennedy  in a series of meetings on this topic over the past months  has expressed his concern that the siting of this proposed LNG terminal in densely populated Fall River could be dangerous in the event of a terrorist attack  According to a Sandia Lab Report  released in December  an LNG tanker or facility could be a serious target for terrorist attacks and that were it to catch fire  the lives of residents within a mile radius could be endangered Kennedy said  We asked the Secretary of Homeland Security to visit Fall River and see for himself that the project is a huge mistake and shouldn t go forward  Every security expert has weighed in on the grave danger it would inevitably create  I hope the Secretary accepts our invitation and joins us on a site visit as soon as possible It s important for Secretary Chertoff to see first hand and up close the reality and dangers of this proposed LNG site in Fall River  This isn t a line item in some theoretical blueprint  it s a real place with real people who feel threatened by the potential toxic mix of explosive fuels and terrorism  The post 9 11 world underscores the need to ensure the safety of every citizen in Massachusetts  said Senator John Kerry Congressman Barney Frank said  By coming to Fall River to evaluate the LNG proposal  Secretary Chertoff will have a chance to prevent a grave security threat as opposed to having to deal with it after the fact The Department of Homeland Security needs to give this issue the attention it deserves  Rep  McGovern said  It is quite clear that siting a huge LNG facility in the middle of Fall River would pose an unacceptable risk to the safety of the area s residents  I hope that Secretary Chertoff visits Fall River soon so that he can see firsthand what a bad idea this LNG proposal really is Additionally  Kennedy and Kerry  along with Congressman Frank and McGovern sent a letter to FERC asking for an additional hearing on safety issues surrounding this project  no response has been received     June 15  2005The Honorable Michael Chertoff Secretary  Department of Homeland Security Naval Security Station Nebraska and Massachusetts Avenues  NW Washington  D C  20528Attention  Marilyn Renner  Executive AssistantDear Mr  Secretary As you know  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  is about to decide whether to authorize Amerada Hess to build an LNG facility at Weaver s Cove in Fall River  Massachusetts  Since there are some 32 other LNG projects around the country seeking government approval  the decision on Fall River not only has vital importance for that city  but also will constitute a precedent for the rest of the country  For the first time in thirty years  FERC appears to be on the verge of approving a project that would be sited in a densely populated urban area In this post 9 11 environment  it would be foolhardy to approve the site  In the words of one expert  it would constitute an invitation to terrorism  We commend the Administration s effort to increase the nation s LNG supply  but acceptable siting alternatives are clearly available that do not risk the lives of men  women and children in densely populated urban areas As recently as June 10  a counter terrorism expert publicly quoted Osama bin Laden as saying  Attack the American infrastructure  Attack the American economy  Attack oil and natural gas facilities  Surely no greater warning is needed  The people of Massachusetts ask us  why isn t the government speaking out against this potentially disastrous project  Why aren t they protecting us We urge you to join us in a visit to Fall River as soon as possible  so that you can see personally the danger that such a facility would pose to the population of the area and the inviting target it would present for a terrorist attack  We hope very much that you will be able to make such a visit in the next few days  We re convinced  once you see for yourself where the facility would be located  and the narrow waterways that the massive LNG carriers would have to use to reach it  that you will agree that this project should not be approved  The consequences of a terrorist attack on the terminal or on one of the LNG tankers in the inland waters would be catastrophic  and that there would be virtually no ability to prevent or defend against such an attack On March 16  in your speech to the Homeland Security Policy Institute  you suggested a risk based approach in your operations by using a piece of the trio of threat  vulnerability and consequence as a general model for assessing risk and deciding on protective measure to be taken As an example of an approach  you said  A terrorist attack on the two lane bridge down the street from my house is a bad thing but has relatively low consequence compared to an attack on the Golden Gate Bridge  At the other end of the spectrum  even a remote threat to detonate a nuclear bomb is a high level priority because of this catastrophic effect A visit to Fall River will demonstrate dramatically that the bridge you will see there is analogous to the golden Gate Bridge  because an attack on it would cause inestimable damage to a huge number of lives and property  The threat is present  the vulnerability is high  and the consequence would be devastating  We very much want you to see this for yourself We hope that we can visit Fall River together before FERC makes its decision  so it will have the benefit of the Department s view before it acts  which we understand may be as soon as June 30 Thank you for your consideration of our request and we look forward to hearing from you as expeditiously as possible With respect and appreciation Sincerely Edward M  Kennedy John F  KerryBarney Frank James McGovern  Melissa Wagoner 202 224 2633
