         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Iran has become an increasingly more powerful player in the Middle East  But its nuclear ambitions and support for international terrorism are a threat to regional stability and to our national security  The question is what we do about it  The President said on January 10  that Iran is providing material support for attacks on American troops  and that wed disrupt the attacks and destroy the networks providing weapons and training to our enemies The next day we raided an Iranian government office in Iraq Last week  President Bush authorized U S  forces in Iraq to kill or capture Iranian operatives inside Iraq Yesterday  the President further raised the temperature by saying  If Iran escalates its military actions in Iraq to the detriment of our troops and  or innocent Iraqi people  we will respond firmly Some have suggested that your nomination  because youd be the first Naval officer to hold this command  plus the fact that the U S  recently sent an additional aircraft carrier battle group to the Gulf region might be a sign that the administration is preparing for military action against Iran  I certainly hope that is not the case Obviously  Congress must be involved in any decision to broaden war to Iran Have you been asked to update war plans for Iran  This committee certainly expects you to fully brief us on an ongoing basis on our plans and intentions on this all important question You were well known during your years in the Pacific Command for having a dialogue with many countries in the region  As Pacific Commander you gave a speech in 2005  9 7 2005  in Beijing where you talked about the need to increase our interactions with China  You said  If we are open with one another  if we share information and ideas  I think that  my experience has been  the tendency is to reduce the anxiety  to reduce the fears of the unknown  and the suspicions that come from lack of knowledge and doubt  Do you see merit to that approach in Central Command  particularly with Iran  Has the President told you not to talk to the Iranians  If there is no dialogue and exchange of information  how would you seek to prevent a further increase in tension between Iran and the United States What is your assessment of Irans naval capabilities and how the US would neutralize those capabilities  if it came to an attack Do you believe that Iran has the ability to close the Strait of Hormuz  How long it would take the US to open it up  How would you counter Irans efforts to lay mines The Administration has outlined military  economic  and political benchmarks to measure success in Iraq  But  it has not indicated any timeline to achieve them or clearly articulated the consequences if the benchmarks are not met  The Iraq Study Group said this  If the Iraqi government does not make substantial progress toward the achievement of milestones on national reconciliation  security  and governance  the United States should reduce its political  military  or economic support for the Iraqi government Do you agree that there should be consequences if the benchmarks are not met  If so  what is your timeline  If the Iraqis believe that the commitment of our military forces in Iraq is open ended  what incentive does it create for them to resolve their political differences and stop the sectarian violence    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
