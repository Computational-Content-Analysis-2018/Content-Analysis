         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     These charges  if true  represent a new low in the already sordid case of partisan interests being placed above national security  The Vice President s vindictiveness in defending the misguided war in Iraq is obvious  If he used classified information to defend it  he should be prepared to take full responsibility  President Bush has clearly said he would  clean house  of everyone who had anything to do with the Plame leak     The American people are also entitled to know whether the President knew that classified information was being used for this purpose  and whether he authorized it himself    In addition  they are entitled to know that the case will not be scuttled by the administration when the decisions are made on declassifying documents necessary for the trial   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
