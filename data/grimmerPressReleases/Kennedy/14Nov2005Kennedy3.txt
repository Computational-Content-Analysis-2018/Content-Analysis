         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent the following letter to Judge Samuel Alito in response to Alito s most recent explanation regarding his failure to recuse himself from a case involving Vanguard     PDF available upon request     November 14  2005   Judge Samuel A  Alito Jr  357 US Post Office and Courthouse Federal Square and Walnut Street Newark  NJ 07101   Dear Judge Alito    I m concerned that your November 10 letter on the Vanguard recusal issue to Senator Specter does not provide the information called for in my letter to you and the letter by eight Senators on the Judiciary Committee to Judge Scirica  Your response raises additional questions that I hope you will be prepared to answer when we meet tomorrow    For example  we still don t have an understanding of the court s recusal notification system  or what the oversight was that you mentioned in your letter  Was that a reference to your oversight or someone else s  If yours  how could that happen when you were still heavily invested in Vanguard companies  and  when the Vanguard name is so prominent in the caption of the case  and in other places including the opinion  Surely  whatever the system  the oversight should have been obvious when the case reached you    Certainly your participation in that case raised the same kind of questions that you saw so clearly in 1990 when you promised the Committee that you would recuse yourself in all Vanguard cases  The new suggestion that your promise was limited in duration is puzzling  Certainly the use of the word initial in the questionnaire did not relieve you of your obligations to us merely because of the passage of time  Obviously  the initial problem which you properly perceived would have disappeared only if your investment disappeared  but your investment in Vanguard  as far as we can tell  grew very substantially     We are also left in the dark as to which of the changing rationales was in your mind when you made the original decision not to recuse yourself in 2001  and what evidence there is of that  I assume you would have provided us with any evidence that some or all of these rationales were your contemporaneous conclusions after requesting or completing your own research on the matter  The absence of such evidence or assurances suggests that these after the fact rationales were instead created recently within the Executive Branch in response to the current controversy    In your commitment to the Committee  and in what you told the Chief Judge in your letter to him in 2003  you seemed to have a great sensitivity to the appearances    what you called the potential questions that might be raised  and you stated a personal policy that reflected that sensitivity    I look forward to discussing this and other matters with you tomorrow    Respectfully    Edward M  Kennedy   Cc  Senator Arlen Specter   Senator Patrick Leahy   The White House    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
