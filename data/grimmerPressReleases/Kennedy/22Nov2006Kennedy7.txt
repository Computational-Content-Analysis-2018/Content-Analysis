         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Dear Governor Romney   We re writing to express our strong support for the state s efforts to respond to the emergency in Massachusetts caused by the explosion at a Danvers industrial park  and to offer our assistance in obtaining a federal disaster declaration   The blast radius affected dozens of buildings within several hundreds of yards of the explosion  We are extremely thankful that no lives have been lost and for the brave work of the first responders and care providers and we pledge our full support in pursuing federal assistance for the recovery efforts   Right now  the Commonwealths efforts are appropriately focused on emergency response and recovery  and we believe the next step should be to seek a Presidential Disaster Declaration  As you know  such a declaration can provide support for a range of critical needs  such as temporary housing  emergency repairs  crisis counseling  medical care and unemployment assistance    The high concentration of this catastrophe will  undoubtedly  put a strain on the areas emergency  housing  and medical services  Federal assistance from a disaster declaration can ease the financial burden that might  otherwise  fall squarely on the shoulders of Danvers  surrounding communities and the Commonwealth    Again  you will have our full support in seeking a federal disaster declaration  and we look forward to working with you to help our communities recover  With respect and appreciation  Edward M  Kennedy John F  Kerry John F  Tierney
