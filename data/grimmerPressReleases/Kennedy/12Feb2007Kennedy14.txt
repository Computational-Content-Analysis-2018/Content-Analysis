         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington  D C   Today  Senators Edward M  Kennedy  Olympia Snowe and Representative Louise Slaughter introduced the Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2007  The increased use of antibiotics in livestock has created microbes resistant to all but the newest and most expensive drugs  The Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2007 will protect the health of Americans by phasing out the non therapeutic use in livestock of medically important antibiotics  unless their manufacturers can show that they pose no danger to the public health  Unfortunately  in recent years  we have done too little to prevent the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria and other germs  and many of our most powerful drugs are no longer effective  Senator Kennedy said  The nation is clearly at risk of an epidemic outbreak of food poisoning caused by drug resistant bacteria or other germs  In recent years  many nations  including the United States  have been plagued by outbreaks of food borne illnesses  It is time to put public safety first and stop this promiscuous use of drugs essential for protecting human health  The effectiveness of infectious disease fighting antibiotics continues to be compromised by their overuse for agricultural purposes  Snowe said and each year we fail to take action on this critical issue increases the risk that drug resistant bacteria will threaten the health of the American people  To ensure the effectiveness of these life saving medicines   the overuse of antibiotics must be a public health priority  When we go to the grocery store  we should expect that the food we buy will not inadvertently expose our families to dangerous strains of resistant bacteria  However  the practice of over using antibiotics in raising livestock   even when animals are not sick   is one of the leading contributors to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria  As a result  our risk of exposure to increasingly stronger bacteria is becoming a frightening reality  said Rep Slaughter  It is imperative that Congress enact this critical piece of legislation to protect the integrity of our antibiotics and the future health of our families  Fact sheet below  THE PRESERVATION OF ANTIBIOTICS FOR HUMAN TREATMENT ACT OF 2007 SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY AND OLYMPIA SNOWE Background  The widespread use of antibiotics beginning in the 1940 s provided  for the first time in history effective treatments for infectious diseases  These miracle drugs have saved countless lives  but they are losing their effectiveness  Antibiotics that once had the power to cure dangerous infections are now often useless  because microbes have become resistant to all but the newest and most expensive drugs  and some superbugs are impervious to any weapons in the medical arsenal  Resistance to antibiotics takes a heavy toll on patients across the nation  The World Health Organization estimates that 14 000 Americans die every year from drug resistant infections  This means that one American dies from a resistant infection every 38 minutes   It seems scarcely believable that these precious medications could be fed by the ton to chickens and pigs  but thats exactly whats happening in farms all over America  Over 20 million pounds of antibiotics are fed to farm animals every year  Thats more than is used in all of medicine  These precious drugs arent even used to treat sick animals  They are used to fatten pigs and speed the growth of chickens  The result of this rampant overuse is clear  meat contaminated with drug resistant bacteria sits on supermarket shelves all over America  Every family is potentially at risk  The most vulnerable among us  children  elderly  persons with HIV AIDS  are particularly endangered by resistant infections   At a time when the nation is relying on antibiotics and other medications to protect our homelands security from the grave threat of bioterrorism  we can no longer squander these precious weapons in the fight against disease by feeding them indiscriminately to livestock  Provisions of the Legislation  The Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2007 will protect the health of Americans by phasing out the non therapeutic use in livestock of medically important antibiotics  unless their manufacturers can show that they pose no danger to the public health  The Act requires this same tough standard of new applications for approval of animal antibiotics   The Act does not restrict use of antibiotics to treat sick animals or to treat pets and other animals not used for food  The below provisions are in the Senate bill   The Act provides for Federal payments to farmers to defray their costs in switching to antibiotic free husbandry practices  with a preference given to family farms  The Act also authorizes grants for research and demonstration programs on means to reduce the use of antibiotics in the raising of livestock   The Act requires manufacturers to report   1  on the amounts of antibiotics they supply for animal use  2  on the animals to which those drugs are given and  3  on the uses for which those drugs are supplied   Melissa Wagoner 202 224 2633
