         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     I commend our chairman  Senator Burr  for holding today s hearing on this important issue  Our subcommittee is off to an active start  and I commend him for the impressive pace he has set    Our hearing today focuses on twenty first century threats to health  Every powerful technology has the potential to be used for good and for harm  The potential for the life sciences to improve health and save lives is almost limitless    but in the hands of terrorists  the threats can be just as vast    Infectious diseases that once took years or even decades to affect the population of the world can now cross the globe with the speed of a jet plane  Old enemies like TB are returning in new and more dangerous forms resistant to the antibiotics we have relied on to defeat them  The specter of bioterrorism is still a constant danger    especially with new technologies to enhance the virulence of deadly viruses or to make dangerous pathogens immune to the drugs we count on to protect us     We re obviously vulnerable to attacks with all weapons of mass destruction    chemical  biological  or nuclear    but our focus today is on strengthening protections against biological attacks  Defending against them is an essential part of protecting homeland security  A microbe can be just as devastating as a bomb or missile  Our health defenses against attack need to be as strong as our military defenses    September 11th and the anthrax attacks of 2001 shattered our sense of invincibility  Although we have the strongest military in the world to defend against conventional attacks  we are not well prepared for acts of terrorism with biological weapons    Across the country  many local and state health agencies and laboratories are under funded  understaffed  and poorly equipped to respond to modern diseases  Hospitals are the foundation of our response to bioterrorism    but they re often starved for funds because of unwise budget cuts  Instead of strengthening our hospitals  the budget just approved by Congress weakens them still further  by slashing  10 billion from Medicaid    Three years after the anthrax attacks  we are still playing catch up and reacting  instead of carefully preparing and coordinating local  state and national efforts  We need a genuine preparedness plan to respond to bioterrorism response and coordinate federal  state  and local agencies     Information technology is an indispensable part of preparedness  Electronic health records allow real time tracking of disease outbreaks  so that early responses can be made effectively  Rapid detection of a bioterrorist attack or a new epidemic can mean the difference between a local outbreak and a national disaster  Yet  the Administration s proposals for funding information technology are grossly inadequate to make the progress we need    Another critical element of defense against bioterrorism is the development of countermeasures against biological weapons  We took a significant step toward that goal last July by enacting the bipartisan legislation called BioShield  Major contracts have now been signed under that law for new anthrax vaccines  If improvements to the legislation are needed  I m hopeful we can work together to provide them  Incentives to industry are also part of our defense  but the incentives have to be appropriate  We can t afford to squander resources on needless giveaways     These are basic issues that have to be addressed  and I hope our panelists today can bring new light to these issues and priorities  It s a special privilege to welcome John Deutch and Harvey Fineberg  who have contributed so much to our nation during their distinguished careers  I look forward to the testimony of all our witnesses on these immense challenges   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
