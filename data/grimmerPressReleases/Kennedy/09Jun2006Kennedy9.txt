delivery   Twenty nine years ago this month  we broke ground here on Columbia Point to begin construction of the John F  Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum    Today is another historical and momentous groundbreaking   It gives me great pleasure to announce a major and unprecedented effort by the National Archives  in a public private partnership with the Kennedy Library Foundation  to build a new Kennedy Presidential Library   This new library will be a digital one consisting of the entire collection of papers  documents  photographs and audio recordings of my brother Jack  eventually making them accessible to citizens throughout the world via the Kennedy Presidential Library and Museums new website   I am joined today by Allen Weinstein  Archivist of the United States  whose staff will oversee this effort  and Joe Tucci  Chairman  President and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation  whose company is providing the National Archives and archivists at the Kennedy Presidential Library with the technology and technical expertise needed to undertake the project   The groundbreaking initiative we are announcing today is the first of its kind in the nation    It is the direct result of the leadership and vision that Paul Kirk  Board Chairman of the Kennedy Library Foundation  and John Shattuck  Chief Executive Officer of the Foundation  have brought to this institution  working in partnership with the National Archives and the Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum  so ably directed by Deborah Leff   It was Paul and John who recruited Ed Schlossberg  husband of Caroline Kennedy  and founder of a world renowned design firm  to design the Kennedy Librarys new website  The website was launched in March  supported entirely by private resources raised by the Kennedy Library Foundation  Together with Ed  Paul and John approached EMC for its help in making President Kennedys archives available and accessible in digitized form to a world wide audience  and this resulted in the major EMC donation we are announcing today    I am very proud that the Kennedy Library Foundation    of which Caroline Kennedy serves as President    has forged such a strong public private partnership with the National Archives and its talented staff at the Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum  This partnership is moving the Kennedy Library into the 21st century  stronger and more relevant than ever to the challenging issues of our time   Because of this historical initiative  millions of documents  miles of film  and hundreds of thousands of photographs from President Kennedys administration will be scanned  digitized  index and permanently preserved   More importantly  they will be available to all citizens of the world  not just the scholars and researchers who make the journey to Boston   Included among the millions of historical papers  documents and images that will be permanently preserved from Jacks days in the White House are precious and irreplaceable records of our nations     struggle for Civil Rights      its conflict with the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War      its efforts to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth      its commitment to public service and creation of the Peace Corps       its prevention of a nuclear holocaust during the Cuban Missile Crisis       and its embrace of American art and culture under the guidance of first lady       Jacqueline Kennedy   This groundbreaking initiative has been made possible by EMC  whose in kind donation in software  hardware and technical support and services to the Kennedy Library Foundation is expected to exceed one million dollars for the total project   We are extremely fortunate that EMC has made such a generous and extraordinary donation to preserve forever this treasure of American history   EMC gives testimony to President Kennedys Inaugural call to Ask not what your country can do for you  Ask what you can do for your country   When he ran for President  John Kennedy spoke of a New Frontier   I believe the times demand new invention  innovation  imagination  decision  he said  and I am asking each of you to be pioneers on that New Frontier   How proud Jack would be that the technology  invention and imagination he so championed would one day be developed by a company in the state he so loved    Even moreso  that that technology would make the records of my brothers 1000 days in office available to every citizen in the world who has access to a computer and the World Wide Web   In describing the yet to be built library for her husband  Jacqueline Kennedy said she envisioned that it would be a vital center of education and exchange and thought  which will grow and change with the times   It will be  she said  not only a memorial to President Kennedy but a living center of study of the times in which he lived  which will inspire the ideals of democracy and freedom in young people all over the world   I believe we have kept faith with Jackies vision           Melissa Wagoner  Keith Maley 617 565 4472
