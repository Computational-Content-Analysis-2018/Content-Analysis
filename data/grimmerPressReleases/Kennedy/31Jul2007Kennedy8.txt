         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I join my colleagues in welcoming Admiral Mullen to the Committee today  Your experience in seven command tours is broad and deep and quite impressive  Youve been dedicated to the Navy and the nations security  and we thank you for your professionalism and service  When he announced the surge seven months ago  President Bush said it would bring security  create an opportunity for political reconciliation  and help reconstruction to make progress But violence continues  reconciliation is stalled  and reconstruction is faltering  There is no indication that the current surge will prove to be any better than the other failed strategies that preceded it  Admiral Mullen  how confident are you that our policy will succeed in creating conditions for a political settlement in the near term  meaning the next three to four months  You said in response to written questions from the Committee  failure to achieve tangible progress toward reconciliation requires a strategic reassessment  The question is how long we allow the status quo to continue before making that reassessment  The surge was to have created conditions to enable progress on reconciliation and it was supposed to be temporary In January  Secretary Gates said  Its viewed as a temporary surge In February  Secretary Gates told the Senate Appropriations Committee  I think General Petraeus believes that he will have a pretty good idea whether this surge and whether this strategy is working  probably by early summer  In April  Secretary Gates told us more time would be needed  He said  I think it s been General Petraeus  view all along thatsome time  at some point during the summer  mid to late summer  perhaps  he has thought that he would be in a position to evaluate whether the plan was working so far  In May  President Bush said even more time would be necessary  He told us  As General Petraeus has said  it will be at least the end of summer before we can assess the impact of this operation  Congress ought to give General Petraeus  plan a chance to work  A week later  Secretary Gates said the Administration would make their evaluation of the situation and the surge in September On May 9  Lt  General Raymond T  Odierno the Commander of the Multinational Corps of Iraq said  the surge needs to go through the beginning of next year for sure   Then  on July 20  General Odierno again admitted that it would be at least November before the military could provide a real assessment of the surge  What the American people deserve is an honest assessment now  They are tired of an Administration that continues to plead for more and more time to pursue its failed course in Iraq  The critical question is not whether violence is up or down on a particular day in a particular area of Baghdad  It is whether the Iraqis will make the political compromises essential to end the violence and the downward spiral of the civil war  Our soldiers are dying every day in Iraq  while the people responsible for making those compromises in Iraq are going on vacation for five weeks  Admiral Mullen  will you assure us that in September you will be honest and candid with Congress and the American people  not seek more time for a failed policy  and reassess our strategy Id appreciate your providing clarification about some of the things you wrote in your questions to the Committee  You said  We must commit to a long term security relationship with Iraq that facilitates political reconciliation  supports development of a stable Iraq  and is directly tied to our enduring long term interests in the region You suggested that we work with the Government of Iraq to achieve a long term security agreement that supports our mutual interests You wrote political and economic progress in Iraq will require patience  persistence and a commitment measured in years not months  Yet  you wrote that you agree with U S  policy not to seek permanent military bases in Iraq Can you clarify what you mean by long term security agreement  What do you mean by a commitment measured in years not months  How many years  How can we have a long term security agreement without permanent bases      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
