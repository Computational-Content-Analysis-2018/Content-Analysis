         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  it is an extraordinary honor to be able to speak for a few minutes about my friend  the Senior Senator from the State of West Virginia  as he makes history yet again There are precious few opportunities in life to recognize greatness in our midst  but today we have that opportunity   We honor our friend not simply because hes become the longest serving Senator in our history  but also because theres no doubt that hes earned his rightful place besides Henry Clay  Daniel Webster  John Calhoun  and other giants in Senate history   Bob Byrds life is a tribute to the power of the American dream  rising from humble beginnings  this son of the Appalachian coal fields reached the pinnacle of power and accomplishment through decades of hard work and unwavering dedication   His life is also a tribute to the power of love and commitment   Bob Byrds commitment and love for the Senate and the country is total and complete  just as they are for the people of West Virginia and his beloved Erma  with whom he shared one of Americas great love stories  Erma and Bob would have celebrated her birthday today  and were saddened that she could not be here to share this extraordinary moment   But we know shes looking down from heaven with a smile for the young boy who once shared his chewing gum with her more than 70 years ago This is a special day for me as well  because its a time to tell my friend how much he means to me  and how much I believe his service means to our nation For longer than Ive been in public life  Ive known Robert C  Byrd   I first came to know him during the famed West Virginia Presidential primary of 1960 Bob was a new Senator and moving up through the ranks as a protg of Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson   My brother and Bob were colleagues in the Senate  but Jack knew it was inevitable that Bob would be looking out for LBJ in the Mountain State  and hoping to deny us the victory we needed  Jack had won the Wisconsin primary  and the stakes were high in West Virginia It was a spirited campaign in which all of us in the Kennedy family got to see the extraordinary qualities of the people of West Virginia  kindness  compassion for their fellow citizens  and perseverance even in the face of enormous obstacles  the qualities that Bob Byrd knew and loved   Jack campaigned extremely well in the state and come to love the people too  and he never forgot the boost they gave him during that hard fought campaign President Kennedy and Robert C  Byrd formed a powerful partnership  and one of Jacks first official acts in office was to authorize the shipment of emergency rations to help the people of Appalachia recover from a disaster They worked together to create the Appalachian Regional Commission  which lifted thousands out of poverty  and eliminated many of the barriers that had isolated the region from the economic mainstream of the nation   They invested in the people  and it worked   President Kennedy and Senator Robert C  Byrd understood that if you give Americans opportunity and hope  there is no limit to what they can accomplish For me personally  its impossible to imagine the Senate without Senator Byrd   He defeated me for Majority Whip in 1971   We both thought we had the votes lined up to win  and it was Bob who taught me how to count votes as he went on to become an outstanding Whip and later an outstanding Majority Leader   My consolation prize was being set free to focus on the legislative issues I care most about  Over the years in the Senate together  weve all come to rely on Senator Byrd as the great defender of this institution and the champion of the Constitution   He doesnt defend the Constitution simply when its in fashion to do so   He doesnt yield when political convenience suggests that the legislative branch should demur for the sake of comity or to accomplish a popular goal    Bob Byrd understands that the founders intended each branch of government to have powers that could place them in conflict  and that the powers Congress cedes to the executive today may have dire consequences for the nation tomorrow In this role  he is the guardian of the Senate and the ideals that Washington  Adams  Jefferson  Madison  and Hamilton fought to enshrine when they created our government I have many warm memories of Bob Byrd as leader  as friend  and as scholar   One that comes to mind now is our barnstorming trip through West Virginia during the 2004 Presidential campaign We traveled by bus around the state from Charleston to Mingo and Logan counties and wherever we stopped  you could feel the love and respect that the people of West Virginia had for Bob Byrd    At one stop  he even jumped up onto the back of a flatbed truck to deliver a stemwinder   I was committed to the campaign as well  but that was a tactic I thought best be left to Bob  In the end we came up short in the West Virginia on election day  but Ill never forget the fun we had those last few weeks of October  and Im eternally grateful to Bob for inviting me   Ill cherish the memory forever Of all the remarkable attributes of Senator Byrd  few have impressed more than his ability to memorize and recite poetry   As a child  this was always one of my greatest challenges at school and Im awed by Bobs extraordinary talent   His mind must hold hundreds of verses that he can recite at a moments notice   One of my favorites describes the responsibilities we have as public servants to address the causes of the problems that confront us  not just the consequences of those problems Its about whether its better to build a fence around the edge of a cliff  or keep an ambulance ready in the valley below I cant recite it from memory like he can  but this is how it goes   It was written by Joseph Malins in 1895  Twas a dangerous cliff  as they freely confessed  Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant But over its terrible edge there had slipped A duke  and full many a peasant The people said something would have to be done But their projects did not at all tally Some said Put a fence round the edge of the cliff Some   An ambulance down in the valley  The lament of the crowd was profound and was loud As their tears overflowed with their pity But the cry for the ambulance carried the dayAs it spread through the neighbouring city A collection was made  to accumulate aid And the dwellers in highway and alleyGave dollars or cents  not to furnish a fence But an ambulance down in the valley  For the cliff is all right if youre careful  they said And if folks ever slip and are dropping It isnt the slipping that hurts them so muchAs the shock down below  when theyre stopping So for years  we have heard    as these mishaps occurred Quick forth would the rescuers sally To pick up the victims who fell from the cliff With the ambulance down in the valley  Said one  to his pleas  Its marvel to meThat youd give so much greater attentionTo repairing results than to curing the cause You had much better aim at prevention For the mischief  of course  should be stopped at its source  Come  neighbours and friends  let us rally It is far better sense to rely on a fenceThan an ambulance down in the valley  He is wrong in his head  the majority said He would end all our earnest endeavour Hes a man who would shirk this responsible work But we will support it forever Arent we picking up all  just as fast as they fall And giving them care liberally A superfluous fence is of no consequence If the ambulance works in the valley  The story looks queer as weve written it here But things oft occur that are stranger More humane  we assert  than to succour the hurtIs the plan of removing the danger The best possible course is to safeguard the sourceBy attending to things rationally Yes  build up the fence and let us dispenseWith the ambulance down in the valley   Thats the principle Bob Byrd has followed throughout his brilliant career in the Senate   Hes a Senator for the ages  and its an extraordinary honor and privilege to know him  to serve with him  and to learn from him     Laura Capps Melissa
