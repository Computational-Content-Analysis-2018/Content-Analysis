         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on General Hayden s nomination to become CIA Director    I voted against General Hayden    I respect General Hayden s lifetime of public service  and his testimony included some encouraging signs that he learned important lessons from the way intelligence was used to defend the Iraq war     However  I cannot support General Hayden s nomination in light of the very serious questions about the scope and legality of the NSA domestic surveillance programs that he helped design  implement  and defend     Until there is a full accounting of the surveillance program  I cannot in good conscience support a promotion for its chief architect     We all want the Administration to have strong leaders and the necessary means to gather the best possible intelligence for our foreign policy and national security  especially the war on terrorism     Those critical goals require a Director of Central Intelligence who will work with Congress    not against us    in our efforts to prevent terrorism and improve our national security laws  We must protect the country while preserving our constitutional freedoms    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
