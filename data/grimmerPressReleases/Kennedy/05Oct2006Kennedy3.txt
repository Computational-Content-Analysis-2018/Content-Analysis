         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement on President Bushs No Child Left Behind remarks    Our nations future depends on many things  but certainly one of the most important aspects of the strength of our democracy is the excellence of our public schools  The No Child Left Behind Act charted a sound course for the future of American education  to improve our schools  to set high standards and focus on student outcomes  and to close the achievement gap so that all students have the benefit of a quality education     But sadly  President Bush has yet to learn his lesson on leaving no child behind  This Administration and the Republican Congress have turned the No Child Left Behind Act into a political slogan rather than the solemn oath it was intended to be to our nations students  parents  and teachers  The President calls for private school vouchers while Americas schools continue to wait for the funding needed to carry out the reforms under the law  Republican budgets have fallen short by over  55 billion since the No Child Left Behind Act was enacted  leaving 3 7 million children behind this year alone     Schools need better solutions to respond to the challenges identified by the No Child Left Behind Act  We need full funding for the Act     Next year  we also need to fine tune the Act to make it more effective in assisting struggling schools  by providing new federal funds for advisors and teacher coaches who are experienced in turning low student achievement around  and by creating new partnerships between high performing and lower performing schools  We can help give the neediest schools greater access to the best teachers by improving training and encouraging teachers to take charge of their own professional growth  establishing new strategies for teachers to advance and become mentor and master teachers  and by rewarding those who do with higher salaries  It also makes sense to offer incentives for schools interested in expanding the school day or year  in order to increase learning time for students     I welcome the opportunity to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act next year  Its time to fulfill the promise under the No Child Left Behind Act and get these essential reforms back on track       Senator Kennedys Proposals for Reauthorizing the No Child Left Behind Act    Supporting High Quality Teaching  Senator Kennedys proposal would identify high performing teachers and provide them career advancement opportunities  additional pay with additional responsibilities  so that our best teachers can earn more money  move ahead  and serve as instructional leaders and mentors to new teachers  It would shift professional development toward a model thats more relevant to teachers needs and helps them take charge of their own growth  Senator Kennedy is interested in exploring ways to expand NCLBs requirements to promote teacher effectiveness  in addition to the subject matter competencies already required under the law   and he strongly supports closing the teacher distribution gap so that all students  regardless of race and income  have access to an excellent teacher     Better Support for Low Performing Schools  Senator Kennedy believes that its important to re affirm that NCLB is not designed as a tool to criticize public schools  but instead to identify challenges and address them  He supports funding to ensure that states have the resources needed to deliver expert technical assistance and help to schools needing improvement or corrective action  Senator Kennedys proposal would help train teachers in low performing schools on how to use data to improve instruction  better align curriculum and instruction to standards  provide educational advisors and coaches with specific expertise in turning around low performing schools  and pair low performing with similar higher performing schools     Improving Student Assessment  Not only is assessment an important tool in teaching and learning  but the accountability decisions under NCLB are only as good as the instruments used to measure student achievement  Senator Kennedy supports enhancing the quality of assessments under the law so that theyre more useful and appropriate for teachers and students  Senator Kennedys proposal would create a new fund for states to develop better assessment and data systems that track the progress and growth of students from year to year  and to review and improve assessments and policies for limited English proficient and special needs children  two populations for which NCLBs current assessments are less than adequate      Improving State Standards  As todays economy re defines the knowledge and skills needed to compete in the global marketplace  its crucial now more than ever for our schools to challenge all students to learn to high standards  Senator Kennedys proposal would modernize public education by disseminating national benchmarks and providing assistance to states to upgrade and improve academic standards and curriculum  to better match what students need to know and be able to do as they enter college or the workforce  He would also establish State Councils  comprised of the education community  business  and other state and local stakeholders  to facilitate this process     Strengthening Parent Community Involvement  Active parent and community involvement is critical to the academic success of students  Senator Kennedys proposal would encourage parent  family  and community involvement in schools  by providing parent family outreach coordinators for schools  Under this plan  a school based coordinator would serve as a liaison with the community  to oversee parent engagement and activities and help access outside services and supports for children      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
