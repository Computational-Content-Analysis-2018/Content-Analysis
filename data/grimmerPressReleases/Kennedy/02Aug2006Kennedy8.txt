         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                It is important to make sure that the Justice Department has all of the options it needs to hold terrorists accountable in our criminal justice system   I welcome this hearing and I hope that we will proceed with deliberation and care in making any changes in the War Crimes Act of 1996   That Act was originally introduced by conservative members of the House of Representatives and passed by a Republican Congress  It is not a complex law   In less than three hundred words  it makes it illegal for a member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a national of the United States to commit a war crime  and criminalizes war crimes against Americans  This brief law speaks volumes about the rule of law and what America stands for    Basic American ideals did not change after 9 11  or become less relevant   America did not resolve to set aside the Constitution or the rule of law after those vicious attacks  We did not decide as a nation to stoop to the level of terrorists    In fact  we have been united in our belief that an essential part of winning the war on terrorism and protecting the nation for the future is safeguarding the ideals and values that America stands for here at home and around the world    That is why  time after time  government lawyers  military officials  and the American people have been shocked by the Administrations eagerness to abandon Americas basic values  in the misguided belief that the end justifies the means   The result has been disastrous    The Administration brazenly claimed that detainees in the Afghanistan War were not subject to the basic human rights protections of the Geneva Conventions  Despite strenuous objections from Secretary of State Colin Powell  the Administration arrogantly refused to follow the law in this area  and our actions have wreaked havoc with our moral standing in the world and made the war on terrorism harder to win   Its lawless policies backfired again when the Administration claimed the inherent power to try detainees in military commissions outside of established legal structures  Instead of cooperating with Congress and attempting to operate within the rule of law  the Administration pressed ahead with its irresponsible unilateral approach     Not a single conviction was obtained under the military commissions  and the Supreme Court has now unequivocally declared that the commissions were not authorized by Congress and do not satisfy Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions    The Administration even attempted to narrow the definition of torture  The Bybee Torture Memorandum  issued in August 2002  took the outrageous position that torture was limited to conduct that caused pain equivalent to death or organ failure  That indefensible position was adopted as official executive policy over the strong and virtually unanimous objections of career military lawyers  who believed it was illegal and unnecessary  and would be harmful to our own troops   When this secret memo finally  came to light  public outcry forced the Administration to repudiate it   Yet when Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act prohibiting cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees  the President signed the Act but issued a signing statement indicating he would ignore the law whenever he felt like it   In the Hamdan case  the Supreme Court clearly reaffirmed the applicability of the Geneva Conventions to the detainees  It rejected the Presidents unilateral military commissions  and emphasized Congresss important role in maintaining the rule of law    An essential part of winning the war on terrorism and safeguarding the country for the future is to protect the ideals that America stands for here at home and around the world  It has taken several years  and in some instances Supreme Court action  to force the President to comply with the rule of law and to respect those ideals     We must make sure that the War Crimes Act remains intact  as a bulwark against future abuses and as a signal to the world that we intend to reclaim our long standing role as leaders in promoting human rights protections here and around the world      Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
