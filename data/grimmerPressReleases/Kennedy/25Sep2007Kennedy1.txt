         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        WASHINGTON  DC Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to the report released today by the National Assessment of Educational Progress       These national test scores show that the hard work of teachers  parents and students in Massachusetts is paying off   Once again  Massachusetts leads the nation in reading and math      These scores are reason to celebrate  but theyre also cause for resolve in finishing the job   Theres more to do in our schools to close the troubling gaps in achievement and opportunity in too many of our schools  especially with minority students      The people of Massachusetts understand that education is the key to our competitiveness in the global economy and opens doors of opportunity for our children   I applaud Governor Patrick for his efforts to strengthen education  sustain these gains  and address the challenges that lie ahead      Well do all we can at the national level to improve the No Child Left Behind law so that it works better for our teachers  school children and schools   And well fight for resources to get the job done      Just imagine how much more progress we would see today if President Bush had invested in school reform instead of investing in a failed war in Iraq        We could have solved the teacher shortage crisis  and hired almost two million new teachers needed for the next decade for the cost of just over six months in Iraq        For the cost of only 49 days in Iraq  we could fully fund our commitment to leave no child behind this next school year  rather than short changing this important program as the Administration has done year after year to the tune of 56 billion dollars since its enactment        Nearly 15 years ago  the Commonwealth made a genuine commitment to raise standards  measure progress  evaluate schools  and put good teachers in every classroom   While other states have struggled to implement a quality accountability system  the consistency between the recent performance on the MCAS and students achievement on the NAEP shows that Massachusetts standards and assessments are among the best in the nation   Its clear that these essential reforms  and those who have worked so hard to implement them  will pay dividends for our students for years to come        And now today our students in Massachusetts show some of the strongest performance in math on the NAEP  where fourth graders scored 252 on the assessment  13 points higher than the nation  and an improvement of 5 points since 2005   In eighth grade  Massachusetts students scored 298  18 higher than the nation  and an improvement of 6 points since 2005        More students in Massachusetts excelled in math on the NAEP than anywhere else in the nation  eleven percent of fourth graders and fifteen percent of eighth graders reached advanced levels on the assessment  compared with five percent of fourth graders and seven percent of eighth graders in other states   And our students continue to achieve at high levels on the NAEP assessment in reading        This progress is hopeful  but its clear that our work is far from over   Todays results reveal  as the MCAS results also do  that closing the persistent gaps in achievement and opportunity remain our greatest challenge   All students  and especially minority students  have steadily improved on the NAEP since the early 1990s  Yet more remains to be done   In reading  77 percent of white fourth graders in Massachusetts reached basic levels on the NAEP  compared to just 46 percent of African American and 49 percent of Latino students      To view the full report  please click here  http   nces ed gov nationsreportcard      To view the live webcast announcement of the results  please click here  http   www visualwebcaster com NAEP 42336 reg html          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
