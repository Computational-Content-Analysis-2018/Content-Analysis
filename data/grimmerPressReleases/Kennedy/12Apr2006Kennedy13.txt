         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  DC  Today Senators Edward M  Kennedy  Joseph Lieberman  and other Senate colleagues detailed how the Judiciary immigration bill  based on the McCain Kennedy plan  will strengthen national security and protect our borders  The Committee bill will double the border patrol  create a  virtual fence  and crack down harder on smugglers and employers who break the law     Our immigration system is badly broken and this week we have a historic opportunity to fix it once and for all  Senator Kennedy said  We know that an effective immigration strategy must have three parts  Enhanced enforcement  earned legalization for those who are here  and a realistic guest worker program for the future  Our bill will strengthen our national security  protect

DELIVERY    Some people have tried to frame the debate between the Judiciary Committee bill and Senator Frist s bill as a debate between those who would be tough on enforcement and those who would not    We all recognize that our current immigration enforcement system is brokenenforcement provisions are an area where a good deal of consensus has already emerged in this chamber      Both bills under consideration would enhance our capacity to monitor immigration flows and stop illegal entry  They would double the number of Border Patrol agents over the next five years  add significant new technology at the border to create a robust virtual fence  develop new land and water surveillance plans  authorize new highway checkpoints near the border  and expand the exit entry security system to all land borders and airports     Both bills would increase our capacity to crack down on criminal syndicates that smuggle immigrants into the country and place them at great risk  They would create new criminal penalties for evading or refusing to obey commands of immigration officers  and new criminal penalties for financial transactions related to money laundering or smuggling  They would also create new fraud proof biometric immigration documents  increase access to anti fraud detection resources  and improve coordination among federal  state  local  and tribal efforts to combat alien smuggling     Both bills would increase cooperation with Mexico to strengthen that country s southern border and to deter illegal migration from Central America through Mexico into the United States  And they would require cooperation with other governments in the region to deter international gang activity      And both bills would reduce the job magnet in America by creating a universal electronic eligibility verification system which will allow employers to tell which individuals are authorized to work in the United States  They will substantially increase penalties against employers who fail to comply with eligibility verification rules and add 5 000 new enforcement agents to back up these provisions     The Frist bill places greater emphasis on border fencing  a method of immigration control which we believe has proven ineffective over the last ten years  The Judiciary Committee bill imposes new penalties on individuals who construct  finance  or use unlawful tunnels under the border  We believe this is an important new tool for enforcement  As Senator Feinstein has argued  these tunnels are one of the many methods immigrants now use to circumvent border fencing    The differences between these two bills  and the issues at stake in amendments being considered  concern what we do in addition to these tough new enforcement provisions  Over the last week we have heard two very different answers to this question  reflecting fundamentally different views of immigrants and the steps we should take to repair our broken immigration system    The Frist bill follows the lead of the House of Representatives  It treats immigrants as criminals  In fact  the Frist bill declares that all undocumented immigrants are criminals  And it goes farther than that  actually making it a felony to provide undocumented immigrants with non emergency humanitarian assistance  In bipartisan votes  two thirds of the members of the Judiciary Committee rejected these measures because they conflict with our basic values  and they would do nothing to actually reduce the number of undocumented immigrants in this country  This is one reason why at least 184 different religious groups support comprehensive reform with a path to permanent status instead    Our bill is not only tough on immigration enforcement  it also takes necessary steps to repair the broken immigration system so that enforcement can be effective  We ve tried enforcement only approaches for the last ten years  and they have failed  A majority of Americans support a three pronged comprehensive reform effort           First  we much strengthen enforcement at the border and within the United States   We all agree on this point      Second  we must provide a path to legal status which will bring the 11 million or so undocumented immigrants already within the United States out of the shadows  and disrupt the culture of illegality which now corrodes our system     Third  we must provide legal channels for future immigration flows so that US employers who are unable to attract native workers are not tempted to hire illegal immigrants in the future     The Frist bill is tough on enforcement  Our bill is tough and smart  The Frist bill does not create the conditions for immigration reform to succeed  and it conflicts with our heritage as a nation of immigrants  Our bill addresses the fundamental flaws in our immigration system  and does so in a way which enhances our security  advances our prosperity  and is consistent with our values     I ve talked a lot in the last few days about our history as a nation of immigrants  Let me briefly say something about our future  The Judiciary Committee bill would take the long overdue step of making the DREAM Act into law  Under the DREAM Act  undocumented Immigrant children would be given an opportunity to become legal  full fledged American citizens if they can prove good moral character  if they have graduated from high school  and if they then go on to college  or join the military     Many of my constituents from Massachusetts are undocumented kids who would benefit from this Act  and I d like to share three of their stories     Mario has lived in Chelsea  Massachusetts for the past seven years  He is a stellar student  patient caretaker for his four year old brother  and a leader in the community  Mario is currently facing deportation  In Mario s own words  I did not make the choice to come to this country  however  over time this country has become my home  My time in the U S  has consisted of nothing but hard work and positive service to the community and all I want is for that to continue  I see this country as my home  and I have always striven to do the right thing  I know that I have a lot to offer this country if I am only given the chance to do so     Jessica was brought to this country when she was 3 years old  originally from the Dominican Republic  She graduated last year with honors from Madison Park High School in Boston  but was unable to pursue her dream of studying psychology because of her status  Jessica was a member of the National Honor Society and an officer in Marine JROTC  Jessica says that going to college is the only way for her to secure a better future for herself and her family  The United States is the only country she has ever known      Flavio graduated last year from the Burke High School in Dorchester  He made a complete turn around from 9th grade to his sophomore yearhe turned Ds and Fs into all As and Bs  When asked about his amazing turnaround he responds that his mother sent him to this country to do something with his life and that s what he decided to do  He is a member of the National Honor Society  Honor Roll  Captain of Track and Soccer teams  He was accepted at Roxbury Community College but was not able to attend for lack of access to financial aid or scholarships  Flavio s parents sent him to the US at the young age of 11  hoping he would have a better life here than in Cape Verde     These kids aspire to US citizenship  and America benefits when they have a chance to earn it    The Judiciary Committee bill includes enhanced enforcement  earned legalization for those who are here  and a realistic guestworker program for the future  This a real comprehensive plan for repairing our broken immigration system  not a campaign slogan    Many of those who oppose real comprehensive reform have mischaracterized our arguments in recent days  and they have introduced a number of amendments which would undermine our reform efforts  So let me set the record straight    First  let me set the record straight on amnesty  Our bill does not provide undocumented immigrants with amnesty  Amnesty  by definition  is an automatic pardon  or free pass  granted to a group of individuals without requiring any actions in return  President Reagan s 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act included an amnesty provision  immigrants only had to prove their previous presence and previous work history in the United States to qualify  They had to pay a processing fee  but not a fine  and they were not required to meet additional requirements after 1986    Our bill also requires immigrants to prove their previous presence and work history  and then it requires them to take significant additional steps  Under our bill  undocumented immigrants would have to do all of the following to earn legal status     1   Must have entered and continuously resided in the US before January 2004     2      Must remain continuously employed     3      Must pay  2 000 in penalties     4      Must pass security background checks     5      Must pass a medical exam     6      Must learn English    7      Must learn U S  history and government     8      Must pay all back taxes     9      Must get to the back of line behind all applicants waiting for green cards  and wait at least 6 years     10    After obtaining green card  must wait another 5 years before becoming eligible to apply for naturalization    None of these requirements existed in 1986  and each of them distinguishes this program from an amnesty    Here s another reason our bill would not provide immigrants with amnesty  Under our bill  unlike in 1986  undocumented immigrants would all have to get at the back of the line prior to earning green cards  There seems to be some confusion and misinformation about this pointSenator Frist told a national TV audience over the weekend that we were putting immigrants at the front of the lineso I have brought in the text and people here can read it for themselves     Under section 605 of our bill  and I quote  The Secretary may not adjust the status of an alien     until     the priority dates have become current for the class of aliens whose family based or employment  for based petitions for permanent residence were pending on the date of enactment of this Act  Here it is in black and white  it couldn t be more clear  undocumented immigrants must go to the back of the line    Let me clear up a third point which has been misrepresented here in recent days  our earned legalization program would not permit felons or other immigrants who have committed serious crimes or who represent security threats to earn legal status  All immigrants will be subjected to rigorous background checks  All of the existing grounds for inadmissibility related to criminal and security issues would apply and would prevent immigrants from participating if they have violated these provisions in the past    Let me read just a partial list of immigrants NOT eligible for earned legalization under the Judiciary Committee bill     Immigrants convicted of crimes of moral turpitude  including aggravated assault  assault with a deadly weapon  aggravated DWI  fraud  larceny  and forgery     Immigrants convicted of controlled substance offenses  including the sale  possession or distribution of drugs and drug trafficking           Immigrants convicted of theft offenses  including shoplifting           Immigrants convicted of public nuisance offenses           Immigrants with multiple criminal convictions           Immigrants convicted of crimes of violence           Immigrants convicted of counterfeiting  bribery  or perjury           Immigrants convicted of murder  rape  or sexual abuse of a minor    The complete list goes on for a full page    Our bill also denies earned legalization to additional classes of immigrants on security related grounds           Immigrants would not be eligible to participate if they have been  convicted of espionage or sabotage     They would not be able to participate if they have engaged in any kind of terrorist activity or if the Attorney general believes it is likely they have done so     They would not be able to participate if they have any association with terrorist activity or if they are representatives of a terrorist organization     Spouses and children of individuals who are inadmissible as a terrorist are also ineligible for earned legalization under the Judiciary Committee bill           Immigrants known to have acted in ways that are deemed to have adverse foreign policy consequences are ineligible           And immigrants who are members of a Totalitarian Party are ineligible    If all of these individuals are already denied legalization under the Committee Bill  who is excluded by the Kyl Cornyn amendment    The answer is that their amendment would target the working men and women who are not criminals  It would target the mothers  fathers  coworkers  and families of the people in our communities  This amendment lumps together people who have committed actual crimes with millions of Mexicans  Central Americans  Irish  and nationals of many other countries whose have status violations but should be able to apply for legal status for the good of this country  According to our analysis  95  of immigrants potentially affected by the Kyl Cornyn amendment would not be criminal aliens  but rather exactly the hard working immigrants and families this program is designed to bring out of the shadows    It is patently false to say that criminals can legalize under the Committee bill  Criminal aliens and terrorists are already excluded from the bill s legalization and temporary worker programs  so I urge my colleagues to reject the Kyl Cornyn amendment in order to preserve comprehensive immigration reform    A fourth point I want to address is the argument we have heard here that it is important to secure the border prior to enacting comprehensive immigration reform  Senator Isakson has introduced an amendment which would delay needed steps to repair our broken immigration system until after the border is sealed     This is a wrongheaded approach  and it reflects confusion about these issues on a very basic level     One of the primary reasons we must enact comprehensive immigration reform is precisely because doing so will allow us to secure the border  Indeed  most experts who have studied these issues will tell you unambiguously that the border cannot be secured unless we fix our broken immigration system  These changes are not sequential  they are two sides of the same coin  I believe Senator Kyl has made this point himself on a number of occasions in the past    We need more border security  and this bill provides it  but we cannot protect US security and control undocumented immigration without addressing the real roots of the problem  not enough visas are available to match willing workers with willing employers  not enough visas are available to permit families to be together  and too many undocumented immigrants already reside within the United States  These are the root causes of undocumented immigration  and any steps which delay our sensible efforts to address these problems directly threaten US national security     As President Bush has emphasized  allowing workers and families to come legally will free up enforcement resources to focus on real security threats  smugglers  criminals  and potential terrorists  And by placing current undocumented on a path to legal status we bring them out of the shadows and break the cycle of illegality which now sustains undocumented immigration    Enforcement first may be an attractive campaign slogan or a smart way to put some Senators on the spot  but we know that effective enforcement to ensure our security requires comprehensive reform  I urge my colleagues to reject Senator Isakson s amendment  which would undermine comprehensive reform    Finally  let me briefly respond to several points Senator Kyl made in his floor comments yesterday afternoon    One point I want to respond to is an issue which also came up several times during the Judiciary Committee hearings  that many workers submit social security numbers which are all zeroes  There s a misconception about this issue  Senator Kyl believes this is evidence of identity fraud  but I want to direct his attention to the Employer s Tax Guide  published by the IRS  On page 8 of this document  employer are instructed to enter 000 00 0000 on their electronic W 2 forms for any worker who has applied for a social security number but not received one yet  It can take weeks to receive a Social Security number  so it s really not surprising that we see a lot of these all zero entries on W 2 forms     I m sure that s an honest mistake  but I also want to respond to a more substantive issue Senator Kyl raised  his comparison of the different guest worker provisions under consideration  Senator Kyl told us yesterday that his guest worker program is similar to the H 1B program  and I found that to be an incredible comparison for two important reasons      First  the H 1B program is subject to numerical limits  just like the temporary worker program in the Judiciary Committee bill  The guest worker program in the Cornyn Kyl bill is uncapped and I would not support it      Second  the H 1B program allows temporary workers to adjust to legal permanent status if their circumstances change and they choose to remain in the United States  The Cornyn Kyl bill accepts that high skilled workers should have the ability to adjust to LPR status  but would not extend this benefit to low skilled guest workersI m not sure why he subjects these two groups to different standards  I believe workers should have the right to adjust to LPR status if their employers want to keep them on a permanent basis or if their personal circumstances change  and that is how the guest worker program in the McCain Kennedy bill and the Judiciary Committee bill is structured     A third point of contrast Senator Kyl made yesterday was that the McCain Kennedy guest worker program does not require employers to recruit US workers prior to hiring guest workers  This allegation is simply false  Under our billjust like under the Cornyn Kyl billemployers are required to recruit US workers prior to hiring a guest worker  and they must list job openings in an electronic job registry  Temporary workers can only be hired when US workers are unavailable to fill the positions     Our temporary worker program also includes numerous provisions which are not found in the Cornyn Kyl bill which will ensure that temporary workers do not depress US wages  I discussed these yesterday  So I don t know if the senator is intentionally misrepresenting the contents of our bill  or if he is confused  but I want to set the record straight     So let s have an honest debate  do we want comprehensive reform which combines tough enforcement  earned legalization  and a sensible temporary worker program  Or do we want enforcement only  This is the real question a stake  and we should not try to hide behind disingenuous amendments and statements which misrepresent our positions and confuse the issues
