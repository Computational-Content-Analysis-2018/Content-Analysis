         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  I welcome today s launch of the Commission on No Child Left Behind  and I commend the Aspen Institute for its focus on this important issue  When the Act became law at the beginning of 2002  it symbolized a strong new national commitment to improving public education and to giving all students what they need to succeed in school  Congress must reauthorize the law next year  and it will clearly benefit from the Commission s careful examination of the implementation and its suggestions for improvement  I look forward to the Commission s proposals and to working closely with students  teachers  parents  and educational leaders to see that Congress and the Administration live up to the promise of the Act   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
