         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  United States attorneys have an indispensable role in the enforcement of federal law  They protect us from violent crime  terrorism  organized crime  public corruption  and violations of basic civil rights  Traditionally  they have practiced law in the district in which they serve  Most often  they are leading members of the local bar who have distinguished themselves in public service or private practice  They bring to their positions an understanding of their local legal system that is indispensable to their effectiveness United States Attorneys must be above partisan or ethical reproach  Many bring to the office some background in political activity  but it is essential for the public to have full confidence in their experience in the law and their ability and commitment to enforce the law effectively  Above all  its the responsibility of a United States Attorney to see that justice is done and to preserve the confidence of the American people in our system of justice  Recently  however  the Bush Administration has fired a number of U S  Attorneys and replaced them with interim U S  Attorneys appointed by the Attorney General with no Senate confirmation  The Deputy Attorney General has admitted that in at least one case the removal had nothing to do with performance  but it appears to have been based on a desire to give a young political operative a credential  Many of the other interim appointees have close political ties to the Administration We know that partisan and ideological hiring has been the hallmark of the Department of Justice in this Administration  Attorney General Ashcroft abolished the honors hiring procedure instituted by the Eisenhower Administration to guarantee merit hiring and prevent partisanship or cronyism  An unusually alarming pattern of partisan and ideological hiring in the Civil Rights Division has allowed partisanship to influence enforcement of the Voting Rights Act  We cant afford to let the same corrupt practices undermine confidence in the fair enforcement of the federal criminal and civil laws by our U S  Attorneys The recent firings were made possible by a little noticed change in the law that was added quietly to the reauthorization of the Patriot Act last March  Before the change  a U S  Attorney vacancy could be filled by an interim appointment by the Attorney General for only 120 days  after which the local district court could appoint the U S  Attorney  who would serve pending confirmation by the Senate of the Presidents nominee  The Patriot Act eliminated the 120 day limitation on service by Attorney General appointees  As a result  vacancies can now be filled by the Attorney General without limitation on the length of service by the appointee  In fact  it is now possible for appointees to serve indefinitely  and never face Senate confirmation Multiple examples exist of interim appointees serving for extended periods without confirmation  The interim U S  Attorney for the Western District of Missouri  a young political appointee from the Department of Justice in Washington  D C  who lacked prosecution experience    was given an interim appointment on March 23  2006 and continues to serve today  nearly a year later  That kind of extended appointment is unacceptable  We must restore the incentive for the Administration to consult with the Senate and submit qualified nominees promptly for confirmation The law should be amended to ensure that the Senate can continue to perform its role of advice and consent  U S  Attorney nominees should be selected by the President in consultation with the Senate and submitted promptly to the Senate for its consent  The Administration must be held accountable for its choices  The legislation before us today would restore those incentives and help to re establish our sound government of checks and balances  S 214 will do this and I urge my colleagues to support it    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
