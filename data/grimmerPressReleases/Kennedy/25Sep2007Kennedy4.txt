         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON  DC Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  released the following statement in response to the report released today by the National Assessment of Educational Progress       Todays good results show theres a rising tide in Americas schools  but it has yet to lift all boats      These welcome signs of progress are a tribute to the hard work of teachers  parents and students across the country   But they also remind us that we still have a long way to go before we can say in America that no child is left behind      Todays encouraging report should prod us to do even better  to strengthen those aspects of the No Child Left Behind law that are working  to reform those that are not  and to invest adequate resources in the future of our schools        These results are not just an assessment of our nations classrooms  but are a measure of our competitiveness in the global economy and our commitment to the hopes and dreams of the next generation   Just imagine how much more progress we would see today if President Bush had invested in school reform instead of investing in a failed war in Iraq        We could have solved the teacher shortage crisis  and hired almost two million new teachers needed for the next decade for the cost of just over six months in Iraq        For the cost of only 49 days in Iraq  we could fully fund our commitment to leave no child behind this next school year  rather than short changing this important program as the Administration has done year after year to the tune of 56 billion dollars since its enactment        These test results show that more students are mastering basic standards in reading and math than ever before  and many more are going far beyond to reach their full potential          In math  fourth grade students scored 27 points higher than in 1990  and the number of students proficient in that subject tripled over that time   Progress is also encouraging among eighth graders  who scored 18 points higher than in 1990   All states that participated in the NAEP in 1990 and 1992 showed progress in math           While not as quickly as in math  Americas students are still moving in the right direction in reading   Fourth graders posted their highest scores ever on this years assessment  and more eighth graders reached basic standards in reading than ever before        As we work to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind law this year  well renew our national commitment to confronting and closing the disparities in opportunity and achievement in our schools   Well make the necessary changes to ensure that the law works well for every student  And well explore new ideas and better solutions to strengthen teaching and learning in our classrooms        Most importantly  well fight to provide the funding so often denied to our schools by the Bush Administration   Every child deserves their fair shot at the American dream and a full chance to learn in a great public school      To view the full report  please click here  http   nces ed gov nationsreportcard      To view the live webcast announcement of the results  please click here  http   www visualwebcaster com NAEP 42336 reg html          Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
