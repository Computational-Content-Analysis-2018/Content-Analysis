         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      As Prepared for Delivery   The Department of Justice is in dire need of new leadership to guide our nation back to its constitutional moorings   Under Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  the Department lost its way as a genuine force for justice   It too often served as a rubber stamp for the White House and as a facilitator and enforcer of political objectives rather than the rule of law   After a period of such tarnished leadership in the Department  we need a clear  decisive and straightforward Attorney General who is not afraid to stand up for the constitution and the rule of law  even if it means disagreeing with the President of the United   States        I had hoped that Judge Mukasey could be that person   He is certainly intelligent and has demonstrated admirable dedication to public service    As a federal judge for almost 19 years  he was by all accounts fair and conscientious in the courtroom and even showed admirable independence at times    But  after reviewing and re reviewing Judge Mukaseys answers to questions from members of this Committee  I have concluded that he is not the right person to lead the Justice Department at this crucial time in our history        We need a leader who will inspire confidence in the rule of law   We need a leader who is unafraid to speak truth to power   We need a leader who is worthy of the trust we place in our Attorney General to support and defend the Constitution of the United States   Michael Mukasey regrettably is not that leader      Like many of my colleagues and many American citizens  I am deeply troubled by Judge Mukaseys evasive answers about the legality of certain techniques of torture   While the nominee acknowledges that torture is unconstitutional  he has repeatedly refused to acknowledge that the controlled drowning of a prisoner  waterboarding    rises to the level of torture    What is the big mystery here   Over and over again  civilian and military tribunals have found waterboarding to be an unacceptable act of torture        Malcolm Nance  a former Master Instructor and Chief of Training at the US Navy Survival  Evasion  Resistance and Escape School  says that  as part of SEAL training  he personally led  witnessed and supervised training to resist waterboarding for hundreds of people   He describes the procedure this way      Waterboarding is a controlled drowning      It does not simulate drowning  as the lungs are actually filling with water  There is no way to simulate that  The victim is drowning         Waterboarding is slow motion suffocation with enough time to contemplate the inevitability of black out and expiration  usually the person goes into hysterics on the board  For the uninitiated  it is horrifying to watch and if it goes wrong  it can lead straight to terminal hypoxia  When done right it is controlled death       According to ABC News  former intelligence officers and supervisors admitted in 2005 that the CIA used waterboarding  in fact the Vice President confirmed its use  and the intelligence officers and supervisors described waterboarding this way         The prisoner is bound to an inclined board  feet raised and head slightly below the feet  Cellophane is wrapped over the prisoner s face and water is poured over him  Unavoidably  the gag reflex kicks in and a terrifying fear of drowning leads to almost instant pleas to bring the treatment to a halt        But Judge Mukasey cannot say to this Committee that waterboarding is torture    He calls it repugnant  and indeed it is   But he refuses to condemn it as unlawful    And then  in perhaps the most stunning and hollow promise reportedly made by a nominee for Attorney General in my 45 years in the Senate  we are told that Judge Mukasey agreed to enforce a ban against waterboarding if Congress specifically passes one   We are supposed to find comfort in the representations by a nominee to be the highest law enforcement officer in the country that he will in fact enforce the laws that we pass in the future   Can our standards really have sunk so low   Enforcing the law is the job of the Attorney General   Its a prerequisite  not a virtue that enhances a nominees qualifications        Make no mistake about it   Waterboarding is already illegal under United States law   It is illegal under the Geneva Conventions  which prohibit outrages upon personal dignity  including cruel  humiliating  and degrading treatment   It is illegal under the Torture Act  which prohibits acts specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering   It is illegal under the Detainee Treatment act  which prohibits cruel  inhuman  or degrading treatment   And it violates the Constitution        The nations top military lawyers and legal experts across the political spectrum have condemned waterboarding as torture   After World War II  the United States even prosecuted Japanese officers for engaging in waterboarding   What more does this nominee need to enforce existing laws      It is the job of the Attorney General to enforce our Constitution and laws   The Attorney General must have the legal and moral judgment to know when an activity rises to the level of a violation of our Constitution  treaties or statutes   But this nominee wants to outsource his job to Congress    That passing of the buck is completely unacceptable by a nominee who wants to be the highest justice official in our great country   This nominee has failed to demonstrate that he will be the clear  decisive and straightforward leader that the Department of Justice so desperately needs        For all these reasons  I oppose this nomination    After six long years of reckless disregard for the rule of law by this Administration  we cannot afford to take our chances on the judgment of an Attorney General who either does not know torture when he sees it  or is willing to look the other way to suit the President              Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
