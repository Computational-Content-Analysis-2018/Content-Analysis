         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  KENNEDY  Mr  President  this afternoon at 4 30  the Senate will be casting    members of this body will be casting an extremely important vote  the implications of which are going to be felt not only in these next several months but for a great number of years  not only for this generation but for the next generation and the following generation  It s the nomination for the Supreme Court of the United States and whether we re going to move ahead and have a final vote on this tomorrow  I believe  Mr  President  as I ve said earlier  there is nothing that s more important than the vote we cast on the Supreme Court  except sending young Americans to war    sending young Americans to war  The implications of this vote are far reaching  As one that has followed the courts of this country as they moved us to a fairer and a more just nation over the period of the past  this nomination  to me  has enormous consequences and enormous importance KENNEDY     As I mentioned  I doubt if we ll cast another vote  unless it ll be for a Supreme Court nominee any time in the near future  I remember the beginning of the great march toward progress that this nation made with the Fifth Circuit in the 1950s  the great heroes Judge Wisdom  Judge Tuttle  Judge Johnson  many others that really awakened this nation to its greatness in terms of having America be America  by knocking down walls of discrimination and prejudice     Our founding fathers failed on that  as we know  They wrote  effectively  slavery into the Constitution  We fought a Civil War that didn t resolve it  didn t solve it  Though we had  obviously    with President Lincoln  other extraordinary leaders  we began to move this process forward where we were going to knock down the walls of discrimination  It was really as a result of the extraordinary leadership  I think  of Dr  King  his allies  associates in the late 1950s that America began to think about what this country was all about  recognizing the stains of discrimination  And then we had a real beginning of movement and knocking down the walls of discrimination in the Public Accommodation Act of 1964  the Voting Rights Act of  65  the Civil Rights Act of  67  housing in  68  Title IX in 1973  In 1965  we knocked down walls of discrimination in our immigration laws  the national origin quota system  The Asian Pacific triangle that discriminated against Asians  national origin quota discriminated against groups of countries KENNEDY  We made enormous progress  not that laws themselves are going to solve these issues or problems  We had laws that were passed  with support of Democrat and Republican alike  during this period of time  And we became a fairer and a more just nation  Still  very important areas that we have to move toward to complete that march  The stains of discrimination are still out there  not nearly as obvious as they were in the earlier part of the last century  but they re still out there  They re very evident  And I think all of us at one time or another still see them     It s not limited  obviously  to a region of the country  It exists in my part of the nation as well  The real challenge and question and test is are we moving forward to knocking down those walls of discrimination  That s always been a pretty basic test for me in terms of reaching a judgment and decision on the Supreme Court  I can remember the case of Lane v  Tennessee that was decided not long ago  It involved a woman in a wheelchair  a single mom  two children  trained as a court reporter  The state was Tennessee  About 60 percent of all the courtrooms in Tennessee  for some reason  are on the second floor  And the question was whether the Americans with Disabilities act    and I welcomed the opportunity to work closely with my colleague from Iowa  Senator Harkin  on that program  Again  we had  by the time we came to the floor  bipartisan support for that legislation  President Bush One indicated it was the piece of legislation he was proudest of  It wasn t always easy in terms of dealing with the disabled  I can remember when we had 4 million children that were kept in closets in this nation rather than being able to go to school  We had bipartisanship in the IDEA  the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  We made enormous progress during this period KENNEDY  Now  we had  a few years ago  the Lane v  Tennessee  the question whether this single mom    whether that courthouse was going to make reasonable accommodation to let that single mom  who was trained as a court reporter  to avoid being carried up the flight of stairs  avoid being carried into the ladies  room  avoid other humiliating circumstances because of her disability    was the courthouse going to have to make those reasonable accommodations  Four justices on the Supreme Court said no    No  no  we don t have to make accommodations    but five said yes  Sandra Day O Connor said yes on that  and they made those accommodations  That mother was able to gain entrance into that courthouse  has had a successful career  appeared before our committee with tears on her eyes about the importance of a single vote    a single vote in the Supreme Court of the United States  If that had gone 5 4 the other way  all 50 states would have had to have passed disability rights acts    not Americans with Disabilities  Massachusetts disabilities  Connecticut disabilities  Rhode Island disabilities    but we had Americans with Disabilities  Forty two million of our fellow citizens with physical and mental disabilities are a part of the American family today  Just like we ve knocked down the walls of discrimination on race  religion  ethnicity  we have knocked down the walls on gender  on disability  And we ve made some progress  as well  in terms of those gay and lesbian issues  as well  So we ve made this march toward progress  Mr  President  and the question is whether we are going to have a judge that believes in that march of progress or whether we re going to have someone that is going to be a roadblock in that march toward progress  And I reserve my    I have expressed my opposition to Judge Alito  Mr  President  because I think is he the wrong judge at the wrong time in the wrong court KENNEDY  I do not believe he is going to be part of the whole movement of the continued march toward progress in this country  And it s at a very  very delicate balance  We have seen  at other times in American history  where executives led the way in making this a fairer country  We have seen where Congress has led the way  being a fairer country  Certainly we saw that with executive power  certainly in terms of the adoption of Medicare programs  Medicaid  We had presidential leadership for a while in the early  60s and then  finally  we passed those  And as a result  we are fairer  Ask our elderly people  if we didn t have the Medicare  didn t have the Social Security programs  where we would be as a country and as a nation  So that is the issue  Does this nominee    and I accepted the challenge of Judge Alito that said  Well  let s read my cases    read my cases     And I m reminded of the fact that  to really understand the nominee  one has to read the dissenting cases  Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Robert Bork agreed 91 percent of the time  Isn t that extraordinary  Two individuals of dramatically different judicial philosophies agreed 91 percent of the time     Where you found their differences were in the dissents  And that is where I looked with regard to this nominee  And that is why I came to the conclusion that this nominee was not going to be friendly to the average worker  friendly on women s rights  friendly on the issues of race  friendly on the issues of the environment  and would no doubt be willing to accede to a more expansive executive power for the executive office  But  Mr  President  I remember the time when the president announced Judge Alito  I happened to be    it was in the early morning  I happened to be up in Massachusetts  We knew that was announcement was going to be there     And I didn t know  really  Judge Alito KENNEDY  But certainly the representations were that there s a wide open kind of net that has been spread out across the country to try and find the very best    the very best    in our nation that was going to be able to be a part    be a nominee  We have seen  Mr  President  where we have had Republicans    I voted for seven Republican nominees for the Supreme Court  We have had a great many of those nominees who were virtually unanimous in this body  Democrats and Republicans voting together for nominees  And that is what I think all of us were hoping for  We had seen sort of the fiasco that had taken place with Harriet Miers  We saw groups in this country that were prepared to exercise a veto  We saw groups in the nation that were prepared to exercise a litmus test  Groups in the nation said  Absolutely no  We re not going to have Harriet Miers  We re not going to have Harriet Miers  These are the same groups that indicated for so long that nominees are entitled to a vote up and down  we ought to be able to look at nominees  judicial philosophy and all the rest  Boy  all of those issues went right out the window    right out the window    when Harriet Miers was nominated  And the reason was because Harriet Miers didn t pass a litmus test  Now we have the appointment of Judge Alito  And before the announcement was really ended  we see this extraordinary wave of favorability that has come over in terms of support for that nominee  I as one wondered how people could be so opposed to one nominee in Harriet Miers and  as soon as Judge Alito was announced  they could be so overwhelming for him     What did they know  Who knew  And  Mr  President  one of the things that I think of at this time is what our founding fathers wanted    our founding fathers  What did the Constitution have on this issue  The founding fathers  debates at the constitutional issue    they considered the whole issue of appointment of judges four different times  Three occasions  they gave all the authority to this body here  the Supreme Court of the United States    recommend and appoint  Recommend and appoint  interesting  The last important decision at the Constitutional Convention  10 days before the end  was to share the power  have the president appoint and also the Congress to give the advice and consent to the president  You can t read the debates    which I have read    and not understand that it was a shared responsibility  This idea that the Congress is supposed to be a rubber stamp for the president suits some people  It suits their politics  suits their interests  But that isn t what our founding fathers  They wanted the shared responsibilities     Remember checks and balances    the essential aspect of the Constitution of the United States  checks and balances     When they give authority and power one place  they give authority and power to the other  The commander in chief  the executive  making of the war with the Congress  The powers of the purse    the rest of the issues that we all are familiar with  So this is a shared responsibility and we in this Congress have a very important constitutional obligation to review  to make the recommendation  inaudible   So it s a real question for us now when we have the nominee is to find out  not for ourselves  but really as instruments for the American people what the beliefs of this nominee    what are the real beliefs of this nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States    and we have the assurances that this individual is really the best of the best KENNEDY  We ve seen that  President Reagan gave us Sandra Day O Connor  really the best of the best  The list went on  We had extraordinary jurists in the past  So we approach this to try to find out on the Judiciary Committee  We have a pretty good sense that the executive branch knows the philosophy of this nominee  They ve made the recommendation  and obviously they have inquired of this nominee  So they know where he is  I was absolutely startled  Mr  President  this morning when I picked up the New York Times and saw under Mr  Kirkpatrick s  ph  article    it s on the front page of the New York Times    exactly how this nominee was selected    exactly how this nominee was selected    and who selected him  what the process was  all during this period of time something that those of us on the Judiciary Committee had no mind of  Maybe our friends on the other side knew about  But this is front page New York Times  Paving the way for Alito began  and it goes back extensively  It goes on to page A 18  I d ask that it be printed at an appropriate place in the record  UNKNOWN     Without objection KENNEDY     I ll just mention just a few times     So America is listening to the president  We re going to get the very best nominee we possibly can  One side of the story  Most of us certainly believed it  Well  this is a leaked story  This may be accurate  it may not be  But I think it s very difficult to read this story and not certainly find a very  very powerful ring of truth in it  Last February  as the rumors swirled around the failing health of Chief Justice Rehnquist  a team of conservative  grassroots  organized public relations specialists  legal strategists met to prepare a battle plan    a battle plan    to ensure any vacancies were filled by like minded jurists     Well  so they have a plan  Conservatives have a plan  They know what the thinking is of the nominee  It continues  The team recruited conservative lawyers to study the records of 18 potential nominees  including Roberts and Alito  and trained more than three dozen lawyers to respond to news reports on presidential eventual picks  So we re going to evidently have this group where the conservatives    they re going to make the pick  and it s seeded around the country where dozens of lawyers are going to call on in the news reports when they have the president  We boxed them in  Boxed who in  Boxed in the American people  That s what they re saying proudly   We boxed them in   lawyer present during the strategy meetings said with pride  Boxed who in  This is supposed to be for the Supreme Court of the United States  This is supposed to represent all the people  all Americans  No  no   We boxed them in   a lawyer present at the strategy meeting said with pride  This lawyer and others present described the meeting    were granted anonymity because the meetings were confidential because the team has told its allies not to exalt publicly    not to exalt publicly    until the confirmation vote was cast  There it is  They can hardly wait    although I was surprised  I mean  this being my 23rd Supreme Court nominee    that we had the nominee up here in the Capitol last week going around and thanking people for their support and receiving congratulations prior to the time that we even voted on him  Less than a week on the floor of the United States Senate    less than a week    25 senators from our side have spoken  only half of our caucus has spoken    had a chance to speak  But not now  They won t if we cut off  They haven t had a chance to talk  But they are told now    the team has been told not to exalt publicly until the confirmation vote was cast  Then  we ll pop the champagne  We pulled one over you  put one over on you  And it continues  Mr  President  The article    They laid out a two part strategy to roll out behind whoever the president picked  people present said  The plan first extolled the nonpartisan legal credentials  They don t even know who the nominee is going to be  but they have the plan  Extol the nonpartisan credentials of the nominee  steering the debate away from the nominee s possible influence over hot button issues  Second  attack the liberal groups they expect to oppose any Bush nominee  There it is  That s the strategy  It isn t  We are going to nominate the best possible nominee  and we are going to work with the Republicans and Democrats alike to make sure the American people understand how this nominee is going to protect your constitutional rights and your constitutional liberties KENNEDY  That s what we thought  That s what s been done at other times  not every time  but most of the time  That s what the American people expect and that s what they are entitled to  But  oh no  this group is already saying  We know how we re going to handle this  Whoever it is  we re going to exalt the assets of this nominee  And the other thing is  we re going to launch our attacks right on other people before the nominee is even out there  Confirmation process  Supreme Court of the United States  A nominee that is going to make the decisions on your rights and liberties for the next 30 or 40 years    attack him  Attack him  as soon as the nomination is out there  Exalt the nominee s professional accounts  We don t know who it is  but you better get about doing it  And we ve got our network wired around the country to make sure that they re going to come out right on it     Supreme Court of the United States  This is what we re finding out  So then it continues  Mr  President  Mr  Leo and other lawyers supporting Judge Alito were inclined to shrug off the memorandum    this is the 1985 memorandum of Judge Alito that he used for an application of a job  He was 35 years old and had argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court  He had a number of statements in there that were provocative  We ll come back to that  But this memoranda was provocative because it indicated that he was against a woman s right to choose  he was against reapportionment  which  of course  has had enormous importance in terms of ensuring people s ability to have a right to vote and have that vote counted in a meaningful way    and other features of it  So there was some concern whether this was going to have any impact  This was his real  true view about Constitution  This was a document that showed his real view about it  which would have been helpful to the American people to at least  sort of  understand what Judge Alito s views were  But those lawyers supporting Alito said   We ll shrug off the memo   which described views that were typical in their circles  people involved in the effort said  But the executives at Creative Response Concepts  the team s public relations firm  quickly convinced that it was a big deal  that it could be the centerpiece of the Democrats  attack  one of them said  Creative Response Concepts  Who are those Creative Response Concepts  The Creative Response Concepts    you look them up  look them up on the Web KENNEDY  Right above the Alito confirmation hearings are the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth    Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  the ones that had the distortions and misrepresentations about my colleague and friend John Kerry and his war record over there  distorted and misrepresented it  Here we are there  This is their advertising  Alito confirmation hearings  They say  Let us get in it    and into it they go  American people entitled    listen to those that believe in the nominee  listen to those on the other side that support it    no  we re getting our message right through a P R  firm  Creative Response Concepts  We re getting our truth right through them  American people have got to understand about his views of constitutional rights  Put on your  inaudible  go down Creative Response Concepts  When we finish doing the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  we ve got the Alito nomination right here     American people  this is what they re entitled to  The team s public relations firm quickly convinced them it was a big deal  and that could become the centerpiece of the Democrats  attacks  one of the people said  And the article continues to go on  So  Mr  President  this has been a difficult process in order to try and make a judgment and be fair to the nominee  and also to carry forward our responsibilities  But when you have this kind of action on the outside and the failure to be responsive on the inside    in terms of his response to questions    this is  I think  a disservice to the American people     This has been a long standing campaign    long standing campaign  It s been a stealth campaign  I dare say that is not what the founding fathers intended  That s not what they expected  And the American people deserve a great deal better  Mr  President  I would hope that people would have a chance to read the whole article  I m not going to go through it now  but I ve given some of the essence of it  It s very clear how this nominee was selected  why he was selected and how that campaign for him was conducted KENNEDY  And as the American people are trying to make a judgment on this through their elected representatives  today and tomorrow  all we re asking for is an opportunity to be able to have the kind of full discussion and full debate that we ought to  and that members of the Senate that haven t had a chance to speak have an opportunity  It s not asking too much  I ve been here in the United States Senate when we really had filibusters  The idea that we re here on a Monday  and this came to the Senate last Wednesday  and the opposition is saying  Oh  well  this is delaying the work of the Senate    what s more important to the United States Senate than a vote for the Supreme Court of the United States  What s more important  What s coming on back  Oh  we re going to deal with the asbestos issue  Oh  well  isn t that important  Sure  it s important  to some people  but not in this bill  This is the issue  this is the time  this is the nominee  And we find out how we ve been treated  Mr  President  And this body deserves better and the American people deserve better  That s what this vote is this afternoon  That s what it s about  Let s really find out  Let s have a chance to go through these cases and this nominee  We know  Mr  President  that the right wing now has its campaign in full gear  Their mission is  cover up the truth  So we do need a full debate  Bring out the truth on Judge Alito s records  What s wrong with debate  Are they afraid of what Americans would do if they really heard the full record     That s what the issue is  Mr  President  and that s why people are entitled to the time  Now  people in my state  Mr  President    I was up there for a few hours on Friday  And what they were talking about to me in the few hours that I was up there  they were talking to me about the prescription drug bill that they just can t navigate through  We ve got 45 different drug bills up there to try and make a choice from  They ve got situations where individuals sign up for a particular program  And it s interesting  the plan itself can change the premiums and the formularies  but the person can t get off that plan  Once they re in it  they re in it  Or if they do get off it  they pay an extraordinary penalty to get onto another  Can change the deductibles  Can change co pays on it  They are very troubled  elderly people  heart rending stories     People up there care about their heating oil  going right up through the roof  People care about that in my state  People are absolutely in disbelief with how a part of America  in New Orleans and Mississippi and Alabama  can be left out and left behind KENNEDY  And they re continually pained by the continued loss of sons and daughters from my state and from across the country in the Iraq war with really no end in sight     They re bothered by all of this  They re bothered by the whole issue on lobbying and lobbying corruption  And they re working hard because the middle class are having a more and more difficult time just to have ends meet  They re finding the prescription drugs have gone up  home heating s gone up  education s gone up  gas has gone up and their wages have not gone up  Nine years since we increased the minimum wage here  Seven times we ve increased our own pay in here by  30 000  but we can t afford to increase the minimum wage for  1  Hard working people are hurting in my state of Massachusetts today  They re wondering about tonight whether they re going to get food onto the table  And now  we re asking them to shift your focus onto Alito     Alito  How is that going to affect what my family is faced with     It will affect a great deal about your children and your children s children in terms of the future  Here are some of the issues that Supreme Court decisions affect  The decisions affect the ability of Americans to be safe in their homes from irresponsible search and seizures and other government intrusions  We had those cases that came up in terms of our hearings  I ll come back and spend some time on that    difficult to believe  They affect whether the rights of employees can be protected in the workplace  If you re a worker  you should be concerned about this nominee  They affect whether families can obtain needed medical care under the health insurance policies  decisions on health insurance  whether they re under ERISA or not often go to the Supreme Court  They effect whether people will receive their retirement benefits that they were promised   8 billion lost in the last five years  700 retirement programs that are lost     8 billion where workers actually paid in  Who s going to protect their rights  Is it going to be the powerful  powerful companies  powerful interests  special interests  or are we going to have a judge that is going to be looking out after the worker and the worker s interest  Legitimate issue  You care about your health care  You care about your retirement  You care about your conditions of employment  This Supreme Court nominee is where you ought to be focused and where you ought to give attention  They effect whether people will be free from discrimination  prejudice and outright bigotry in their daily lives  whether you re going to be told you re not going to get the job because of the color of your skin or you re not going to get it because of your gender KENNEDY  Cases    we went through during the Judiciary Committee    I ll come back to them    about Judge Alito being insensitive in those areas  Do you hear me  Discrimination  prejudice  outright bigotry in their daily lives  You re going to have to make sure you re going to have a Supreme Court that is going to be fighting for you  They affect whether Americans  most private medical decisions will be remain a family matter or subject to government interference  Terri Schiavo is a classic example  We got governmental solutions to these issues or should these matters be left in terms of individuals that are closest to any patient  their families  their loved ones  their priests  their ministers  their rabbis  We had the debate on this issue  People can think that that s a long way away from you  but there s nobody    nobody in this body  nobody in this audience  nobody that s watching that hasn t got the real potential concern for what is going to happen to their parents  to their loved ones  and whether we re going to be able to deal with that issue with respect or whether the Supreme Court is going to say  Well  I think there are appropriate governmental kinds of roles in this kind of a situation  We certainly saw in this body where there were a majority of this body legislatively felt that the courts ought to become much more involved on it  They basically retreated on that position  although some have still defended it even in recent days  They affect whether a person with disabilities will have access to public facilities and programs  I gave the example of the Lane v  Tennessee    that s in the last few years    last three years     last three years    and disability rights  And who among us doesn t have a member of their family that has not some kinds of challenges  either a mental challenge  mental health challenge  a physical challenge  We ve certainly seen it in our family  And I think most    and when we get the chance to talk about disability and disability rights in this body  it s always amazing    not amazing  it s always interesting to me that we give such little focus and little attention to those that have mental health challenges and disability needs  and we give such little focus and attention and assistance to them  Parity is the codeword  where we ve got to treat people the same for mental health and for those that are involved with disabilities  as well as those that have physical  We still haven t had it  but I certainly hope that with the leadership of Senator Domenici  certainly myself  many others here in this    Senator Harkin    many other members  that we will have a chance to vote on that on this year KENNEDY     It s long  long overdue  They affect whether we will have reasonable environmental laws that keep our air and water clean  Care about the water  care about the air that we have  Well  does that really make much of a difference to us  Senator  Does it really make much difference to us  Interesting  We have doubled the number of deaths from asthma this year than we had five years ago    double the deaths for children  I wonder why that is  And you know where they are  They re all in the states and in the cities and in the communities that  by and large  have inhaled the toxins and the dioxins that have come from the changes in the environmental laws  the major carbon producing plants in this country  We have laws  I don t know what you tell the mother when they see the children having that intensity  As one who s a father of a chronic asthmatic on this  they live with it  The idea of people outgrow it  not in our family  And see the constant kind of challenge that that is for any young person  and as they go to adulthood     And that is growing  and there s no question about it it s because of the pollutions in the air  Do we going to have a judge that s going to recognize what the Congress wanted to do  or someone that s going to say  Oh no  we ve got a very powerful company down here that seems to have a reasonable argument    as we saw with Judge Alito  and I ll come back to that case  as well    so therefore we re going to find for the company and we re going to let them continue to discharge pollutants into the lakes on this     Do we care about the lakes  care about the streams  My part of the country  we have    what     65 percent  70 percent of all the streams are contaminated with mercury  a dramatic increase with mercury in all of those  Where kids used to go out and fish and enjoy  that is absolutely denied them  And the risks in terms of health  particularly for expectant mothers  is very real  These are issues which are going to    we in Congress try and deal with them  We pass laws  the president signs them  They go to the court in terms of interpretation  And where will this nominee come out  Will he come on out for that mother who has a child that s got asthma or that parent who s seen the pollution that s taken place in a pond  in a lake  and whose child has been affected by those kinds of poison  Where is he going to come out on the issues of discrimination in the job place  issues that we have been fighting to eliminate under Title VII of our civil rights laws and that still is a problem KENNEDY     We can go through those cases where this nominee fails to shape up  So let me just say  Mr  President  this vote this afternoon will last for 15 or 20 minutes  but the implications for that vote  the implications in terms of your life  your children s life and your grandchild s life are going to be for years to come  We only have one chance of getting it right  This isn t a piece of legislation where you can go ahead and just pass it  say  Oh  well  we got it wrong  I think we will with regard to the prescription drug bill  I think we re going to have to come on back and redo it  I do  I think we should  We can come back and redo a prescription drug  Americans are entitled  Seniors are entitled  We do the hospitalization  We do the doctors attention  ph   We ought to do the prescription drugs  We got it wrong the last time when effectively that conference was hijacked by the drug companies  Extraordinary payoffs    extraordinary  Written up in The Washington Post last week about the payoff   48 billion to the HMOs  People that go to the HMOs are 18 percent healthier and they got a 9 percent inflator  25 percent advantage  I thought Republicans used to say  Look  the private sector is more efficient  we can do it more efficiently than the government  so we don t need extra help  No  they say  We want all the extras  25 percent more  So it comes to about  45 billion more  You re asking why people in my state are paying higher co pays  premiums and all the rest  It s because we ve got these kinds of payouts  So  Mr  President  we can come back and deal with those  People can deal with those in the elections next fall  I understand that  You win and lose  We come back to it     But not on the Supreme Court of the United States  One time  one chance  one vote to get it right  No second times  And that s  Mr  President  what all of this is really about in this debate that we ll have in the course of the day and this afternoon  As I say  I just don t know what s more important that we re going to deal with  I gave examples of the range of different issues that come before the Supreme Court  I doubt if anybody who is listening to this or is watching this at all  they re not affected by at least one or two of those different kinds of issues over the course of their lifetime  in terms of their work  in terms of their retirement  in terms of their pay  in terms of discrimination  in terms of the environmental kinds of issues  women s privacy issues that are so at risk on this particular issue  time  this nominee  All of those are out there  And all we re saying is  don t we think we ought to try and get it right  Don t we think we ought to try and have the chance to lay this out  lay this out just a little more  In every one of those examples I gave  in those nine different titles  there are cases which Judge Alito has ruled on    has ruled on  taken a position  In many of those cases  he s taken a position in strong opposition from other dissenters appointed by Republicans  Judge Chertoff  head of Homeland Security  talked about Gestapo  like tactics that were used when marshals came in on a civil action    no crime committee  a civil action in order to take over a    repossess a farm from bankruptcy  sold at public auction KENNEDY  People working their lives off for this small farm in Pennsylvania  And  boom  the marshals came in  seized and grabbed these individuals  No crime  No crime  No attempt to run  no attempt to hide  no attempt to evade  And we have Judge Chertoff  President Bush s selection for the head of Homeland Security  talking about Gestapo like tactics    Gestapo like tactics by those marshals  Well  whether they were Gestapo like or they weren t Gestapo like certainly ought to be decided by the jury  I think most of us would agree with that  would we not  Judge Chertoff said they were Gestapo like  and others believed they were Gestapo like  except Judge Alito  And he said  No  no  We re not going to let that go to the jury  They were just performing their own responsibilities and I m not going to let that go to the jury  Other nominees  on issues about whether there s discrimination in the employment  Republican judges that sat with Alito and said  If we followed Judge Alito s reasoning and rationale  it will effectively eviscerate    is the word they use    Title VII  Title VII being the provisions we passed in the  64 act to make sure that we were not going to discriminate in the employment     Do you hear  Those are Republican judges KENNEDY     They re not us  They re not us  So the list goes on  Mr  President  It isn t just myself or others who have expressed opposition  We have the very distinguished Cass Sunstein of University of Chicago who s done a review of Judge Alito s cases and says that he found that on 84 percent of the time  Judge Alito decided for the powerful or the entrenched interests for the government   Cass Sunstein  Knight Ridder    that s not a Democratic organ  that s not Democrats     inaudible  member of the committees  They have a whole group that did it  Independently  Knight Ridder  newspaper chain  reached exactly the same decision    same decision  Yale Study Group    gifted  talented teachers and professors up there at Yale University    did the study about Judge Alito s dissent and opinion  Exactly the same conclusion  If you re looking for someone that s going to protect the workers  if you re looking for someone that s going to protect men and women of color  if you re looking for somebody that s going to protect children  if you re looking for someone that s going to protect the privacy issues of women  this is not your candidate  Mr  President  Those are the conclusions certainly of a broad range of different groups that have studied this    broad range  not just Democrats  not partisan     These aren t partisan  Knight Ridder is not partisan  Cass Sunstein basically has been very much in the middle  Some will say  this afternoon  Oh  well  you can always find a few cases on this  It isn t just a few  Mr  President  These are the overwhelming cases  These are the studies  Even the Washington Post study in terms of the number of victories that individuals of color had or workers had over the existing power system reaches the same kind of conclusion  So it seems to me  Mr  President  that we ought to at least have an opportunity to make sure that the American people understand it  It takes time    takes time    took some time for the American people to understand what was really happening in Iraq    took some time  They understand now  But it took time  It took some time  People are working hard  They re busy  They re busy with their jobs and their families  and they re trying to do what s right  play by the rules  It takes some time for them to understand how this nominee is going to affect their life and their well being in terms of the future  But  Mr  President  there s nothing that s more important  nothing more important here in the United States Senate  nothing more important in the unfinished business of the Senate  Just pick it up and look at the card  the unfinished business of the Senate  Nothing that comes to it  If you said to me  Right behind here is the defense appropriations bill  This is going to make the decision on armor  support for our troops on that part  I d say  Fine  let s that go right through  Let s get to that  Maybe we ll find time afterward for Judge Alito  if that was the issue before us  But that isn t here  Mr  President     What are we doing after this  We re doing asbestos issues  And that s an entirely different    got real questions on that  whether it s going to be adequate to try and fund those people that have been the sickest and all the rest  We ve got to have a full time debate on that  But there s no reason in the world that we can t take the time and we can t have the debate and the discussion on this issue which is of extraordinary  incalculable kind of importance to the well being and the lives of all Americans KENNEDY  And there are sufficient kinds of questions and issues which have just been across the front page of America s newspapers today that raise very  very serious issues and questions about this whole process  That ought to cause our colleagues  our friends  our associates  the members of this body some pause to say  let s try and think  let s try and get it right  Let s try and get it right  I say  let s try and get it right  We ll have an opportunity to do that this afternoon at 4 30     Mr  President  I believe my time is just about up
