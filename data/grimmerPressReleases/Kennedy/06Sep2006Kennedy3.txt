         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in reaction to Senator Frists comments that passing comprehensive immigration reform would be next to impossible   How can Republicans say they are for making America safer when they cant even pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill to protect our borders  Republicans are so divided over immigration that it will take leadership from the President to break the impasse    In the House  the hearings proved to be nothing more than a cynical ploy and now in the Senate  the Majority leader is refusing to move it forward despite its broad bipartisan support  Sadly the American people are paying the price of this Republican do nothing Congress  Americans deserve a solution to our broken immigration system  not delay tactics and election year politics     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
