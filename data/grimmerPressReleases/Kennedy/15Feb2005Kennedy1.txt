         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       Today  Senator Edward Kennedy and Congressman Henry Waxman released a letter to the President calling for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to be given the authority to negotiate lower prices for drugs under the Medicare program  Under the recently enacted drug benefit bill  the Secretary is explicitly barred from negotiating the best possible price for American s seniors  protecting profits for prescription drug companies      Last week  after the new  724 billion price tag for the drug benefit was announced  President Bush threatened to veto any attempt to change the drug law  In light of this veto threat  Kennedy and Waxman released a new estimate of possible savings for seniors through price negotiation     190 billion   if Medicare followed the lead of the VA  This savings which could eliminate the entire benefit gap for seniors or be used to reduce the skyrocketing costs to taxpayers for the new drug law     The goal of a Medicare drug law is to keep our seniors healthy by keeping our drug prices low  Unfortunately  current law puts drug company profits first  said Senator Kennedy  If President Bush was serious about fiscal discipline and protecting drug coverage for our seniors  then he d stop threatening vetoes and take common sense steps to reduce drug costs     The news this week that the already inadequate Medicare drug benefit is so expensive only underlines that we need to use our leverage to negotiate lower prices for our seniors and disabled citizens  just like the VA does  said Congressman Waxman  If the President is threatening to veto that kind of change  he s doing a real disservice to people relying on Medicare  and the American public    Currently  the Veterans Administration negotiates the best possible drug prices with drug manufacturers for our veterans  Bipartisan legislation is pending before the Senate   introduced by Senator Snowe   requiring the Secretary of HHS to negotiate drug prices  using the bulk purchasing power of 40 million Medicare beneficiaries  with drug companies     Below is the letter  sent to the President today      February 15   2005     The Honorable George W   Bush   President   The White House   1600 Pennsylvania  Avenue   Washington  DC 20050    Dear Mr   President     On Friday  you indicated your intention to veto any bill that took away prescription drug coverage from America s seniors  We support your position that any steps to cap or reduce the recently enacted drug coverage under Medicare are unacceptable  Indeed  addressing the large gaps and high out of pocket and premium costs associated with the new drug benefit should be a high priority      While actions to reduce the recently enacted drug benefit are unacceptable  one simple change will both reduce the costs of the new law and benefit Medicare beneficiaries   and that is to give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to negotiate the best possible prescription drug prices for the Medicare program  This single change will save the Medicare program  190 billion over the next decade without cutting benefits     All we are suggesting is to give HHS the same authority as the VA to negotiate the best possible price for prescription drugs with manufacturers  The Veteran s Administration has negotiated excellent prices for veterans and the VA for years  and there is no reason why Medicare should not do the same for senior citizens  Just as large corporations and insurance companies use their bulk purchasing power to negotiate discounts  the Secretary of HHS should be empowered to use the purchasing power of 40 million Medicare beneficiaries to negotiate the best possible price for the Medicare program and for the elderly and disabled     The  724 billion ten year price tag for the drug benefit announced in your new budget is sobering  and underlines the necessity for prompt action to deliver the benefit with the maximum possible efficiency  The  190 billion savings we project would be sufficient to eliminate the entire benefit gap the so called doughnut hole or to substantially reduce the deficit or to achieve some combination of improved benefits and reduced costs to the government  This approach would avoid either of two unacceptable options cutting benefits or accepting the status quo of uncontrolled costs and inadequate coverage     There is a bipartisan support for giving the Secretary this authority  and we urge you work with us and others in the House and Senate to bring this critically important improvement to the Medicare drug program                                                                 Sincerely     Edward  M  Kennedy           Henry  A  Waxman   Contact  Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner
