worked with her to pass the landmark holiday honoring the birth of Martin Luther King     Below are the remarks Senator Kennedy will deliver at today s funeral services  embargoed until delivery      KENNEDY REMARKS HONORING CORETTA SCOTT KING  AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY     It is a very great honor    and a very great sorrow    to join in this tribute to our sister  Coretta Scott King    We honor her of course for her partnership with Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  They say marriages are made in heaven  and this marriage certainly was  It was also made in Boston    53 years ago    where a beautiful young woman with a beautiful soprano voice who had come to the New England Conservatory of Music to learn to be a concert singer met a young divinity student earning his doctorate degree in theology  The music they heard was more than music  the bread they broke was more than bread  and the history they made together changed the world    But we honor her as well for the person she was in her own right  Coretta marched to the drum beat of justice  sang for the cause of freedom  and preached fairness for the oppressed  Her legacy will forever stand as a monument in the heart and soul of our nation and in the pages of our history     The Book of Proverbs asks  Who can find a virtuous woman  Strength and honour are her clothing         She openeth her mouth with wisdom  and in her tongue is the law of kindness  America found that ideal in Coretta Scott King     It was an extraordinary privilege for me to have the chance to know her  She showed me  as she showed us all  what it means to overcome    not only  as the spiritual says  some day    but every day     She overcame when her husband was jailed in October 1960 and given an incomprehensible sentence of four months of hard labor in a rural penitentiary for a minor traffic violation  The situation was ominous  and many feared for his life  I remember my brother  President Kennedy  calling her to say he would do whatever was necessary to help  Robert Kennedy called the judge  the next day  and miraculously Martin was released  In that difficult time and in countless similar times  in the years that followed  Coretta was a constant pillar of strength     Even in the face of the sharpest slings and arrows of outrageous fortune  she was able to overcome and become a symbol of the triumph of hope over hate     She became not only a national presence  but an international icon  opposing apartheid in South Africa in the 1980s with the same fervor that she had challenged prejudice in America in the 1960s  She knew deep in her heart that none of us are free until we all are free    Coretta was also an extraordinary mother  who raised her children in troubled and turbulent times without a father  I was honored to have the chance to know her children  and she made a special point to make sure that each of them grew up with a sense of dignity  a sense of the worth of the individual  and a sense of obligation to others  Yolanda  Martin  Dexter  and Bernice are strong men and women in their own right  who have made a difference themselves and who carry on the noble tradition of their parents    There were countless times along the way when it seemed the nation might never relinquish the old traditions of prejudice  bigotry and discrimination  We who lived through those years recall Coretta as a remarkable combination of power and peacefulness  In the face of her constant courage  her unshakable faith  her inner strength  and quiet grace  even Jim Crow had to yield     For decades  she was an inspiration to us as we worked in Congress to enact and uphold the civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in education  jobs  and housing  The magnificent King Center here in Atlanta is a monument to her as well  I had the honor of working with her on the landmark legislation to make the birthday of her husband a national holiday  Then too  her quiet persistence prevailed  Only three Americans in our history have been given that high honor    George Washington  Abraham Lincoln  and Martin Luther King    and Coretta made it happen     The words of our Lord in the Sermon on the Mount describe her best  Blessed are they that mourn  for they shall be comforted  Blessed are the meek  for they shall inherit the land  Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness  for they shall be filled  Blessed are the merciful  for they shall obtain mercy    Blessed are the pure in heart  for they shall see God    Blessed are the peacemakers  for they will be called the children of God  Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness  sake  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven  Truly Coretta Scott King was blessed in each of these ways    We know how much the nation still has to do to live up to her ideals  But we know that  thanks to her inspiration and that of her husband  eventually we will reach the promised Land  And we rejoice that she and Martin are already there  together again  We know they will always be there to inspire us in our journey  and we know they will never leave us    Thank you  Coretta Scott King  for all you taught us and all you gave us      With renewed spirit  we carry on your work    confident that we shall overcome     The work goes on  the cause endures  the hope still lives  and the dream shall never die
