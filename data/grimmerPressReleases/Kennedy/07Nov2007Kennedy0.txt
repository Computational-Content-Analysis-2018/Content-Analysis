         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     WASHINGTON   DC Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy released the following statement in response to the passage by the United States House of Representatives of the Employment Non  Discrimination Act      Although the House bill is narrower than we had hoped  the Houses approval of the Employment Non Discrimination Act is a major step in the journey toward equality toward full civil rights for the entire gay  lesbian  bisexual  and transgender community  The House has clearly recognized the basic injustice of job discrimination based on sexual orientation  No one should face discrimination in the workplace because of who they are  I look forward to taking up this issue in the Senate so that we can finally ensure that no American finds the doors of opportunity locked shut by prejudice and bigotry           Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
