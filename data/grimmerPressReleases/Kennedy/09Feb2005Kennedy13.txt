         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      We re now seeing the real cost of our failure to provide affordable health care for our citizens  Illness is bankrupting millions of Americans who ve done everything right  They have worked hard  played by the rules  earned a good salary  saved their money  even purchased health insurance   only to find that s not enough    Today  they are penalized twice   once by our fractured health care system and a second time by our bankruptcy laws    The bill before us will make matters worse  It places the profits of credit card companies and banks ahead of the needs of hard working  hard pressed Americans    A recent study by Professor Elizabeth Warren and her associates at Harvard exposes the flawed rationale for this special interest giveaway  Almost half of all Americans who file for bankruptcy every year are the victims of our broken health care system  not of a misplaced attempt to live high on the hog on borrowed money  They are middle class Americans who have had the misfortune to get sick  They were faced with large doctor and hospital bills that insurance didn t cover    Most of these Americans did not seek relief in the bankruptcy courts willingly  In the two years before they actually declared bankruptcy  they went through extensive sacrifices as they struggled to pay for their health care and to make ends meet  One in five went without food  Almost one third had their electricity shut off  Almost half lost their phone service  And many more went without needed medical care     It is indefensible to deny hard working Americans bankruptcy protection because our society has denied them access to affordable health care  It is reprehensible to put the interests of credit card companies and banks that have so much wealth and power ahead of the interests of working families that are in such desperate straits  It is unconscionable to punish people because they have the misfortune to be sick    As this bill moves forward  we must change it to protect families with high medical costs from its draconian provisions  The issue is not financial responsibility  These families have more than met that test  Now we have a moral obligation to provide solutions that are fair and compassionate  American families already bear a heavy burden because our broken health care system denies so many of them access to affordable medical care  Slamming shut the door of the bankruptcy courts is no solution      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633
