for the record       I welcome you here  this morning  Mr  Gates   The Committee is very pleased to have this opportunity  to talk to you about the critical issue of Americas competitiveness   We are  eager to hear the insights you have gained through your leadership of the  Microsoft Corporation and through your unparalleled philanthropic endeavors  which have shed light on the critical issues facing our families  the nation   and the world        You and your family  are powerful advocates for the principle that all people need and deserve the  opportunity to achieve their full potential  regardless of race  ethnic  background  or financial means         In fact  today equal  opportunity is more than a guiding principle for our nation   Its essential to  our strength and prosperity   We must make use of the skills and talents of  every American to compete and win in todays competitive global economy   We  cannot tolerate second class schools and second class citizens if we are to have  a first rate economy that works for everyone        So the choice before  us is clear   We can be swept away by the swift currents of globalization  or we  can determine our own destiny through wise policies and decisive action   In my  view  that means we should face the future not by lowering American wages  but  by increasing American skills to equip our citizens to compete and win in the  global economy       Im sure youd agree  that Americans know how to rise to challenges and come out ahead   Weve done it  before and we can do it again       Our nations founders  understood that education was important to building a new nation and  strengthening our democracy   In 1780  John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts  constitution that education of the people was necessary for the preservation of  their rights and liberties   Massachusetts had the first public school and the  first college in the nation       With the Industrial  Revolution  America rose to the challenge once again   We established free  public schools   And at the turn of the last century  we founded public high  schools to help move the nation forward       After years of  depression and the Second World War  we built a new peacetime economy   We  passed the GI Bill to enable those who served in battle to rebuild their lives  at home   For every dollar we invested  the Greatest Generation returned  7 to  our economic growth       In 1957  we were  called to action once again   The Soviets sparked the Space Age with the Sputnik  launch   We rose to the challenge by passing the National Defense Education Act  and inspiring the nation to ensure that the first footprint on the moon was left  by an American   We doubled the federal investment in education          Now we must rise to  the challenge again        First  we must invest  in education and job training to give our citizens the skills to spur innovation  and progress   The No Child Left Behind Act   The Higher Education Act   The  America Competes Act   The Workforce Investment Act   The Head Start Act   All  of these matters are before this Committee this year and each one is vital to  the innovation and competitiveness of our nation       This was underscored  in a report on innovation released just last week by our nations governors    They  like others  point to education and job training as a key part of the  solution         Mr  Gates  thanks in  large part to your work  we know also how critical it is for our high schools to  prepare students for success in college and the workplace   We know we can  improve the results for our children by creating schools that serve all students  with rigorous standards  challenging curriculums  up to date materials and  technology  highly trained teachers  and supportive communities        To be globally  competitive  we need to provide a world class education to each and every  student  not just a few   We must close the significant and shameful achievement  gap that exists in this country   We must also do more to improve math and  science instruction in our public schools to encourage more young people to  become scientists and engineers   We can do that if we ensure all students have  good teachers   But students in high poverty and high minority schools are more  likely to learn from new  inexperienced teachers than students in less poor and  less diverse schools   We passed the No Child Left Behind Act to put a high  quality teacher in every classroom and ensure that all students have the  opportunity to learn and to meet high standards   Were making progress  but we  need to make changes to the law to make it work better for our schools and our  children   And we need to provide the resources to support the reform        We also must  dramatically increase access to college   A college degree is fast becoming the  ticket to entry in the global economy   In 1950  when I graduated from school   only 15 percent of jobs required some post secondary training   Today  the  number is over 60 percent and rising rapidly   But as the importance of college  has increased  the financial challenge for families has only become greater     As a consequence  each year  400 000 talented  college ready young people  dont go to a four year college because they cannot afford to do so   To keep  America competitive  we must ensure cost is never a barrier to getting a degree        Improving education is  essential  but it alone isnt enough       We must also do more  to address the devastating impacts of the global economy on American workers and  their families   We must strengthen our commitment to help workers adjust to the  new economy  particularly those who lose their jobs due to trade and those who  need training in 21st century skills   In Massachusetts  there are 181 000  people unemployed  and yet there are over 84 000 jobs waiting to be filled    That is a clear sign of a skills gap   And we should enable workers to improve  their skills throughout their careers so they can adjust to the constant and  rapid changes in the workplace and the economy       Second  we must invest  in innovation and industries that will create the good new jobs of the future         We are relying more  and more on the private sector to conduct the research and development to keep  us competitive   We must make the RD tax credit permanent   But we also  have to increase federal investment in basic research  which is less in real  terms today than it was in 2004    While the US continues to be a leader in  government supported research  China  Japan  and other fast growing economies  like Ireland and South Korea are seeing the immense potential of basic research  for encouraging economic growth   Chinas total research and development  investments rose from  12 billion in 1991 to  85 billion in 2003  an average  increase of 17 percent per year   Over the same period the US investment  increased an average of only 4 to 5 percent annually         Federally funded  research often primes the pump for future innovation and commercial applications  of new technologies    Its also essential to our ability to attract the best  and brightest students to our universities and employees to U S  companies  and  to cultivate the leading minds in promising new technologies         Finally  we must  reform our immigration laws and policies not only to protect our land and our  jobs  but to help keep the engines of innovation running strong          Since our nations  founding  we have attracted the best and the brightest talent from throughout  the world  people determined to live their dreams  reach their potential  and  prosper in a way that only this country allows   It is this continual mix of new  blood and new ideas that has propelled us to a position of leadership among  nations         Increasingly  our  broken immigration system is limiting our ability to recruit and retain the  worlds best   There are not enough visas under current law to meet our need    The U S  cannot sit back and watch other countries attract the best talent          Today  foreign  nationals earn over half of the advanced degrees at U S  universities in  science  technology and engineering   Yet  these American trained  foreign born  students  because of our immigration laws  are not able to stay here and apply  their knowledge and skills to advance our economy and create new jobs          We all agree that  Americans must be hired first   But we must also keep the doors open to those  who will contribute and strengthen our land for the future          Last year  I supported  the inclusion of immigration provisions targeted at high skilled foreign  workers   I plan to include similar provisions in the comprehensive immigration  reform bill that I am about to introduce        When it comes to  innovation  we must look beyond the horizon and invent the future   Mr  Gates  you done that throughout your career  Were delighted to have you before our  Committee and look forward to your testimony   Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
