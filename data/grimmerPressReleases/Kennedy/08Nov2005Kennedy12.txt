         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE       LETTER AND BACKGROUND ON VANGUARD INCLUDED   Washington  DC    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy sent the following letter to Judge Samuel J  Alito in an effort to gain clarity about the facts surrounding Judge Alito s failure to recuse himself from a case involving Vanguard  Also below is a backgrounder on the facts in the Vanguard case     PDF available upon request     November 8  2005   Judge Samuel J  Alito 357 US Post Office and Courthouse Federal Square and Walnut Street Newark  NJ 07101   Dear Judge Alito    I look forward to our meeting next week to discuss your nomination to the Supreme Court  As you know from your review of earlier confirmation proceedings  my main focus is on whether nominees have a commitment to the basic values and liberties which lie at the heart of this nation s greatness  and whether they believe the Court should continue its important role in the many years of progress in equality and fairness that have made this an even better country  In order to make our meeting as productive and efficient as possible  I hope you will provide me in advance with some of the facts on another issue that has been raised in press reports relating to your recusal practices    I m particularly interested in the background of the commitment you made to our Committee  when you were being considered for the Circuit Court in 1990  to recuse yourself in all cases involving the Vanguard companies  Smith Barney  First Federal Savings  Loan of Rochester  and your sister s law firm  It would be helpful to know whether you made this commitment because of a request or suggestion from a Senator  the White House or the Justice Department  whether it was the result of some experience you had in a prior position  whether it derived from the specific nature of your past or present contacts or relationships    adversarial or otherwise    with the specified entities  or whether you were anticipating and seeking to avoid any potential ambiguities in the applicable canons or provisions of federal law by instead having a bright line rule to govern your actions    I assume that  as an experienced lawyer and law enforcement officer  having made the commitment to us  you made some arrangements to facilitate your compliance with it  whether by informing the court s Chief Judge  Clerk or Administrator  alerting your own staff  or filing appropriate informational or disclosure forms or notices  If you did take any of these or other steps to implement your commitment  either upon being sworn in or subsequently  I d appreciate your describing them in your reply    When this issue first arose in 2003  you were the subject of a newspaper interview and wrote a letter to the Chief Judge  Neither the resulting article nor the letter mentioned your commitment to the Committee  If  in fact  you did tell the reporter about those promises  or if your letter omitted them because you had reason to believe the Chief Judge already knew about them  please provide the details    You reported to the Committee in 1990 that your investment in Vanguard companies was about  80 000  The 2003 newspaper article reported that the value of your investment in various Vanguard funds and entities had increased to an amount between  390 000 and  930 000 by 2002  If any of those figures is incorrect  please provide the correct figure    Finally  the White House has been responding to the recent stories on the recusal issue with two different assertions  First  they claimed a computer malfunction caused you to overlook your obligation to recuse  They then abandoned that explanation and instead claimed that your financial interest was insufficient to trigger any obligation to recuse  again without even mentioning your unconditional recusal commitment to the Committee  To the extent you had any role in developing these explanations  or the decision to switch from one to the other  please describe that role  To the extent that others researched  developed  or suggested either explanation or the switch in explanations  please describe what you know about who they were and what they did    I hope you will agree that clarifying these facts in advance will save us time in our meeting next week  It would be helpful to have your reply before the weekend  I look forward to seeing you    Sincerely    Edward M  Kennedy   BACKGROUND ON VANGUARD    CONFLICT OF INTEREST ISSUE  As of the time of Alito s confirmation to the Third Circuit in 1990  his interests in various Vanguard Mutual Funds were substantial enough that  in answer to the Judiciary Committee s pre hearing Questionaire  he specified that  I would disqualify myself from any cases involving the Vanguard companies    As to disqualifications in general  he stated that he would abide by the applicable Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct and provisions of law  Canon 3C requires disqualification whenever a judge knows that     he or she  has a financial interest    in a party to the proceeding   Financial interest is defined as ownership of a legal or equitable interest  however small    The Canons derive from mandatory provisions of the U S  Code   28 U S C  455 b  4  and  d  4      Alito s interest in 3 Vanguard named funds was about  80 000 when he was before the Committee in 1990  By 2002  he had investments in 1  or more Vanguard named funds totaling over  390 000     Case No  01 1827 involved a widow who claimed she had been denied funds on deposit with Vanguard  originally belonging to her deceased husband  The appeal in the Third Circuit was filed in the spring of 2001  and was decided  against the widow  on April 12  2002  A Petition for Re hearing was later filed and referred to Judge Alito for action in August 2002  The case name included three separate references to related Vanguard companies  The case name or references to Vanguard would have appeared repeatedly in various filings in the case  such as briefs  significant motions  Vanguard s required Corporate Disclosure Statement  and the court s opinion dismissing the appeal  in which Alito joined  as well as in the lower court s decision which the 3rd Circuit was reviewing     After the Supreme Court denied the widow s petition for certiorari in April 2003  she discovered that Alito s financial disclosure forms filed with the court included a substantial number and amount of Vanguard named funds   She apparently did not know about the promise to the Judiciary Committee   In December 2003  she filed a motion to vacate the judgment against her  and requested that Alito be disqualified  Alito then wrote a letter to the chief judge asserting that there was no real problem  since he did not own shares in any party  He stated  I do not believe that I am required to disqualify myself based on my ownership of the mutual fund shares  But as a matter of personal practice to recuse in any case in which any possible question might arise  he was voluntarily recusing himself from considering the widow s motion to vacate the original judgment  The letter did not mention his promise to the Committee to recuse in any Vanguard case     The matter became public at that time in an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer  Excerpts discussing the disqualification issue     Plaintiffs  contend that Alito was required by law and federal court rules to disqualify himself from any case involving Vanguard  The merits on this are a slam dunk in my view  Flym  widow s lawyer  said in an interview  All we need to know is that he s got a financial interest  however small  That s it  He surely knew that the bulk of his money was in Vanguard Alito said he believed his Vanguard holdings did not constitute a conflict because they were investments in mutual funds  As such  he said  he was merely an investor in Vanguard  not an owner of the company  Flym said the judge  in fact  is an owner because Vanguard is owned by its investors  In its corporate literature  Vanguard says  The shareholders and owners are essentially one and the same at Vanguard  Vanguard shareholders own the Vanguard funds  which are independent investment companies that jointly own the Vanguard Group  The Vanguard Group provides management  administrative and marketing services to the funds     Ethical issues have entered into Supreme Court nominations at least twice in the past 50 years  a  Justice Fortas  nomination as Chief Justice was blocked by a Republican filibuster in 1968  in part based on allegations of ethical improprieties  Fortas remained on the Court as an Associate Justice until he retired in May 1969  b  Judge Clement Haynsworth was nominated as Associate Justice in August 1969  His confirmation was hotly contested over a variety of issues  including ethical issues involving his involvement in a private company which was a service contractor to a party in a case before him  and his shareholdings in various public companies which were  or were affiliated with companies which were  parties to cases before him  Even under the rules then in place  which apparently did not include the current however small provision  many Senators  including members of the President s party  believed that the ethical issues were relevant to his qualifications  He was defeated by a bi partisan vote of 45 55     The White House s first explanation of Alito s non recusal    that a computer glitch at the court s computer contactor prevented his being notified of the conflict    is not sufficient  and the White House s second explanation    that he didn t have to recuse himself because he didn t have a financial stake in the outcome  is factually untrue  Vanguard was his largest investment when he made the promise and clearly remained a very large investment for him  Vanguard was one of just three companies he had promised the Committee to recuse on  Its hard to understand how he failed to see the Vanguard name each and every one of the many times it appeared on papers he was reading  writing  or signing  Moreover  his failure to tell the chief judge of his committee promise and assertion that he was not required to disqualify do not add up since he made a promise to recuse in 1990 in any case involving Vanguard  regardless of the stake in the outcome    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
