         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Alan Greenspan is a near impossible act to follow but Ben Bernanke is certainly well qualified for the critically important position of Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board  I hope that during his confirmation hearing he ll affirm his commitment to economic policies to help Americans who have had their finances unbearably squeezed by the rising cost of gas  education  housing  and health care     It s obviously important for the Federal Reserve Board to ensure a stable economy for business  But it s also important for Americans to have access to affordable lines of credit to buy homes and send their children to college  Hopefully  Mr  Bernanke s priorities will reflect the needs of Working America  not just Corporate America   Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
