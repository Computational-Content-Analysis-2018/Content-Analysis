         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WASHINGTON  D C Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  sent the following letter to Secretary Michael Leavitt requesting information on the interactions of political appointees at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of the Surgeon General  specifically during tenure of Dr  Richard Carmona  The letter is below  August 30  2007Secretary Michael LeavittDepartment of Health and Human Services200 Independence Avenue  SWWashington  D C  20201Dear Secretary Leavitt I am writing to follow up on my letter of July 11 requesting information concerning interactions between political appointees at the Department Health and Human Services  HHS  and the Office of the Surgeon General  specifically  during the tenure of Dr  Richard Carmona  I appreciate the Departments cooperation with my request for documents as they are important to the Committees oversight responsibilities  Improper Efforts to Politicize the Office of the Surgeon GeneralDocuments provided by your office and uncovered by my investigation bear out the concerns that motivated my initial request  This evidence shows that HHS officials sought to censor and suppress certain projects undertaken by the Surgeon General  and promote the Administrations agenda  for purely political purposes  For example  in an April 14  2003 email to Regina Schofield  then Director of Intergovernmental Affairs at HHS   William Turenne  then Consultant to the Secretary  writes that Surgeon General Carmona needs to be the SG with specific speeches  to specific audiences  on specific topics addressing the Secretarys and the Presidents agenda  which will become more political as the re elect gets underway  Schofield responds later that day that officials in the Secretarys office are hammering  Surgeon General Carmona  everyday  Another email from Turenne to Schofield on September 25  2002 demonstrates that Turenne viewed the Surgeon General as little more than an extension of the White House communications office  my level of concern about the SG is growing and a few words are inadequate  In a few short words  and with a few exceptions he seems to be wandering  is not focused on the Presidents Secretarys agenda  and has not moved to organize his office RECOMMENDATIONS  So here are a few recommendations that are aimed at getting him to focus on that which he was hired for   a  Strengthening the public health infrastructure as the President laid out two years ago  c  Defending the Presidents position on Stem Cell Research  the Presidents position on smallpox vaccine Other documents reveal that the White House was directly involved in efforts to politicize the Surgeon Generals office  Specifically  emails indicate that the White House Office of Political Affairs pushed Surgeon General Carmona to attend certain events  including a Republican Party fundraiser  For example  after the National Fraternal Order of Police invited the Surgeon General to speak at a February 2006 conference  the Associate Director of Scheduling in the White House Office of Political Affairs began an insistent string of emails to Dr  Carmona from her RNC account  making clear that there was a huge push from the White House for him to attend the event  January 23  2006  The WH Political Office is following up to see if you are planning to accept an invitation to speak on 2 11 at a Fraternal Order of the Police event in Nashville  TN  And later the same day  Just found out this is a HUGE push from WH  can you do this event A few days later  on February 1st  the HHS White House Liaison began sending similar emails to Dr  Carmona  Can you do this event on 2 11 in Nashville  Very big push from WH And the next day  TIME SENSITIVEWH is still pushing on thisif you can do this it would be greatly appreciated by WH Sara Taylor  then Director of the White House Office of Political Affairs  wrote a memo to Dr  Carmona seeking his participation in the Alabama Republican Councils Annual Fundraiser  The HHS White House Liaison also emailed Dr  Carmona in February of 2006 that the WH would be grateful if you could do this event  Finally  a February 2006 document entitled WH Post SOTU  State of the Union  Surrogate Travel shows that  like Turenne  the White House viewed Surgeon General Carmona as a political surrogate to be deployed to communicate the Presidents message  a completely inappropriate role for the nations doctor Importantly  many of the emails from White House officials were sent from Republican National Committee email accounts  a practice that the Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees  and the Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  have criticized as violating transparency provisions of the Presidential Records Act These documents confirm that White House and HHS officials improperly sought to influence the activities of the Surgeon General to achieve political goals  As Chairman of the Committee of jurisdiction  it is my duty to thoroughly investigate the extent of such improper activity  Therefore  I have broadened the scope of my July 11 document request to include additional issues and document custodians  please see the attachment for specifics  Improper Efforts to Politicize the CDC and NIHIn addition  my office has uncovered information tending to show that HHS officials engaged in similar politically motivated conduct with regard to scientists and researchers at the National Institutes of Health  NIH  and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   Specifically  former NIH officials have indicated that HHS sought to limit scientists participation in an important international conference on HIV AIDS  Information obtained by my office also shows that HHS officials and NIH leadership instructed scientists that the Administration intended to censor  edit  or otherwise control statements by NIH scientists and researchers to ensure that those statements hewed to Administration ideology  Similarly  information has come to my attention indicating that HHS officials blocked or censored several important CDC initiatives  including the Health Education Curriculum Assessment Tool  HECAT   the product of an expensive and exhaustive process of scientific research and stakeholder consultation  Information obtained by my office also indicates that the Department delayed or cancelled grant and procurement requests that concerned child and family health  In light of these events  I ask that your Department provide to my office information and documents concerning certain political appointees interaction with NIH and CDC  Please see the attachment for specifics  The production of documents may be coordinated with Nicholas Bath or Sandra Gallardo  Counsels to the Committee  at  202  224 3112 Thank you for your consideration   Sincerely  Edward M
