         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  LEAHY  If I might add to that  of course we have been parties    we re all    when we got attack on 9 11  nobody asked whether you were attacking Democrats or Republicans  You were attacking Americans  So I sit in there  you know  I go to work every day in one of the buildings that was supposed to be destroyed by Al Qaida  Thousands of other people do too  Obviously  we want them caught  we want them destroyed  That s why all of us voted to get Osama bin Laden  the man who masterminded that and why  frankly  some of us are concerned that he has not been caught yet  We d like to have him caught  On the question of legal matters  of course there is a difference of opinion  And as many very conservative Republican conferees  I think of Bruce Fein and others  has said very clearly  they don t think this program is legal  What we re asking is not what s going on in the program  Actually  the president and the attorney general have spoken more in public about what s going on in this program than most members of Congress have ever heard  The people who have been briefed  Bob Graham  former chairman of the Intelligence Committee  said specifically it was not authorized under the authorization to take force against Al Qaida  Tom Daschle said the same  I mention the two of them only because they were quoted  I believe  out of context  But let me show you the thing we were not allowed to see   BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GEORGE W  BUSH  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  It requires    a wiretap requires a court order  Nothing has changed  by the way   END VIDEO CLIP LEAHY  Just two other quick ones  I think we ve all heard the president s    and we will do this again for you   BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GEORGE W  BUSH  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  Any time you hear the United States government talking about wiretap  it requires    a wiretap requires a court order  Nothing has changed  by the way   END VIDEO CLIP LEAHY  Well  I agree with the president on that  We don t always agree  but I do agree with him on that  And that s one of the reasons we re having this hearing   BEGIN VIDEO CLIP DURBIN  Has this president ever invoked that authority as commander in chief or otherwise to conclude that a law was unconstitutional and refused to comply with it GONZALES  I believe I stated in my June briefing about these memos that the president has not exercised that authority  Senator  this president is not    it is not the policy or the agenda of this president to authorize actions that would be in contravention of our criminal statutes DURBIN  Finally  will you commit to notify Congress if the president makes this type of decision  and not wait two years until a memo is leaked about it GONZALES  I will commit to advise the Congress as soon as I reasonably can  sir   END VIDEO CLIP LEAHY  Now  you understand when you listen to those three are the series of questions I was asking Attorney General Gonzales  When was this authorized  Authorized before the Patriot Act  Authorized before the Afghanistan resolution LEAHY  And he says he doesn t know  Now as White House counsel  of course  he had to sign the final papers for the president  And that s why I ve asked him to come back after lunch and tell us when it was  Because certainly  from what we ve heard there  it was well before the question asked by Senator Durbin  well before the question asked by Senator Feingold  And I realize that the explanations for what they re doing seems to change depending upon who s speaking  But this is one heck of a change KENNEDY  We all want to have the strongest national security  The real issue in question is whether this proposal of the administration is really a step back from the best that we can do  This whole program has been questioned in terms of its legality within the Justice Department and in many other areas of legal opinion  And if the attorney general has it wrong  like he had it wrong on the torture amendment  then we are opening up those that are on the front line of defense of our national security  the people in NSA  the workers out there at NSA  the court systems of our country  the telephone companies  to all kinds of harassment  This attorney general and the administration should have come to Congress to get this program right  We did it before  in 1978  and had only one member of the United States Senate vote against the FISA  We are prepared    Republicans and Democrats    to work with the administration and to get it right  There s no reason in the world we should have a program of questionable legality like this one  It is not in our national security interest  It s not in our national security  We ought to do what is in our national security  And we on the Judiciary Committee are willing to work with this Republican attorney general and this Republican president as we did with President Ford and Attorney General Levi QUESTION  Did anyone tell the president s people that when he came to them and told members of the Judiciary    members of the Intelligence Committee KENNEDY  No  they never talked with us  who were actually the principal sponsor of the FISA in 1976 QUESTION  Why didn t Senator Rockefeller say something about this KENNEDY  Well  that s   QUESTION  Why didn t Jane Harman say something about it KENNEDY  As you well know  the Intelligence Committee legislation requires that they brief the total Intelligence Committee and not just pick one or two of the members  So they are in conflict with that  and I believe that will be brought out in the questioning of the attorney general this afternoon DURBIN  I d say a word  if I might  about the issue that came up this morning about whether the attorney general should have been sworn and testified under oath  When I made the motion that the attorney general take an oath  that was to follow the custom and practice of the committee  This attorney general has been before the committee twice  and in both instances was sworn by Chairman Specter before he testified  In April of 2005  when he testified on the Patriot Act  he was sworn by the chairman  And secondly  that same week  he testified before the House Judiciary Committee and was sworn before he testified by Chairman Sensenbrenner  So it is the ordinary custom and practice  What we see today is unusual  I don t know why Chairman Specter reached that conclusion  but he did  The importance of the attorney general speaking to us under oath is dramatized by the tape we ve just shown  We ve been told by the chairman that we cannot play this tape in the Judiciary Committee hearing  I think it s critical that the American people understand the last time the attorney general came to us and spoke in the most general constitutional terms about this  he said some things which are contradictory with what he s saying today DURBIN  Senator Feingold will raise his point    his question and response    and put it in the context of what hear today  I ll do the same  Here is what we are concerned about  From the very beginning  from 9 11 forward  Democrats and Republicans have stepped up and said  We will give this administration every tool and every resource it needs in order to keep America safe  We have voted for the Patriot Act  we made changes that they suggested  and given them every single appropriation  And  of course  we were instrumental in creating the Department of Homeland Security and intelligence reform  which has given us more tools and a better approach to keeping America safe  I just can t understand  as I stand here  why this administration did not trust the same bipartisan spirit when it came to this program  If the question is  Do we want our administration  our government  to wiretap anyone who is suspected to be a member of Al Qaida and might threaten the United States   the answer is obviously yes  And the way to do it  of course  is to follow the law  And the law is explicit  And in this case  the administration did not follow the law  It would have been a simple matter for them to use the FISA Court  to go to a judge  and to go ahead with any wiretap that they felt was necessary to keep America safe  And  if it turned out to be too cumbersome  the administration can do what it s already done  Come to Congress and asked us to change the law so that FISA is more efficient in the way that it works  Unfortunately  they did not do that and that s what led to this hearing today QUESTION  Senator  what about the arguments that you endanger exposing this program and thereby killing the program DURBIN  I think that that begs the question  because what we re asking for in FISA legislation  is the most general authority of the United States government  We re not specific  We don t spell out exactly how we re going to go after conversations or messages or e  mails or any other source of communication  It is a question of giving authority through a judge at the FISA Court  And if the administration would come forward  as they did after 9 11  and say  There are new techniques being used by the enemy  we need to change the FISA law  trust me  an overwhelming bipartisan majority will still support the administration  I just don t understand why they can t make what modifications in the law may be necessary  but instead are claiming powers which go way beyond what the statute allows and way beyond what anyone voted for on September the 14th  2001 QUESTION  But the attorney general says that FISA allows intercepts that are otherwise authorized by statute  And he also says that that was authorized in the authorization to force act DURBIN  That s his argument  you ve just repeated it QUESTION  Well  if you disagree with that argument  why don t you go on the floor and try to get a vote and have the Senate say whether or not the authorization of all force necessary   DURBIN  No  you ve got it wrong  I don t know    who do you work for  incidentally QUESTION  Powerline and Pajamas Media DURBIN  Pajamas Media QUESTION  Pajamas Media and Powerline DURBIN  OK  I m sorry  I wasn t familiar with your publication  But I will just tell you this  The argument is that the Constitution spells out the powers of the president as well as the powers of the legislative branch and judicial branch  And statutes will be followed if in fact they put exclusive authority  That s what FISA does  It creates the word exclusive means  exclusive authority  And they are reading more into it now than the statute obviously allows
