         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE          REMARKS AND FACT SHEETS INCLUDED      WASHINGTON   House and Senate Democrats today discussed recent successes in their attempts to increase the minimum wage and their strategy for getting an increase passed this year   The minimum wage is currently  5 15 an hour   Sen  Edward Kennedy  D MA  and Rep  George Miller  D CA  have co authored a bill to increase it to  7 25 over three years that has bipartisan support in Congress  and overwhelming support across the country    But the Republican leadership is pulling out all the stops to keep this plan from becoming law by blocking it from coming to the floor in the House and attaching poison pills to it in the Senate     Last week  the House Appropriations Committee voted 32 to 27 to attach the Kennedy Miller plan to increase the minimum wage to the FY 2007 Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill   The House was expected to consider the annual funding bill this week  but House Republican Leadership has put it on hold as they scramble to find a way to kill the measure   I find it outrageous that a week after the House declined to block a cost of living increase for Members of Congress the Republican Leadership would try to prevent members from increasing the minimum wage so folks can have a decent standard of living  said Dave Obey  D WI   Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee   Democrats are going to keep trying to attach a minimum wage increase to bills until we get a vote on the House Floor   This issue clearly illustrates the different priorities of the Democratic and Republican parties  said House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer  D MD   who offered the amendment to the appropriations bill   Democrats are focusing on the working men and women of this country  And  what are our Republican colleagues doing   This week  they intend to take up legislation   once again   that gives the heirs of the wealthiest families in America a break on the estate tax and drives our nation even deeper into debt  Paris Hilton does not need another tax cut    Following on the House s success  Sen  Kennedy offered an amendment yesterday that would attach the minimum wage increase to the Defense Authorization bill     The issue resonates strongly with the people  because it s fundamentally about fairness   Americans understand fairness   They know the difference between right and wrong  said Kennedy  Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions   It s wrong that hard working men and women can t afford to put food on the table or heat their homes  It s wrong to give billions upon billions of dollars in tax relief to the wealthy  and then but turn your back on the hard working families who live in poverty each day   It is wrong that in our prosperous nation  14 million children go to bed hungry each night    Minimum age employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year earn  10 700 a year   6 000 below the poverty line  Senator Durbin said  Holding the minimum wage at  5 15 an hour is shameful and should be changed  Durbin said  Increasing the minimum wage to  7 25 an  hour would benefit 6 5 million Americans  60  of whom are women   An increase to  7 25 an hour will mean an extra  4 000 a year for   millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet   It is unacceptable that Americans working full time are living in poverty   Every day the minimum wage is not increased  it continues to lose value and working families fall further behind   It is past time to stand up for working families and raise the minimum wage  said Senator Clinton   I also believe we should tie the minimum wage to Congressional pay raises   If we in Congress can give ourselves a raise  surely we can raise the pay of working families struggling to make ends meet   The American people have had enough  They want their Congress to act on behalf of all Americans  They want their Congress to help make it possible for all Americans to get ahead by working hard  They do not want their Congress to believe that it is okay for American families to work full time and still live in poverty  said George Miller  D CA   Ranking Member of the House Education and Workforce Committee   KENNEDY STATEMENT AT MINIMUM WAGE PRESS CONFERENCE  AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY   Let me begin with a word of thanks to the Republican Congress for all theyve done in the past month to put the minimum wage at the top of the agenda in Congress   They didnt mean to do it  but its a classic example of the saying  When we see the darkness  it reminds us of the light   First  the GOP Senate tried to run through a repeal of the estate tax   Then the GOP House tried to ram through a pay increase for members of Congress   Millions of Americans were outraged and theyre responding by demanding an increase in the minimum wage for low income workers who havent had a raise in nine years    During those years  we fought time and again to raise the minimum wage  but our Republican colleagues always said no   Now  theyve embarrassed themselves by their greed  and we have new momentum for the long overdue pay increase that millions of minimum wage workers need and deserve       The issue is resonating more strongly than ever  because its fundamental were talking about fairness   People understand fairness   They know the difference between right and wrong           Its wrong that hard working men and women cant afford to put food on the table or heat their homes           Its wrong to give billions upon billions of dollars in tax relief to the wealthy  and then turn your back on hard working families who live in poverty each day         It is wrong that in our prosperous nation  14 million children go to bed hungry each night   Across the country  brave citizens are pounding the pavement and knocking on doors to say that no one who works for a living should have to live in poverty   Republicans are feeling the pain  especially in this election year   They know they cant keep ignoring the will of the people  because November will soon be here   The momentum is growing  and the time for action is now   The proposal Im offering in the Senate will raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour over the next 2 years  70 cents now  70 cents a year from now  and 70 cents two years from now   That increase will help almost 15 million Americans rise out of poverty   It will put food on their table  gas in their gas tanks  and clothes on their backs   It will help people pay for education  get out of debt  and spend more time with their families   It will make a huge difference to all the hard working men and women trapped in a minimum wage job that no longer keeps them out of poverty   The vote will come soon  so keep the pressure on   Victorys finally within our grasp   With your help  we can put it over the top    RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS   A FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT FACT SHEET       Millions of minimum wage earners who work hard and play by the rules are forced to live in poverty   Too often  these hardworking Americans are forced to make impossible choicesbetween paying the rent and buying groceries  paying the heating bill  or buying clothes                          Senator Edward M  Kennedy  An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem of poverty in our nation        The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office        37 million Americans currently live in poverty  including 13 million children       Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s         Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year earn  10 700 per year  almost  6 000 below the federal poverty guidelines of  16 600 for a family of three     The minimum wage is losing value   Every day the minimum wage is not increased  it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind         Since then the minimum wage was last raised in 1997  its real value has eroded by 20 percent   Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase       Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  4 00 below what it was in 1968   To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  9 26 an hour today  not  5 15  Raising the minimum wage will make a significant difference in the lives of working families   Millions of hardworking Americans would benefit from a higher minimum wage       Nearly 15 million Americans will benefit from a minimum wage increase to  7 25 an hour  6 6 million directly  and another 8 3 million indirectly  Almost sixty percent of these workers are women  and forty percent are people of color         Eighty percent of those who would benefit are adult workers  not teenagers seeking pocket change   More than a third of these adults are sole breadwinners for their families       Increasing the minimum wage will help more than seven million children whose parents would receive a raise         Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 400 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families   It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy   o    15 months of groceries o    19 months of utilities o    8 months of rent o    Over two years of health care o    20 months of child care o    30 months of college tuition at a public  2 year college  A fair increase in the minimum wage is long overdue   Congress continues to line its own pockets while ignoring the needs of the poorest Americans       Its been more than 9 years since minimum wage workers last saw an increase in their wages  the longest period without a raise since the first minimum wage was passed in 1938       During that nine years  Congress has raised its own pay by  31 600   Its inexcusable that Congress continues to vote itself a pay increase while ignoring our nations lowest paid workers         Twenty one states and the District of Columbia have responded to this inexcusable inaction at the federal level by raising their minimum wages at the state level    A minimum wage increase will not hurt the economy   History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation         In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades   Nearly 12 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 248 000 per month         In contrast  in the last four years  the minimum wage has held steady  but only 4 7 million jobs have been created   A minimum wage increase will not hurt small businesses    The vast majority of small business owners agree that a minimum wage increase would not affect their business       A recent Gallup poll found that 86  of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business       Three out of four small businesses said that a 10  increase in the minimum wage would have no effect on their company         Additionally  nearly half of small business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased  and only 16  of owners think the minimum wage should be reduced or eliminated entirely   Other countries have benefited from minimum wage increases   International experience indicates that raising the minimum wage reduces poverty without hurting economic growth or job creation       Britain has the second largest economy in Europe  after Germany    They implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty   They raised their minimum wage to about  9 26 per hour last year  and they are planning to raise this rate to about  9 81 in October of this year        Ireland has an extremely robust economy  with impressive growth over the last decade  and the fourth largest GDP per capita in the world   The minimum wage rate in Ireland is 7 65  hour  about  9 60 an hour  and yet their unemployment rate is lower than the U S      SUMMARY OF  THE FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT         The wages that we pay our workers make a profound statement about who we are as a nation   The American Dream is about working hard to build a better life for your family   In the wealthiest country on the face of the earth  no one that works hard for a living should have to live in poverty                                                                                   Senator Edward M  Kennedy  The Fair Minimum Wage Act  S 1062 H R 2429  will provide a long overdue increase in the federal minimum wage   The bill would        Raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps         5 85 60 days after enactment       6 55 one year later       7 25 one year after that        Make the federal minimum wage applicable in the Commonwealth of Northern Marianas Islands  and gradually raise the minimum wage on the Islands by 50 cents per hour every six months until it meets the federal standard     STATES WITH MINIMUM WAGE RATES HIGHER THAN THE FEDERAL  21 STATES   D C  Alaska   7 15 Arkansas   6 25    California   6 75  Connecticut   7 40   D C
