         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Had this been a real strategy for victory  it would have come none too soon  But  it s not  The President s effort to put lipstick on his failed Iraq strategy fools no one  It s still a plan for a continued open ended commitment  which puts at risk our troops on the ground and our citizens at home  As the United States Senate declared earlier this month  and as many Americans from all walks of life and all political beliefs have called for  we need a real and honest plan for success in Iraq so that our troops can begin to come home in 2006  That s the yardstick by which the American people will judge progress in Iraq  not by another political campaign with brushed off speeches and fancy backdrops  The American people  and our men and women in uniform  deserve far better than this    If things on the ground in Iraq are as rosy as the picture the President painted today  then we should be able to begin to bring our troops home in 2006  But  even according to the White House s own document  we are a long way from victory  As a result of the President s failure to go to war with a plan to win the peace  Iraqi s are not prepared to defend themselves  leaving American troops as the targets of a growing insurgency    America deserves a candid  open  civilized and honest debate about what is in America s national security interest in Iraq  an effective plan that will enable our troops to begin to come home  That s not what they got today  We all share the goal of an Iraq that can stand on its own so our troops can begin to come home  But  by accusing elected officials of setting artificial timelines the President is once again engaging in the politics of fear  which does nothing to protect the American people  Responsible Senators on both sides of the aisle have laid out plans to achieve victory and bring our troops home  which the President still has not done  The only thing artificial in this debate is the President s belief that we can achieve victory by staying the same failed course     Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
