Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Immigration Reform Bill                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    May 25  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Immigration Reform Bill      This bill appreciates the importance of addressing the problem of illegal immigration and border security while at the same time proposing an intelligent solution to the issue of the millions of people here without documentation today    First and foremost  we need to control our borders and enforce our laws   This bill adds thousands of additional border patrol agents  increases the use of technology and enhances the authority of our immigration enforcement officials to deport criminals and others who may seek to do us harm   This will significantly enhance our ability to catch people before they enter the country  and deport those who do   I could not support a bill that I did not believe could secure our borders    Border security alone is not sufficient   We must also enforce our laws in our interior   This bill includes a strong employment verification system  so that employers can determine who in this country is eligible to work  and will be punished severely when they employ those who are here illegally  We must also be realistic about how to deal with the millions of undocumented immigrants currently in this country   It is not realistic to deport them all   For those hardworking  law abiding people who have been here for years and set down roots in our communities  it is reasonable to allow them to earn citizenship over a significant time period   In this bill  they are asked to earn their legalization over the course of eleven or twelve years and demonstrate that they deserve to be an American  I am glad that we have put the time and effort into crafting a bipartisan solution we can be proud of  one that is both tough and fair
