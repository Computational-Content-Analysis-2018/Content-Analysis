KOHL SPONSORS BILL TO LIFT BAN ON INTERSTATE SALES OF STATE INSPECTED MEAT                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    April 19  2007     Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL SPONSORS BILL TO LIFT BAN ON INTERSTATE SALES OF STATE INSPECTED MEAT  Changing current law would open new markets for Wisconsin s agriculture and food entrepreneurs    WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Herb Kohl today introduced legislation to overturn a nearly 30 year ban on the interstate shipment of state inspected meat and poultry products  Wisconsin is home to more state inspected plants than any other state in the nation  Current federal law requires the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to inspect all meat products shipped across state lines  however state inspection programs are mandated to be  at least equal to  the federal inspection program  Lifting the ban would allow producers and processors who use state inspected plants to sell their products outside Wisconsin   Removing the current prohibition will help level the playing field for small businesses and spur additional competition in the market place  It will help main street businesses    who often specialize in local  organic  grass fed or artisanal products    meet emerging markets  And it will help livestock producers who want more options for marketing their livestock   Kohl said  Kohl noted that current regulations allow meat inspected in 34 foreign countries to be shipped throughout the U S  because the USDA has certified that the inspection programs in those countries are equivalent to the federal program    For too long  processors with state inspected facilities have been unfairly constrained to selling only within their home states   Kohl said   This is an effort to give main street businesses the same opportunity our government confers on foreign processors   Kohl is the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations panel  which has jurisdiction over the USDA s budget  Kohl sponsored a similar state meat inspection bill last year and noted that local processors are strategically important to Wisconsin agriculture because they have greater flexibility to fill growing markets for local and organic products  Kohl s bill is co sponsored by Sens  Max Baucus  D MT  and Kent Conrad  D ND
