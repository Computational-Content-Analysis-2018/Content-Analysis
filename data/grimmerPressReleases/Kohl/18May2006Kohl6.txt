KOHL SPONSORS BILL TO PREVENT ANTI COMPETITIVE MERGERS IN OIL   GAS INDUSTRIES                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    May 18  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL SPONSORS BILL TO PREVENT ANTI COMPETITIVE MERGERS IN OIL   GAS INDUSTRIES More than 2 600 mergers and acquisitions in the fuel business have gone unchallenged since 1990    WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Herb Kohl today introduced legislation to direct the Federal Trade Commission and the U S  Department of Justice to revise antitrust guidelines for the oil industry to block mergers and acquisitions that would reduce competition in the fuel marketplace  Since 1990  the Government Accountability Office has counted over 2 600 mergers  acquisitions and joint ventures in the oil and gas industries  Led by gigantic mergers such as Exxon Mobil  BP Arco  Conoco Phillips and Chevron Texaco  by 2004 the five largest U S  oil refining companies controlled over 56  of domestic refining capacity  a greater market share than that controlled by the top ten companies a decade earlier   Kohl s bipartisan legislation  the Oil Industry Merger Antitrust Enforcement Act  will change current guidelines by demanding proof from merging parties that their transaction will not harm competition and allow the FTC and Justice Department to block proposed mergers that do   This merger wave has crippled competition in the oil industry   We have all seen the suffering felt by consumers and our national economy resulting from rising energy prices    Gasoline prices have now shattered the once unthinkable three dollar a gallon level  have doubled in the last five years  and increased more than thirty percent in the last year alone   Kohl said    In 2004  the Government Accountability Office concluded that these mergers have directly caused increases in the price of gasoline    A study by the independent consumer watchdog Public Citizen found that in the five years between 1999 and 2004  U S  oil refiners increased their average profits on every gallon of gasoline refined from 22 8 cents to 40 8 cents per gallon  a 79  jump   And the grossly inflated profit numbers of the major oil companies    led by Exxon Mobil s   8 4 billion profit in the first quarter of 2006  which followed its  36 billion profit in 2005  the highest corporate profits ever achieved in U S  history  are conclusive evidence of the lack of competition in the U S  oil industry    Kohl s bill directs the FTC and Justice Department to revise its Merger Guidelines to take into account the special conditions prevailing in the oil industry    including the high inelasticity of demand for oil and petroleum related products  the ease of gaining market power  supply and refining capacity limits  difficulties of market entry  and unique regulatory requirements applying to the oil industry    Kohl s legislation will also strengthen antitrust enforcement by shifting the burden of proof in oil industry mergers and acquisitions   In such cases  the burden will be placed on the merging parties to establish  by a preponderance of evidence  that their transaction does not substantially lessen competition   This provision would reverse the usual rule that the government or private plaintiff challenging the merger must prove that the transaction harms competition   This provision does not forbid all mergers in the oil industry    if the merging parties can establish that their merger does not substantially harm competition  it may proceed    However  shifting the burden of proof in this manner will make it more difficult for oil mergers and acquisition to survive court challenge  enhancing the law s ability to block truly anti competitive transactions and deterring companies from even attempting such transactions   Kohl s bill is cosponsored by Sen  Mike DeWine  R OH    DeWine is the chairman and Kohl is the ranking member of the Senate Antitrust  Competition Policy and Consumer Rights panel   Last month  the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006  legislation sponsored by Kohl and Sen  Arlen Specter  R PA  to give the federal government more tools to go after anti competitive conduct in the oil and gas industry  Kohl is also the author of legislation to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish and operate a strategic refining reserve and to authorize him to stop the exportation of gasoline and home heating oil when he supply falls short at home
