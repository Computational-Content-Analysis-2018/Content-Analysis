KOHL   TRUE BIPARTISANSHIP  ONLY PATH TO PRESERVING SOCIAL SECURITY                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 15  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL   TRUE BIPARTISANSHIP  ONLY PATH TO PRESERVING SOCIAL SECURITY       WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Herb Kohl  Ranking Member of the Special Committee on Aging  today heard from Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  at a hearing to examine the current state of Social Security and the President s recommendation to create a new system based on private investment accounts    What we re dealing with today is nothing close to a complete bankruptcy of Social Security  I don t believe we should do nothing  but it s clear that for those who are truly interested in strengthening Social Security    and not dismantling or replacing it with something very different    the problem can be fixed through relatively modest adjustments     Instead  the President has proposed a new  untested and expensive system of private accounts   Chairman Greenspan  as you have said  private accounts would do nothing to improve Social Security s financial condition and  instead of increasing national savings  these accounts would add up to  5 trillion more to our national debt  And they would not meet your goal    which I share    to increase national saving   If we truly want to increase national savings  shouldn t our priority be to reduce the budget deficit     What bothers me most about this debate is that it sidetracks us from the central issue we should be discussing  that our country faces growing budget deficits that will take its toll not just on our ability to sustain Social Security  but also other important entitlement programs like Medicare      If we are serious about dealing with these projected fiscal challenges  then we should spend our time and effort looking at the entire federal budget  including the current Administration s budget and tax policies that alone will increase the budget deficit by  1 6 trillion over the next 10 years    The debate today has become so polarized that partisan sniping and deadlock are the most likely outcomes    this is unacceptable   In 1983  people from both sides were able to come together to strengthen Social Security for another 75 years and it is only in this spirit that we will again be able to protect millions from poverty and restore a sense of security to all Americans
