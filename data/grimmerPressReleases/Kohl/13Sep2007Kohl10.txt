Statement of Senator Kohl on the President s Address on the Petraeus Report                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    September 13  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of Senator Kohl on the President s Address on the Petraeus Report      I m disappointed that the President s strategy for Iraq appears to continue down the same dead end road   We will see a draw down of troops next year    in part because our soldiers have been stretched to the limit    but only to pre surge levels   The draw down will  in effect  bring us back to where we started   The American people  myself included  are frustrated with the lack of political progress in Iraq and want to see the Administration begin to end our commitment there
