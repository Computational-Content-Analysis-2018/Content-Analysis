FARM BILL CONTAINS KOHL PRIORITIES ON MILC  MEAT INSPECTIONS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    October 25  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        FARM BILL CONTAINS KOHL PRIORITIES ON MILC  MEAT INSPECTIONS     WASHINGTON    The new Farm Bill reported by the Senate Agriculture Committee today contains provisions negotiated by U S  Senator Herb Kohl to help Wisconsin dairy farmers remain competitive and to permit state inspected meat processors to expand their markets across state lines     I m glad we were able to include provisions in the Farm Bill that will help Wisconsin farmers and rural businesses   The billions of dollars that dairy farming contributes to our state s economy each year is inherently linked to the success of farm families and rural communities across Wisconsin   It s important to provide a safety net to prevent widespread repercussions when markets are bad   Kohl said    The Farm Bill  which authorizes federal farm programs for the next five years  continues the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program  a countercyclical program that serves as a safety net to small and mid size dairy farmers when milk prices plummet   Kohl helped establish the MILC program in 2002 to end regional fighting over federal milk pricing policies  and the program has provided over  517 million to Wisconsin dairy farmers since its inception   Beginning in October  2008  the Farm Bill restores the payment rate for MILC to 45   currently 34   of the difference between market price and target price  the bill will also strengthen the safety net by covering up to 4 15 million pounds of milk per farm  which is equivalent to the average production of a Wisconsin dairy herd of 220 cows     The Farm Bill also includes a landmark change to allow interstate shipment of meat and poultry products from state inspected facilities   Wisconsin is home to more state inspected plants than any other state in the nation   Kohl is the sponsor of legislation to overturn the ban on interstate shipment of state inspected meat  which will allow small  specialty processors access to a broader market   State meat inspections programs are already  under current law  required to be  at least equal to  federal inspections   The new Farm Bill will allow some state inspectors  with federal oversight  to give federal certification to products at plants with 25 employees or less     I have traveled across the state and know firsthand that our people produce some incredible products   Our livestock producers and processors deserve more marketing options    and this bill achieves that in a way that actually strengthens food safety   Kohl said     The bill also   includes stricter timelines for USDA to consider and render decisions on proposed amendments to federal milk marketing orders    authorizes specific research for cranberry production and development assistance for value added dairy initiatives    expands the fresh fruits and vegetable program  which makes these products available to school children    clarifies that local sourcing is an option under the federal school lunch program    expands research  development and demonstration for biofuels
