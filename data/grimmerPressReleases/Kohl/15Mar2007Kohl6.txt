Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on S J RES  9  Senate Resolution on Iraq                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 15  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on S J RES  9  Senate Resolution on Iraq     Mr  President  today the Senate confronts the tragic situation facing us in Iraq   No member of the Senate  the Administration  or our Armed Forces is happy with where we stand in Iraq   A mission that began with the great success of our men and women in uniform has bogged down through no fault of theirs   With heavy hearts the Congress  after hearing the people speak in November  must now force a change in our policy in Iraq   We can no longer allow an open ended commitment to Iraq that endangers our forces while allowing Iraqi politicians to delay the difficult choices they must make  Senate Joint Resolution 9  which I support  calls on the President to begin the redeployment of our troops out of Iraq   After four long years they have been stretched to the breaking point   They now referee a bloody civil war that bears no resemblance to the original conflict we authorized them to engage in   The time for military solutions is over  and the difficult work of political compromise lies before the Iraqis with little our soldiers can do to help    The resolution does not require a rapid withdrawal  however  but gives time for a measured withdrawal that will protect our troops while providing support to the new Iraqi government   It sets March 2008 as a goal for our combat troops to be gone from Iraq    five years after they first entered the country    but it provides flexibility if that is not possible   The March withdrawal goal is also in line with what the Iraq Study Group believed was appropriate  This reasonable goal will give Iraq s politicians time to make the difficult decisions they need to make about power sharing and dividing oil revenues   It will also give our troops time to complete the training and equipping of additional Iraqi police and security forces    Five years is plenty of time to help a new nation toward democracy    or prove that democracy cannot be imposed from the outside   Either way we cannot ask our military to continue their mission indefinitely  Critics of the resolution believe that withdrawing from Iraq will damage our national security    but I disagree   The ongoing conflict in Iraq is hurting our image in the world  it is hurting our economy  and it is hurting our military   This war is no longer protecting us  but according to our own intelligence community it is encouraging terrorists to take up arms against us   Our presence has kicked off a vicious circle of violence that makes us less secure    not more   We need to close the circle and end this cycle of violence  We all want a stable and peaceful Iraq  but it is time to recognize that the U S  alone cannot achieve that goal   We need the help of the Iraqi people  and the assistance of Iraq s neighbors   If we work together Iraq can get on its feet and repair the sectarian divide   But if we continue on our current path  bearing the burden by ourselves  the cycle of violence will erode our good efforts   It is time for a change   It is time for us to shift the burden to the Iraqis and help them carry it forward
