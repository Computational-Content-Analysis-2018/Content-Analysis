KOHL INTRODUCES FIRST BILLSFOR 109TH CONGRESS                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    January 25  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL INTRODUCES FIRST BILLSFOR 109TH CONGRESS  Among first introduced bills  extension of national dairy program  class action reform  patient abuse prevention  tsunami food aid  and weekend voting legislation    WASHINGTON    With Congress reconvening this week following President Bush s second inauguration  U S  Senator Herb Kohl announced his first bill introductions for the 109th Congress  The bills address a number of Kohl s priorities for the new session of Congress   People in Wisconsin and throughout the nation have made it clear that they expect us to work together on their behalf to get things done  The new session of Congress presents a fresh opportunity  I look forward to working with the Administration and members of both parties in Congress to address our priorities  and these bills are part of that effort   Kohl said  Among the first bills Kohl will introduce in the 109th Congress   Extension of the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program   Kohl helped to create this counter cyclical support program that provides a critical safety net for America s dairy farmers in the 2002 Farm Bill  When dairy prices reached 25 year lows in 2002 and the first half of 2003  the MILC program provided dairy producers with much needed assistance and helped stemmed the tide of losses that dairy farmers had experienced in previous periods of downturn   Wisconsin farmers received  413 million during that period  The MILC program  however  is scheduled to expire in September 2005  two years earlier than the rest of the farm bill commodity programs  Kohl s bipartisan and multi regional legislation would extend the program for two years   Fishing and boating access expansion   Kohl s bill would reauthorize and expand the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund  which distributes monies to states for such activities as stocking fish  maintaining boating access areas and boating safety education programs   According to the Wisconsin DNR  Wisconsin would receive  3 million each year from the trust fund    The Patient Abuse Prevention Act  This legislation addresses the protection and care of elderly and disabled patients in nursing homes and home health care  The legislation will establish a national background check system for workers who care for the elderly and disabled to weed out known abusers and people with violent criminal backgrounds  Current state and national safeguards have been inadequate to prevent abuse of patients by those who are supposed to care for them   All states are required to have nurse aide registries  but these registries are not comprehensive or efficiently maintained   Additionally  many states limit their registries to nursing home aides  failing to cover home health and hospice aides     Weekend Voting bill   In an effort to increase access to polling places for American voters  Kohl is introducing a bill that would move federal elections to the first weekend in November and open polling places for uniform hours over the two days   Kohl s bill addresses a major shift in the way Americans vote  as voters increasingly opt to vote absentee or early because of increased crowding at the polls    Class Action Fairness Act  Kohl and Sen  Chuck Grassley  R IA  are reintroducing this bill to stop unfair and abusive class action settlements that ignore the best interests of injured plaintiffs  The bill makes it easier to move class action cases to federal court  where the judges are much more experienced and there are greater resources to deal with these very large cases   The bill also adds an extra layer of review for the class action settlements by permitting the Attorney General of a state whose constituents are affected to review and object  if necessary  to the settlements before the judge approves it   A Wisconsin case  involving a Baraboo woman  Martha Preston  underscores the need for reform  Preston was an unnamed class member of a class action lawsuit against her mortgage company that ended in a settlement   Ultimately  Preston received four dollars in the lawsuit  while her attorneys pocketed  8 million  Soon after receiving her four dollars  Ms  Preston discovered that her lawyers took  80  twenty times her recovery  from her escrow account to help pay their fees   International food assistance bill   In order to help meet the food aid needs of victims devastated by the recent earthquake and tsunami in South Asia  as well as to ensure that funding continues for current food aid programs in other parts of the world  Kohl will introduce an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill for food aid efforts  Such funding would help provide food aid to tsunami victims in South Asia without diverting food aid funding away from people in other developing countries    Additionally  Kohl is cosponsoring the following legislation introduced by the Democratic Leadership    Standing With our Troops   This legislation recognizes the sacrifices our troops make by providing them the personnel  equipment  compensation  and benefits they need to them accomplish their mission   The bill would increase military end strength by up to 40 000 by 2007  It would create a Guard and Reserve Bill of Rights to protect and promote the interests of the dedicated citizen soldiers  The bill also provides income security and immediate access to affordable health care for families of those in uniform    Fulfilling Our Duty to America s Veterans   As a new generation of veterans return from Iraq and Afghanistan  Kohl and the bill s sponsors are working to protect their rights  This legislation will ensure that all veterans get the health care they deserve while also expanding the availability and accessibility of mental health care  The bill will ensure the same commitment to the soldiers of today that was made to past veterans with a 21st Century GI Bill    Fiscal Responsibility for a Sound Future     This legislation helps to restore budget discipline and fiscal responsibility to the country s finances  The bill s passage would mark a return to budget discipline  including the restoration of the Senate  pay as you go  rule that requires that mandatory spending and tax legislation be fully paid for  or be subject to a 60 vote point of order  Pay go is one of the crucial budget enforcement tools that allowed the federal government to move from deficit to surplus in the 1990s  The bill would also reinstate mandatory spending cuts to balance the budget
