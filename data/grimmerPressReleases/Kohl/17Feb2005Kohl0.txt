DEWINE  KOHL INTRODUCE BILL TO STRENGTHEN ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 17  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        DEWINE  KOHL INTRODUCE BILL TO STRENGTHEN ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT Bill Would Give Department of Justice Authority to Request a Wiretap Order to Investigate Criminal Antitrust Conspiracies      U S  Senators Mike DeWine  R OH  and Herb Kohl  D WI   the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary  Antitrust Subcommittee  today introduced a bill that would give the Department of Justice a much needed tool to investigate and prosecute criminal antitrust conspiracies   The legislation protects consumers from conspiracies like price fixing and bid rigging which drive up prices and stifle competition  The  Antitrust Investigative Improvements Act of 2005  would add criminal antitrust offenses to the list of so called  predicate offenses  under the wiretap statute   By adding criminal antitrust offenses to the list  the Department of Justice would be authorized to seek a wiretap order from a federal judge    for a limited period of time    to monitor communications between criminal antitrust conspirators   This legislation would treat criminal antitrust offenses the same as such white collar offenses as mail fraud  wire fraud and bank fraud  for which prosecutors are able to seek wiretap orders upon a showing of probable cause    It is time to give the Department of Justice this tool   Under current law  the Department of Justice can seek a wiretap order when investigating other white collar fraud offenses like wire fraud  mail fraud or bank fraud  but it cannot do so when investigating a criminal antitrust conspiracy   said Senator DeWine    I think this is a mistake   In many instances the harm to innocent consumers from a criminal antitrust conspiracy is much more severe than in other types of white collar fraud crimes    Senator Kohl observed   Because of their secret nature  antitrust conspiracies are extremely hard to uncover unless prosecutors can penetrate the inner workings of the conspiracy   And antitrust conspiracies such as price fixing and bid rigging steal from consumers just as surely as other white collar crimes such as mail or wire fraud for which prosecutors do have the ability to obtain wiretaps   It is vital that we give law enforcement all the necessary tools to detect these conspiracies   By giving prosecutors the necessary authority to obtain a wiretap in these cases  we will greatly enhance their ability to aggressively bust up these criminal enterprises   Under current antitrust law  for a criminal offense  corporations may be fined up to  100 million and individuals may be fined up to  1 million and incarcerated up to 10 years   The Department of Justice criminally prosecutes certain violations of the Sherman Act  such as price fixing or bid rigging agreements among competitors    This bill is co sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vermont
