Opening Statement of Sen  Herb Kohl on the Supreme Court Confirmation Hearing of Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    September 12  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        Opening Statement of Sen  Herb Kohl on the Supreme Court Confirmation Hearing of Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States     Thank you  Mr  Chairman  Judge Roberts  let me also extend my welcome to you this afternoon and to your family    Judge Roberts  if confirmed you will succeed Justice Rehnquist and serve as only the 17th Chief Justice in the history of the United States  and the youngest in 200 years   You are nominated to a position of awesome power and responsibility   The decisions you and the other Justices make will shape the lives of every person in America for generations   Yet for only a few days this week will the people  through their Senators  be able to question and judge you  That means that we on this Committee who will be questioning you have an awesome power and responsibility as well  Judge Roberts  our democracy  our rights  and everything we hold dear about America are built on the foundation of our Constitution   That remarkable document has endured throughout our history   In the hands of the Supreme Court  it has established a right to equal education regardless of race   It has guaranteed an attorney and a fair trial to all Americans  rich and poor alike   It has allowed women to keep private medical decisions private    It has allowed Americans to speak  vote  and worship without interference from their government  You will lead the Court in its most solemn duty to interpret the Constitution and the rights it grants to all Americans   The Court has the last say in what will be the scope of our rights and the breadth of our freedoms   The Court even has power over which constitutional questions it will hear and which cases the Court will decide   That is why the Supreme Court is so vital to our lives    and who decides these issues  Judge Roberts  is therefore of unsurpassed importance  Moreover  you will enjoy even greater authority as Chief Justice of the United States than your fellow Associate Justices   You will not only lead an entire branch of our government if you are confirmed  but you will have a less evident  but an even more important power because it will be your sole responsibility to determine which Justices write which opinions when you are in the majority   Who writes the opinion governs the principle the case stands for and whether the precedent it sets is broad and important or narrow and less consequential  If you are confirmed for this lifetime position  your decisions and those of your colleagues will be the final word on the rights and freedoms of all Americans for decades to come   You will have no constraints on the decisions you reach    other than your understanding of the Constitution and your heart   That is why it is so essential that we    the democratic representatives in a democratic country    take this week to probe that understanding and that heart  This process of lifetime tenure is unique in our system of government   The President  Senators  and Governors make decisions every day   Our choices and our opinions are transparent to the public   And every few years  we are accountable for the decisions we make and the votes we cast   If the people do not like our votes or disagree with our record  they vote for someone else and we are gone  Just as we want    and need    to know much more about you  we presume that you want the country to know a lot about what is in your mind and in your heart   People in high places of public trust in this country have a responsibility to share their thoughts about important issues like civil rights  privacy  property rights  the separation of church and state  civil liberties and much more   We hope you understand the need to be totally forthcoming in your answers to questions on these issues   Evasions  avoidance  and hiding behind legal jargon simply will not suffice    So  the panel will ask you about some of the most important issues that you will face should you be confirmed   For example  the right to privacy   In early writings  you questioned this freedom  calling it a  QUOTE   so called right to privacy   so we expect you to discuss with us your current thinking on this basic question  This past term  the Court decided a ground breaking case concerning the government s power of eminent domain   The Supreme Court held that the government may take private land not only for public use  but also for private development   Public opinion is opposed to this outcome   So  we look forward to hearing your views on this important issue  The Supreme Court s decisions may be most important when they address the breadth of our civil rights   Some people think that your early writings were cavalier in dismissing many civil rights protections   For example  you were active in efforts to narrowly define voting rights protections   And  your narrow interpretation of Congressional power to address civil rights and other important issues while a judge on the D C  Circuit gives some pause   The American people deserve to know how you will approach cases involving voting rights  gender discrimination  violence against women  and affirmative action  among many others     Finally  some speculate that if confirmed you will seek to weaken the separation between church and state   Your critics point to positions you took as a government attorney critical of Supreme Court decisions on prayer in school   So  we need to hear your views about the Establishment Clause of the Constitution as well  Judge Roberts  if confirmed we can expect that you will serve 25 or 30 years as Chief Justice of the United States   You will likely become the most influential Justice of your generation   During these decades  you will help shape the nature of our country and our democracy   It will be your job to give life and meaning to the broad and lofty promises of the Constitution    such essential principles as  due process    equal protection   and  free speech     and to stand up for the rights and civil liberties of the underrepresented and unpopular    Before we decide whether to entrust you with this power  we ask you to stand before the public and explain your views  express our hopes  and expound on your approach to the bedrock principles that guide us as a Nation    We have an obligation to find out where you will take us before we decide whether we want you to lead us there   And  most importantly  you have an obligation to tell us    This would be an appropriate time to share my perspective on how I will judge a nominee   In judging this and other Supreme Court nominations  my test has been judicial excellence  To me  judicial excellence involves four elements  First  a nominee must possess the competence  character  and temperament to serve on the Supreme Court  He or she must have a keen understanding of the law  and the ability to explain it in ways that the American people will understand    Second  judicial excellence means that a Supreme Court Justice must have a sense of the values which form the core of our political and economic system   We have a right to require the nominee to understand and respect our constitutional values    Third  judicial excellence requires a sense of compassion  The law is more than an intellectual game  and more than a mental exercise  As Justice Black said   QUOTE   The Courts stand against any winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless  weak  outnumbered  or because they are non conforming victims of prejudice and public excitement     UNQUOTE  A Supreme Court Justice must understand this  He or she must recognize that real people  with real problems are affected by the decisions rendered by the Court  They must have a connection with and an understanding of the problems that people struggle with on a daily basis  Justice  after all  may be blind  but it should not be deaf   And finally  judicial excellence requires candor before confirmation  We are being asked to give the nominee enormous power  So  we want to know how he or she will exercise this power and how they see the world    and we need and we deserve    to know what is in your mind and in your heart   Judge Roberts  I am convinced that you satisfy the requirements of competence  character and temperament   I enjoyed meeting you a few weeks ago and appreciated our discussion   Your legal talents are undeniably impressive  Yet  while we are now familiar with your abilities  we still know precious little about your legal philosophy and views on the crucial issues you will face on the Supreme Court in the years ahead    So  we look forward to these hearings as an opportunity to learn more and measure whether you meet our test of judicial excellence  Thank you  Mr  Chairman
