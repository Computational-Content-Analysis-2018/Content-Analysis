KOHL LEADS EFFORT TO RESTORE  1 BILLION IN CRIME FIGHTING FUNDING IN SENATE BUDGET                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 17  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL LEADS EFFORT TO RESTORE  1 BILLION IN CRIME FIGHTING FUNDING IN SENATE BUDGET Kohl s amendment would boost Juvenile Justice  COPS  anti drug efforts    WASHINGTON B U S  Senator Herb Kohl today introduced a bipartisan amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution to restore  1 billion in federal funding for a number of successful Department of Justice crime fighting programs that are cut under the President s budget proposal   Kohl s initiative would add  173 million to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention  OJJDP    500 million to the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program   200 million to the COPS program  and  127 million to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area  HIDTA  program  Kohl is working to increase funding for these programs as part of the Senate fiscal year 2006 Budget Resolution  which the Senate is debating this week  Kohl is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee s Subcommittee on Crime  Corrections and Victims Rights and has been a strong supporter of these programs   The downward spiral of juvenile justice and local law enforcement funding is a disturbing budget trend with ugly real world implications  As a result of the Byrne  COPS  Juvenile Justice  and HIDTA programs  we have enjoyed steadily decreasing crime rates for the past decade   But  if we do not  at a minimum  maintain funding for crime fighting  we cannot be surprised if crime again infests our cities  communities  and neighborhoods   Kohl said  The President s reduced budget for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention would result in the elimination of the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Program  JABG  and the slashing of the Title V Delinquency Prevention Program  JABG provides funding for intervention programs that address the urgent needs of juveniles who have had run ins with the law   The JABG program has had success in reducing juvenile crime  In Wisconsin  for instance  the Southern Oaks Girls School  a juvenile detention center outside of Racine  built a new mental health wing to provide much needed counseling services for the girl inmates   The Administrator of this school cites a 56 drop in violent behavior since the new mental services have been offered   Title V is the only federal program solely dedicated to juvenile crime prevention  The President s budget proposal would also provide no funding for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program  which pays for state and local drug task forces  community crime prevention programs  substance abuse treatment programs  prosecution initiatives  and many other local crime control programs   Talk to any police chief or sheriff back in Wisconsin and they will tell you that the Byrne program is the backbone of federal aid for local law enforcement   Kohl said   Do we really want to walk away from a program with more than 30 years of success supporting our local police chiefs  sheriffs  and district attorneys     The COPS program would also be drastically cut under the Administration s budget  Under the President s proposal  popular initiatives like the COPS Universal Hiring Program and the COPS Technology Grants Program would be eliminated  In just the last two years alone  38 law enforcement officers were added in Wisconsin through the COPS program and more than  113 has been awarded to Wisconsin since the program begin in 1993    Almost three years ago  I asked Attorney General Ashcroft him why the COPS program was being cut   He answered that that the COPS program was a  good thing   that it  worked very well  and that it had been one of the  most successful programs  we have ever had   The Senate should heed our former Attorney General s words and restore funding for COPS in our budget   Kohl said  Finally  Kohl would increase funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area  HIDTA    The HIDTA program is a vital collaboration between federal  state and local law enforcement to combat drug trafficking through intelligence gathering and cooperation   This proposed cut in the overall HIDTA program would threaten the future of smaller HIDTAs like a program in Milwaukee that has been extremely successful in stemming crime
