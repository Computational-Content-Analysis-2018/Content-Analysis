INDUSTRIES Senator introduces legislation to block anti competitive mergers  permit U S  legal action against OPEC    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    March 14  2007 Contact  Lynn Becker or Ashley Glacel    202  224 5653 WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Herb Kohl today introduced legislation to direct the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and the U S  Department of Justice  DoJ  to revise antitrust guidelines for the oil industry to block mergers and acquisitions that would reduce competition in the fuel marketplace  Since 1990  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  has counted over 2 600 mergers  acquisitions and joint ventures in the oil and gas industries that have gone unchallenged  Led by gigantic mergers such as Exxon Mobil  BP Arco  Conoco Phillips and Chevron Texaco  by 2004 the five largest U S  oil refining companies controlled over 56  of domestic refining capacity  a greater market share than that controlled by the top ten companies a decade earlier   Kohl s bipartisan legislation  the Oil Industry Merger Antitrust Enforcement Act  will change current guidelines by demanding proof from merging parties that their transaction will not harm competition and allow the FTC and Justice Department to block proposed mergers that do   This merger wave has led to substantially less competition in the oil industry  which have directly caused increases in the price of gasoline   And the grossly inflated profit numbers of the major oil companies     the highest corporate profits ever achieved in U S  history    are conclusive evidence of the lack of competition in the U S  oil industry   Kohl said    In 2004  the GAO concluded that these mergers have directly caused increases in the price of gasoline    A study by the independent consumer watchdog Public Citizen found that in the five years between 1999 and 2004  U S  oil refiners increased their average profits on every gallon of gasoline refined from 22 8 cents to 40 8 cents per gallon  a 79  jump    Kohl s bill directs the FTC and Justice Department to revise its Merger Guidelines to take into account the special conditions prevailing in the oil industry    including the high inelasticity of demand for oil and petroleum related products  the ease of gaining market power  supply and refining capacity limits  difficulties of market entry  and unique regulatory requirements applying to the oil industry    Kohl s legislation will also strengthen antitrust enforcement by shifting the burden of proof in oil industry mergers and acquisitions   In such cases  the burden will be placed on the merging parties to establish  by a preponderance of evidence  that their transaction does not substantially lessen competition   This provision would reverse the usual rule that the government or private plaintiff challenging the merger must prove that the transaction harms competition   This provision does not forbid all mergers in the oil industry    if the merging parties can establish that their merger does not substantially harm competition  it may proceed    However  shifting the burden of proof in this manner will make it more difficult for oil mergers and acquisition to survive court challenge  enhancing the law s ability to block truly anti competitive transactions and deterring companies from even attempting such transactions  Today Kohl also reintroduced his No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act   NOPEC     The legislation will permit the DoJ to bring actions against foreign states    such as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries    for collusive practices in setting the price or production of petroleum products   In addition  it will expressly specify that the doctrines of sovereign immunity and act of state do not exempt nations that participate in oil cartels from basic antitrust law     Throughout the last year  consumers all across the nation have watched gas prices rise to previously unimagined levels    As crude oil prices exceeded forty  then fifty  then sixty dollars a barrel  retail prices of gasoline over three dollars a gallon became commonplace   While prices  temporarily receded for short periods  the general trend was significantly upwards  and rising even today   Gas prices have increased nearly 15   in last month alone   And one fact has remained consistent    any move downward in price would end as soon as OPEC decided to cut production    Such blatantly anti competitive conduct by the oil cartel violates the most basic principles of fair competition and free markets and should not be tolerated   Kohl said  In 1979  a federal district court found that OPEC s price fixing decisions were  governmental     not  commercial     acts and accordingly they were protected by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act   Subsequently  in 1981  a federal court of appeals declined to consider the appeal of that antitrust case based on the so called  act of state  doctrine  which holds that a court will not consider a case regarding the legality of the acts of a foreign nation    NOPEC effectively reverses these decisions by making it clear that OPEC s activities are not protected by sovereign immunity and that the federal courts should not decline to hear such a case based on the  act of state  doctrine   It clears away these judicially created roadblocks so the DoJ could bring an antitrust case against OPEC for its price fixing behavior
