KOHL SPONSORED AMENDMENT BLOCKS DRASTIC CUTS TO MEDICAID                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 17  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL SPONSORED AMENDMENT BLOCKS DRASTIC CUTS TO MEDICAID      WASHINGTON  D C     Applauding colleagues on both sides of aisle  Senator Kohl  D WI  today commended the Senate s agreement to stop a proposed  15 billion cut to Medicaid  the state federal health insurance program for low income families and the elderly  by passing an amendment to the budget which he cosponsored   Today is a prime example of what we can accomplish  the difference we can make in people s lives  when we just work together   said Kohl   Stopping these drastic cuts will ensure that thousands of poor families  disabled Americans and the elderly get proper medical care  Fifty three million people depend on Medicaid and today  the Senate stood up for them   The proposed  15 billion cut to Medicaid would have translated to a loss of  300 million for Wisconsin   It would be extremely difficult for Wisconsin and other states to absorb a cut of this magnitude while continuing to provide the level of services 53 million Americans depend on   Recent studies by the Urban Institute and the Kaiser Family Foundation show that Medicaid spends less  per patient  than private health insurance plans and that its costs have grown more slowly in the last four years than private sector insurance premiums  Kohl said that there should be a thorough discussion about how Medicaid can work better to serve low income Americans and that it is unacceptable to force arbitrary cuts in Medicaid without first taking the time to consider the future efficiency and operation of the Medicaid program  stressing that any changes to the program should be driven by informed  reasoned policy and not by arbitrary budget targets  The amendment  introduced by Senators Smith  R OR  and Bingaman  D NM   passed the U S  Senate by a 52 48 vote and will erase language in the budget requiring the Senate Finance Committee to find five year savings of  15 billion in legislation later this year
