Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl in Opposition to the Military Commissions Bill                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    September 28  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl in Opposition to the Military Commissions Bill     There is no question that we need the tools to fight terrorism at home and abroad so that we can bring to justice those responsible for innocent bloodshed   But this bill jeopardizes the safety of our own men and women in uniform by disregarding the basic protections guaranteed by the Geneva Conventions and encouraging other countries to violate them when holding our soldiers captive   Under this bill  the President is allowed to lock up anyone  forever and without trial  merely by declaring them an enemy combatant   It unconstitutionally strips the right of most detainees to ever challenge their imprisonment   And it allows tribunals to convict people with evidence gained through coercion and cruel treatment   This bill runs contrary to our history of humane justice
