KOHL CALLS ON THE GOVERNMENT TO CREATE A  STRATEGIC REFINERY RESERVE                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    November 7  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL CALLS ON THE GOVERNMENT TO CREATE A  STRATEGIC REFINERY RESERVE  Kohl Proposal will Increase Supply and Lower Cost of Fuel      Washington  DC  In response to rising energy prices  U S  Senator Herb Kohl today called on the federal government to build an oil refinery to produce petroleum products for the government s use and for the private market in times of tight supply and high prices  Kohl s proposal would authorize the Department of Energy to build enough refining capacity to meet the energy needs of the federal government    primarily the Department of Defense    and to supply the private market in times of shortages and price spikes  Sen  Kohl offered his Strategic Refining Reserve Amendment to the Defense Authorization bill           In a letter to colleagues seeking their support  Kohl  who was joined by Senator Jim Jeffords  I VT   stated the reasons for his proposal   Americans deserve better than another week of finger pointing and grandstanding over the price of gas    they deserve better than more excuses and rationalizations for an oil industry raking in record profits   They deserve a concrete response to the soaring energy prices that threaten our national and economic security           Kohl s proposal would authorize the Secretary of Energy to build refining capacity to supply the government s own needs  as well as add to strategic stockpiles to increase the supply of refined petroleum products available  lower and stabilize prices and ensure an adequate supply of fuel in the event of future natural disasters or increased demand  Current fuel shortages have led to price spikes felt across the nation  During the 1980 s and 1990 s there were significant refined oil reserve capacity   However since 1981  when 324 refineries existed with a capacity of 18 million barrels per day  refinery and reserve capacities have shrunk dramatically  Today there are a mere 149 refineries in the U S  with a capacity of 16 9 million barrels per day  desperately low to meet growing demand   On November 9th the Energy and Natural Resources Committee will hold a hearing with top executives from the oil industry to defend their record profits this year  Below is the text of the Kohl letter  Dear Colleague   As families and businesses face another week of sky high energy prices  we ask your support for an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that would increase the supply and decrease the cost of energy   Americans deserve better than another week of finger pointing and grandstanding over the price of gas    they deserve better than more excuses and rationalizations for an oil industry raking in record profits   They deserve a concrete response to the soaring energy prices that threaten our national and economic security    Our amendment would direct the Department of Energy  in concert with the Department of Defense  to build a refinery to produce petroleum products for the federal government  particularly the military   In case of a supply disruption caused by a disaster like Hurricane Katrina or Rita  our  Strategic Refinery Reserve  could refine oil for the private market  keeping the supply of gas steady and its price down  There is little argument that diminished refining capacity in the United States is the primary cause of the energy price explosions we have experienced in the last months   No new oil refinery has been built in the United States since the 1970 s   In fact  in 1981  there were 324 refineries in the United States  today  there are 149    Though demand is growing at a rate of about 2  a year    and though Congress just passed an energy bill that provided numerous new incentives to those willing to invest in new refineries    the oil companies have shown little interest in dipping into their profits to build up refining capacity for the future   That is their choice in a free market  But it is also our choice here in Congress    and our responsibility    to look after more than just the bottom line of oil company stockholders   By building our own refinery to meet the needs of the federal government  we are acting on behalf of   Our National Security  The Strategic Refinery Reserve will ensure our military has a steady supply of fuel available at a predictable cost from an American source   Taxpayers  The federal government    the Armed Services as well as civilian operations like the postal service and NASA    pays the same price at the pump as the average consumer  And when the refining capacity shortage pushes prices up  as it is doing right now  those extra dollars flowing into oil company profits are taxpayer dollars   Our amendment would ensure that the government    and the taxpayer    only has to cover the actual cost of delivering refined petroleum products   Families and Businesses   The Strategic Refinery Reserve would have a refining capacity of 5  of total U S  consumption  2  of that would go to the Federal Government    taking those buyers out of the market and freeing up supply for consumers   The remaining 3  capacity would be held in reserve  ready to increase supply in the private market should prices start to rise as they have these last few months   Our economy  our military  our communities and our families are struggling under the burden of volatile energy prices   They don t need any more hearings or excuses   They expect us to act concretely to bring energy prices down   Our amendment would do that  and we ask for your support
