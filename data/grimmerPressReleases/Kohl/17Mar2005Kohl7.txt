DEWINE  KOHL ANNOUNCE ANTITRUST SUBCOMMITTEE AGENDA FOR 2005                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 17  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        DEWINE  KOHL ANNOUNCE ANTITRUST SUBCOMMITTEE AGENDA FOR 2005 Today the Judiciary Committee Adopted the Official Subcommittee Designations and Membership  and Senator DeWine and Kohl are Once Again Chair and Ranking Member on Antitrust Subcommittee    U S  Senator Mike DeWine  R OH   Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust  Competition Policy  and Consumer Rights  and Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Ranking Member  have announced an active agenda of hearings and legislation for 2005     I take pride in the bipartisan manner in which Senator Kohl and I have operated the Antitrust Subcommittee in the past and will continue to operate it in the future   Senator DeWine said    We both firmly believe that antitrust enforcement must remain a vital feature of our nation s economic landscape   This Subcommittee will continue to act vigorously to assure that antitrust enforcement works to protect American consumers  both through its oversight of the antitrust enforcement agencies and through its own hearings and investigations into mergers and other activities that could potentially harm consumers and competition    Senator DeWine and I have worked to strike a fair balance between the need to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws and to respect the achievements of our nation s key industries to ensure that competition flourishes and consumers are protected   Senator Kohl said   I have been proud of the strong and constructive bipartisanship on this Subcommittee  and I expect that this tradition of antitrust oversight will continue into the new Congress during 2005 and beyond   During the past eight years  under the strong bipartisan leadership of Senators DeWine and Kohl  the Subcommittee has taken an aggressive role to promote competition and to protect the American consumer throughout many key sectors of the nation s economy   The Subcommittee has conducted more than 40 hearings to examine competition in numerous important industries  including health care and hospital group purchasing  media and telecommunications  the airline industry  the computer software industry  and gasoline and energy  and agriculture   In addition  last year Senators DeWine and Kohl were the co sponsors of one of the most significant antitrust reform measures in more than twenty five years  legislation which substantially increased criminal fines and jail time for antitrust violations and enhanced the ability of federal courts to review antitrust settlements to ensure they are in the public interest  In 2005  the Subcommittee plans to address the following issues              Telecommunications We plan to hold a hearing in April to examine the rapid consolidation in the telecommunications industry   The recently announced mergers between SBC AT and Verizon MCI recreates  in part  the old Bell system and will remove two important competitors in both national and local service markets   We have already begun to scrutinize these proposals very carefully by taking a leading role in the Judiciary Committee s examination of the mergers   Likewise  the recently announced Sprint Nextel merger comes on the heels of the Cingular AT Wireless merger  and is another step in the increased consolidation of the up to now robust wireless market   If approved  this deal will reduce the number of national wireless providers to four   Given this increased level of consolidation in the telecommunications industry we plan to closely review how these mergers will affect competition in the telecommunications market   We plan to follow the March hearing at the Judiciary Committee examining these mergers with a follow up hearing in April at the Antitrust Subcommittee   Also  we plan to actively participate in any effort to revise the Telecommunications Act and will advocate that any proposed changes to the Act promote competition in the telecom market               Media In this era of continued consolidation in the media sector  the Subcommittee will continue to focus on competitive conditions in this vital industry  We will continue to examine the effects of media consolidation on the marketplace of ideas  on diversity of ownership in the media  and on the ability of independent content producers to distribute their products   We will work to preserve and protect competition  diversity  and localism in media   We will also continue to emphasize bringing increased competition to the cable television market  by such means as monitoring program access issues and ensuring that competitors to incumbent cable companies are not subject to predatory conduct    We requested a study from the Government Accountability Officewhich is scheduled to be released shortlyon the extent to which satellite TV is competing with cable TV   The Subcommittee will examine this report closely when it is released            Health Care Industry The Subcommittee will continue its work to ensure that hospital group purchasing organizations   GPOs   operate as intendedmaking sure they do not harm competition and innovation in the markets for medical devices but instead lower costs for hospitals  medical caregivers  and patients   The Subcommittee s hearings and investigatory and oversight efforts into this issue since 2002 have resulted in the nation s leading GPOs agreeing to voluntary reforms to their business practices   The Subcommittee has been following this achievement by examining closely how the GPOs implement these reforms    In the upcoming Congress  the Subcommittee also expects to promote measures to ensure that these voluntary reforms are made permanent and enforceable  either by legislation or by implementation of a robust industry wide enforcement mechanism    The Subcommittee s continued goal is to ensure that GPO practices result in America s hospitals  medical caregivers  and patients obtaining the best possible medical equipment and supplies at the best possible prices              Gasoline and Oil Markets In this time of skyrocketing prices for crude oil and gasoline  the Subcommittee will focus on bringing increased competition to the oil industry as a means of restraining energy price increases   Senators DeWine and Kohl have already reintroduced this Congress the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act or  NOPEC    NOPEC would strip nations that participate in the OPEC oil cartel of the protections of sovereign immunity and make them subject to U S  antitrust law   Our other efforts will include monitoring and encouraging the Federal Trade Commission s efforts to observe and track changes in gasoline prices in order to uncover any potentially anticompetitive behavior             International Markets The Subcommittee plans to hold a hearing on how U S  multinational companies have been affected by different antitrust regimes in different countries   Complying with the antitrust laws of different countries  which often have different substantive or procedural rules  is increasingly becoming a burden on U S  businesses and thus merits review by the Subcommittee   The Subcommittee will continue to work closely with the European Commission s Directorate General for Competition  and its newly appointed Competition Commissioner  to ensure that American companies are treated fairly and in a non discriminatory fashion when their transactions and activities are reviewed by the European Commission   EC     The Subcommittee will also continue to encourage the EC and other international antitrust enforcement agencies to focus their investigations on harm to consumers by using sound economic analyses  and to cooperate with U S  authorities to the maximum extent possible in order to harmonize the competition law principles they apply               Strengthening Criminal Enforcement  We plan to strengthen the Department of Justice s ability to prosecute cartel and bid rigging conspiracies by advancing our legislation that would authorize the Department to seek a wiretap order from a federal judge under normal criminal law standards during the course of investigating a criminal antitrust conspiracy
