NEARLY ONE THIRD OF SENATE SPONSORS KOHL S MILC EXTENSION BILL                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 3  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        NEARLY ONE THIRD OF SENATE SPONSORS KOHL S MILC EXTENSION BILL Senator introduces legislation today to extend milk price safety net that brought  414 million to Wisconsin dairy farmers       WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Kohl today introduced legislation to extend the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program with the bipartisan support of nearly one third of the Senate behind his bill   Moreover  Kohl has lined up support from Senators in regions that have historically feuded over national dairy policy  including New Englanders and Southerners   Kohl s bill would extend the MILC program  a countercyclical program that serves as a safety net to dairy farmers when milk prices plummet  for two years to coincide with the duration of other Farm Bill programs   The program provided  414 million to Wisconsin dairy farmers when milk prices dropped to record lows over the past three years   Kohl has been fighting to extend the program  which expires in September  and   gained a pledge of support from President George W  Bush in his remarks during a campaign visit to Wausau last year   The President submits his budget to Congress on Monday  and Kohl is hopeful that the MILC extension will be included      We have come a long way in a short time from the painful battles over national dairy policy that pit one group of dairymen against another   Kohl said    As the Senate s wide bipartisan support of this bill shows  the MILC program has been a remarkable success   Now we need the President s continued support and determination to persuade the House of Representatives  which blocked the program last year  to follow suit         Kohl helped establish the MILC program to end regional fighting over federal milk pricing policies and as an alternative to the Northeast Dairy Compact he helped defeat   The program was included in the 2002 Farm Bill  however without an extension the MILC program expires two years before other farm support programs  leaving family sized dairy operations without a meaningful safety net        In addition to the 28 original Senate sponsors of the bill  the MILC extension is supported by sixteen governors including the governors of Wisconsin  Minnesota  Virginia  Vermont  Missouri  North Carolina  Pennsylvania  Idaho  Maine  Iowa  Michigan  New York  South Dakota  Ohio  Louisiana and North Dakota        Kohl has already discussed the need to extend the MILC program with the new Secretary of Agriculture  Mike Johanns  and members of the Senate Appropriations Committee  on which Kohl serves       Kohl said he is hopeful that the President s budget will include the MILC extension when it is submitted to Congress on Monday  but noted that the budget resolution is only a framework for further discussion   It will take continued effort from both Congress and the Administration to see that the extension is translated into law
