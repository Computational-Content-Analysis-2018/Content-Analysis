KOHL DIRECTS  7 MILLION TO TRUAX FIELD IN MADISON                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    June 14  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL DIRECTS  7 MILLION TO TRUAX FIELD IN MADISON     WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Herb Kohl announced today that he directed  7 million  toward a new Air National Guard rescue station at Truax Field in Madison as part of the Senate s FY2008 Military Construction Appropriations Bill   Kohl is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  which approved the bill today  and had identified this project as a priority for funding            Facility improvements for the 115th Fighter Wing are now long overdue   Kohl said   After September 11th  the men and women of the Air National Guard based at Truax were asked to shoulder a greater burden of our homeland security and they ve risen to that challenge  but have done so without the proper equipment at their outdated facility  This funding is an important first step in addressing their pressing needs   The new fire crash rescue facility will provide the required 23 500 square feet of space replacing the existing 9 300 square foot facility   The current facility is 40  below the required square footage and is failing to provide adequate crew space and decontamination areas   Since 9 11 the F 16 s of the 115th Fighter Wing have been a part of Operation Noble Eagle  and the 24 hour watch requirements of the mission have put a great strain on the current facility   Added staff doesn t have the needed space  and the building was not built to accommodate women   The 115th also lacks enough space to park all of their vehicles inside the building  increasing the wear and tear on trucks parked outside during the Wisconsin winter   The building the 115th uses now is in violation of many state building and occupancy codes  as well as Air Force and National Fire Protection Association regulations   This funding is necessary to protect the pilots and airmen of the 115th as well as the local community that lives near the airport   Kohl fought for and won support for the Truax Field expansion during last year s appropriations debate  however  the bill was never reported out of the joint Senate House of Representatives conference committee  The FY2008 Military Construction Appropriations bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration
