KOHL  FEINGOLD INTRODUCE BILL TO EXTEND SSI BENEFITS FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED REFUGEES                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 17  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL  FEINGOLD INTRODUCE BILL TO EXTEND SSI BENEFITS FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED REFUGEES Senators  bill would also restore Supplemental Security Income benefits to those who have recently lost them    WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold today introduced the SSI Extension for Disabled and Elderly Refugees Act  bipartisan legislation to extend the deadline for U S  citizenship requirement for Supplemental Security Income  SSI  from seven to nine years   The bill also includes a provision to restore benefits to those legal immigrants who have recently lost their benefits because of the seven year limit  Under current law  there is a seven year time limit on SSI benefits    a basic monthly income for the elderly  blind or disabled    for legal humanitarian immigrants who are not U S  citizens   A refugee must reside in the U S  for five years as a lawful permanent resident before beginning the lengthy citizenship process  which often proves overwhelming      So many of our refugees are trapped in the naturalization process and  as a result  have lost the SSI benefits that provide them with the basic resources to live  Many more will soon lose those benefits   Kohl said   These refugees include Hmong living in Wisconsin who fought on our side during the Vietnam War  We owe it to them to pass this extension so they can have the basic financial resources they depend on    It is my sincere hope that this bill will be taken up and passed quickly  since time is of the essence for this population   Feingold said    Many of the Hmong risked their lives to help the United States and I believe that the U S  government should do all it can to provide for them in their time of need    The 1996 welfare law included a seven year time limit on SSI benefits for legal humanitarian immigrants   In order to avoid losing this important support  refugees and asylees must become citizens within the seven year limit   Unfortunately  there are many barriers in the application for citizenship among elderly Hmong refugees in Wisconsin  including language difficulties  which put them at risk for losing SSI benefits   And beyond that  there are processing and bureaucratic delays within the various agencies  which an immigrant must overcome before they become naturalized    The President s recent budget proposal includes a one year extension for the citizenship requirement  Kohl and Feingold said that was a good first step  but still seek a longer term solution to the issue   The SSI Extension for Disabled and Elderly Refugees Act is cosponsored by Senators Gordon Smith  R OR   Sam Brownback  R KS   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ   Joe Lieberman  D CT   and Richard Lugar  R IN
