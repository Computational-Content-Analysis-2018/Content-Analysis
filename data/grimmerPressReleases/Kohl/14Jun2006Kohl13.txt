STATEMENT OF SENATOR HERB KOHL ON RECONSIDERING OUR COMMUNICATIONS LAWS AND ENSURING COMPETITION AND INNOVATION                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    June 14  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        STATEMENT OF SENATOR HERB KOHL ON RECONSIDERING OUR COMMUNICATIONS LAWS AND ENSURING COMPETITION AND INNOVATION     Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for holding this hearing today    Besides food and energy  perhaps no industry is as important to millions of American consumers as telecommunications    From making a phone call  to watching television  to using the internet  the telecommunications industry touches every American dozens of times every day    And we all depend on choice and competition to deliver these services at the lowest possible price and at the best possible quality   We have today reached a pivotal point in the telecommunications industry  and the policies we adopt will affect competition in this crucial industry for years to come   Many industry critics believe that the enormous gains in innovation and competition we have all seen are now threatened by the emergence of a few dominant telecom companies     As we revise our telecom laws  our Committee    as the guardian of antitrust law and competition policy    has a central role to play  and so I commend you  Mr  Chairman  for placing these crucial issues on the forefront of our agenda   We can start by ensuring that our antitrust enforcement agencies are at full strength to protect competition in the telecom industry    Under current law  the Federal Trade Commission is prevented from exercising any jurisdiction over telecom  common carriers     This common carrier exemption should be repealed so that the FTC can protect consumers from unfair methods of competition in this industry as in any other   Another crucial issue that we must consider is  net neutrality    Many fear that the relatively few large phone and cable companies that provide high speed internet access for millions of consumers could become the gatekeepers with respect to internet content      We must ensure that consumers have unfettered access to all internet content free from discrimination   And we must prevent broadband providers from being able to determine winners and losers on the information superhighway    At the same time  broadband providers need to be able to manage their networks so that the profusion of video content does not degrade the internet experience for everyone     Roadblocks to video competition also need to be addressed     The deployment of video services by the phone companies brings the prospect of much needed competition for video  but the requirement of obtaining literally thousands of local franchises threatens to seriously retard this promising development    We must ensure that local franchise requirements are not a barrier to competition  while at the same time respecting the role of states and municipalities    Also central is the existence of robust program access law  so that these new competitors have access to the  must have  programming necessary to compete     In sum  consumers have benefited from an abundance of new technologies and new choices over the last 25 years   Yet today s wave of telecom consolidation means that we must be wary that new dominant providers do not stifle competition and harm consumers    We must do everything we can to ensure that competition in telecom does not go the way of the rotary telephone and the telegram
