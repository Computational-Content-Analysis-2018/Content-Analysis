KOHL S BILL TO CRACK DOWN ON OIL   GAS INDUSTRIES PASSED BY SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    April 27  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL S BILL TO CRACK DOWN ON OIL   GAS INDUSTRIES PASSED BY SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE Bipartisan bill will change antitrust laws to give government tools to combat anti competitive conduct in the oil   gas industries    WASHINGTON    The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved legislation sponsored by U S  Senator Herb Kohl to give the federal government more tools to go after anti competitive conduct in the oil and gas industry   The bipartisan Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006 will make several important and overdue reforms to U S  antitrust laws   Kohl is the senior Democrat on the Senate Antitrust  Competition Policy and Consumer Rights  and the bill s chief cosponsor is Sen  Arlen Specter  R PA   the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee   Last month  the Presidents and CEOs of six major American oil companies testified before the Judiciary Committee during a hearing on consolidation in the oil and gas industries   While consumers pay rapidly rising prices for gasoline and home heating fuel  the oil industry continues to report record profits    like ExxonMobil s  36 billion last year  the  400 million retirement package given the company s departing CEO  and the  8 4 billion in first quarter profits it reported today    I m glad the Committee moved so quickly to consider this legislation  While it is true that the world price of crude oil has substantially increased  the fact that the oil companies can so easily pass along all of these price increases to consumers   and compound their profits along the way   demonstrates that there is a failure of competition in our oil and gas markets  and a failure of antitrust enforcement   Kohl said   The Kohl Specter bill has five elements  each essential to strengthening antitrust enforcement in the petroleum industry     It contains two important changes to existing antitrust law    First  it will amend the Clayton Act to prohibit withholding supplies of petroleum  gasoline or any other fuel for the primary purpose of increasing prices or creating a shortage    This provision will prevent oil producers and refiners from limiting supply to manipulate price   Second  it incorporates Kohl s bill to make the actions of the OPEC oil cartel subject to U S  antitrust law   This provision will  for the first time  establish clearly and plainly that when a group of competing oil producers like the OPEC nations act together to restrict supply or set prices  they are violating U S  law   This provision will authorize the Attorney General to file suit under the antitrust laws for redress  and will remove the protections of sovereign immunity and the act of state doctrine from nations that participate in the oil cartel   The Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006 also will direct that the antitrust enforcement agencies undertake several important actions to promote competition   First  the bill will direct that the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission conduct a study  and report their findings to Congress in nine months  as to whether the Clayton Act needs to be amended to ensure that mergers which truly lessen competition in the petroleum industry are prohibited    Second  the bill directs a study by the Government Accountability Office to be completed within six months to examine whether the consent decrees and divestitures obtained by the Justice Department or FTC in the oil industry have been effective in protecting competition    The Attorney General and FTC are directed to consider additional action require to restore competition upon completion of this report     Finally  the bill directs that the Attorney General and FTC Chairman establish a joint federal state task force to investigate information sharing among companies producing  refining  or marketing petroleum  gasoline or any other refined product    Kohl is also the author of legislation to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish and operate a strategic refining reserve and to authorize him to stop the exportation of gasoline and home heating oil when he supply falls short at home
