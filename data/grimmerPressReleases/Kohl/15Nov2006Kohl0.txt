SENATE APPROVES KOHL S REQUEST FOR  7 MILLION FOR TRUAX FIELD IN MADISON                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    November 15  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        SENATE APPROVES KOHL S REQUEST FOR  7 MILLION FOR TRUAX FIELD IN MADISON     WASHINGTON  DC    The U S  Senate last night approved Sen  Herb Kohl s request for  7 million toward a new Air National Guard rescue station at Truax Field in Madison as part of the Senate s FY2007 Military Construction Appropriations Bill   Kohl is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and had identified this project as a priority for funding            The demands on the men and women who serve out of Truax Field have risen sharply in a few short years  and the facility hasn t kept pace   They need a major overhaul to bring the facility up to code  and to provide more space for personnel and additional areas to shelter expensive equipment   I m pleased that the Senate recognized the need for this investment in Truax Field   Kohl said  The new fire crash rescue facility will provide the required 23 500 square feet of space replacing the existing 9 300 square foot facility   The current facility is 40  below the required square footage and is failing to provide adequate crew space and decontamination areas   Since 9 11 the F 16 s of the 115th Fighter Wing have been a part of Operation Noble Eagle  and the 24 hour watch requirements of the mission have put a great strain on the current facility   Added staff doesn t have the needed space  and the building was not built to accommodate women   The 115th also lacks enough space to park all of their vehicles inside the building  increasing the wear and tear on trucks parked outside during the Wisconsin winter   The building the 115th uses now is in violation of many state building and occupancy codes  as well as Air Force and National Fire Protection Association regulations   This funding is necessary to protect the pilots and airmen of the 115th as well as the local community that lives near the airport
