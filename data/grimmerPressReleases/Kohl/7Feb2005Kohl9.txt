PRESIDENT S BUDGET REQUEST INCLUDES TWO YEAR EXTENSION FOR KOHL S MILC PROGRAM                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 7  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        PRESIDENT S BUDGET REQUEST INCLUDES TWO YEAR EXTENSION FOR KOHL S MILC PROGRAM Senator introduced legislation last week to extend milk price safety net that brought  414 million to Wisconsin dairy farmers    WASHINGTON    President Bush s budget  which he submitted to Congress today  includes a two year extension for U S  Senator Herb Kohl s Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program  Last week  Kohl introduced a bill    with multi regional and bipartisan support    that would extend the MILC program  a countercyclical program that serves as a safety net to dairy farmers when milk prices plummet  for two years to coincide with the duration of other Farm Bill programs   The program provided  414 million to Wisconsin dairy farmers when milk prices dropped to record lows over the past three years   Kohl has been fighting to extend the program  which expires in September  and gained a pledge of support from President Bush in his remarks during a campaign visit to Wausau last year     This is an encouraging step  and I m pleased the President has joined me and our bipartisan and multi regional coalition to support an extension of this successful program   Kohl said   The President s budget proposal is  of course  the first step in a long budget process  It will take a continued effort in the months ahead  from the Administration and Congress  to ensure that our dairy farmers continue to have this meaningful safety net   Kohl helped establish the MILC program to end regional fighting over federal milk pricing policies and as an alternative to the Northeast Dairy Compact he helped defeat   The program was included in the 2002 Farm Bill  however without an extension the MILC program expires two years before other farm support programs  leaving family sized dairy operations without a meaningful safety net  While MILC would be extended for two years under the President s budget  the program  would also be subject to a general  U S  Department of Agriculture wide 5 percent across the board cut in direct payments to farmers under price support systems  Kohl said he would not support scaling back the MILC program by 5 percent
