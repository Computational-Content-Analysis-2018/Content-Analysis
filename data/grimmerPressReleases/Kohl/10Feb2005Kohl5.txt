PRESIDENT S BUDGET INCLUDES EXTENSION OF SSI BENFITS FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED REFUGEES  KOHL AND FEINGOLD ANNOUNCE                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 10  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        PRESIDENT S BUDGET INCLUDES EXTENSION OF SSI BENFITS FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED REFUGEES  KOHL AND FEINGOLD ANNOUNCE Current seven year time limit puts Wisconsin s elderly Hmong refugees at risk of losing Supplemental Security Income    WASHINGTON    Washington  D C     A week after U S  Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold urged him to do so  President Bush included a provision in his budget proposal to extend for one year Supplemental Security Income  SSI  benefits for refugees  including the Hmong  Last week  Kohl  Feingold and a bipartisan group of Senators asked the administration to include a provision in the fiscal year 2006 budget that would protect elderly and disabled refugees from losing their SSI benefits   The President s budget proposal is the first step in the budget process  and Congress still must approve the extension   I m encouraged to see the Administration recognize the seriousness of the situation  and the need to help the most vulnerable legal immigrants   While the President s budget includes a short term extension  I believe we can and should do more  I remain hopeful that this is just the first step in correcting the unjust flaw in the system   Kohl said    I am pleased that  by putting this benefit extension in his budget proposal  the President recognized how critical the situation is for many elderly refugees   Feingold said    Now the Congress must act to extend the resources that these immigrants and their families  including Hmong refugees who risked their lives to help this country during the Vietnam War  depend on   A country grateful for the service of these refugees should do what it can to help them as they continue the process of becoming American citizens   Each month  a growing number of individuals lose their eligibility for SSI benefits  That s because under the 1996 welfare law there is a seven year time limit on SSI benefits    a basic monthly income for the elderly  blind or disabled    for legal humanitarian immigrants who are not U S  citizens   In 2003  elderly and disabled refugees began losing their SSI benefits  and the Social Security Administration estimates that tens of thousands more will be affected  If benefits are extended  refugees and other humanitarian immigrants would be eligible for SSI benefits for eight years  This extra year would provide more time for refugees to become citizens before losing their benefits  Many Hmong currently have applications for citizenship pending  and have been waiting for over two years for their applications to be processed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and now the Department of Homeland Security  Others are suffering from serious mental or physical disabilities that prevent them from completing the requirements necessary to obtain citizenship  Last year Kohl and Sen  Gordon Smith  R OR   along with Feingold  introduced the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act   In the letter sent last week to the President  the Senators pledged to Bush that they would work with the Administration throughout the year to ensure that an extension passes Congress
