KOHL INITIATIVE TO REDUCE GAS PRICES PASSED BY HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    May 22  2007     Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL INITIATIVE TO REDUCE GAS PRICES PASSED BY HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Senator s Legislation Will Permit U S  Legal Action Against OPEC    WASHINGTON    Legislation to permit the Department of Justice to bring actions against foreign states    such as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC     for collusive practices in setting the price or production of petroleum products was approved by the U S  House of Representatives today by a vote of 345 to 72  U S  Senator Herb Kohl is the author of the  No Oil Producing   Exporting Cartels Act of 2007  NOPEC    which was unanimously approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 25th  the House version of Kohl s bill was sponsored by Rep  John Conyers  D MI     This legislation is about accountability  OPEC has an unfettered ability to manipulate the price of oil  and each time they hike the price it creates a ripple in our economy  This bill gives our government the leverage it needs to persuade OPEC to compete fairly or to be held accountable   Kohl said  In 1979  a federal district court found that OPEC s price fixing decisions were  governmental     not  commercial     acts and accordingly they were protected by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act  Subsequently  in 1981  a federal court of appeals declined to consider the appeal of that antitrust case based on the so called  act of state  doctrine  which holds that a court will not consider a case regarding the legality of the acts of a foreign nation   Kohl s bipartisan NOPEC legislation effectively reverses these decisions by making it clear that OPEC s activities are not protected by sovereign immunity and that the federal courts should not decline to hear such a case based on the  act of state  doctrine  It clears away these judicially created roadblocks so the Department of Justice could bring an antitrust case against OPEC for its price fixing behavior   The legislation would force OPEC to begin pricing in a competitive  free market manner or face the possibility of being prosecuted for civil or criminal antitrust violations   NOPEC was passed by the Senate on June 21  2005 as part of the Energy Bill  which subsequently died in a House Senate conference  Kohl said that he will offer the bill as an amendment to the next appropriate legislative vehicle brought before the Senate for debate  Kohl s legislation is cosponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy  D VT   Arlen Specter  R PA   Russ Feingold  D WI   Chuck Grassley  R IA   Charles Schumer  D NY   Tom Coburn  R OK   Richard Durbin  D IL   Olympia Snowe  R ME   Carl Levin  D MI   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Bernie Sanders  I VT  and Joe Lieberman  i CT
