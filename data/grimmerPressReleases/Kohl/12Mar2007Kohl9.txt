KOHL EXAMINES FOOD SAFETY DURING CONGRESSIONAL HEARING IN WISCONSIN                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 12  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL EXAMINES FOOD SAFETY DURING CONGRESSIONAL HEARING IN WISCONSIN FDA Officials will Consider New Rapid Response Teams  Additional Research to Prevent and Contain Contamination Outbreaks      VERONA  WI    U S  Senator Herb Kohl today held a Congressional hearing in Wisconsin to examine the issue of food safety and called for additional research and rapid response teams to help prevent and contain contamination of produce   The Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   Dr  Andrew von Eschenbach  and the Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition  Dr  Robert Brackett  testified at today s hearing   Kohl also heard from representatives of produce growers and processors  grocers  and food safety scientists to review the pipeline from field to table   During the e  coli outbreak caused by spinach last fall  more people in Wisconsin became ill than in any other state  Sen  Kohl  as chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee  has jurisdiction over the FDA and USDA  the two places in government charged with keeping the food supply safe   At the hearing  Kohl noted that    between 1998 and 2004  outbreaks in produce have almost doubled   Since 1990  there have been almost 650 outbreaks caused by produce  and over 30 000 people have gotten sick   He said the last six months have been particularly troublesome   In September  200 people got sick  including 49 in Wisconsin   and 3 died from E  coli in spinach   Also in September  almost 200 people got salmonella from tomatoes   In late November and early December we had two separate E  coli outbreaks from lettuce   71 people were afflicted in the Northeast   And 81 in Minnesota  Iowa and Wisconsin   A few weeks ago  FDA recalled cantaloupes because of salmonella  And we are still in the middle of the peanut butter recall because of salmonella which was first detected in August of 2006  Kohl also pointed out that     In 2003  there were 870 food inspectors at the FDA  In 2006  there were 640   The FDA lost 230 inspectors in less than 4 years  and food inspections dropped nearly in half during that time   Safety tests for food produced in the United States have dropped by nearly 75 percent   And even though some 20 to 30  of our fruits and vegetables are imported   less than one percent are inspected by the FDA   There are  without a doubt  some complex factors involved   We have growing imports of fruits and vegetables   Produce is moving further and faster than it was a decade or two ago   We don t have inspectors in every processing plant   We have growing consumption    And lots of fruits and vegetables are eaten raw   Some of these trends have been very good for consumers   Kohl said    But when it comes to safety  it means we have a bigger hill to climb   Logic tells us that this hill will be easier to climb if there is collaboration  cooperation and coordination   But the patience of the American people is not unlimited   And neither is mine   So I hope we will seize this opportunity to make a difference   One approach Kohl supports is the creation of Rapid Response Teams within the FDA  groups of scientists assigned regionally to be on the ground in case of an outbreak   These teams would be able to provide field tests more quickly to help isolate  diagnose and contain food contamination outbreaks   During the remainder of time  the teams would travel to be on site at farms to conduct preventive tests and ensure that food safety guidelines are being followed   Kohl said he would support additional funding for FDA to implement the Rapid Response Teams
