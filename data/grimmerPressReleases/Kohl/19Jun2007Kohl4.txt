SENATE APPROVES KOHL S  NOPEC  INITIATIVE TO REDUCE GAS PRICES                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    June 19  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        SENATE APPROVES KOHL S  NOPEC  INITIATIVE TO REDUCE GAS PRICES Senator s Legislation Will Permit U S  Legal Action Against OPEC     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Herb Kohl s legislation to permit the Department of Justice to bring actions against foreign states    such as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC     for collusive practices in setting the price or limiting the production of oil was overwhelmingly approved by the U S  Senate today by a vote of 70 to 23    Kohl is the author of the  No Oil Producing   Exporting Cartels Act of 2007  NOPEC    which also won approval in the House of Representatives by a vote of 345 to 72 on May 22nd    Kohl offered his legislation as an amendment to the Energy Bill  which is being debated in the Senate this week   For years  this price fixing conspiracy of OPEC nations has unfairly driven up the cost of imported crude oil to satisfy the greed of the oil exporters     We have long decried OPEC  but  sadly  no one in government has yet tried to take any action   Our amendment will  for the first time  establish clearly and plainly that when a group of competing oil producers like the OPEC nations act together to restrict supply or set prices  they are violating U S  law   Kohl said   The Federal Trade Commission has estimated that 85  of the variability in the cost of gasoline is the result of changes in the cost of crude oil   As crude oil prices exceeded  40  then  50 and then  60 per barrel  retail prices of gasoline over  3 00 per gallon have now become commonplace   While prices have temporarily receded from time to time  the general trend is consistently  and significantly  upwards     Gas prices have now increased 71 cents per gallon just since the start of the year to a national average of  3 01 per gallon  an increase of more than 30     So there is no doubt that the price of crude oil dances to the tune set by OPEC members   Kohl said    Such blatantly anti competitive conduct by the oil cartel violates the most basic principles of fair competition and free markets and should not be tolerated     If private companies engaged such an international price fixing conspiracy  there would be no question that it would be illegal   The actions of OPEC should be treated no differently because it is a conspiracy of nations   In 1979  a federal district court found that OPEC s price fixing decisions were  governmental     not  commercial     acts and accordingly they were protected by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act   Subsequently  in 1981  a federal court of appeals declined to consider the appeal of that antitrust case based on the so called  act of state  doctrine  which holds that a court will not consider a case regarding the legality of the acts of a foreign nation    Kohl s bipartisan NOPEC amendment effectively reverses these decisions by making it clear that OPEC s activities are not protected by sovereign immunity and that the federal courts should not decline to hear such a case based on the  act of state  doctrine   It clears away these judicially created roadblocks so the Department of Justice could bring an antitrust case against OPEC for its price fixing behavior       The amendment will force OPEC to begin pricing in a competitive  free market manner or face the possibility of being prosecuted for civil or criminal antitrust violations   Kohl s legislation is cosponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy  D VT   Arlen Specter  R PA   Russ Feingold  D WI   Chuck Grassley  R IA   Charles Schumer  D NY   Tom Coburn  R OK   Richard Durbin  D IL   Olympia Snowe  R ME   Carl Levin  D MI   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Bernie Sanders  I VT   Joe Lieberman  ID CT   Joe Biden  D DE  and Amy Klobuchar  D MN   Audio of Sen  Kohl s floor speech is available at    http   demradio senate gov actualities kohl kohl070619 mp3
