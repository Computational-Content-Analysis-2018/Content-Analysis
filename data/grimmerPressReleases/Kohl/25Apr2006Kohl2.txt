Senators Patrick Leahy  D VT  and Herb Kohl  D WI  today called on President George W  Bush to support the enactment of legislation to strengthen antitrust measures to prevent illegal price manipulation by oil cartels   Leahy and Kohl  along with Sens  Arlen Specter  R PA  and Mike DeWine  R OH   are sponsors of the  Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006   which includes provisions to make OPEC accountable for its anti competitive behavior and give the Department of Justice the tools it needs to take action against the foreign oil cartels for withholding supplies  price gouging or other anti competitive activities   The bill is expected to be considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee next week  Leahy is the Committee s ranking member and Kohl is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Antitrust  Competition Policy and Consumer Rights   The text of their letter follows  April 25  2006 The Honorable George W  Bush President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington  D C  20500 Dear Mr  President  We are writing to enlist your support in enacting strong antitrust measures to allow the Department of Justice to crack down on illegal price manipulation by oil cartels   Those tough provisions would immediately serve to deter the illegal actions of members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries   OPEC   and provide quick relief to millions of American families    If OPEC nations continued their price gouging and manipulation of supplies after passage of the law  S  2557  they would be subject to immediate and severe legal action by the Justice Department   America needs immediate solutions to this oil crisis before the prices at the pump reach  4 or  5 per gallon   We were proud to recently introduce with Judiciary Committee Chairman Specter and the Antitrust Subcommittee Chair and Ranking Member  Senators DeWine and Kohl  along with Senators Feinstein and Durbin  this bill called the  Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006   which includes provisions that could quickly work to reduce high gas and oil prices   We believe that this bill will be on the Judiciary Committee s agenda for action later this week   Those provisions    called  The No Oil Producing And Exporting Cartels Act   NOPEC     would make OPEC accountable for its anti competitive behavior and allow the Justice Department to take decisive action against the foreign oil cartels for the withholding of supplies  price gouging or other anticompetitive activities    It will allow the federal government to take legal action against any foreign state  including members of OPEC  for price fixing and other anti competitive activities   The tools this bill would provide to law enforcement agencies are necessary to rapidly counter OPEC s anti competitive practices  and these tools would help reduce gasoline prices now  We strongly believe that passage of this bill would immediately deter many of these illegal actions that otherwise would keep increasing our gas and oil prices    Mr  President  your support will help pass this measure  OPEC has America over a barrel  and we should fight back   If OPEC were simply a foreign business engaged in this type of behavior  it would already be subject to American antitrust law   It is wrong to let OPEC producers off the hook just because their anti competitive practices come with the seal of approval of this cartel s member nations   The Senate has already passed NOPEC once  In fact  the Judiciary Committee has approved the NOPEC bill three times    In addition  the day you sign this bill it would be unlawful to divert petroleum or natural gas products from their local market to a distant market with the primary intention of increasing prices or creating a shortage in a market   This would solve a serious problem where oil or gas products are being shipped for sale in one market but are later diverted and sold for less in another market to artificially reduce supplies and force up prices   We have an obligation to address these and other issues caused by oil cartels and by profit driven companies who have money to burn  Authorizing tough legal action against illegal oil price fixing  and taking that action without delay  is something we should do without additional obstruction or delay    We urge you  Mr  President  to help us in getting this bill important bill through Congress in the next couple weeks  Sincerely   PATRICK LEAHY                            HERB KOHL  Ranking Member                                Ranking Member                                                          Antitrust  Competition Policy and                                                          Consumer Rights Subcommittee
