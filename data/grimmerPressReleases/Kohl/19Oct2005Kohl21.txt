KOHL URGES PASSAGE OF STEM CELL BILL BEFORE HOLIDAY RECESS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    October 19  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL URGES PASSAGE OF STEM CELL BILL BEFORE HOLIDAY RECESS     WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  Education and Related Agencies  today made the following statement on the potential of stem cell research and his support for expanding Federal funding of this promising life saving research  Kohl is the lead Democrat on the Senate s Special Committee on Aging  which recently held a hearing to examine progress in embryonic stem cell research  the need for new stem cell lines and why these additional lines should receive federal support                I applaud my colleagues  Senators Harkin and Specter  for their continued leadership and their work on critical legislation which I am proud to co sponsor   stated Kohl   I truly hope we will be able to pass the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act before we adjourn for the holidays    The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  introduced by Senators Arlen Specter  R PA  and Tom Harkin  D IA  in February  will expand the number of new stem cell lines available to researchers at the National Institutes of Health and other affiliated laboratories  like the University of Wisconsin  America s epicenter for groundbreaking stem cell research  The House passed companion legislation in late May  but the Senate has yet to take it up              Scientists have raised concerns over the quality  longevity and availability of the current human embryonic stem cell lines that are eligible for use in federally funded research  Under the Bush Administration s policy  only 22 cell lines are available for federal research dollars  and an unpublished NIH report indicates that under a best case scenario  a total of 23 embryonic stem cell lines will ever be ready for use in research   It would be unconscionable for the Federal government to turn its back on the discoveries that expanding stem cell research promises   Now more than ever  it s important to grasp this opportunity in an ethical manner by making sure that potentially lifesaving research keeps moving forward
