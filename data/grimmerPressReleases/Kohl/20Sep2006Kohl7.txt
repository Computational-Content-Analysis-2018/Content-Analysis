Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on Reporters  Privilege Legislation                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    September 20  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on Reporters  Privilege Legislation Preserving Effective Federal Law Enforcement    We need a federal  reporter s shield  law   Though forty nine states including Wisconsin recognize a shield law  there is no comparable federal statute   Unfortunately  reporters are increasingly being subject to subpoenas ordering them to give up their sources in federal court   Though justified in some instances  we would do well to set the rules of game with a federal law instead of relying upon court decisions and non enforceable Department of Justice guidelines   A free and vibrant press is essential to an open society and is a cornerstone of our democracy   Government abuse and corporate fraud would often go unreported without the use of confidential sources   Sources will not reveal volatile information if they stood a strong chance of being exposed    exposure that could cost them their job or even worse   If the press is to serve as a legitimate check against government and corporate wrongdoing  we must ensure their right to confidential sources  Granting reporters this privilege is hardly revolutionary   Similar confidential communications between spouses  attorneys and clients  and doctors and patients are protected where we determine that the value of keeping those conversations private outweighs society s right to know   Of course  there are exceptions to the rule and this privilege is not absolute   Mr  Chairman  your bill is careful to protect law enforcement s legitimate need to discover the identity of a source where national security is threatened or in circumstances where a terrible harm could be prevented    Like so many laws we enact  we must strike the right balance with this legislation and I am confident that we will
