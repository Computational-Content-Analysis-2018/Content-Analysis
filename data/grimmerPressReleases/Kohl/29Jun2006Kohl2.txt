KOHL SPONSORS BILL TARGETING RAIL SHIPPING RATES THAT DRIVE UP CONSUMER COSTS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    June 29  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL SPONSORS BILL TARGETING RAIL SHIPPING RATES THAT DRIVE UP CONSUMER COSTS Four railroads  providing 90  of the nation s rail transportation  can hold shippers captive and charge staggering fees     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Herb Kohl today introduced the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2006 in response to concerns that freight railroads are abusing their dominant market power and raising rates for those who rely on them to ship dozens of vital commodities  including coal and agricultural products   The legislation will repeal the obsolete antitrust exemptions protecting freight railroads from competition   These exemptions deny rail consumers antitrust protections available to consumers in virtually every other industry   Last year  according to the Wisconsin Public Service Commission  Wisconsin utilities incurred nearly  50 million in additional costs associated with shipments of coal  which provides about 60 percent of the state s energy   These costs are then passed along consumers already paying for record high energy prices    By clearing out this thicket of outmoded antitrust exemptions  railroads will be subject to the same laws as the rest of the economy   Kohl said    All those who rely on railroads to ship their products    whether it is an electric utility for its coal  a farmer to ship his grain  or a factory to acquire its raw materials or ship out its finished product    deserve the full application of the antitrust laws to end the anti competitive abuses all too prevalent in this industry today    Over the last 20 years  railroad industry consolidation has reached the point where only four class I railroads provide over 90 percent of the nation s rail transportation    Many industries    known as  captive shippers     are served by only one railroad    These captive shippers have faced constantly rising rail rates     Captive shippers allege they have been the victim of monopolistic practices and price gouging by the single railroad that serves them  price increases which they are forced to pass along into the price of their products and  ultimately  to consumers  And in many cases the ordinary protections of antitrust law are unavailable to these captive shippers    instead  the railroads are protected by a series of exemptions from the normal rules of antitrust law to which all other industries must abide  Dairyland Power in La Crosse serves the electricity needs of more than 575 000 people   In recent years  they have experienced a 93 percent average increase in rail rages as of January of this year  According to Dairyland  it will now cost about  75 million to ship  30 million worth of coal    Current antitrust law protects a wide range of railroad industry conduct from scrutiny by antitrust enforcers    Railroad mergers and acquisitions are exempt from antitrust law and are reviewed solely by the Surface Transportation Board    Railroads that engage in collective ratemaking are also exempt from antitrust law     Kohl s bill will eliminate these antitrust exemptions by allowing the federal government  state attorneys general and private parties to file suit to enjoin anti competitive mergers and acquisitions    It will restore the review of these mergers to the agencies where they belong    the Justice Department s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission    And it will eliminate the antitrust exemption for railroad collective rate making  Kohl is the senior Democrat of the Senate Judiciary Committee s Antitrust  Competition Policy and Consumer Rights panel
