STATEMENT BY SENATOR HERB KOHL ON THE BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE COMMISSION DECISION TO MOVE THE 440TH AIRLIFT WING                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    August 26  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        STATEMENT BY SENATOR HERB KOHL ON THE BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE COMMISSION DECISION TO MOVE THE 440TH AIRLIFT WING     I believe the Commission made a serious mistake in not recognizing the value and strategic importance of keeping the 440th at Mitchell Air Field   In numerous meetings  conversations  testimony  and letters my colleagues and I have worked diligently to make a strong and convincing case for keeping the 440th off the final BRAC list    ignoring that case does a disservice to men and women of the 440th  to the Reserve system in the Midwest  and to the military needs of this Nation in a time of war    I am hopeful that the final Commission report  due out on September 8  will    at a minimum      make clear how the Commission responded to the many flaws and questions we raised about putting the 440th on the list   As the process of closing the 440th moves forward  we will work hard to ensure that Wisconsin gets its fair share of the funds that the federal government makes available to help communities recover from the losses as painless as possible
