SENATE PASSES KOHL S CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT REFORM BILL                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 10  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        SENATE PASSES KOHL S CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT REFORM BILL Senator is Lead Democrat on Bipartisan Legislation to Protect Consumers and Injured Parties    WASHINGTON    The U S  Senate today passed legislation sponsored by Senator Herb Kohl to stop unfair and abusive class action settlements that ignore the best interests of injured plaintiffs   Kohl is the lead Democratic sponsor of the Class Action Fairness Act  to help people understand their rights in class action lawsuits and protect them from unfair settlements   The bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support in a 72 to 26 vote   While this bill does not solve all of the problems in the class action system  consumers will never again need to worry about being injured and receiving worthless coupons as damages   Businesses will never again need to fear being sued in a small county court where the rules are stacked against them   And  most importantly  every claim with merit will still go forward and the court house doors will always remain open   Kohl said   Class action suits are brought on behalf of a group of individuals who all have the same complaint   While the vast majority of lawyers who work on class action lawsuits protect consumers  people sometimes get caught up in abusive cases   For example  a woman from Baraboo  Wisconsin was part of a class action lawsuit against her mortgage company   While she won the suit  she ended up owing money and then getting sued by the lawyers who were supposed to be representing her   In the recent Blockbuster video suit  plaintiffs received dollar off coupons on their next video rental and the lawyers took over nine million dollars     Kohl and Sen  Chuck Grassley  R IA  sponsored the Class Action Fairness Act   The bill makes it easier to move class action cases to federal court  where the judges are much more experienced and there are greater resources to deal with these very large cases   The bill also adds an extra layer of review for the class action settlements by permitting the Attorney General of a state whose constituents are affected to review and object  if necessary  to the settlements before the judge approves it
