KOHL  WISCONSIN SENIORS WANT MEDICARE DRUG PROGRAM DEADLINE EXTENDED                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 23  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL  WISCONSIN SENIORS WANT MEDICARE DRUG PROGRAM DEADLINE EXTENDED     Milwaukee  WI   After hosting four roundtable meetings to talk about the new Medicare prescription drug benefit with Wisconsin seniors  U S  Senator Herb Kohl  D WI  again called on President Bush to extend the program s enrollment deadline until the end of 2006  Concerned about repeated complaints by constituents from across the state  Kohl held meetings in Eau Claire  La Crosse  Green Bay and Madison earlier this week to hear  first hand  how seniors are navigating the complex enrollment process  In every city  seniors and senior advocates shared their stories of frustration  being switched from Medicaid into a Medicare drug plan that doesn t cover the drugs they need  experiencing hundreds of dollars in incorrectly charged copays  and wrestling with the choice of dozens of drug plans with little information available about their coverage or costs   In Eau Claire  Kohl called the new program rollout a  disaster  adding  but now that it is going forward  we need to make sure it runs as smoothly as possible    This program was designed only with the interests of drug companies and HMOs in mind  it s no surprise that seniors have found the benefit to be extremely confusing and unworkable   Kohl said   We need to extend the enrollment deadline to give seniors a fighting chance to make the best possible decision when choosing their drug coverage   Under the current law  Medicare beneficiaries who do not act by the May 15 deadline to choose a plan and enroll at a later date will face a substantial and permanent penalty   Kohl is a cosponsor of the Medicare Informed Choice Act  S  1841  that would delay the late enrollment penalties until the end of this year and give every beneficiary a one time chance to change their plan at any point in 2006  Kohl also cosponsored a similar measure during last week s consideration of the fiscal year 2007 Budget Resolution  yet it failed by one vote  Instead  the Senate passed an amendment that would give the Administration discretionary authority to decide to extend the enrollment deadline for the drug benefit   It is important to send a strong signal to this administration that they must consider extending the deadline   Kohl said   But I m very concerned by recent comments made by the President and Medicare officials that clearly show their resistance to giving seniors more time to make a careful decision about what drug plan they will be locked into for the remainder of the year   The Health and Human Services  HHS  Department s Medicare Mobile Office Tour passed through Wisconsin this week  making stops in Eau Claire  Marshfield and Baraboo  Today  HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt is expected to be in Wausau to discuss the Medicare prescription drug benefit
