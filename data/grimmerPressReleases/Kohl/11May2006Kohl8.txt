Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the NSA Call Database                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    May 11  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the NSA Call Database     We all agree that al Qaeda operatives must be tracked wherever they may be  but the President s unprecedented intrusion into the lives of millions of Americans is chilling   If these phone records were collected without the legal authority to do so  it is a contradiction of our basic constitutional rights and expectations of privacy   The law    and our entire system of checks and balances    makes clear that the President does not have unlimited authority  yet he consistently refuses to seek consent for these broad and far reaching government programs  This pattern troubles me and raises many grave questions
