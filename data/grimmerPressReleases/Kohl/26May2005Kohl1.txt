Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    May 26  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act     While not a perfect bill  this bipartisan legislation and the trust fund it creates truly is a better way than the current system for compensating asbestos victims in a timely  predictable and reliable fashion  First and foremost  the trust fund will put more money in the pocket of the victim than the current system  Of all the money spent in the current system    an estimated  70 billion    only about 42 cents of every dollar winds up in the victim s pocket  In contrast  the trust will help victims get at least 95 cents of every dollar  That means money will go where it should  to victims who need it  Furthermore  we must do more for victims than simply cutting them a check  We owe them a significant effort to find a cure and better treatment options for the deadliest asbestos disease  mesothelioma  That is why I worked with Senators Specter and Leahy to include an amendment that will provide  290 million to support efforts to better diagnose  treat  and find a cure for mesothelioma  This will be money very well spent and it also represents some hope for future victims
