CONGRESSWOMAN MOORE  SENATOR KOHL ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR A NEW SPINAL CORD INJURY UNIT AT ZABLOCKI                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 21  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        CONGRESSWOMAN MOORE  SENATOR KOHL ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR A NEW SPINAL CORD INJURY UNIT AT ZABLOCKI Department of Veterans Affairs to Spend  32 5 Million under 2007 Appropriations bill    WASHINGTON   Congresswoman Gwen Moore and Senator Herb Kohl today announced that Milwaukee s Zablocki VA Medical Center  a major veterans  health care facility in Wisconsin s Fourth Congressional District  will receive  32 5 million for a new Spinal Cord Injury Unit  SCI  under the Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY 2007    Last year  Congresswoman Moore sent a letter signed by Wisconsin delegation members Sen  Herb Kohl  Sen  Russ Feingold  Rep  Tammy Baldwin  Rep  Mark Green  and Rep  Ron Kind to VA Secretary R  James Nicholson expressing their strong support for the funding   When the House FY2007 Military Quality of Life Appropriations bill did not include funding for Zablocki s SCI Unit  Congresswoman Moore offered an amendment to that bill to reinstate the funding   That bill was later taken up by the Senate  where Senator Kohl fought in the Appropriations Committee to ensure that funding was included for the new SCI Unit   The Zablocki Spinal Cord Injury Unit routinely treats our veterans with some of the most specialized and complicated medical treatments in use today  Our veterans  including the many brave men and women who served our country in Iraq  deserve the best medical care available  This upgrade at Zablocki will bring cutting edge medical technologies to Wisconsin s veterans  and I m pleased that the VA has signaled that this important project is now moving forward   Kohl said    We re talking about our nation s veterans heroes by any measure who have lost the use of their legs and arms and often the ability to live independently   Moore said   A state of the art SCI Unit is long overdue at Zablocki   Considering their many sacrifices  the least we can do is provide these veterans with the best technology available      BACKGROUND ON ZABLOCKI MEDICAL CENTER Zablocki Medical Center is the only VA unit that treats spinal cord injuries in Wisconsin  and only one of 23 in the United States  with its spinal cord injury unit treating approximately 500 veterans as inpatients and providing service to 10 000 outpatients annually   The  32 5 million in funding will improve patient care  maximize patient services and quality of life as it creates a new building that will include 38 patient beds   The new SCI unit will help thousands of veterans deal with irreversible paraplegia and quadriplegia  disabilities that are catastrophic to both veterans and their families  The existing Spinal Cord Injury Unit at the Milwaukee VA Medical Center was established in 1972   The SCI unit is on two retrofitted acute care wards on the 10th floor of the Medical Center   Limitations of space and technology in the current location have made it impossible to keep the SCI unit abreast of the evolution of SCI medicine over the past thirty three years   These facilities do not currently meet the current standards as set by JCAHO  the VA s space criteria  or the life and safety evacuation criteria   As of now  the SCI unit does not have rooms that were built to contain all the equipment needed by the veteran as he she works to achieve optimal independence  and the unit s multi patient rooms make it virtually impossible to meet expectations for patient privacy  Even with the limited space and outdated technology  the SCI unit at Zablocki VA Medical Center boasts a very dedicated staff   The structural upgrades and new equipment afforded by this funding will bring Zablocki up to speed with the spatial and technology requirements that are needed to ensure that the staff can serve our veterans properly and more efficiently
