KOHL INTRODUCES  FAMILY REUNIFICATION ACT                      Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 1  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL INTRODUCES  FAMILY REUNIFICATION ACT   IMMIGRATION BILL WILL ALLOW CHILDREN TO JOIN THEIR PARENTS IN AMERICA    WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Herb Kohl this week introduced legislation to correct a loophole in federal immigration law that bars minor children from joining their parents in the United States  Under current law  parents of U S  citizens are able to enter the country as legal permanent residents  but they cannot bring their other young children with them   Kohl s legislation  the  Family Reunification Act   will close this loophole by including minor siblings of U S  citizens in the definition of  immediate relative    A minor oversight in the law has led to an unfortunate consequence  Today  a U S  citizen can bring his parents into the country  but not his five year old brother or sister   The parents    forced to choose between their children    are effectively prevented from coming to this country as well   The result is that we are unnecessarily keeping families apart   Our immigration laws are intended to strengthen families  not build needless roadblocks   By qualifying as  immediate relatives   the Immigration and Nationality Act currently offers parents  spouses and children of U S  citizens the ability to obtain immigrant visas to enter the country legally  However  minor siblings of U S  citizens are not included in that definition  For example  one family Wisconsin is a textbook example of the regrettable consequences of the current law   Effiong and Ekom Okon  both U S  citizens by birth  requested that their parents  who were living in Nigeria  be admitted to as  immediate relatives    The law clearly allows for this   Their father  Leo  had already joined them in Wisconsin  and their mother  Grace  was in possession of a visa  ready to join the rest of her family   However  Grace was unable to join her husband and sons in the United States because their six year old daughter  Daramfon  did not qualify as an  immediate relative    Because it would be unthinkable for her to abandon her small child  Grace was forced to stay behind in Nigeria  separated from the rest of her family   That is not what this law was intended to accomplish  Kohl s legislation has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee  on which he serves
