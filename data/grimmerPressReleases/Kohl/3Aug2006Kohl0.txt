Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Estate Tax Minimum Wage Bill                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    August 3  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Estate Tax Minimum Wage Bill     I support raising the estate tax exemption so that virtually all farms and small businesses will not be affected  we need to do that and I think we will   This estate tax proposal  however  is estimated to cost  750 billion over ten years  primarily because it dramatically reduces the top rate on the richest estates   That goes much farther than we can afford    I also support raising the federal minimum wage and have voted many times to do so   While Wisconsin s minimum wage is already higher than the national wage  we need to give all hard working Americans a minimum wage that allows them to support a family without sinking into poverty
