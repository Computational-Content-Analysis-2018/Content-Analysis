STATEMENT BY SENATOR KOHL ON KATRINA AFTERMATH                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    September 2  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        STATEMENT BY SENATOR KOHL ON KATRINA AFTERMATH     WASHINGTON  D C     The Senate last night approved  10 5 billion in emergency funding to aid rescue  recovery and care for the thousands upon thousands of victims throughout the Gulf Coast region left in Katrina s wake   Following is a statement by Senator Herb Kohl  D WI  on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the relief efforts surrounding this tragedy   Like anyone who has heard of the horrific destruction in New Orleans and the gulf coast region and of the deteriorating and dangerous conditions of the hundreds of thousands of refugees  I am stunned and sickened that such a scene could unfold in the United States  Reports of an uncoordinated  insufficient  and often completely absent federal response has compounded the national tragedy    Officials at highest levels of government will have to answer to how this could happen in a country as rich and supposedly well prepared for disaster as the United States  Those questions will be asked    and there will be accountability    but  right now  the focus must remain on saving lives and housing refugees in sanitary  humane conditions
