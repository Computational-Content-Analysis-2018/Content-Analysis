NOMINATION HEARING OF JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HERB KOHL                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    January 9  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        NOMINATION HEARING OF JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HERB KOHL      Thank you  Mr  Chairman  Judge Alito  let me also extend my welcome to you this afternoon and to your family   You are to be congratulated on your nomination    Through its interpretation of the Constitution  the Supreme Court hugely shapes the fabric of our society    for us and for future generations   Over the course of more than 200 years  it has found a right to equal education regardless of race   It has guaranteed an attorney and a fair trial to all Americans  rich and poor alike   It has allowed women to keep private medical decisions private    It has allowed Americans to speak  vote  and worship without interference from their government  Through these decisions and many more  the Judicial Branch has    in its finest hours    stood firmly on the side of individuals against those who would trample their rights    In the words of Justice Black   the Courts stand against any winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless  weak  outnumbered  or because they are non conforming victims of prejudice and public excitement    As the guardian of our rights  the Supreme Court makes decisions every year which either protect the individual or leave him at the mercy of more powerful forces in our society   They consider questions like when can a disabled individual sue to gain access to a courthouse   When can a parent leave work to care for a sick child   When should the government be allowed to listen to a private conversation   And  when will the courthouse doors open    or close    to an employee suffering discrimination at work   Whether interpreting the Constitution or filling in the blanks of a law or a regulation  every word of the Court s opinion can widen or narrow our rights as Americans    and either protect us or leave us more vulnerable to  any winds that blow   If confirmed  you will write the words that will either broaden or narrow our rights for the rest of your working life   You will be interpreting the Constitution in which we as a people place our faith and on which our freedoms as a nation rest   And  on a daily basis  the words of your opinions will affect countless individuals as they seek protection behind the courthouse doors  Despite your enormous power  you will be free of all constraints    unaccountable and unrecallable   We give Supreme Court justices this freedom because we expect them to remain above the pull of politics    to avoid the effects of  public excitement  and allow a broader view not tied to the whims of the majority at a certain moment in history   So for only a short time this month will the people  through their Senators  be able to question and judge you    In short  before we give we give you the keys to the car  we would like to know where you plan to take us    To a certain extent we know more about what is in your heart and your mind than we did with now Justice Roberts   You have a long track record as a judge and as a public official in the Justice Department   When we met privately  I asked you what sort of Supreme Court justice you would make   And your answer was fair when you said  if you want to know what sort of Justice I would make  look at what sort of a judge I have been   Taking this advice  your critics argue that your judicial record demonstrates that you will not sufficiently protect the individual but will  instead  side with more powerful interests  narrow the rights we enjoy  and leave individual Americans more vulnerable to abuse   For example  they cite your Casey dissent as diminishing the power of married women over their own bodies   They identify your decision in the Chittester case as evidence that you will make it harder for working people to care for a family member in need  They cite the Bray case and others where you often side with corporations to block the victims of discrimination from getting their day in court   Others raise concerns about your views on the rights of the accused when faced with the government s enormous power in the criminal justice process     In addition to your record on the bench  your opponents identify memos you wrote while in the Justice Department as further evidence of your hostility to individual rights     For example  in your now famous 1985 job application you expressed pride in some of the work you did in the Solicitor General s office   You chose to single out the assistance that you provided in crafting Supreme Court briefs arguing that QUOTE  the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion    While these statements came in the context of your work on behalf of the Reagan Administration they were nevertheless your self proclaimed personal views    In the same job application  you wrote that you had pursued a legal career because you disagreed with many of the decisions of the Warren Court especially QUOTE  in the areas of criminal procedure  the Establishment clause  and reapportionment    These Warren Court decisions establishing one person one vote  Miranda rights and protections for religious minorities are some of the most important cases protecting our rights and liberties    protecting minorities against majority abuses  and protecting individuals against government abuses   Yet  antagonism toward these decisions seems to have motivated your pursuit of the law  Your supporters contend that it is not fair to select a few specific cases in light of a career as a judge spanning 15 years   Further  they dismiss some of your early memos in the Justice Department as old and not particularly relevant   They argue that you are well within the mainstream of judges  especially Republican appointed judges  It is our job to sort out the truth about your record    to separate the rhetoric from the reality and decide where you will lead the country   We will need to examine whether    as your critics contend    you will consistently side against the individual or whether your supporters are correct that you are a mainstream conservative who will fairly decide all cases   I hope that these hearings will add to our record in making this critical determination    This would be an appropriate time to share our perspective on how we will judge a nominee   We have used the same test for each of the previous five Supreme Court nomination hearings    a test of judicial excellence  Judicial excellence  it seems to me  involves at least four elements  First  a nominee must possess the competence  character  and temperament to serve on the bench   Second  judicial excellence means that a Supreme Court Justice must have a sense of the values which form the core of our political and economic system   In other words  we should not approve any nominee whose extreme judicial philosophy would undermine rights and liberties relied upon by all Americans    Third  judicial excellence requires an understanding that the law is more than an intellectual game  and more than a mental exercise   He or she must recognize that real people  with real problems are affected by the decisions rendered by the Court   Justice  after all  may be blind  but it should not be deaf   And finally  judicial excellence requires candor before confirmation  We are being asked to give the nominee enormous power  We want to know  in general  what is in your heart and in your mind   Judge Alito  we are convinced that your intellect and experience qualify you for this position   I enjoyed meeting you a few weeks ago and appreciated our discussion   Your legal talents are undeniably impressive and your opinions are thoughtful and well reasoned   We are now familiar with your abilities and your long tenure as a judge   Yet  we do not know whether the concerns some have raised about your judicial philosophy are overstated or whether we need to have serious doubts about your nomination    I look forward to these hearings as an opportunity to learn more and measure whether you meet our test of judicial excellence  Thank you  Mr  Chairman
