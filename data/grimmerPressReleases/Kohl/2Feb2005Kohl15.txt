Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the State of the Union Address                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 2  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the State of the Union Address     I give the President credit for his willingness to put Social Security reform at the top of his agenda tonight   But it s important to recognize that Social Security is not facing an imminent crisis   Clearly we need to strengthen Social Security so that it s able to meet the needs of seniors for generations to come   And that is very doable by making incremental changes without incurring all the costs and risks of privatization   I look forward to working with both sides of the aisle to achieve that    The President also highlighted the elections in Iraq last weekend   They were a great step forward  and hopefully will hasten the day that Iraq has a functioning government that will enable us to bring home our men and women in the armed services at the earliest possible date
