KOHL OFFERS ALTERNATIVE TO DRASTIC MEDICAID CUTS                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 16  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL OFFERS ALTERNATIVE TO DRASTIC MEDICAID CUTS      WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senator Herb Kohl  D WI  today signed on to an bipartisan amendment that would prevent a  15 billion cut to Medicaid as part of the Senate Budget Resolution and instead recommends a Medicaid Commission to consider the future efficiency and effectiveness of the Medicaid program   A budget decrease of this size has the potential to deprive thousands of poor families needed medical care and greatly increase the already record number of uninsured Americans   Kohl said     The real cost driver in Medicaid is the economy  which continues to cause a strain on the ability of businesses to offer health insurance coverage to their employees   More and more employers are dropping health insurance coverage  pushing low wage working families onto public programs  while the overall cost of health care continues to skyrocket  Cutting  15 billion from federal Medicaid spending is only going to make matters worse by forcing the problem down to states  which already face severe budget crises   A  15 billion cut in Medicaid could translate to a loss of  300 million for Wisconsin   It would be extremely difficult for Wisconsin and other states to absorb a cut of this magnitude while continuing to provide the level of services 53 million Americans depend on   Recent studies by the Urban Institute and the Kaiser Family Foundation show that Medicaid spends less  per patient  than private health insurance plans and that its costs have grown more slowly in the last four years than private sector insurance premiums  Kohl said that there should be a thorough discussion about how Medicaid can work better to serve low income Americans and that it is unacceptable to force arbitrary cuts in Medicaid without first taking the time to consider the future efficiency and operation of the Medicaid program  stressing that any changes to the program should be driven by informed  reasoned policy and not by arbitrary budget targets   The amendment  introduced by Senators Smith  R OR  and Bingaman  D NM   would erase language in the budget requiring the Senate Finance Committee to find five year savings of  15 billion in legislation later this year
