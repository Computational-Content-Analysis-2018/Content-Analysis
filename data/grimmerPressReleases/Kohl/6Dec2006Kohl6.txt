Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Iraq Study Group Report                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    December 6  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Iraq Study Group Report     I m pleased that the Baker report has come to the same conclusions that many of us in the Senate reached last year    we must begin a phased redeployment of troops as a way to both encourage the Iraqis to take more responsibility for their own security and also to reduce the extent to which a large U S  footprint is fueling the insurgency    I am grateful to this distinguished group of Americans for their hard work toward a resolution of this difficult situation  and I am hopeful that the President will take this opportunity to move forward in a new direction in Iraq
