SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE PASSES LEGISLATION TO FIGHT METHAMPHETAMINE PRODUCTION                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    July 28  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE PASSES LEGISLATION TO FIGHT METHAMPHETAMINE PRODUCTION      WASHINGTON   The Senate Judiciary Committee today passed legislation cosponsored by U S  Senator Herb Kohl to make it more difficult for methamphetamine   meth   producers to obtain the chemicals used to produce the illegal drug   The  Combat Meth Act of 2005   sponsored by Senator Diane Feinstein of California  would limit access to cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine  the primary ingredient used to make meth   Over the last five years  Wisconsin saw a 74 percent increase in the number of meth cases   from 314 in 2000 to 545 in 2004   according to the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation   Wisconsin is one of nine states that recently passed similar laws    Despite Wisconsin s efforts  it is still vulnerable   Individuals can still purchase these products in nearby states without such restrictions  manufacture the drug  and then deliver it to customers in the state   For instance  Kohl  a member of the Judiciary Committee  noted that the Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA  reports that it seized 37 pounds of meth from out of state individuals who were trying to generate a market for the drug in the Green Bay area   As a result  federal legislation is vitally important to efforts to effectively combat the growing production and use of meth in the state     Wisconsin has done a better job than most states in fighting the spread of meth early and strongly   Kohl said    But where we had only a handful of meth lab busts in the  90s  we now see one hundred a year   Meth has a clear presence in our state  and we need to prevent it from gaining a stronghold   This bill will make it harder to produce meth and bring us closer to our goal   The bill passed by the committee today moves cold medicines containing pseudophedrine behind the counter and sets a limit on the amount one person can buy in a month   In 1996 when Congress limited the amount of pseudophedrine tablets that any one person could purchase in bottles  it did not restrict the purchase of pseudophedrine in foil backed plastic packages  or blister packs  which hold far fewer tablets   Subsequently  meth producers adapted their behavior to take advantage of the loophole in the law by using presses that simply punctured all of the blister packs  The DEA found that among the refuse left at meth labs was an increasing number of blister packs                The bill also authorizes  33 million for meth enforcement  training  and research into treatment  Kohl has led other efforts to combat meth use in Wisconsin  particularly in western Wisconsin  which has seen a dramatic emergence of meth in recent years   In response  Kohl has amplified the DEA s representation in Wisconsin  specifically adding new agents in the western part of the state to work in conjunction with state drug officials  He also helped provide DEA mobile drug teams to traverse western Wisconsin  Additionally  as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  Kohl has secured millions of dollars in federal funding to assist in prevention and clean up efforts in Western Wisconsin   Kohl included  1 million in the current federal budget for the Wisconsin Methamphetamine Law Enforcement Initiative   Last year  as part of the FY2004 federal budget  Kohl included  1 million for the Wisconsin Methamphetamine Law Enforcement Initiative   300 000 for the Barron Rusk County Drug Task Force  and  50 000 for the St  Croix District Attorney s Office Initiative to Combat Methamphetamine
