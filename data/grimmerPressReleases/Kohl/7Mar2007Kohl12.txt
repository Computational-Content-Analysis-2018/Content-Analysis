MIDWEST AIRLINES AIRTRAN MERGER WILL GET SECOND LOOK BY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  KOHL SAYS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 7  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        MIDWEST AIRLINES AIRTRAN MERGER WILL GET SECOND LOOK BY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  KOHL SAYS Chief Antitrust Official Agrees to Re Examine Competition and Quality Concerns Regarding Air Carrier Merger    WASHINGTON    At a Senate hearing today  the chief antitrust official at the Department of Justice  DoJ  agreed to conduct a second review of merger terms in AirTran s bid to take over Midwest Airlines   U S  Senator Herb Kohl  the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee s Antitrust  Competition Policy and Consumer Rights subcommittee  raised his concerns over the proposed merger during a hearing on antitrust law enforcement   Last month  DoJ closed its mandatory investigation of the AirTran Midwest deal after only a cursory review lasting fewer than 30 days   Despite the obvious dangers of this acquisition in terms of frequency of service and quality of service for the many thousands of Midwest Airlines customers  DoJ s antitrust division did not initiate the full follow up investigation that most in the industry expected   The Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust  Thomas Barnett  who approved DoJ s review of the Midwest Airlines AirTran merger  testified at the hearing  along with the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission            The most important antitrust issue for me and my constituents this year is AirTran s bid to acquire Midwest Airlines in a hostile takeover   Kohl said at the hearing    As you know  Midwest Airlines is a true success story    Midwest Airlines is a unique company in the airline industry    an airline that offers the highest quality of service  and is actually beloved by its customers   Beyond this  Midwest Airlines is vital to the economy of Wisconsin and the Greater Milwaukee area   Unfortunately  the business model of AirTran is very different than Midwest Airlines    It is a no frills  discount airline with low ratings for quality and customer service in industry ratings    No one doubts that the quality of Midwest s stellar service offered to consumers will suffer should AirTran complete this acquisition   Even more worrisome is AirTran s history of promising high levels of service when entering new markets and then abruptly breaking these promises and sharply reducing service  Should AirTran acquire Midwest Airlines and decide in the future to reduce service from Milwaukee  the negative consequences for the Wisconsin economy would be enormous          Kohl noted that since 2004   AirTran has exited 29 markets it had promised to serve  sometimes  returning  in  a scaled down  version  and sometimes not at all   Notably  at Dallas Ft  Worth  AirTran promised a mini hub with 30 flights a day to seven destinations by the end of 2004   The reality was far different   AirTran  never attained more than 17 flights a day at Dallas Ft  Worth and presently has only eight flights a day to two destinations   Similarly   AirTran has reduced service at Washington Dulles from 16 to seven daily departures  and at Pittsburgh from 13 to six              Mr  Barnett  in light of the facts I ve presented to you today  should AirTran s offer to purchase Midwest Airlines be accepted by Midwest  will you commit that the Antitrust Division will conduct an investigation of any anti competitive effects harming consumers arising from this deal   Kohl asked    And will you also commit to personally examining the consequences of this deal for consumers and businesses in Wisconsin   Assistant Attorney General Barnett agreed to review additional comments and evidence submitted by Sen  Kohl  his staff   and his constituents regarding concerns over the impact of the AirTran takeover   Barnett said that threats to competition in the airline industry are taken very seriously at the DoJ Antitrust Division  and he will take into consideration the breadth of competition with regard to price and quality that this transaction would create     In January  Kohl wrote to the CEO of AirTran  Joseph Leonard  to say that   As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust  Competition Policy  and Consumer Rights  I and others on the panel are concerned about consolidation in the airline industry   Further consolidation could lead to higher prices  lower quality of service  and loss of competitive choices   Should AirTran pursue its offer to acquire Midwest Airlines  you can expect that the Antitrust Subcommittee will examine this proposed acquisition very carefully to ensure this transaction does not harm the interests of Wisconsin consumers or airline competition generally   We will also engage in close oversight over the Justice Department and the Department of Transportation as they review this transaction   You can expect me to oppose any transaction that will risk substantial harm to the interests of Wisconsin consumers  airline competition in Wisconsin  or the Milwaukee economy
