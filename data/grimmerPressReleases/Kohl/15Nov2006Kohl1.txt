SENATE APPROVES KOHL S REQUEST FOR  32 5 MILLION FOR THE SPINAL CORD INJURY UNIT AT THE MILWAUKEE VA                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    November 15  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        SENATE APPROVES KOHL S REQUEST FOR  32 5 MILLION FOR THE SPINAL CORD INJURY UNIT AT THE MILWAUKEE VA     WASHINGTON  DC    The U S  Senate last night approved the FY2007 Military Construction Appropriations Bill  which includes Senator Herb Kohl s request for  32 5 million for the Spinal Cord Injury Unit at the Milwaukee Veterans Administration  VA  Zablocki Medical Center   In July  Kohl succeeded in including the Zablocki funding in the Senate s version of the Military Construction bill   Kohl is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee         The highly specialized work being done at the Zablocki Spinal Cord Injury Unit cannot be easily replicated anywhere else in the state   Our veterans  including the stream of soldiers returning from perilous work in Iraq  deserve the highest quality of medical care and the most advanced treatment available   The much needed upgrade at Zablocki will bring state of the art technology to Wisconsin s veterans  and I m pleased that the Senate recognized the value in this project   Kohl said  Rep  Gwen Moore said   The Department of Veterans Affairs listed Zablocki s Spinal Cord Injury Unit as a priority for inclusion in the 2007 budget  and I fought so hard to have Zablocki included in the House Military Quality of Life bill   In spite of the VA s endorsement and my efforts  the House Appropriations Committee left Zablocki off its list of veterans  facilities to be upgraded  and it became vital that this funding be included in the Senate version of the military construction appropriations bill   I am so grateful to Senator Kohl for doing all he could to make this happen  and will work together with him to try to keep the funding in the final conference bill   Our veterans have risked their lives to defend our country  and deserve the highest quality of care     Zablocki has the only spinal cord injury unit in the State of Wisconsin  and is one of only 23 nationwide specializing in this high demand specialty   Wounded veterans are returning to the United States everyday with serious wounds that need long term attention and rehabilitation   Veterans returning from Iraq are adding to the 44 000 patients currently receiving treatment for serious spinal cord injuries   In Wisconsin  the VA cares for 500 veterans as inpatients  but reaches out to another 10 000 a year with outpatient services  The VA established the existing Spinal Cord Injury Unit in Milwaukee in 1972   Located on two wards on the 10th floor  limited space and technology have left Zablocki outdated   The facilities fail to meet recognized standards and the VA s own space criteria   A new unit will give veterans the space and privacy they need during long rehabilitations to achieve the independence they need
