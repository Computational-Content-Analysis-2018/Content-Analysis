KOHL   WE CAN ACT RIGHT NOW TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 2  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL   WE CAN ACT RIGHT NOW TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS  Lead Democrat on Aging Committee calls for immediate action in saving seniors  states millions in drug costs                WASHINGTON  D C     The Senate Special Committee on Aging  co chaired by Ranking Member Herb Kohl  D WI   today held a hearing examining the problems and confusion resulting from the implementation of the Medicare Part D drug benefit  including the impact on  dual eligibles   those who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid               We can act right now to fix these problems   said Kohl who has made numerous attempts to preempt possible problems with the transition of low income and disabled Medicaid recipients  also known as  dual eligibles   to the new Medicare prescription drug plan   These efforts include holding an Aging Committee hearing in March 2005 to examine the problems  as well as contacting   Secretary Leavitt on numerous occasions to express concern over the potential and existing problems surrounding implementation of the benefit  Repeatedly  HHS and CMS assured Kohl and Congress that the implementation of the new benefit would be smooth and not cause undue burden on seniors or states              Many states  including Wisconsin  have had to step in to provide emergency coverage of drugs to avert a public health emergency  Last week  Kohl joined Senate Democrats in introducing the Requiring Emergency Pharmaceutical Access for Individual Relief  REPAIR  Act  which will provide guaranteed access to prescription drugs to beneficiaries who have enrolled in a plan that does not cover their necessary medications  reduce the burden on pharmacists  provide federal reimbursement to states and beneficiaries who have incurred unexpected costs  and provide additional protections for low income Medicare beneficiaries  He is also a cosponsor of the Medicare Informed Choice Act  which would extend the enrollment period for Part D and allow beneficiaries to make a one time change of drug plan in order to help them find the most suitable plan for their needs    Earlier this week  I met with seniors  individuals with disabilities  pharmacists  and advocates in Milwaukee  who have been working around the clock to help people get the drugs they need   The Administration needs to show that same commitment  and they must look at what can be done to rectify the serious problems that exist with Medicare Part D
