KOHL STATEMENT ON SENATE APPROVAL TO DRILL IN ANWR                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    November 3  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL STATEMENT ON SENATE APPROVAL TO DRILL IN ANWR     WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Herb Kohl today made the following statement on the Senate s approval of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  ANWR  as part of the year end budget bill     I strongly oppose this bill s use of extraordinary fast track procedures to accomplish what Big Oil proponents have not been able to get through the Senate in the past  opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling     I have long supported protecting this valuable and fragile natural wonder  and I think it is unfortunate that we are drilling in this wilderness for a relatively small payback  I believe we should be looking instead at high oil company profits and encouraging innovative energy alternatives      The outcome of today s vote marks a sad day    for Alaska and for the American people  Drilling in ANWR won t solve the energy crisis    or even put a dent in high gas prices   All we did today was deprive future generations of an irreplaceable pristine wilderness
