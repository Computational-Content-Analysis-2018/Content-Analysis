KOHL CALLS ON FCC TO REJECT MOVE TO BLOCK WISCONSIN S DO NOT CALL LAW                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 2  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL CALLS ON FCC TO REJECT MOVE TO BLOCK WISCONSIN S DO NOT CALL LAW Consumer Bankers Association has petition pending to replace state laws with federal Do Not Call registry    WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Herb Kohl today called on the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  to reject a petition by the Consumer Bankers Association to preempt Wisconsin s telemarketing laws   Congress authorized the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission in March of 2003 to develop a federal Do Not Call registry to prevent telemarketers from placing unwanted calls to consumers   While the federal initiative has been a success  with more than 64 million telephone numbers registered on the national Do Not Call list  some states like Wisconsin have even stronger Do Not Call laws   The Consumer Bankers Association s petition would weaken Wisconsin s Do Not Call law by applying federal exceptions that currently do not exist under state law   Specifically  the federal law allows businesses with an  existing relationship  to call customers without permission for up to 18 months after a purchase or transaction   Furthermore  federal law permits affiliates of companies to call customers who have such an existing relationship with the parent company     Preemption of Wisconsin s D Not Call law would have one sure result   annoyed Wisconsinites receiving increased telemarketing calls allowed under a federal exception but prohibited under state law   Kohl wrote in a letter to FCC Chairman Michael Powell    And I can assure you that most consumers will care little for the legal arguments for or against preemption     When the FCC implemented the national Do Not Call list  it correctly chose not to preempt state Do Not Call lists and rather worked to harmonize the national list with the various state lists   This approach established the national Do Not Call list as a floor  not a ceiling  and states could enact stronger laws pursuant to their powers to regulate telemarketing practices    Wisconsin s law is stronger than the federal law in several ways   First and foremost  Wisconsin law does not include a broad  existing business relationship  exception   And second  Wisconsin law does not permit affiliates to make calls to existing customers of a parent company   In a world of large  multi national companies with numerous affiliates  this exception could lead to sales calls being made to customers that are completely unrelated to the original transaction or company
