Kohl  Leahy  Grassley and Schumer Introduce Bill To Stop  Payoffs  That Delay Generic Drugs                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    June 26  2006     Phone   202  224 5653        Kohl  Leahy  Grassley and Schumer Introduce Bill To Stop  Payoffs  That Delay Generic Drugs     Washington  D C     In the wake of today s Supreme Court refusal to hear the drug patent case  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  v  Schering Plough  top Senate Judiciary Committee members Herb Kohl  D WI  and Patrick Leahy  D VT   Chuck Grassley  R IA  and Charles Schumer  D NY  have announced legislation to prohibit brand name drug manufacturers from using pay off agreements to keep cheaper generic equivalents off the market     When big brand name drug companies pay generic manufactures to stop generic drugs from reaching pharmacy shelves  consumers lose big time   Kohl said   These companies are playing it fast and loose with antitrust law and padding their profits by forcing families and the federal government to pay far more than we should for prescription drugs  This has got to stop    Leahy said   It is stunning that the U S  Supreme Court would refuse a request by the Federal Trade Commission to hear a case so important to senior citizens and others needing lower cost generic medicines   It is also regrettable that the Administration has sided with big drug companies over seniors and the FTC in pushing for this outcome      In 2005  two appellate court decisions overturned FTC s long standing position against this practice and upheld settlements that include such pay offs  Today s Supreme Court dismissal of the FTC s latest appeal prompted lawmakers to propose this important bill   This may be the first time in history that the U S  Solicitor General under any administration has opposed a request by the FTC for the Supreme Court to hear a case of this nature   said Leahy   Sweetheart deals that delay the entry of low cost drugs in the marketplace not only hurt consumers  they also threaten the sustainability of federal health care programs  such as Medicare and Medicaid  Our bill will ensure that the FTC has the ability to look out for the American public  not the profits of drug companies   Grassley said   These deals between big drug companies and small generic competitors are a financial boon for everyone but the consumer   Schumer said    The high cost of prescription drugs is already one of the most daunting problems American families and seniors face today  and these agreements are only increasing this already tremendous financial burden   The key to lowering drug costs is competition and our legislation would put an end to these backroom deals that undermine true competition   A recent FTC report found that in the six months following the 2005 court decisions  there were three settlement agreements in which the generic company received compensation and agreed to a restriction on its ability to market the product   Additionally  the FTC found that at least seven settlement agreements made in 2006 included a pay off from the brand manufacturer in exchange for a promise by the generic company to delay entry into the market  According to a study released earlier this year by Pharmaceutical Care Management Association  PCMA   health plans and consumers could save  26 4 billion over the next five years by using the generic versions of 14 popular drugs that are scheduled to lose their patent protections before 2010    Last week  Senator Kohl was successful in including an additional  10 million in the FY  07 Agriculture Appropriations bill for the Food and Drug Administration s Office of Generic Drugs  an effort to help reduce the growing backlog of generic drug applications   In 2003  Senators Grassley and Leahy were able to include their Drug Competition Act in the Medicare Modernization Act  The Drug Act required companies such as Schering Plough to report all proposed deals with potential generic competitors  which were often previously worked out in secret  to the federal antitrust law enforcers    the FTC and the Justice Department  Sen  Schumer is also the author of the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act with Senator John McCain  R AZ    The Schumer McCain law  which was enacted in 2003  shut down loopholes that drug companies created in Hatch Waxman law  enabling generic drugs to be brought to market sooner  and lowering the cost of prescriptions for millions of Americans
