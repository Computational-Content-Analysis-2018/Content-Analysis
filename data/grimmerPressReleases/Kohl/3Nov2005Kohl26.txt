Kohl  Harkin  Bayh  Obama Co Sponsor Effort to Fully Fund Enforcement of Child Support Payments                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    November 3  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        Kohl  Harkin  Bayh  Obama Co Sponsor Effort to Fully Fund Enforcement of Child Support Payments  Senators say enforcing child support payments helps children  saves taxpayer dollars    Washington  D C     U S  Senators Herb Kohl Tom Harkin  D IA   Evan Bayh  D IN  and Barack Obama  D IL   today co sponsored an amendment expressing the Sense of the Senate in support of maintaining funding for a federal program responsible for enforcing child support payments   The program is currently in danger of having its budget cut by 40 percent  despite its success in bringing back more than  4 in child support for every  1 spent on enforcement     By cutting funds for child support payment enforcement  we are pursuing a foolish fiscal policy and unduly jeopardizing our children   said Senator Kohl   Promoting parental responsibility is vital and these cuts will ultimately hurt the children that need our help the most     Gutting this extremely effective program is penny wise  and pound foolish   Senator Harkin said    Child support payments keep thousands of Iowa children out of poverty   When parents don t live up to their responsibilities  strong enforcement of child supports laws keeps our families self sufficient    Parents who try to skip out on their responsibilities to their children should know that the government will make every effort to hold them accountable for their actions   Senator Bayh said    Child support payments provide critical advantages to children and help ensure that they have a good start in life  while saving taxpayers millions of dollars   This program ensures that parents live up to their responsibilities and helps provide a brighter future for millions of children     Each year  millions of children count on child support payments to help lift them out of poverty and meet their most basic needs   said Senator Obama   If this program is cut  over the next 10 years Illinois kids could be deprived of up to  500 million in child support payments  These cuts are immoral and I urge the Senate to reject them   Sixty percent of all children living apart from a parent receive child support payments as a result of the federal child support program  and 84 percent of low income children depend on payments secured by the program   If funding for the enforcement program is cut as is currently suggested  children across the country would lose more than  24 billion in support payments over the next ten years  a loss that would likely increase reliance on services provided at taxpayer expense  such as Medicaid  food stamps and subsidized housing  In addition to the savings it represents to taxpayers  the federal child support program helps ensure a stronger start in life for millions of children across the country   Children who receive child support payments do better in school than those who do not receive payments and are more likely to attend college   Child support helps lift more than one million Americans out of poverty each year and makes it more likely for families to find and keep jobs
