KOHL MEETS WITH MILWAUKEE FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE TO DISCUSS FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP IN COMBATTING CRIME                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 7  2007     Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL MEETS WITH MILWAUKEE FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE TO DISCUSS FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP IN COMBATTING CRIME     WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Herb Kohl and the Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  office in Milwaukee  Richard Ruminski  met this morning in Kohl s Washington Senate office to discuss ongoing efforts to combat violent crime in Milwaukee  Kohl is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  which has oversight over the FBI  and has been a critic of the Administration s funding cuts to successful local crime prevention and law enforcement programs  Last month  Kohl raised the issue with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales when he testified before the committee during an oversight hearing  The Attorney General agreed to study the rise in violent crime in Milwaukee and pledged to report back to U S  Senator Herb Kohl about what can be done to reverse the trend    I m encouraged by the cooperation we see in Milwaukee between federal  state and local law enforcement  The FBI office in Milwaukee is doing tremendous work with a dedicated and talented staff  But we re asking the impossible to expect our police to do more with less  and federal cuts to programs that put more cops on the street have clearly taken their toll   Kohl said  Kohl noted that there are nearly 2 200 fewer FBI agents devoted to traditional crime since 2000 due to a shift in the bureau to counter terrorism  In addition  funding cuts in the COPS program have meant that the Milwaukee Police Department  which received  1 million from the COPS program in 2002  received no funding at all last year to hire new officers  As a result  between 2002 and 2005  the Milwaukee Police Department s forces were reduced by 55 police officers  leaving it with nearly 200 vacancies in a force of 2 000   Earlier this year  Kohl raised the same issue with FBI Director Robert Mueller during another Judiciary Committee oversight hearing  Mueller said that he supported joint task forces with federal  state and local law enforcement and that he would take a specific look at Milwaukee
