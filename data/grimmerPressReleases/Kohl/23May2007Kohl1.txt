KOHL WEIGHS IN WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  FCC TO OPPOSE XM SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO MERGER                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    May 23  2007     Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL WEIGHS IN WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  FCC TO OPPOSE XM SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO MERGER Senator is Chairman of the Antitrust  Competition Policy and Consumer Rights Panel    WASHINGTON    Saying that the proposed merger of XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio  would cause substantial harm to competition and consumers   U S  Senator Herb Kohl today urged the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  and the head of the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice  DoJ  to block the deal  The proposed merger is currently under review by the two federal agencies  Kohl is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee s Antitrust  Competition Policy and Consumer Rights Subcommittee  which held a hearing on March 20th to examine the XM Sirius merger    Elimination of the head to head competition currently offered by XM and Sirius leaving only a monopoly satellite radio service will likely result in higher prices and poorer service being offered to consumers  Satellite radio is a unique service for which none of the other audio services is a substitute  Uncertain promises of competition from new technologies tomorrow do not protect consumers from higher prices today   Kohl said  The full text of Kohl s letter to the DoJ and the FCC is attached  May 23  2007 The Honorable Thomas Barnett  Assistant Attorney General  Antitrust Division  United States Department of Justice The Honorable Kevin Martin  Chairman  Federal Communications Commission Dear Assistant Attorney General Barnett and Chairman Martin  I write to you concerning the proposed merger between XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio  now under review at the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission  The Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust  Competition Policy and Consumer Rights recently held a hearing to examine the competitive issues surrounding this merger  and we have now completed our examination of this transaction  I have concluded this merger  if permitted to proceed  would cause substantial harm to competition and consumers  would be contrary to antitrust law and not in the public interest  and therefore should be blocked by your agencies  As you know  XM and Sirius are the only two providers of satellite radio service in the United States  If satellite radio is considered to be a distinct market  this merger is to a two to one merger to monopoly and should be forbidden under the antitrust laws  If satellite radio is a separate market  the combined firm will have the ability to raise price to consumers  who will have no choice to accept the price increase  Such a result should be unacceptable under antitrust law and as a matter of communications policy  It is my conclusion that satellite radio is in fact a separate market  I reach this conclusion for the following reasons  Satellite radio is the only medium offering hundreds of radio channels  170 channels in the case of XM and more than 75 in the case of Sirius  with a tremendous variety of music formats  entertainment programming  live sports on a national basis and extensive news programming  Satellite radio is delivered in far superior sound quality to terrestrial radio and is largely commercial free  Satellite radio is a national service  delivered to consumers on a nationwide basis  and travels with listeners as they move about the country in their automobiles  where the majority of radio listening occurs  No other audio service existing currently is a viable substitute for satellite radio  Unlike the national nature of satellite radio  terrestrial radio is locally based  and has a much more limited number of radio stations than satellite radio s channels in any local geographic market  Terrestrial radio cannot move with listeners as they travel to different cities  does not offer the variety of programming available on satellite radio  including  for example  out of town sports broadcasts or specialized music formats   and offers inferior audio quality   Nor are newer technologies a substitute for satellite radio  MP3 players such as iPods cannot offer the programming offered on satellite radio  such as live news and sports broadcasts  And with the cost of music commonly priced at about one dollar per song  it would cost consumers many thousands of dollars to legally duplicate on an MP3 player the musical offerings available on satellite radio  Nor is wireless internet radio a competitive alternative today  There are very few devices to receive wireless internet radio presently available to consumers  Even more important  the technology to deliver wireless internet to listeners in their automobiles as they travel between cities  and to a large extent within cities  is virtually unavailable  No other technology available today is a substitute for the satellite radio  The lack of a viable competitive alternative existing today to the satellite radio monopoly created by this merger is a sufficient independent reason to block this merger  The merger s proponents  however  argue that new technologies will in the future create competitive alternatives  However  only new entry that is  timely  is properly considered to be a competitive alternative under antitrust analysis   Timely  means likely to be on the market within the next two years  No new technology satisfies this requirement  The deficiencies of the new technologies previously identified making these technologies an unsuitable competitive alternative are unlikely to be remedied in the next two years  While it is possible that wireless internet radio  for example  could become a viable competitive alternative sometime in the future  our concern is the marketplace today  Consumers should not suffer the price increases likely to result from a merger to monopoly because of a vague hope that new technologies may deliver new competitive alternatives sometime in the future  In addition  the parties concede that  due to the enormous capital expenditure running into billions of dollars for new satellites  as well as the regulatory difficulties in obtaining new spectrum licenses  the parties concede that the entry of a new satellite radio service is unlikely  When asked by at our hearing on March 20  2007  whether entry by another satellite radio company was likely  the CEO of Sirius  Mel Karmazin responded that  I do have a clear answer to that question        You re asking whether I think there will be another satellite competitor  the answer will be  probably not   Without the possibility of new entry of a new satellite competitor  and without the existence of any true competitive alternative from any other audio service  the combination of Sirius and XM will result in a merger to monopoly  Some public interest advocates have argued that the merger should be subject to binding conditions to protect competition and consumers as an alternative to being blocked  The conditions proposed include  i  a price cap on satellite radio service for a meaningful period of time after the merger   ii  new pricing choices such as tiered programming  and  iii  the combined company making available a designated portion of its capacity  i e   5 10   for educational  informational or independent entertainment programming over which it has no editorial control  However  I believe that none of these conditions would be sufficient to ameliorate the substantial harm to competition caused by this merger   At our hearing  Sirius promised to enter into a price cap after the merger  In answers to written follow up questions  Mel Karmazin stated that   f ollowing the merger  we will not raise either the   12 95 that each satellite radio company currently charges consumers  or the   26 dollars  sic  that it costs to get both services   He further agreed to this commitment as part of an enforceable FCC order or antitrust consent decree  See Karmazin Answer to Sen  Kohl s Follow Up Question 1  copy attached   However  I am concerned that even if either of your agencies were willing to enter into such a decree  enforcement of such a decree might mean that the satellite radio industry would be subject to intrusive governmental regulation for years to come  A competitive marketplace that would not require extensive regulatory oversight is far preferable  and such a competitive marketplace can only be assured by blocking this merger  In sum  because this merger will result in a satellite radio monopoly  it will violate section 7 of the Clayton Act which forbids any merger or acquisition when  the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition  or tend to create a monopoly   Elimination of the head to head competition currently offered by XM and Sirius leaving only a monopoly satellite radio service will likely result in higher prices and poorer service being offered to consumers  Satellite radio is a unique service for which none of the other audio services is a substitute  Uncertain promises of competition from new technologies tomorrow do not protect consumers from higher prices today  The antitrust laws should not countenance such a dangerous outcome  I therefore urge the Justice Department to bring a legal action to block this merger   Further  because of the likely harm to competition and consumers  we believe this merger is not in the public interest  and we likewise urge the FCC to deny approval to this merger under the Communications Act  Nor has there any basis demonstrated for the FCC to eliminate its rule    first promulgated when satellite radio was licensed in 1997    that there be at least two licensees for satellite radio   I therefore urge that both of your agencies take all necessary actions to deny approval of this merger and prevent the creation of this satellite radio monopoly  Thank you for your attention to this matter  Sincerely  HERB KOHL Chairman  Subcommittee on Antitrust  Competition Policy and Consumer Rights
