WISCONSIN LAWMAKERS CONTINUE FIGHT TO PROTECT WISCONSIN MILITARY FACILITIES                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    May 13  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        WISCONSIN LAWMAKERS CONTINUE FIGHT TO PROTECT WISCONSIN MILITARY FACILITIES      WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Herb Kohl  Russ Feingold and Congressman Ron Kind and Congresswoman Gwen Moore today issued the following joint statement in response to the Department of Defense Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission announcement this morning  Initial review of the BRAC list shows that Wisconsin will not lose any National Guard bases or units  and all Guardsmen and women will stay in Wisconsin  The list recommends the closure of the 440th Airlift Wing in Milwaukee  however  and the realignment of Ft  McCoy    After initial review of the BRAC impact list released this morning  it appears that the administration intends for most Wisconsin military installations to continue providing valuable assistance and resources to our Armed Forces  However  we are extremely disappointed that the administration is proposing to close the 440th in Milwaukee  which continues to be a vital resource for the military  And while it remains to be known what the exact impact of the Fort McCoy realignment plan will be  we remain committed to helping ensure the economic vitality of Ft  McCoy and the surrounding area  Throughout this process we have worked together and extensively with communities to prepare for the 2005 BRAC round and provide information to accurately inform the DOD in its decision making process  Having examined the DOD s criteria in selecting military installations for closure and realignment  we feel that all Wisconsin installations fulfill  and in many circumstances exceed  the standards of the criteria  As we move into the next phase of the 2005 BRAC process  we intend to exhaust all available options to protect the 440th  Fort McCoy and the other Wisconsin military facilities   The four Wisconsin lawmakers  along with Governor Doyle and local leaders  prepared a series of reports detailing the importance of Wisconsin s military installations that have been presented to Pentagon officials involved in the decision making process   The BRAC Commission will review the Secretary s list of proposed closures and is scheduled to submit the final list to President Bush for review and approval by September 8  2005  The President can either approve or disapprove the entire BRAC list  If approved  the list is submitted to Congress for a vote on the entire list within 45 days  If Congress fails to act  the list is automatically approved and has the  force and effect of law   If the President disapproves the BRAC recommendations  a revised list from the commission is due to the President by October 20  2005
