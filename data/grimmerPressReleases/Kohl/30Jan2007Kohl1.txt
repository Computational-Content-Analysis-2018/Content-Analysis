ANTITRUST SUBCOMMITTEE AGENDA FOR 2007     U S  Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust  Competition Policy  and Consumer Rights  and Senator Orrin Hatch  R UT   Ranking Member  have announced an active agenda of hearings and legislation for 2007     In the upcoming year  the Antitrust Subcommittee will continue to engage in active  ongoing oversight over the antitrust agencies and the nation s key industries   Our goal will be to ensure that our antitrust laws are vigorously applied so that consumers see the benefits of full and free competition   Senator Kohl said    I look forward to working with Senator Hatch and continuing our Subcommittee s proud tradition of strong and bipartisan antitrust oversight    This is an exciting time to examine antitrust issues facing the nation   Hatch said   I have tremendous respect for Sen  Kohl  and I look forward to collaborating with him as we guide the work of the Subcommittee this Congress   In 2007  the Subcommittee plans to address the following issues    Overseeing the Antitrust Enforcement Agencies The Subcommittee expects to engage in close scrutiny of the government s antitrust enforcement activities at both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission  including holding an antitrust oversight hearing   Issues to be examined will be merger enforcement  the government s pursuit of civil non merger cases  such as monopolization and unilateral anti competitive practices  and criminal antitrust enforcement     The Justice Department s implementation of the 2004 Tunney Act amendments designed to ensure meaningful judicial review of antitrust settlements will also be scrutinized      Pharmaceutical Industry In this era of ever rising health care and prescription drug costs  the Subcommittee will make competition in the pharmaceutical industry a priority   A particular focus will be eliminating barriers to the entry of generic competition to brand name drugs    The Subcommittee will also closely scrutinize the continuing consolidation among companies in the pharmaceutical benefits management  PBM  business to ensure that this consolidation does not create any anti competitive bottlenecks   Additionally  Senator Kohl intends to pursue legislation to ban  reverse payment  patent settlements in which brand name drug manufacturers pay off generic drug manufacturers to delay the entry of generic competition            Gasoline  Natural Gas  and Oil Markets Energy In this time of continued high prices for crude oil and gasoline  the Subcommittee will focus on bringing increased competition to the oil industry as a means of restraining energy price increases    Our efforts will include monitoring and oversight of the Federal Trade Commission s investigations into allegations of anti competitive behavior as well as its continuing project to observe and track changes in gasoline prices in order to uncover any potentially anticompetitive behavior     We will also continue to engage in oversight to ensure that the FTC and Justice Department take all necessary action to prosecute those who attempt to engage in anti competitive conduct  price gouging or market manipulation    Senator Kohl intends to pursue legislation to enhance antitrust enforcement in the oil and gas industry  including legislation to bring the actions of the OPEC oil cartel under the jurisdiction of U S  antitrust law  and legislation to increase antitrust scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions in the oil and gas industry     Airline Competition Another important issue the Subcommittee expects to scrutinize will be ensuring full and robust competition in the airline industry   Airline consolidation will be a particular focus in the wake of several merger proposals at the beginning of the year  We will closely examine the likely effects on competition of these proposed airline mergers  We will also continue to examine any non merger conduct of airlines that raises competition concerns     Railroad Competition  The Subcommittee will examine the competitiveness of the railroad industry and whether shippers  communities  and small businesses who depend on rail transportation have been the victims of anti competitive practices when dealing with dominant railroad shippers   Senator Kohl intends to pursue legislation to remove obsolete antitrust exemptions protecting the railroad industry  exemptions that eliminate the ability of those aggrieved by anti competitive practices or transactions to seek antitrust remedies               Telecommunications We plan to continue to examine closely competition in the rapidly consolidating telecommunications industry in the year ahead     Maintaining competitive choices in this industry is crucial to consumers and the health of the national economy   In the wake of the Verizon MCI  AT SBC  and AT Bell South mergers of the past two years  we will focus carefully on the state of competition in this industry    Our subcommittee intends to advocate for proposed changes to the Telecommunications Act to promote competition in the telecommunications market and consider ways the Justice Department can play a role in protecting that competition     We will also examine the need for network neutrality protections  so that consumers continue to have the freedom to access the internet content they wish without interference from their internet service provider                Media Cable Satellite In this era of continued consolidation in the media sector  the Subcommittee will continue to focus on competitive conditions in these vital industries  We will continue to examine the effects of media consolidation on the marketplace of ideas  on diversity of ownership in the media  and on the ability of independent content producers to distribute their products   As cable television rates continue to rise  we will also continue to emphasize bringing increased competition to the cable and satellite television market  by such means as examining program access issues and ensuring that competitors to incumbent cable companies are not subject to predatory conduct and also evaluate the impact of new technology and new competitive options available to consumers    We will also review the need for renewal of the program access law so that all cable and satellite providers will continue to have access to  must have  programming necessary to compete              Agriculture The Subcommittee intends to examine competition in agricultural markets    Issues to be examined will be consolidation in the agricultural sector  the danger of monopsony buying power as a result of agricultural consolidation  inequities in bargaining power held by processors over farmers and ranchers  and the competitive impact of mergers in the seed industry            Hospital Purchasing of Medical Products The Subcommittee will continue its work to ensure that hospital group purchasing organizations   GPOs   operate as intendedmaking sure they do not harm competition and innovation in the markets for medical devices but instead lower costs for hospitals  medical caregivers  and patients   The Subcommittee s hearings and investigatory and oversight efforts into this issue over the past several years have resulted in the nation s leading GPOs agreeing to voluntary reforms to their business practices  including the creation of a new self regulatory organization  the Healthcare Group Purchasing Industry Initiative   The Subcommittee will continue its examination of whether the Initiative is adequate to assure the industry s voluntary reforms are permanent and enforceable  or whether legislation is necessary to assure this result            International Markets The Subcommittee plans to examine closely how U S  multinational companies have been affected by different antitrust regimes in various countries   Complying with the antitrust laws of different countries  which often have different substantive or procedural rules  is increasingly becoming a burden on U S  businesses and thus merits review by the Subcommittee   In recent years  the Subcommittee has worked closely with U S  and international enforcement authorities to address these concerns and will to continue to do so                 Antitrust Modernization Commission  The Antitrust Modernization Commission is due to issue its final report in April 2007   The Antitrust Subcommittee will closely review and consider the recommendations for antitrust law reform contained in the report  and will consider whether any legislation is necessary to implement those recommendations in the report that the Subcommittee concludes are meritorious                  Industry Standards Because voluntary industry standards often involve significant coordination and cooperation among horizontal competitors  they have given rise to frequent allegation of anticompetitive behavior   Given the number of ongoing controversies regarding both the pro competitive and anticompetitive effects of industry standards and standard setting processes  and the recent activities of antitrust enforcement entities  the Antitrust Subcommittee intends to examine this issue carefully and will consider whether legislation in this area would be advisable
