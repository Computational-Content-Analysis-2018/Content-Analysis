BYRD  KOHL  PRESIDENT S VETO THREAT JEOPARDIZES NUTRITION PROGRAM IN AG APPROPS BILL                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    November 1  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        BYRD  KOHL  PRESIDENT S VETO THREAT JEOPARDIZES NUTRITION PROGRAM IN AG APPROPS BILL     WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Robert C  Byrd  D WV  and Herb Kohl  D WI  today warned the head of the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  that President Bush s threat to veto the Agriculture Appropriations bill jeopardizes the health of millions of women and children served by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women  Infants and Children  WIC   WIC helps preserve the health of low income women  infants  and children up to age 5 by providing them with nourishing foods and healthy eating guidance   In their letter to Acting Secretary Chuck Conner  the Senators write   the Administration s FY 2008 budget request  submitted in February  included an increase of  182 million for the WIC program Since then  food costs and participation have continued to rise   Consequently  the amount necessary to ensure that the WIC program is fully funded has increased significantly   The latest estimates from the non partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities state that  5 929 billion will be needed an increase of  542 million above the President s request level  and an increase of  209 million above the current level provided by the Senate    Byrd and Kohl have requested an update from Conner on the amount his agency estimates is now necessary to fully fund the WIC program   Earlier this year  President Bush threatened to veto any domestic spending bill with a price tag over his Administration s budget request   Byrd is the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations committee  Kohl is the Chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee  Full text of the letter follows  Mr  Chuck Conner Acting Secretary U  S  Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Avenue  SW Washington  DC  20250      November 1  2007 Dear Mr  Conner   On August 28th  2007  former Secretary Johanns wrote to the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Agriculture   In this letter  Congress was encouraged to pass the Agriculture Appropriations bill quickly  and at a level that would not exceed the President s budget request   In this letter  Secretary Johanns stated   I am confident the top line amount set for the Department of Agriculture will enable us to successfully accomplish our mission    We appreciate the Administration s desire for fiscal responsibility and quick action on Appropriations bills   However  since the President s budget was submitted to Congress  there have been economic changes that have resulted in a significantly higher funding need for the single largest discretionary account in the Agriculture Appropriations bill  the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women  Infants and Children  WIC    As you know  the Administration s FY 2008 budget request  submitted in February  included an increase of  182 million for the WIC program   By the time the Senate bill was passed out of the Appropriations Committee on July 24th  an increase of  333 million above the Administration s request was necessary to fully fund the WIC program   While a portion of this increase was necessary because the Senate rejected the Administration s proposal to cap administrative funding  which would have had a very negative effect on states  abilities to effectively serve WIC recipients  the vast majority of this increase was a direct result of increased food costs and slightly increased participation    information collected by USDA   Since then  food costs and participation have continued to rise   Consequently  the amount necessary to ensure that the WIC program is fully funded has increased significantly   The latest estimates from the non partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities state that  5 929 billion will be needed in FY 2008 to serve all eligible WIC applicants   This would require that the Congress provide the WIC program with an increase of  542 million above the President s request level  and an increase of  209 million above the current level provided by the Senate     These estimates are determined using the most current food cost data from the USDA Economic Research Service and the latest available USDA data on WIC participation  among other factors   Obviously  increases of this magnitude cannot be covered by the WIC contingency fund  and all indications are that the need will continue to grow     To date  USDA has not submitted any of this additional information to the Congress  and we are hopeful that it is not the Administration s intent for people to be turned away from the WIC program in FY 2008   Therefore  we would appreciate an updated estimate from USDA on the amount necessary to fully fund the WIC program  including whether it is the Administration s belief that the original budget request is still adequate     If USDA agrees that additional WIC funding is required  we would invite suggestions as to where  within the President s budget request  offsets should be found  so as to remain consistent with Secretary Johanns  earlier statement that the top line amount set for USDA is appropriate   We look forward to working with you to ensure that this vital nutrition program is not maintained at the expense of other important rural development  conservation  research  and food safety programs    Sincerely  Robert C  Byrd Chairman Committee on Appropriations Herb Kohl Chairman Subcommittee on Agriculture  Rural Development  and Related Agencies
