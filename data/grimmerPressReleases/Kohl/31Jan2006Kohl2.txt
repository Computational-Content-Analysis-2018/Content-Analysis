STATEMENT OF U S  SENATOR HERB KOHL ON THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    January 31  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        STATEMENT OF U S  SENATOR HERB KOHL ON THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS      I give the President credit for making health care an important part of his agenda tonight  but I m concerned that his proposals will do little to rein in the costs of health care and reduce the number of uninsured Americans   While expanding HSAs might help some people  the health care concerns I hear about from people at home require a broader approach  We need to tackle a major force behind rising health care costs    prescription drugs    by allowing the government to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies for lower prices   We also need to address all the serious problems and confusion surrounding the Medicare Part D implementation  which are denying many Senior Citizens the health care they need  The President also talked about the progress being made in Iraq   I hope we will hear more details from him soon about how 2006 will be a year of significant transition toward Iraqi sovereignty so that we can vastly reduce our commitment there
