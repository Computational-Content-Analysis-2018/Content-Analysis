STATEMENT OF SEN  KOHL ON THE CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 3  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        STATEMENT OF SEN  KOHL ON THE CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT     Mr  Chairman  thank you for scheduling the class action bill for committee consideration today and for your support and assistance in improving this bill   There are many people to thank as this bill has undergone a great deal of revision and improvement as we arrive at this final compromise product   Senators Grassley  Carper  Hatch  Feinstein  Schumer  and Dodd have all played essential roles in shepherding this bill to this stage   All of them  and many others  deserve a great deal of credit for the success of this bill   This legislation addresses the continuing problems in class action litigation  particularly unfair and abusive settlements that shortchange consumers across America  The time for this bill has come   We have worked together on a bipartisan basis on this legislation in past Congresses   In fact  versions of this bill have passed the House of Representatives on two occasions in the past   In the Senate  we passed this bill through the Judiciary Committee in each of the last two Congresses and came within one vote of gaining cloture on the bill    We worked successfully to substantially improve this bill during the last Congress   As a result of the interest of Senators Feinstein  Dodd  Schumer and Landrieu  we have changed the bill in important ways   Now  only cases that are truly national in scope will be tried primarily in the federal courts   Cases that primarily involve people from only one state and that interpret state law will remain in state court   These changes will ensure that class action cases are handled efficiently and in the appropriate venues and that no case that has merit will be turned away  We have a simple story to tell   Consumers are too often getting the short end of the stick in class action cases  recovering coupons or pocket change  while their lawyers reap millions   Many of these complex class action cases proceed exactly as we would hope   Injured parties  represented by strong advocates  get their day in court or reach a positive settlement that is good for the parties and handled well by their attorney    Unfortunately  this is not how it always works   Rather  more and more frequently  some are taking advantage of the system and  as a result  consumers are getting the short end of the stick  recovering coupons or pocket change  while the real reward is going to others   The Washington Post put it clearly   no portion of the American civil justice system is more of a mess than the world of class actions   Our remedy is straightforward   Consumers deserve notices that are written in plain English so they can understand their rights and responsibilities in the lawsuit   Too many of the class action notices are designed to be impossible to comprehend   Further  if the cases are settled  the notice to the class members must clearly describe the terms of the settlement  the benefits to each plaintiff and a summary of the attorneys fees in the case and how they were calculated   We are grateful that the Federal Judicial Conference has adopted our idea and has already begun to improve the notices provided to class action plaintiffs  Second  state attorneys general should be notified of proposed class action settlements to stop abusive cases if they want   This encourages a neutral third party to weigh in on whether a settlement is fair and to alert the court if they do not believe that it is   The Attorney General review is an extra layer of security for the plaintiffs and is designed to ensure that abusive settlements are not approved without a critical review by one or more experts  Third  a class action consumer bill of rights will help limit coupon or other unfair settlements  Finally  we allow many class action lawsuits to be removed to federal court   This is only common sense  These are national cases affecting consumers in 50 states   If the court rules were being drafted today  these are exactly the types of cases which we would want and expect to be tried in federal court  Stories of nightmare class action settlements that affect consumers around the country are all too frequent   For example  a suit against Blockbuster video yielded dollar off coupons for future video rentals for the plaintiffs while their attorneys collected  9 25 million   In California state court  a class of 40 million consumers received  13 rebates on their next purchase of a computer or monitor    in other words they had to purchase hundreds of dollars more of the defendants  product to redeem the coupons   In essence  the plaintiffs received nothing  while their attorneys took almost  6 million in legal fees   We could list many  many more examples  but let me discuss just one more case that is almost too strange to believe  I am speaking about the Bank of Boston class action suit and the outrageous case of Martha Preston from Baraboo  Wisconsin   She was an unnamed class member of a class action lawsuit against her mortgage company that ended in a settlement   The plaintiffs  lawyers were supposed to represent her   Instead  the settlement that they negotiated for her was a bad joke   She received four dollars and change in the lawsuit  while her attorneys pocketed  8 million    Yet  the huge sums her attorneys received were not the worst of the story   Soon after receiving her four dollars  Ms  Preston discovered that her lawyers took  80  twenty times her recovery  from her escrow account to help pay their fees   Naturally shocked  she and the other plaintiffs sued the lawyers who quickly turned around and sued her in Alabama  a state she had never visited  for  25 million   Not only was she  75 poorer for her class action experience  but she also had to defend herself against a  25 million suit by the very people who took advantage of her in the first place  No one can argue with a straight face that the class action process is not in serious need of reform    Comprehensive studies support the anecdotes we have discussed   For example  a study on the class action problem by the Manhattan Institute demonstrates that class action cases are being brought disproportionately in a few counties where plaintiffs expect to be able to take advantage of lax certification rules  The study focused on three county courts   Madison County  Illinois  Jefferson County  Texas  and Palm Beach County  Florida   that have seen a steep rise in class action filings over the last several years that seems disproportional to their populations   They found that rural Madison County  Illinois ranked third nationwide  after Los Angeles County  California and Cook County  Illinois  in the estimated number of class actions filed each year  whereas rural Jefferson County and Palm Beach County ranked eighth and ninth  respectively    As plaintiff attorneys found that Madison County was a welcoming host  the number of class action suits filed there rose 1850  between 1998 and 2000  Another trend evident in the research was the use of  cut and paste  complaints in which plaintiffs  attorneys file a number of suits against different defendants in the same industry challenging standard industry practices   For example  in one situation  six law firms filed nine nearly identical class actions in Madison County in the same week alleging that the automobile insurance industry is defrauding Americans in the way that they calculate claims rates for totaled vehicles  The system is not working as intended and needs to be fixed   The way to fix it is to move more of these cases currently being brought in small state courts like Madison County  Illinois to federal court    The federal courts are better venues for class actions for a variety of reasons articulated clearly in a RAND study   RAND proposed three primary explanations why these cases should be in federal court    First  federal judges scrutinize class action allegations more strictly than state judges  and deny certification in situations where a state judge might grant it improperly   Second  state judges may not have adequate resources to oversee and manage class actions with a national scope   Finally  if a single judge is to be charged with deciding what law will apply in a multistate class action  it is more appropriate that this take place in federal court than in state court   We all know that class actions can result in significant and important benefits for class members and society  and that most class lawyers and most state courts are acting responsibly    Class actions have been used to desegregate racially divided schools  to obtain redress for victims of employment discrimination  and to compensate individuals exposed to toxic chemicals or defective products   Class actions increase access to our civil justice system because they enable people to pursue claims that collectively would otherwise be too expensive to litigate  The difficulty in any effort to improve a basically good system is weeding out the abuses without causing undue damage    The legislation we propose attempts to do this  Let me emphasize the limited scope of this legislation   We do not close the courthouse door to any class action   We do not require that state attorneys general do anything with the notice they receive   We do not deny reasonable fees for class lawyers   And we do not mandate that every class action be brought in federal court   Instead  we simply promote closer and fairer scrutiny of class actions and class settlements   Right now  people across the country can be dragged into lawsuits unaware of their rights and unarmed on the legal battlefield   What our bill does is give back to regular people their rights and representation  This measure may not stop all abuses  but it moves us forward   It will help ensure that unsuspecting people like Martha Preston don t get ripped off  We believe this is a moderate approach to correct the worst abuses  while preserving the benefits of class actions   It is both pro consumer and pro defendant   We believe it will make a difference
