BIDEN KOHL EFFORT TO RESTORE COPS FUNDING APPROVED BY U S  SENATE                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    October 17  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        BIDEN KOHL EFFORT TO RESTORE COPS FUNDING APPROVED BY U S  SENATE      WASHINGTON    The U S  Senate last night approved the FY2008 Justice Department Appropriations Bill  which includes an amendment sponsored by Sens  Joseph Biden  D DE  and Herb Kohl  D WI  to provide  110 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  Universal Hiring Program   The funding will allow local law enforcement departments to hire approximately 1 400 new police officers across the county  Years of decreases in COPS funding have led to fewer patrol officers on the streets and an increase in violent crime   The Biden Kohl amendment directs funding to COPS hiring for the first time in three years  and even then there was merely  10 million budgeted for police hiring for FY2005    Police chiefs and Sheriffs throughout Wisconsin agree that the COPS program was a helpful federal effort that gave a boost to local law enforcement and led to a decrease in crime in big and small communities alike   Despite its success  the Administration has repeatedly slashed funding for the program and many of the gains have evaporated   We hope today s funding will help reverse that trend   Kohl said  Due in part to cuts in COPS program funding  the Milwaukee Police Department  for example  has 227 vacancies   The Hiring Program provides federal funding for 75 percent of a newly hired entry level officer s salary and benefits  up to a maximum amount of  75 000 per officer  over the course of the three year grant period   Departments are generally required to contribute at least 25 percent in local matching funds  unless the recipient agency is approved for a waiver of the local match based upon a demonstration of extraordinary fiscal hardship   The COPS program  administered through the Department of Justice  was passed into law in 1994   The goal was to place 100 000 new officers on the beat by 2000    a goal that was realized ahead of time and under budget   COPS grant programs also include assistance for purchasing new technologies and equipment that result in officers spending more time on the streets  and financing the training of former military personnel for local law enforcement
