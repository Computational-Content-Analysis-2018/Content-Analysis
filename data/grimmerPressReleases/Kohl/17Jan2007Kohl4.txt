KOHL  LEAHY  GRASSLEY  SCHUMER  FEINGOLD INTRODUCE BILL TO STOP  PAYOFFS  THAT DELAY GENERIC DRUGS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    January 17  2007       Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL  LEAHY  GRASSLEY  SCHUMER  FEINGOLD INTRODUCE BILL TO STOP  PAYOFFS  THAT DELAY GENERIC DRUGS     Washington  D C    Today  top Senate Judiciary Committee members Herb Kohl  D WI   Patrick Leahy  D VT   Chuck Grassley  R IA   Charles Schumer  D NY  and Russ Feingold  D WI  will introduce the  Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act  in the 110th Congress to explicitly prohibit brand name drug manufacturers from using pay off agreements to keep cheaper generic equivalents off the market   Leahy  chairman of the Judiciary Committee  held a hearing today to examine the issue  Federal Trade Commissioner Jon Leibowitz and former Congressman Billy Tauzin  now CEO of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  PhRMA   were on hand to discuss the impact these agreements have on the pharmaceutical market   When big brand name drug companies pay generic manufacturers to stop generic drugs from reaching pharmacy shelves  consumers lose big time   Kohl said   We can t say we care about the high cost of prescription drugs while turning a blind eye to backroom deals between brand and generic drug companies  This practice has got to stop    Leahy said   Some drug firms have colluded to pad their profits by forcing consumers to pay higher prices than they would pay for lower cost generics   Now that this sweetheart dealing has been uncovered  we owe it to consumers to end it   Our bill is a clear cut opportunity to remove an impediment to competition that prevents the marketplace from working as it should    to benefit consumers  and not just the drug companies    In 2005  two appellate court decisions overturned Federal Trade Commission s  FTC  long standing position against this practice and upheld settlements that include such pay offs  Last year s Supreme Court dismissal of the FTC s latest appeal prompted lawmakers to introduce this important bill    Recently  the dramatic increase in wheeling and dealing between brand name and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have only ended up delaying the entry of less costly medicines in the marketplace  leaving the bill to the consumer   These deals also threaten the sustainability of federal health care programs  such as Medicare and Medicaid   It s important that the Federal Trade Commission have as many tools as possible in its arsenal to protect the American public from these types of anti competitive agreements   Grassley said    When consumers have access to lower cost drugs  we all win   Schumer said   But as long as we let stand the appellate court decisions that encourage brand and generic companies to split up the pie between them and not give the consumer a fork  we are accepting higher drug prices for the average American     The current high prescription drug prices take a particularly heavy toll on sick and low income individuals who desperately need life saving medicines   It is time for Congress to ensure that a truly competitive marketplace for prescription drugs is in place    one that will help bring down the skyrocketing prices in this country   Feingold said   A FTC report found that in the six months following the 2005 court decisions  there were three settlement agreements in which the generic company received compensation and agreed to a restriction on its ability to market the product   Additionally  the FTC found that at least seven settlement agreements made in 2006 included a pay off from the brand manufacturer in exchange for a promise by the generic company to delay entry into the market  According to a study released last year by Pharmaceutical Care Management Association  PCMA   health plans and consumers could save  26 4 billion over the next five years by using the generic versions of 14 popular drugs that are scheduled to lose their patent protections before 2010  Kohl and Leahy have also introduced S  25  Citizen Petition Fairness and Accuracy Act of 2007  legislation that prohibits brand name drug companies from abusing the Food and Drug Administration s  FDA   citizen petition  review process  In 2003  Senators Grassley and Leahy were able to include their Drug Competition Act in the Medicare Modernization Act  The Drug Act required companies such as Schering Plough to report all proposed deals with potential generic competitors  which were often previously worked out in secret  to the federal antitrust law enforcers   the FTC and the Justice Department  Sen  Schumer is also the author of the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act with Senator John McCain  R AZ    The Schumer McCain law  which was enacted in 2003  shut down loopholes that drug companies created in Hatch Waxman law  enabling generic drugs to be brought to market sooner  and lowering the cost of prescriptions for millions of Americans
