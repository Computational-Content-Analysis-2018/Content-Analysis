KOHL CALLS FOR SUBPOENAING OIL COMPANY EXECUTIVES TO TESTIFY BEFORE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ABOUT HIGH FUEL PRICES                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 1  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL CALLS FOR SUBPOENAING OIL COMPANY EXECUTIVES TO TESTIFY BEFORE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ABOUT HIGH FUEL PRICES     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Herb Kohl today urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to issue subpoenas to compel oil industry Chief Executive Officers to appear before the Committee as it examines the driving forces behind high fuel prices   The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on  Consolidation in the Energy Industry  Raising Prices at the Pump   this morning at which representatives of the oil industry refused to appear   Kohl is the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust  Competition Policy and Consumer Rights  and the author of several bills to restore competition in the oil industry   It is simply unconscionable that the industry will not answer the concerns of the American people  through their elected representatives  about the historically high prices of gasoline and home heating fuels   Kohl said at the hearing    The pain felt by consumers is real and it is growing   And while consumers suffer from these price increases  the oil industry seems only to get richer and richer   ExxonMobil this week issued its profit reports showing  10 7 billion in profits for last quarter and more than  36 billion for all of last year   These were the highest profits ever recorded by a U S  corporation    ExxonMobil is not alone    just last week  Chevron reported that its fourth quarter profit climbed 20 percent to  4 14 billion  a company record that continued the most prosperous stretch in the oil company s 126 year history      Mergers and acquisitions in the oil industry    more than 2600 since the 1990s as counted by the General Accounting Office  GAO     have left a dangerous level of consolidation in their wake   The GAO has found that this has led to higher gas prices   This increased industry concentration has another effect    Kohl said that  as demand and prices increase  refining capacity would be expected to expand if the market was competitive    Instead  numerous refineries have been closed    more than half of all those existing 25 years ago    and none have been opened for many years    Refinery capacity has become a bottleneck limiting supply and causing price spikes whenever an accident occurs    Indeed  oil industry critics argue that oil companies have chosen not to expand refining capacity in order to gain market power to keep prices high    And  Kohl said  the statistics seem to bear this out    from 1999 to 2004 U S  oil refiners increased the profits they made on each gallon of gas by 79    Kohl noted that yesterday s Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported gas prices jumped 25 cents on Monday in the Milwaukee area  reaching nearly  2 50 per gallon    The national average price has risen 51  from its level just a year ago   And the price increases for home heating oil and natural gas are following close behind   So it is time for us to think of new solutions and new policies to restore competition in the oil industry   Kohl said    We need to start by ending the refining bottleneck   Kohl urged the Senate to pass S  1979  a bill he introduced to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish and operate a strategic refining reserve    Second  Kohl said that oil companies should not be able to tighten supplies further in times of shortage by exporting needed fuels abroad    He urged passage of S  1996  his bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to stop the exportation of gasoline and home heating oil when the supply falls short at home
