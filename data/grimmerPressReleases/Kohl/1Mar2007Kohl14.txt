KOHL INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH STATE COURT INTERPRETERS GRANT PROGRAM                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 1  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH STATE COURT INTERPRETERS GRANT PROGRAM Program would fund interpreters for non English speakers appearing in court     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Herb Kohl today introduced legislation that would create a federal grant program to support state court interpreter services   Court interpreters assist non English speakers appearing in court as litigants and witnesses   In recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee  Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said that the current lack of qualified court interpreters poses a significant threat to our judicial system and emphasized the importance of addressing the issue   Court interpreting services vary greatly by state    some states have highly developed programs  others are trying to get programs running but lack adequate funds  and still others have no program at all   This inconsistency creates the potential for poorly translated court proceedings  or court proceedings that are not translated at all     Some of the stories associated with this problem are simply unbelievable   For instance  a husband accused of abusing his wife was asked to translate as his wife testified in court   Kohl said    The shortage of qualified interpreters has become a national problem  and it has serious consequences  When interpreters are unqualified or untrained  mistakes are made    and because the lawyers and judges are not interpreters  these mistakes often go unnoticed   In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee  Justice Kennedy described a particularly alarming situation where bilingual jurors can understand what the witness is saying and then interrupt the proceeding when an interpreter has not accurately represented the witness  testimony    This legislation addresses the shortage of qualified court interpreters by authorizing  15 million per year  over five years  for a State Court Interpreter Grant Program   Those states that apply would be eligible for a  100 000 base grant allotment   In addition   5 million would be set aside for states that demonstrate extraordinary need   The remainder of the money would be distributed on a formula basis  determined by the percentage of persons in that state over the age of five who speak a language other than English at home  A lack of qualified interpreters can create serious problems in the justice system   For example  a poorly interpreted trial may be appealed on the grounds that justice was not administered fairly   Those appeals clog up the courts   In addition  where there are inadequate resources available  interpreters may not be able to keep up with the caseload and trials may be delayed unreasonably and in violation of a defendant s right to a speedy trial    When Wisconsin s launched its state court interpreter program in 2004  using state money and a  250 000 federal grant  certified interpreters were scarce   Now  just two years later  it has 43 certified interpreters   Most of those are certified  Spanish language interpreters  where the greatest need exists   However  the state also has interpreters certified in sign language and Russian   The list of provisional interpreters    those who have received training and passed written tests   is much longer and includes individuals trained in Arabic  Hmong  Korean  and other languages
