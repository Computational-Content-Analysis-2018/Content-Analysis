KOHL FIGHTS FOR HEALTH CARE IN SENATE BUDGET SHOWDOWN                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    November 3  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL FIGHTS FOR HEALTH CARE IN SENATE BUDGET SHOWDOWN     WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Herb Kohl today made the following statement on the Senate s approval of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  ANWR  as part of the year end budget bill    There are individual provisions in this overall bad piece of legislation to which I take exception  One is the use of this bill s extraordinary fast track procedures to accomplish what Big Oil proponents have not been able to get through the Senate in the past  opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling    I have long supported protecting this valuable and fragile natural wonder  and I think it is unfortunate that we are drilling in this wilderness for a relatively small payback  I believe we should be looking instead at high oil company profits and encouraging innovative energy alternatives     The outcome of today s vote saddens me    it saddens me for Alaska and for the American people  This is not an energy solution  only a crutch that will deprive future generations of an irreplaceable pristine wilderness and set back progressive solutions to alleviating a true energy crisis
