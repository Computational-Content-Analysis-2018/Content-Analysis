KOHL URGES FINANCE COMMITTEE TO OFFER BUSINESS TAX CREDIT TO RETAIN OLDER WORKERS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    October 26  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL URGES FINANCE COMMITTEE TO OFFER BUSINESS TAX CREDIT TO RETAIN OLDER WORKERS Kohl tax credit to help curb projected labor shortage    WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Herb Kohl yesterday called on Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley to include a business tax credit for hiring and retaining older workers in the Finance Committee s tax reconciliation bill    This proposed tax credit addresses a critical need   said Kohl   to encourage older workers to stay in the workforce longer  and to address the workforce needs of our nation s businesses    As millions of people prepare to exit the workforce  businesses could face a labor shortage of thirty five million workers by 2030  and the projected slowdown in labor force growth could translate into lower economic growth and lowering standards for all age groups   The proposal offered by Kohl is designed to soften the potentially serious impact of these trends by providing a tax credit for employers who offer flexible and part time work to older workers  while protecting them from the loss of pension benefits and health insurance coverage   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  only 11 percent of workers participate in a formal flexible work program  only 27 percent of part time workers have access to retirement benefits  and only 22 percent of part time workers have access to health benefits   While flexible and part time work arrangements are rare  employers which offer them benefit from increased employee retention and productivity  The request presented by Kohl to the Finance Committee was also signed by Senators Craig  Durbin and Feingold  and also appears in the Older Worker Opportunity Act of 2005  S 1826   a measure introduced by Kohl which addresses pension  health insurance coverage  job training and care giving issues to give incentives to both businesses and older individuals
