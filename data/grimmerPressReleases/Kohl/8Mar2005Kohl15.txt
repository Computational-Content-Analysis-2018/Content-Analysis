DEWINE  KOHL CONTINUE EFFORTS  TO REDUCE GAS PRICES                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 8  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        DEWINE  KOHL CONTINUE EFFORTS  TO REDUCE GAS PRICES Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman and Ranking Member Introduce  Legislation To Permit U S  Legal Action Against OPEC    U S  Senators Mike DeWine  R OH  and Herb Kohl  D WI   Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust  Competition Policy  and Consumer Rights  today introduced legislation to permit the U S  Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to bring actions against foreign states    such as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC     for collusive practices in setting the price or production of petroleum products     Through setting prices and production levels  OPEC attacks our economy by raising gasoline prices at the pump  by raising heating oil costs for homes  and by raising jet fuel prices to airlines   said Senator DeWine    We cannot stand idly by while OPEC brazenly fixes prices in violation of our antitrust laws   Even though oil prices have been at historic highs  OPEC s hunger for even higher prices cannot be satisfied   It voted in December to raise prices even more   Our bill arms the Administration with the necessary weapon to combat these illegal practices and will hold the OPEC cartel to the same standards we hold all other businesses    OPEC should play by the same rules of free and fair competition as apply to the rest of the economy   said Senator Kohl    People from Wisconsin and throughout the nation suffer real consequences every day because of OPEC s actions   Higher oil prices mean higher prices at the gas pump  higher prices for manufactured goods  and higher home heating or cooling bills   We need to ensure that our consumers are not being burdened with unfair and illegal additional costs   At a minimum  our authorities should be able to take legal action to combat illegitimate price fixing by the oil cartel   In 1979  a federal district court found that OPEC s price fixing decisions were  governmental     not  commercial     acts and accordingly they were protected by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act   Subsequently  in 1981  a federal court of appeals declined to consider the appeal of that antitrust case based on the so called  act of state  doctrine  which holds that a court will not consider a case regarding the legality of the acts of a foreign nation    NOPEC effectively reverses these decisions by making it clear that OPEC s activities are not protected by sovereign immunity and that the federal courts should not decline to hear such a case based on the  act of state  doctrine   It clears away these judicially created roadblocks so the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission could bring an antitrust case against OPEC for its price fixing behavior       Senator DeWine and Kohl s efforts are in response to the continuing dramatic increase in gasoline and other fuel prices  which has severely harmed American consumers  workers and businesses throughout the country  especially in the Midwest   If this bill were to become law  it would force OPEC to begin pricing in a competitive  free market manner or face the possibility of being prosecuted for civil or criminal antitrust violations   Looking through any newspaper in Ohio over the past few weeks  I see story after story about the effects these higher prices are having on Ohio s consumers   This legislation is more timely and necessary than ever before   stated DeWine  Senators DeWine and Kohl have introduced NOPEC in June 2000  March 2001 and April 2004   Twice the legislation was voted out of the Judiciary Committee without objection   The bipartisan bill is co sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy  D Vermont   Charles Grassley  R Iowa   Russell Feingold  D Wisconsin   Olympia Snowe  R Maine   Charles Schumer  D New York   Dick Durbin  D Illinois   Carl Levin  D Michigan   Barbara Boxer  D California   Ron Wyden  D Oregon   Jon Corzine  D New Jersey   and Mark Dayton  D Minnesota
