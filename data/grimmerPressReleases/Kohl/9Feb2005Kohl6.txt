FEINGOLD  KOHL PART OF STRONG BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO SAFELY IMPORT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 9  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        FEINGOLD  KOHL PART OF STRONG BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO SAFELY IMPORT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Access to Safe  FDA Approved Reimported Drugs Would Help Bring Down the Cost of Health Care For America s Seniors    Washington  D C     U S  Senators Russ Feingold  D WI  and Herb Kohl  D WI  are part of a strong bipartisan effort to legalize the safe reimportation of prescription drugs from countries like Canada  Japan  and the members of the European Union   The Senators are cosponsoring the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act  introduced by Senators Byron Dorgan  D ND  and Olympia Snowe  R ME   which would allow licensed American pharmacies and drug wholesalers to safely import prescription drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   giving Americans access to their medicines at lower prices    One of the major flaws with the new Medicare law is that it prohibits seniors who are struggling to keep up with health care costs from purchasing safe  FDA approved prescription drugs from countries like Canada   Feingold said    As I travel around Wisconsin listening to people s concerns  the high cost of health care continues to be at the top of the list   The strong bipartisan support for this bill makes clear that Americans of all political backgrounds want the federal government to support seniors  rather than the interests of drug companies  and make safe and affordable prescription drugs available to those who need them    As Congress continues to debate this issue  the reality is that drug importation is already happening  We ve heard from many of our seniors in Wisconsin who  when faced with the choice of buying the medicines they need to keep them healthy or paying for food and rent  turn to Canada and the Internet to find drugs at more reasonable prices   Our seniors don t need a government that defends the status quo and sets up new roadblocks   They need an administration and Congress that work together to give Americans the price relief and safety assurances they need   Kohl said    The bill has built in safeguards to ensure that the drugs are safe for consumers   For example  the drugs must be manufactured in an FDA inspected plant and include a  chain of custody  so they can be traced back to the plant   The legislation also includes measures to prevent the drug industry from circumventing the law   Individuals would also be able to have the medicines shipped directly to their houses via the Internet or mail order from Canadian pharmacies registered with the FDA
