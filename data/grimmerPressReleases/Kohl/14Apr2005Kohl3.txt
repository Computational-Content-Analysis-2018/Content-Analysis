DEWINE  KOHL CONTINUE EFFORTS TO REDUCE GAS PRICES                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    April 14  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        DEWINE  KOHL CONTINUE EFFORTS TO REDUCE GAS PRICES     U S  Senators Mike DeWine  R OH  and Herb Kohl  D WI   Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust  Competition Policy  and Consumer Rights  today announced that their legislation to permit the U S  Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to bring actions against foreign states    such as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC     for collusive practices in setting the price or production of petroleum products passed the Senate Judiciary Committee    Through setting prices and production levels  OPEC attacks our economy by raising gasoline prices at the pump  by raising heating oil costs for homes  and by raising jet fuel prices to airlines   said Senator DeWine   Today s vote in the Judiciary Committee is a step in the right direction  and it shows that we will not stand idly by while OPEC brazenly fixes prices in violation of our antitrust laws  Every American is affected by the high prices we see on our home energy bills and at the gas pump  and our bill arms the Administration with the necessary weapon to combat these illegal practices    Throughout the last year  consumers all across the nation have watched gas prices rise to previously unimagined levels  Rising gas prices are a silent tax that takes hard earned money away from Americans every time they visit the gas pump   Senator Kohl said   And one fact has remained consistent    any move downward in price ends as soon as OPEC decides to cut production  The price of crude oil has danced to the tune set by OPEC members  Such blatantly anti competitive conduct by the oil cartel violates the most basic principles of fair competition and free markets and should not be tolerated   In 1979  a federal district court found that OPEC s price fixing decisions were  governmental     not  commercial     acts and accordingly they were protected by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act  Subsequently  in 1981  a federal court of appeals declined to consider the appeal of that antitrust case based on the so called  act of state  doctrine  which holds that a court will not consider a case regarding the legality of the acts of a foreign nation   NOPEC effectively reverses these decisions by making it clear that OPEC s activities are not protected by sovereign immunity and that the federal courts should not decline to hear such a case based on the  act of state  doctrine  It clears away these judicially created roadblocks so the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission could bring an antitrust case against OPEC for its price fixing behavior   Senator DeWine and Kohl s efforts are in response to the continuing dramatic increase in gasoline and other fuel prices  which has severely harmed American consumers  workers and businesses throughout the country  especially in the Midwest  If this bill were to become law  it would force OPEC to begin pricing in a competitive  free market manner or face the possibility of being prosecuted for civil or criminal antitrust violations   Looking through any newspaper in Ohio over the past few weeks  I see story after story about the effects these higher prices are having on Ohio s consumers  This legislation is more timely and necessary than ever before   stated DeWine  Senators DeWine and Kohl have introduced NOPEC in June 2000  March 2001 and April 2004  This is the third time the legislation has been voted out of the Judiciary Committee without objection  The bipartisan bill is co sponsored by Senators Arlen Specter  R Pennsylvania   Patrick Leahy  D Vermont   Charles Grassley  R Iowa   Russell Feingold  D Wisconsin   Tom Coburn  R Oklahoma   Charles Schumer  D New York   Dick Durbin  D Illinois   Olympia Snowe  R Maine   Carl Levin  D Michigan   Barbara Boxer  D California   Ron Wyden  D Oregon   Jon Corzine  D New Jersey   and Mark Dayton  D Minnesota
