KOHL  MEDICARE PART D S LOW INCOME SUBSIDY MAY NOT BE REACHING OUR NEEDIEST SENIORS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    January 31  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL  MEDICARE PART D S LOW INCOME SUBSIDY MAY NOT BE REACHING OUR NEEDIEST SENIORS     Washington  DC    U S  Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Chairman of the Special Committee on Aging  today held a hearing to examine the challenges that many seniors are facing with the Medicare Prescription Drug program s low income subsidy  LIS   There are more than 3 million low income seniors who may be eligible for the benefit  but are not receiving it    Last year got off to a rocky start as many low income seniors were denied the drugs they needed at the pharmacy   Kohl said    While some of those problems were resolved  serious issues remain that are preventing low income seniors from getting the low income subsidy   Seniors with incomes less than roughly  15 000 a year and assets less than roughly  11 500 are eligible for Medicare s LIS  These seniors can benefit from low or no co payments  deductibles  and premiums  and they are covered in the  donut hole     a gap in the program s coverage of drug costs between  2 251 and  5 100  Many lawmakers and organizations cited the low income benefit as a major selling point when the Medicare Prescription Drug law was passed in 2003  But many low income seniors have not been able to take advantage of the program   The Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  estimated that in 2006 only 2 million  or 35 percent of the 5 7 million people who needed to apply for LIS  received the benefit  Senior advocates have pointed to the program s complex application process and shifts in drug plan participation in the LIS as challenges many seniors face in accessing the benefit   Seniors faced many of these problems last year  and they should have been solved by now   Kohl said   It s time for CMS to put together a comprehensive plan and report back to this Committee on how they will fix these problems   Larry Kocot  Senior Advisor to the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  CMS  and Beatrice Disman  New York Regional Commissioner of the Social Security Administration  SSA  were on hand at today s hearing to discuss what their agencies have done to address the challenges seniors have faced with the LIS implementation  Both CMS and SSA play important roles in this process  CMS has overall responsibility for implementing the Medicare drug benefit  while SSA is responsible for processing the LIS applications and determining eligibility  In November of 2006  the HHS Inspector General found that neither CMS nor SSA had good income data to identify eligible seniors      As we enter the second year of the Medicare drug benefit  we have an obligation to make sure it is working for all seniors  but particularly for our poorest seniors who need help the most   Kohl said   We are not there today   The recommendations from today s witnesses can lead to real solutions  and I hope the Administration is willing to work with us to implement them   At the hearing  Kohl noted that he is crafting a bill to help SSA better target low income seniors  He also urged CMS and lawmakers to simplify the application process and revaluate the  asset test   which many advocates believe is too restrictive and further complicates the LIS application
