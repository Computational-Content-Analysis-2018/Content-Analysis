KOHL SEEKS ADDITIONAL HUMANITARIAN FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR TSUNAMI VICTIMS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    January 14  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL SEEKS ADDITIONAL HUMANITARIAN FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR TSUNAMI VICTIMS Kohl  Senators urge President to fund food aid efforts in supplemental budget     WASHINGTON    In order to help meet the food aid needs of victims devastated by the recent tsunami in South Asia  as well as to ensure that funding continues for current food aid programs in other parts of the world  U S  Senator Herb Kohl and a bipartisan group of 43 Senators today wrote to President Bush  urging him to include a request in the Administration s supplemental appropriations bill for food aid efforts  Such funding would help provide food aid to tsunami victims in South Asia without diverting food aid funding away from people in other developing countries   Kohl is the ranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee  which funds food aid programs   It would not be appropriate to help the people of South Asia by reducing aid to people in other developing countries  Such a move would be tantamount to feeding one group with the seed corn that another group was supposed to sow for crops the following year   the Senators wrote in their letter to the President   The December 26 tsunami that impacted several countries in the Indian Ocean has left hundreds of thousands  or even millions  in need of such essentials as food  clean water and medical attention   As the Senators note to the President  even before the tsunami struck  other natural disasters and wars had strained the ability of USAID and USDA to provide emergency food aid while still maintaining long term commitments to development assistance projects  Additional food aid funding in the supplemental budget bill    which Congress plans to consider in the coming weeks    would help to ensure that food aid funding is not simply shifted from one need to the next   Over the past several decades  the U S  food aid programs run by the U S  Agency for International Development and the U S  Department of Agriculture have demonstrated their capacity to help people in need  but their fiscal 2005 funding will have to be increased for them to do the job properly   the Senators added   As part of the supplemental appropriations bill you are planning to submit within the next several weeks  we urge you to include a request for food aid programs to help the tsunami victims in South Asia as well as to address the food aid shortfall generated by pre existing emergency assistance needs in Africa and elsewhere in the world
