KOHL PRESSES ATTORNEY GENERAL ON CUTS TO LOCAL CRIME PREVENTION FUNDING                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    July 18  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL PRESSES ATTORNEY GENERAL ON CUTS TO LOCAL CRIME PREVENTION FUNDING Questions Administration s proposed elimination of programs that successfully reduced crime in the  90 s    WASHINGTON    As violent crime begins to rise across the country  including 28 shootings over Memorial Day weekend in Milwaukee  U S  Senator Herb Kohl criticized the Administration s drastic cuts in funding for local law enforcement during a hearing with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in the Senate Judiciary Committee today   Kohl helped craft the 1994 Crime Bill  which created the COPS  Community Oriented Policing Services  program to put 100 000 more law enforcement officers on the streets in cities and smaller communities across the country   The Administration eliminated the COPS hiring program and has slashed funding for the COPS budget   Kohl also strongly supports the Byrne grant program  a Department of Justice  DOJ  initiative that funds state and local drug task forces and crime prevention programs  which the Administration has proposed wiping out    Perhaps these budget cuts could be justified if violent crime wasn t a problem anymore    but that couldn t be further from the truth   Kohl told the Attorney General    How can this Administration possibly justify cutting off programs that support local law enforcement in the face of a resurgent crime wave   These were the very programs that successfully reduced crime in the  90 s    Attorney General Gonzales said that  while the Administration is very concerned about crime and wants to be sure that they re doing what they can  they are operating under tough budget times with a deficit and a country at war  and that difficult budget decisions need to be made about spending priorities   The Attorney General said that Kohl can t just look at DOJ dollars  because funding comes to first responders through grants by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS    Kohl noted  however  that the DHS grants do not fund more officers on the streets or crime prevention programs   After nearly a decade in which violent crime rates fell or were stable throughout the United States  the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported last month that there was a 2 5  rise last year in violent crimes  which include homicides  rapes  robberies and aggravated assault   Federal funding for local law enforcement in Wisconsin via the Byrne grant program has been cut by more than two thirds
