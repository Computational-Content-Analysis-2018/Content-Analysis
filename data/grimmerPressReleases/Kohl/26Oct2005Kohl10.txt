DEWINE  KOHL BILL TO STRENGTHEN ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT PASSES SENATE                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    October 26  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        DEWINE  KOHL BILL TO STRENGTHEN ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT PASSES SENATE Bill Would Give Department of Justice Authority to Request a Wiretap Order to Investigate Antitrust Crimes      Washington  D C     A bill to strengthen criminal antitrust enforcement written by U S  Senators Mike DeWine  R OH  and Herb Kohl  D WI   the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary  Antitrust Subcommittee  passed the Senate by Unanimous Consent late yesterday   The bill would give the Department of Justice a much needed tool to investigate and prosecute criminal antitrust violations   The legislation protects consumers from conspiracies like price fixing and bid rigging which drive up prices and stifle competition  The Antitrust Investigative Improvements Act of 2005 would for the first time grant authority to the Justice Department to obtain wiretaps to detect antitrust crimes   By adding criminal antitrust offenses to the list  the Department of Justice would be authorized to seek a wiretap order from a federal judge    for a limited period of time    to monitor communications between criminal antitrust conspirators   This legislation would treat criminal antitrust offenses the same as other white collar offenses such as mail fraud  wire fraud and bank fraud  for which prosecutors are able to seek wiretap orders upon a showing of probable cause   I am pleased my Senate colleagues saw the need to give the Department of Justice this essential tool for investigating criminal antitrust violations   Investigators are able to seek a wiretap order when investigating other white collar fraud offenses  and it is smart law enforcement policy to allow antitrust enforcers the same investigative tools   said Senator DeWine    In many instances the harm to innocent consumers from a criminal antitrust conspiracy is much more severe than in other types of white collar fraud crimes  and this bill would help fight these crimes   Senator Kohl observed   Antitrust conspiracies such as price fixing and bid rigging steal from consumers just as surely as other white collar crimes such as mail or wire fraud   Because of their secret nature  antitrust conspiracies are extremely hard to uncover unless prosecutors can penetrate the inner workings of the conspiracy   It is vital that we give law enforcement all the necessary tools to detect these conspiracies   Under current antitrust law  for a criminal offense  corporations may be fined up to  100 million and individuals may be fined up to  1 million and incarcerated up to 10 years   The Department of Justice criminally prosecutes certain violations of the Sherman Act  such as price fixing or bid rigging agreements among competitors    This bill is co sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vermont    It now goes to the House for consideration
