KOHL SPONSORS BILL TO REVERSE CUTS TO CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT FUNDING                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 8  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL SPONSORS BILL TO REVERSE CUTS TO CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT FUNDING Wisconsin has been harder hit than most states since federal funds dried up    WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Herb Kohl  along with Sen  John Rockefeller  D WV  and three Republican colleagues  last night introduced bipartisan legislation to reverse harmful cuts to the successful federal child support enforcement program that helps states and localities collect child support payments to provide basic necessities for many families   Wisconsin has been hit harder than most states because of its demonstrated success in its child support program  While the national program collects  4 10 for every federal dollar spent    a success by any measure for a federal program    Wisconsin collects  on average  about  6   The federal government rewarded the efforts of Wisconsin s child support agencies with incentive payments  allowing for even greater investments in the state s program   The cuts  which the President signed into law last year  targeted these incentives and penalized Wisconsin for its success   The impact has been clear   The cuts are so damaging    and the program so important    that one Wisconsin community has decided to hold a raffle  to raise funds for their child support enforcement program   I have heard from child support directors who will be forced by budget cuts to fire staff   And I have heard from scared constituents who are owed child support that they worry they will never see   Kohl said    Nationally  more than  8 billion in child support owed by non custodial parents will go uncollected over the next decade   That figure  from the non partisan Congressional Budget Office  is misleading  because it assumes that every state will be able to step in and make up for half of the funding cut  If cash strapped states are unable to fill the gap  it is estimated that nearly  17 billion will go uncollected and never reach the families that need it  The legislation to repeal the child support cuts  S  803  is also co sponsored by Sens  Olympia Snowe  R ME   John Cornyn  R TX   and Norm Coleman  R MN
