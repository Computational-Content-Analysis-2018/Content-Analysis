DEWINE  KOHL INTRODUCE BILL TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES BENEFIT FROM HIGH POWERED COMPUTING                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    June 15  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        DEWINE  KOHL INTRODUCE BILL TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES BENEFIT FROM HIGH POWERED COMPUTING Bill Would Establish Supercomputing Centers Across America    Senators Mike DeWine  R OH  and Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   continuing their support of small businesses  today introduced the Blue Collar Computing and Business Act of 2006   The bill would create the Advanced Multidisciplinary Computing Software Institute  AMCSI  to help make existing high performance computing resources more accessible to small businesses and manufacturers     Small businesses and manufacturers are critical to growing our economy and we need to do all we can to support them   said Senator DeWine    This bill would help small businesses become even more productive and competitive by allowing them to harness the cutting edge  supercomputing technology that our larger corporations are already using  With this technology  small businesses in Ohio and across America will be able to compete even better in the expanding global marketplace    We ve seen small and mid sized manufacturers  which provide good paying  family supporting jobs for skilled workers  dwindle in number and decline in productivity because they don t have access to the same high tech equipment that giant companies rely on   It makes sense to establish these regional high tech centers where expertise can be shared and experience can be tapped    one stop shopping for small businesses and manufacturers who want to make sure their enterprises thrive in an evolving marketplace   Kohl said  Advances in computational science and high performance computing provide a competitive advantage because they allow businesses to run faster simulations of complex systems or to develop more precise computer models    As the Council on Competitiveness has said  America s small businesses and manufacturers will have to  out compute to out compete    However  even though small businesses and manufacturers would benefit greatly from high performance computing  access to such technology is often prohibitively expensive  or requires specialized technical expertise    The Blue Collar Computing and Business Assistance Act would authorize up to  25 million per year for 5 years for the Department of Commerce to create up to five new supercomputing centers across the country  Staff from these centers would help small businesses find areas where supercomputing would help them stay competitive and then link the business with existing supercomputing labs to execute those plans   The centers would also develop software specifically designed to meet the needs of small businesses    This bill is the latest in Senator DeWine and Senator Kohl s efforts to support America s small businesses and manufacturers   Most recently  they worked to fully fund the Manufacturing Extension Partnership  MEP   and have also joined as co sponsors of S  2134  the Manufacturing Technology Competitiveness Act  MTCA   MEP is a nationwide network of not for profit centers in nearly 350 locations nationwide  whose sole purpose is to provide small and medium sized manufacturers with the services they need to succeed  The MTCA would reauthorize and expand the MEP program as well as other Commerce Department programs focused on promoting competitiveness in the manufacturing sector
