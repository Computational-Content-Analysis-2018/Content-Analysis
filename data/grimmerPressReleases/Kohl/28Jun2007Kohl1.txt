Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Immigration Reform Bill                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    June 28  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Immigration Reform Bill      I m disappointed that partisan divide has prevented us from completing our work on the immigration reform bill   We can all agree that the system is broken and needs to be fixed   While the bill certainly was not perfect  it strengthened our border  addressed the millions of undocumented immigrants who are already here  established serious penalties for employers who hire illegal workers  and created a guest worker program   This was our best opportunity to ensure more secure borders and effective enforcement of immigration laws   However  because some of my colleagues were dead set on stopping any immigration reform  the Senate did not have the opportunity to take an up or down vote on this bipartisan legislation
