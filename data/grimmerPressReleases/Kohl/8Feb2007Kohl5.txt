KOHL  LEAHY INTRODUCE BILL PROHIBITING CLONED PRODUCTS FROM ORGANIC LABELING                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 8  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL  LEAHY INTRODUCE BILL PROHIBITING CLONED PRODUCTS FROM ORGANIC LABELING     WASHINGTON   Today  U S  Senators Herb Kohl  D WI  and Patrick Leahy  D VT  have introduced legislation to bar products that are produced from cloned livestock from receiving an organic food label under the National Organic Program administered by the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA     According to emerging legal analysis  prompted by recent Food and Drug Administration  FDA  action  the federal definition of organic food could allow cloned animal products to be labeled organic    This bill has one purpose and one purpose only  to protect the integrity of organic standards   Kohl said    The conditions under which cloned animal products enter our food supply will be much debated in the months and years to come   But I would hope that we can begin that discussion with general consensus that it is not acceptable for cloned food products to enter the marketplace under the organic label    Any attempt to allow cloned animal products to carry the organic label would be inconsistent with the national organic standards and labeling program   said Leahy  the  father  of the program and author of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990    Recent USDA statements unfortunately have called that fact into question   Ensuring that the organic label stands for the highest possible standards is essential to ensuring and maintaining consumer confidence in our rapidly growing organic market     Both the Agricultural Marking Service  which runs USDA s National Organic Program  and the National Organic Standards Board  which sets guidelines for the organic food labeling  have indicated that they will take up this issue when they meet later this year
