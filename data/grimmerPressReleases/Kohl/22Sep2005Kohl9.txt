Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Nomination of Judge Roberts as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    September 22  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Nomination of Judge Roberts as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court      I want to congratulate you  Chairman Specter  and Senator Leahy and your staffs on Judge Roberts  confirmation hearings   The proceedings were fair to both sides and more importantly the hearings were fair to the nominee   The impartial handling of the hearing allowed us    on behalf of the people we represent    to conduct a thorough examination of Judge Roberts   Judge Roberts came before this Committee as a very well respected Judge with a sterling academic record and a remarkable legal career   He leaves this Committee with that reputation intact  if not enhanced    I have enormous respect for Judge Roberts  legal talents    they are undeniable     It is for this reason    his distinguished career and his sterling reputation as a lawyer and a judge    that I will vote my hopes today and not my fears and support Judge Roberts  nomination for Chief Justice of the United States   During a private meeting with him  as well as through four impressive days of testimony  Judge Roberts made clear that he will be a modest judge   He assures us that he will address each case on its merits and approach each argument with an open mind   He recognized that judges should not substitute their policy preferences for those of Congress    and I agree  Judge Roberts sees a clear boundary to the Judge s role    He told us repeatedly that his personal views about issues did not matter   He assured us that he will not be an activist  and that he will rarely  if ever  look to overturn precedent   Rather  precedent     not his version of how the law should be     will mark the beginning of his Constitutional analysis     Judge Roberts recognizes a right to privacy in the Constitution  and he understands that people have come to rely on it    He made clear his agreement with the cases on the right to privacy that led to the Court s decisions in Roe and Casey   Judge Roberts rejected  originalist  or a  literalist  philosophies    he does not bind the Constitution to narrow interpretations of the past    Too many judicial activists have used this philosophy to limit our rights and freedoms    Judge Roberts believes that as society evolves  our interpretation of the Constitution must evolve with it  We choose to take Judge Roberts at his word    and believe that those words will bind him throughout his tenure on the Court    Ultimately  Judge Roberts persuaded us that he will be the Chief Justice we saw this past week  not the Chief Justice that his critics see in his past    Nonetheless  the decision was not an easy one    While I support moderation in judicial temperament  I do not support inaction in the face of injustice    I worry that a Court full of neutral umpires would not have decided Brown v  Board of Education or other cases in which the Court moved America forward   Modesty is to be respected to a point  but not when it stands in the way of progress   Historically  the Courts have often succeeded when our democratically elected branches could not  However  Judge Roberts testified    and I do not disagree    that his confirmation to replace Chief Justice Rehnquist will not radically shift the balance of the Court   If he had been nominated  as he was originally  to replace Justice O Connor then his confirmation would have moved the Court to the right   That would have a much more difficult decision   It is my hope that the White House recognizes this concern when they choose their next nominee  Mr  Chairman  in considering my decision  I was troubled by parts of Judge Roberts  record  but I was impressed by the man himself    I will support him as a Chief Justice who will keep an open mind and reject ideological extremism and simplistic approaches to interpreting the Constitution   I will vote my hopes and not my fears
