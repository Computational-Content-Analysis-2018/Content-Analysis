Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Nomination of John Bolton to be U S  Ambassador to the United Nations                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    May 26  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Nomination of John Bolton to be U S  Ambassador to the United Nations     Once again I come to the floor to voice my concerns regarding the appointment of John Bolton to an important office in this Administration  This time he is being promoted to a government position with high international profile  the U S  Ambassador to the United Nations  I believe his appointment to this post will harm our interests at the UN and hamstring our international cooperation efforts  Mr  Bolton  whom I opposed when he was nominated to be the Under Secretary for Arms Control  did not distinguish himself in his last job  His comments about the North Korean regime during sensitive negotiations almost derailed our efforts there  This is not just my opinion  After his remarks  Mr  Bolton s superiors recalled him to the United States and sent a replacement  This blunder is not the only black mark on Mr  Bolton s record  He also failed in another highly critical negotiation    our unsuccessful attempts to convince Iran to curtail its nuclear activities  Mr  Bolton also has publicly and often expressed his disdain for the United Nations    the very institution the President has chosen to send him presumably to represent us and pursue our interests  How can he do that when his public criticism of the UN has been  not constructive or thoughtful  but heavy handed and destructive  He has advocated not paying our UN dues and  in a moment of high arrogance  said he thought there should only be one permanent member of the Security Council    the United States    to reflect today s international power structure  Statements like these make our allies believe that we do not value their cooperation and effort    and perhaps Mr  Bolton does not  His remarks create ill will and make it harder for us to lead in the international community    and perhaps Mr  Bolton believes the United States needs to play no role in that community  He has a right to those views  But we in the Senate have a right not to consent to the appointment to the Ambassador to the UN of a man whose views would  in my opinion  keep him from being able to do his job  There is an old saying that  you gather more flies with honey  than with vinegar   I am afraid that we are sending a big bottle of vinegar to the UN  and it will attract us no friends  Diplomacy requires tact  It requires being able to use both the carrot and the stick  rewards and sanctions  Mr  Bolton seems to be focused entirely on the stick  believing that by wielding our power and the threat of force like a cudgel  we can bring the international community into line  I do not agree  Senator Voinovich was right when he said the United States can do better than John Bolton  There are so many bright  gifted people in the Administration that would do a better job and be a better fit  I regret the President did not send one of those people to us for this high profile job  Mr  Bolton s presence at the UN will do little to build our prestige around the world  and may well hamstring our efforts in the war on terror  I urge my colleagues to vote against this nominee  and I yield the floor
