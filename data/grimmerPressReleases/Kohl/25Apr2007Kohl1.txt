KOHL BILL TO REDUCE GAS PRICES PASSED BY SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    April 25  2007     Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL BILL TO REDUCE GAS PRICES PASSED BY SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE  Senator s Legislation Will Permit U S  Legal Action Against OPEC     WASHINGTON    Legislation sponsored by U S  Senator Herb Kohl to permit the Department of Justice to bring actions against foreign states    such as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC     for collusive practices in setting the price or production of petroleum products passed the Senate Judiciary Committee today  Kohl is the chairman of the committee s panel on Antitrust  Competition Policy and Consumer Rights   At this time of ever rising gas prices  the time is now for the U S  government to finally fight back on the price of oil and hold OPEC accountable when it acts illegally  Our bill will hold OPEC member nations to account under U S  antitrust law when they agree to limit supply or fix price in violation of the most basic principles of free competition   Kohl said  In 1979  a federal district court found that OPEC s price fixing decisions were  governmental     not  commercial     acts and accordingly they were protected by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act  Subsequently  in 1981  a federal court of appeals declined to consider the appeal of that antitrust case based on the so called  act of state  doctrine  which holds that a court will not consider a case regarding the legality of the acts of a foreign nation   Kohl s bipartisan bill  the  No Oil Producing   Exporting Cartels Act of 2007   effectively reverses these decisions by making it clear that OPEC s activities are not protected by sovereign immunity and that the federal courts should not decline to hear such a case based on the  act of state  doctrine  It clears away these judicially created roadblocks so the Department of Justice could bring an antitrust case against OPEC for its price fixing behavior   If this bill were to become law  it would force OPEC to begin pricing in a competitive  free market manner or face the possibility of being prosecuted for civil or criminal antitrust violations   Kohl s legislation is cosponsored by Senators Arlen Specter  R PA   Russ Feingold  D WI   Chuck Grassley  R IA   Charles Schumer  D NY   Tom Coburn  R OK   Richard Durbin  D IL   Olympia Snowe  R ME   Carl Levin  D MI  and Barbara Boxer  D CA
