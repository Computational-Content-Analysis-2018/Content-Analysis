STATEMENT OF SENATOR HERB KOHL ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BAN FLAG DESECRATION                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    June 15  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        STATEMENT OF SENATOR HERB KOHL ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BAN FLAG DESECRATION     Thank you  Mr  Chairman   I have long opposed the Constitutional amendment on flag desecration   Today  support for our national symbol is stronger than ever   Thus  this amendment is as unnecessary today as it was in past years  Millions of Americans have fought and died for our country   They fought for each of us  and for the very freedoms we hold dear   In fact  they are doing so today in Afghanistan and Iraq   These brave men and women do so because they love their country  and for that  we honor them and will be forever indebted to them   But  we would be doing them a disservice if we amended the Constitution to place limits on one of the most important freedoms they fight to defend    the freedom of speech  Those who speak out against this amendment  and those of us who will vote against it today  are not doing so to advocate flag desecration  or to diminish what the flag symbolizes   The opposite is true   We do not condone or encourage flag desecration   In fact  all of us find those acts reprehensible   Yet  our disapproval of those acts  by itself  does not mean a constitutional amendment is necessary or justified   The First Amendment has long stood for the essential principle that our government should not seek to tell people how to say something any more than it should tell them what to say  no matter how strongly the rest of us may disagree  All Americans have the right to voice their opinions  regardless of how unpopular they may be   The First Amendment has protected this right for more than two hundred years   Even unpopular speech has value   In some cases  a minority of Americans have used their voices to spark much needed change in this country   In others  such as flag desecration  unpopular speech further enhances our feelings of patriotism   These rights  no matter how disagreeable on their face  are worth protecting  The debate over this amendment began seventeen years ago  when the Supreme Court decided the Texas v  Johnson case   The Court held that the right to desecrate an American flag as a method of speech is protected by the First Amendment   Since this case was decided in 1989  we have not seen a surge in flag burnings in our streets or on our courthouse steps   And we have not seen the strong feelings Americans have for their freedom  or the flag itself  diminish in any way   If anything  our love for the flag has become stronger   This was particularly true after the terrorist attacks of September 11th  when more Americans than ever before began flying flags outside their homes and placing flag decals on their cars  The Constitution should be amended with extreme caution  and only in the most limited circumstances   Amending it to preserve something that is not in jeopardy could set a precedent for censoring other forms of legitimate speech   Those who desecrate the flag only make the rest of us value our flag  our freedoms  and those who have given their lives to protect them even more   Our flag and the principles it represents will survive any ill conceived desecration by a few protesters   A Constitutional amendment is unnecessary because the strength of the American people and their unwavering support for our country and our national symbol will make certain of that   These are the reasons why I will vote no on this amendment today
