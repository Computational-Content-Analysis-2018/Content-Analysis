KOHL PRESSES FBI DIRECTOR TO ADDRESS INCREASE IN MILWAUKEE VIOLENT CRIME                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    December 6  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL PRESSES FBI DIRECTOR TO ADDRESS INCREASE IN MILWAUKEE VIOLENT CRIME Director Mueller commits Department of Justice team to investigate Milwaukee s situation    WASHINGTON   At a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee today  U S  Senator Herb Kohl told the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations  FBI  Robert Mueller that more federal involvement is needed in the efforts to stem the alarming increase in violent crime in Milwaukee   Mueller said that he has formed Department of Justice  DoJ  teams to focus on the violent crime uptick across the country and will assign one to look specifically at Milwaukee   Director Mueller testified before the Judiciary Committee during their hearing on DoJ oversight  Kohl noted at the hearing that violent crime in Milwaukee rose 32 percent in 2005   Robberies were up 36 percent   Aggravated assaults were up nearly 32 percent   And most concerning of all  homicides increased 40 percent     Part of the problem is that we are not giving our states and localities the help they need   Kohl told Mueller    Year after year  we see a concerted effort by this Administration to end the COPS program and gut funding for juvenile justice and prevention programs   Virtually everyone in the law enforcement community will agree that this has been a major contributing factor to the rise in violent crime     For example  Kohl said the Milwaukee Police received  1 million from the COPS program in 2002  but last year received no funding at all   As a result  between 2002 and 2005  the Milwaukee Police Department s forces were reduced by 55 police officers  leaving it with nearly 200 vacancies in a force of 2 000   Years of decreases in funding have led to fewer cops on the beat and increases in violent crime   Mueller insisted that the FBI has not allocated resources away from violent crime in their focus on the threat of terrorism  and that he strongly supports funding for federal state local task forces
