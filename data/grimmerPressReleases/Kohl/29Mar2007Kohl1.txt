KOHL RENEWS EFFORT TO BOOST REFINING CAPACITY  LOWER ENERGY PRICES                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 29  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL RENEWS EFFORT TO BOOST REFINING CAPACITY  LOWER ENERGY PRICES Senator Introduces Bill to Build U S  Strategic Oil Refining Reserve    WASHINGTON    In the wake of a government report that showed the national average price for gasoline rising for the eighth straight week  U S  Senator Herb Kohl introduced legislation to have the federal government build oil refineries around the country  a move that would help stabilize the supply and lower the price of gasoline and heating oil across the nation   The price per barrel of oil  set by the Middle east cartel OPEC  is only one factor that pushes up the price of gas and oil in our country   Kohl said   Refining capacity  the infrastructure that takes crude oil and turns it into gas  is down dramatically  which results in higher fuel prices for everyone    In 1981  there were 324 refineries in the United States  today  there are 149  The oil industry has not built a new oil refinery in the Unites States since the 1970 s  In 1985  refining capacity equaled daily consumption of petroleum products  By 2002  daily consumption exceeded refining capacity by almost 20 percent  Kohl s bill  the Strategic Refinery Reserve Act of 2007  would designate that forty percent of the production from these new facilities would support the day to day needs of the military  saving taxpayers from paying the oil industry s inflated prices  The rest of the capacity would be available to keep gasoline flowing and prices stable in times of disaster or disruption     Big Oil has made it clear that they are unwilling to reinvest their record profits in new refineries  because the less they sell  the more they make per gallon   Kohl said   That may be good for oil company shareholders  and it may keep the executive bonuses fat  but it is bad for consumers    Until we are able to transition to alternative energy sources  our country will rely on oil and gas  We can t sit idly by waiting for that day to come   The U S  Energy Information Administration reported Monday that drivers paid an average of  2 610 a gallon for regular gasoline last week  up from  2 577 the week prior  According to the report prices are now 11 2 cents per gallon higher than March of 2006 and all regions reported price increases  Senator Dianne Feinstein  D CA  has co sponsored this legislation
