KOHL QUESTIONS RUMSFELD ON DIRECTION OF IRAQ WAR DURING SENATE HEARING                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 9  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL QUESTIONS RUMSFELD ON DIRECTION OF IRAQ WAR DURING SENATE HEARING     WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Herb Kohl today urged Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to insist that the Iraqi governing body make the compromises necessary to a achieve a broadly based political settlement which will allow the U S  to reduce its forces in the country   Kohl reminded the Secretary that a bipartisan majority of the Senate has agreed that 2006 needs to be a year of transition toward a successful conclusion to U S  involvement in Iraq  Secretary Rumsfeld testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee  on which Kohl serves  today to seek emergency funds for the Iraq War   America has paid a high price  in dollars and most importantly in the lives of American soldiers   And now we find ourselves in a position no great country should ever occupy   We don t control the events that determine the success of the war or even the safety of our troops   Kohl told Secretary Rumsfeld  Last year Kohl supported legislation sponsored by Sen  Carl Levin  D MI  which called on the President to make 2006 a year of transition between U S  and Iraqi control   Senator Levin has also suggested that the Shiites  Sunnis  and Kurds are all counting on the U S  presence in Iraq to keep the country from falling into civil war   He argues that the U S  should use that leverage to motivate the Iraqis to make the necessary compromises to achieve the broadly based political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency    that the U S  should tell the Iraqis that if they fail to reach a solution by the time table that they have set forth  that the U S  will consider a time table for the reduction of our forces   Kohl asked Secretary Rumsfeld to consider that option   You will tell me  as you have been telling the American people  that the situation in Iraq is not that dire   But Mr  Secretary  with all due respect  and speaking for a majority of the American people  that is hard to swallow   Kohl said    From the beginning  the Administration s Iraq strategy has been an amalgamation of misdirection and missteps   The intelligence about weapons of mass destruction that justified our invasion was wrong   You went into the war with no plan beyond the initial few weeks of military action   The estimates of the number of troops needed to accomplish the mission were too low   And now we are in Iraq with public support waning  American casualties mounting  and no apparent timetable or plan for turning Iraq back to the Iraqis and bringing our troops home
