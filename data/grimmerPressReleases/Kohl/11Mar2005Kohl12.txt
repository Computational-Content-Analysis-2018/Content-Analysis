 KOHL S CHILD SUPPORT REFORM PROPOSAL INCLUDED IN SENATE S WELFARE BILL                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 11  2005    Phone   202  224 5653         KOHL S CHILD SUPPORT REFORM PROPOSAL INCLUDED IN SENATE S WELFARE BILL Bipartisan bill provides more child support money to families leaving welfare  simplify distribution   improve collection    WASHINGTON The U S  Senate Finance Committee has approved a welfare reform bill that includes legislation sponsored by Senators Herb Kohl  D WI  and Olympia J  Snowe  R ME  to improve the collection and distribution of child support funds throughout the nation   The proposal  the Child Support Distribution Act  is based on Wisconsin s system  which ensures that more child support payments go directly to the children they re designed to help   Currently  states keep a portion of child support payments to defray the cost of providing services to needy families   In 1997  Sen  Kohl helped Wisconsin receive a federal waiver to become the only state that currently lets families working their way off welfare keep their own child support   The Senate Finance Committee incorporated the bill into the reauthorization of the 1996 Welfare Reform law   This proposal gives states the flexibility and incentives to distribute more child support directly to the families it is intended to help   It also builds upon Wisconsin s record of success using this system   Results have shown that mothers receive substantially more child support  and fathers are significantly more likely to pay the support they owe   Kohl said    Kohl and Snowe s legislation would give mothers leaving welfare an additional  4 billion in child support collections over the first five years of implementation   It would also lead to voluntary child support payments by states to families while they are still on welfare totaling approximately  900 million over five years   Current law regarding the assignment and distribution of child support for families on welfare is extremely complicated    depending on when families applied for welfare  when the child support was paid  whether the child support was for current or past due payments  and how the child support was collected   For example  the 1996 Welfare Reform law required that in order to qualify for Temporary Assistance for Need Families  TANF  benefits  beneficiaries must  assign     or give    their child support rights to the state for periods before and while the family is on welfare   This means that the State is allowed to divide with the federal government child support payments that were owed even before the family went on TANF if these payments are collected while the family is receiving welfare benefits
