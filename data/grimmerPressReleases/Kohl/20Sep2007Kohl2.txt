SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE APPROVES KOHL BILL TARGETING RAILROAD  PRICE GOUGING  THAT DRIVES UP CONSUMER COSTS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    September 20  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE APPROVES KOHL BILL TARGETING RAILROAD  PRICE GOUGING  THAT DRIVES UP CONSUMER COSTS Four railroads  providing 90  of the nation s rail transportation  can hold shippers captive and charge staggering fees      WASHINGTON    The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved legislation sponsored by U S  Senator Herb Kohl to repeal the obsolete antitrust exemptions protecting freight railroads from competition   These exemptions deny rail consumers antitrust protections available to consumers in virtually every other industry   Kohl authored the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2007 in response to concerns that freight railroads are abusing their dominant market power and raising rates for those who rely on them to ship dozens of vital commodities  including coal and agricultural products   The legislation is co sponsored by Senators Norm Coleman  R MN   Russ Feingold  D WI   Jay Rockefeller  D WV   David Vitter  R LA   Patrick Leahy  D VT  and Joe Biden  D DE       Freight railroads have the luxury of being protected from the competition other industries face   They can name their price and the consumer pays   We have seen the result of this outdated policy in Wisconsin  where our utilities were forced to absorb staggering cost increases for shipping coal   This bill will bring scrutiny to freight railroads and encourage competition in this highly consolidated industry   Kohl said  According to the Wisconsin Public Service Commission  in 2005 Wisconsin utilities incurred nearly  73 million in additional costs associated with shipments of coal  which provides about 60 percent of the state s energy   These costs are then passed along to consumers already paying for record high energy prices   Over the last 20 years  railroad industry consolidation has reached the point where only four class I railroads provide over 90 percent of the nation s rail transportation    Many industries    known as  captive shippers     are served by only one railroad    These captive shippers have faced constantly rising rail rates    In many cases the ordinary protections of antitrust law are unavailable to these captive shippers    instead  the railroads are protected by a series of exemptions from the normal rules of antitrust law to which all other industries must abide  As an example  Dairyland Power in La Crosse serves the electricity needs of more than 575 000 people  In 2005  Dairyland experienced a 13  shortfall of scheduled coal shipments  but was hit with a 93  rate increase   resulting in about  35 million of increased cost  Current antitrust law protects a wide range of railroad industry conduct from scrutiny by antitrust enforcers    Railroad mergers and acquisitions are exempt from antitrust law and are reviewed solely by the Surface Transportation Board    Railroads that engage in collective ratemaking are also exempt from antitrust law     Kohl s bill will eliminate these antitrust exemptions by allowing the federal government  state attorneys general and private parties to file suit to enjoin anti competitive mergers and acquisitions    It will restore the review of these mergers to the agencies where they belong    the Justice Department s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission    And it will eliminate the antitrust exemption for railroad collective rate making
