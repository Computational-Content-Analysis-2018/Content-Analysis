FEINGOLD  KOHL LAUD BILL THAT WILL STRENGTHEN BADGERCARE                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    July 19  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        FEINGOLD  KOHL LAUD BILL THAT WILL STRENGTHEN BADGERCARE SCHIP Reauthorization Bill Will Contain Funding for BadgerCare to Keep Helping Uninsured Wisconsin Families     Washington  D C     U S  Senators Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl hailed the Senate Finance Committee s passage of legislation that includes provisions to help strengthen BadgerCare  a Wisconsin program to help provide health care coverage for uninsured families   The committee s passage of the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  Reauthorization included funding for the program   The President has proposed stopping the expansion of programs like BadgerCare despite their cost effectiveness and popularity   SCHIP funds are critical to the thousands of Wisconsinites enrolled in the successful and popular BadgerCare program   Feingold said   I routinely hear how happy people in Wisconsin are with the coverage they receive through BadgerCare   I m happy I was able to help make sure the Senate s reauthorization of SCHIP included funding to help keep even more Wisconsin families healthy    Skyrocketing health care costs combined with a decline in employer sponsored health insurance means that thousands of kids and families across our state would go without basic medical care if BadgerCare didn t fill the need   Strengthening the SCHIP funding for BadgerCare will ensure that this successful program can continue to cover working families in Wisconsin   It s a good investment of our scarce federal dollars   Kohl said  Feingold and Kohl have worked hard to preserve and strengthen SCHIP so it could continue to benefit programs like BadgerCare   Both Senators have repeatedly urged the Senate Finance Committee to include provisions to help Wisconsin in the SCHIP reauthorization bill   When Republican Senators and the White House targeted the coverage of parents enrolled in SCHIP  Senator Feingold and Kohl aggressively and successfully worked to make sure no Wisconsin parents would see their coverage dropped as a result of the reauthorization bill   Last year  both Senators cosponsored the Keep Children Covered Act last year to prevent SCHIP shortfalls while Congress was out of session   The shortfall was eventually averted   There are currently 67 000 families enrolled in the BadgerCare program   The SCHIP reauthorization bill will allow Wisconsin to expand the program and cover more uninsured families   Governor Jim Doyle has already expressed support for the expansion of the program
