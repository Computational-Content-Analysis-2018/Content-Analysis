Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Nomination of Judge Samuel Alito  Jr  as Associate Justice on the Supreme Court                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    January 24  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        Statement of U S  Senator Herb Kohl on the Nomination of Judge Samuel Alito  Jr  as Associate Justice on the Supreme Court     Mr  Chairman  I want to congratulate you and Senator Leahy on your impartial handling of Judge Alito s confirmation hearings   You allowed us    on behalf of the people we represent    to conduct a thorough examination of Judge Alito    And after that thorough examination I cannot support the nomination of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court   I fear that a Justice Alito will narrow our rights  limit our freedoms and overturn decades of progress    To confirm Judge Alito to the Supreme Court would be to gamble with our liberties  a bet I fear the Constitution    and the American people    would lose    Generations of Americans have looked to the Supreme Court as more than a simple legal tribunal asked to decide cases and controversies   Rather  we expect the Supreme Court to guard our liberties  protect our rights  and    where appropriate    expand our freedoms     This process of bringing life to the promises of the Constitution has never moved predictably    or smoothly    As Martin Luther King  Jr  once noted   Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable    Every step toward the goal of justice requires       the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals    Throughout American history  those  dedicated individuals  have fought on many battlegrounds    from the steps of the White House and Congress  to the dangerous back roads traveled by the Freedom Riders    And somehow the fight always leads to the Supreme Court    it is there that these brave individuals have found refuge and  through their victories  changed America for the better  Many of these victories are now identified with individuals through familiar case names    Brown v  Board of Education  Gideon v  Wainwright  Baker v  Carr and Miranda v  Arizona    Judge Alito has stated his allegiance to the principles of these cases    and we are grateful for that    But we would expect any nominee to any court in this land to agree that schools should not be segregated and votes should count equally   That is a starting point   But we must dig deeper to discover whether Judge Alito should serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States   We must ask ourselves  how will Judge Alito view the next  dedicated individuals  who come before him seeking justice    What of the next Brown   The next Gideon   We do not consider Judge Alito for a seat on the bench in 1954 or 1965but rather  in 2006  and possibly 2036    Given his narrow judicial philosophy    on display throughout his legal career    Judge Alito is unlikely to side with the next  dedicated individual     This narrow judicial philosophy is clear  for example  in his views on civil rights    In his now famous 1985 job application  he took issue with Warren Court decisions that established one person one vote  Miranda rights and protections for religious minorities    These statements leave the clear impression that his antagonism toward these decisions    decisions that helped religious and racial minorities receive protection from majority abuses    motivated Judge Alito s pursuit of the law  While Judge Alito claimed that he was merely describing his opinions as a young man  his judicial opinions suggest a more well formed philosophy of limited rights and restricted civil liberties   He was in the extreme minority of judges around the country when he found that Congress has no ability to regulate machine guns   His efforts to strike down portions of the Family and Medical Leave Act were rejected by then Chief Justice Rehnquist   He raised the bar to unreachable heights repeatedly in employment discrimination cases  to the point where the majority of his court concluded that he was attempting to  eviscerate  the laws entirely    His restrictive view of Constitutional liberties was echoed in his thoughts about a woman s right to choose    In a 1985 job application  he expressed a legal view that there was no such right  and worked hard to craft a legal strategy that would chip away at    and ultimately eliminate    that right from the Constitution    When asked about this  Judge Alito has said    in essence    that was then  this is now   Yet even years after his work for the Reagan Administration  his narrow views on privacy echoed throughout his opinion in Planned Parenthood v  Casey    He would have placed more restrictions on a woman s freedom than other conservative judges    including the woman he seeks to replace on the Supreme Court    Even today  Judge Alito is unwilling to declare that Roe v  Wade is  settled law     a pronouncement that Chief Justice Roberts made with ease   Judge Alito felt free to confirm that one person one vote  integrated schools  and some privacy rights were settled  but not a woman s right to choose    In addition  Judge Alito s decisions call into question our right to be free of police intrusion and government power   For example  Judge Alito  in disagreement with his colleagues in the Reagan Justice Department  argued that the police acted reasonably in shooting    and killing    a fleeing  unarmed  teenage suspect   In many opinions as a judge  he deferred reflexively to the police in cases involving the interpretation of search warrants    including one permitting the strip search of a ten year old girl    At a time in our history when the balance between our security and our civil liberties requires the active involvement of the courts  Judge Alito s deference to Presidential power concerns us   He promoted the radical idea of a  unitary executive     the concept that the President is greater than    not equal to    the other branches of government   Judges are meant to protect us from unlawful surveillance and detention    not simply abide the President s wishes  Although it is the most important standard  judicial philosophy is not the only measure of a nominee   We had hoped that Judge Alito would have been able to satisfy the concerns we had with his record at his hearing   Instead  he chose to avoid answering many of our questions   His inability    or unwillingness    to answer those questions in even the most general manner did a disservice to the country and to his nomination  For example  when questioned on his support for Judge Bork    calling him  one of the most outstanding nominees of the century     Judge Alito answered that he was just supporting the Administration s nominee    When questioned about his membership in the Concerned Alumni of Princeton he said he could not remember this group    despite citing it with pride in a job application    When questioned about whether Bush v  Gore should have been heard by the Supreme Court  Judge Alito said that he had not thought about it as a judge and did not have an opinion    Mr  Chairman  in each of the six Supreme Court nominations that I have voted on  I have used the same test of judicial excellence   Justices Souter  Breyer  Ginsburg and Roberts passed that test   Judge Alito does not    Judge Alito s record as a professional   both as a Justice Department official and as a judge    reflects something more than a neutral judicial philosophy   Instead  it suggests a Judge who has strong views on a variety of issues  and uses the law to impose those views      Judge Alito has the right to see  read  and interpret the Constitution narrowly   And we have the obligation to decide whether his views have a place on the Supreme Court   I have decided they do not  and so I will oppose Judge Alito s nomination today
