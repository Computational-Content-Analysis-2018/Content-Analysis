KOHL CALLS MILC EXTENSION A VICTORY FOR WISCONSIN DAIRY FARMERS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    December 21  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL CALLS MILC EXTENSION A VICTORY FOR WISCONSIN DAIRY FARMERS     Washington  D C    U S  Senator Herb Kohl today called the two year extension of the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  a victory for Wisconsin s Dairy farmers  The MILC program extension was included in the budget reconciliation conference report  which was passed by the Senate today  The House passed the budget reconciliation act early Monday morning  The MILC program  which expired in September 2005  has provided  414 million since 2001 in support to Wisconsin dairy farmers struggling with plummeting milk prices  Kohl helped establish the MILC program as part of the 2002 Farm Bill to end regional fighting over milk pricing policies    I am very pleased MILC program has been extended   said Kohl   The MILC extension is one hopeful element in an otherwise difficult bill  It will help thousands of Wisconsin dairy families survive if we have another bout of disastrous prices  That s why I have fought so hard for a basic safety net  This is the third time Senate has passed a MILC extension and I m glad the House leadership has finally joined us in recognizing the importance of a basic safety net for dairy    The budget reconciliation act will return to the House of Representatives for two technical corrections unrelated to MILC before going to the President to be signed into law
