Kohl Pushes Leavitt to Accelerate Generic Drug Approvals                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    May 3  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        Kohl Pushes Leavitt to Accelerate Generic Drug Approvals     WASHINGTON    In response to sharp questions by U S  Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt today defended budget cuts to the Food and Drug Administration s generic drug program  which is saddled with its largest backlog of generics applications in the agency s history    I fear the Secretary is defending business as usual at the FDA and that s unacceptable in my book   Kohl said   Generic drugs  especially when there is competition in the generics market  save a lot of people a lot of money everyday    While acknowledging the current and growing backlog of over 800 applications  Leavitt testified that the FDA did not require any additional money to expedite generics approval  Rather  he noted that the agency was prioritizing its review of first generics in an effort to ensure that at least one generic equivalent is approved for each brand name drug coming off patent   According to FDA data  when a brand name drug has one generic counterpart approved  the generic normally prices that drug about six percent below the brand name cost  However  when a second generic enters the market  the price drops to nearly half of the brand name cost   Kohl   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the use of generics provides a savings of  8 to  10 billion to consumers every year  and that doesn t include the billions of dollars of savings to hospitals  Medicaid and Medicare  It is now more important than ever that we speed less expensive generic drugs to market    Leavitt s comments today at the Labor HHS Appropriations subcommittee hearing were similar to the testimony of Acting FDA Commissioner Dr  Andrew Von Eschenbach  who agreed to work with Kohl to find ways to reduce the backlog during an Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee last March   Kohl is scheduled to meet with Von Eschenbach later today in a private meeting to further discuss the agency s efforts to expedite generic drug applications   Last week  Kohl filed an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2006 supplemental spending bill to boost funding for the FDA s Generic Drug Office by  20 million to expedite generic drug approvals and reduce the backlog of generic applications by roughly 20 percent  However  Senate procedures did not allow for floor consideration of this measure
