STATEMENT OF SEN  KOHL AT ANTITRUST SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ON GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 14  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        STATEMENT OF SEN  KOHL AT ANTITRUST SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ON GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS     Thank you   Mr  Chairman     Our hearing today will consider what steps remain to be taken to ensure that competition prevails in hospital purchasing so that the abuses our subcommittee uncovered in the last several years never return    We will need to carefully consider the industry s latest efforts at self regulation   We also will examine possible legislative alternatives we have drafted should the industry s efforts fall short     The last year has witnessed important developments for all of us who care about competition in hospital purchasing   At the behest of our Subcommittee  the industry has created a new organization to set standards and monitor the purchasing activities of hospital group purchasing organizations     The purpose of this new Industry Initiative is to ensure that GPOs do not engage in anticompetitive or unethical practices that freeze out new and innovative medical device manufacturers from the hospital market          The founders of this new Industry Initiative    the nation s largest and most influential GPOs    are to be commended for voluntarily forming this organization      The goals of this organization  and the goals of the work of this Subcommittee over the last four years  are central to American health care    ensuring that physicians  patients  and health care workers have access the best and safest medical devices  devices that can literally make the difference between life and death    The vital question that remains for us to consider is whether the organization is strong enough to do the job     The founders of the Industry Initiative now argue that the creation of this organization means that we need do nothing more  and that we can rely entirely on the Initiative to guarantee an open and honest marketplace     They argue that any further legislation is unnecessary   In order to assess this claim  two vital questions must be answered     First  is this organization really up to monitoring what is taking place is this enormous  multi billion dollar industry   And  second  does this voluntary Industry Initiative contain sufficient sanctions to prevent wrongdoing and to penalize those GPOs that violate its founding principles     Any industry plan must include real and meaningful sanctions if any GPO violates ethical principles or the rules of free competition     In an industry as important to health and safety as the purchasing of medical equipment for critically ill patients  half measures which do not assure that the best medical devices are available for patients are simply not acceptable   And we have legislative tools available should we conclude that the Industry Initiative falls short    In the last Congress  Senator DeWine and I introduced the Medical Device Competition Act    This legislation would give the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to forbid GPO business practices which are anticompetitive or unethical      Other commentators have suggested an alternate approach    simply forbid GPOs from receiving payments from hospital suppliers     Advocates of this approach argue that such a prohibition would remove an inherent conflict of interest in the present system    No longer would hospital vendors pay the very organizations that are supposed to negotiate with these vendors to get the best deal for their hospitals     We will therefore need to pay close attention to the testimony of our witnesses today as we evaluate whether we need to take further steps      Before closing  I must express my disappointment that no representative of the GPO industry accepted our invitation to testify today   The GPOs  willingness to provide us with candid answers is a factor we will evaluate in determining whether self regulation will suffice     We thank the witnesses who are testifying for coming here today to testify and look forward to hearing their views
