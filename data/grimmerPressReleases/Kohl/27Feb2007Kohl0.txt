KOHL PRESSES RICE  GATES TO SEEK END TO U S  MILITARY COMMITMENT IN IRAQ                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    February 27  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL PRESSES RICE  GATES TO SEEK END TO U S  MILITARY COMMITMENT IN IRAQ Senator Urges Administration to Put Greater Emphasis on Regional Diplomacy to Achieve Stability in Iraq    WASHINGTON   Saying that the  answer to our problems in Iraq cannot be found down the barrel of a gun   U S  Senator Herb Kohl today urged the Administration to pursue more aggressive diplomatic efforts with Iraq s neighbors to help bring stability to the country and end the U S  military commitment there   Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee today regarding supplemental funding for the war in Iraq   Kohl serves on the Appropriations Committee and its Subcommittee on Defense  which has oversight over the Pentagon s annual budget    Everyone agrees that Iraq is an enormous problem for us and that by anyone s reckoning it has been badly mismanaged  Republicans and Democrats alike are desperately searching for a way out that leaves behind a stable Iraq and allows the men and women in our military    who have done a magnificent job and been stretched to the breaking point    to come home   And I also think we agree that the answer to our problems in Iraq cannot be found down the barrel of a gun   The changes that need to be made are more political than military   Our hopes increasingly focus on our diplomatic efforts   Iraq s neighbors must be more invested in quelling the country s escalating violence  and Iraqis themselves need to believe in their government and take charge of their own security   Kohl said at the hearing   Kohl also expressed concern about a statement Secretary Gates made several weeks ago mentioning that if the troop surge backed by the President was not successful  the Secretary is considering  alternatives      What concerns me about that statement is that it implies there will be no end to our commitment   I am worried that there is no point at which this Administration would look at the situation in Iraq and say that this cannot continue   Who knows  the Administration could change strategies several more times   Are you proposing an open ended commitment with constantly changing strategies    and if not    when do we run out of  alternatives    Kohl asked Secretary Gates  Secretary Gates indicated that if Iraq is left in chaos  more problems for the United States would store up in the region and beyond   He reminded the panel that the President has said the patience of the American people is limited with regard to the war in Iraq  and the Administration wants to balance that with the imperative needs of the security of the U S  by not leaving Iraq in chaos
