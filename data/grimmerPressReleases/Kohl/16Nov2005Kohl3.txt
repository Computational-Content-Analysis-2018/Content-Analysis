KOHL LONG TERM CARE BACKGROUND CHECK PROVISION INCLUDED IN ELDER JUSTICE ACT                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    November 16  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL LONG TERM CARE BACKGROUND CHECK PROVISION INCLUDED IN ELDER JUSTICE ACT     WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Herb Kohl  D WI  today announced he has joined a bi partisan group of Senators as one of the lead sponsors of the Elder Justice Act  Included in the bill is a Kohl provision requiring mandatory criminal background checks for potential long term care employees  including nursing home and home health workers   This provision extends an existing pilot program  modeled after Kohl s Patient Abuse Prevention Act  that was included in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003     This legislation asks the Congress to make the prevention of elder abuse  neglect and exploitation a top priority   and to make it just as important as preventing child abuse and domestic violence   said Kohl   As part of that effort  I am pleased that it includes the important priority of screening potential nursing home and home health workers and weeding out those with abusive and criminal backgrounds   While the vast majority of workers are dedicated and professional  it only takes a few abusive staff to threaten patient safety and peace of mind     The Elder Justice Act is designed to create a national focus on elder abuse in order to increase detection  prevention  prosecution and victim assistance  The measure ensures that states  communities  consumers and families will have access to the information and resources they need to confront this difficult issue   Kohl s background check provision mandates a national criminal background check system for nursing home  home health and other long term care employees   Currently  seven states  including Wisconsin  are engaged in the pilot project to require FBI criminal background checks before hiring a new employee with direct access to patients of long term care facilities   Passage of the Elder Justice Act will ensure that once the pilot is over  a national criminal background check system will be implemented in all fifty states    The Elder Justice Act is a bi partisan measure sponsored by Senators Orrin Hatch  R UT   Blanche Lincoln  D Ark    and Gordon Smith  R Ore
