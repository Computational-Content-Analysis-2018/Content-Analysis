KOHL MOTION OPPOSING CUTS TO CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM PASSES SENATE                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    December 15  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL MOTION OPPOSING CUTS TO CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM PASSES SENATE     Washington  D C     Senator Herb Kohl  D WI  today offered a motion to instruct conferees to oppose deep cuts to the Child Support Enforcement program that were included in the House version of the Budget Deficit Reduction Act   The Kohl motion was passed by the Senate today  75 16  The Senate version of the bill excluded any cuts to the program that enforces child support payments  one of the most successful and cost effective federal programs currently operating  In addition  Kohl drafted a letter  signed by forty nine of his colleagues  to conferees of the Budget Deficit Reduction Act of 2005  outlining a strong argument against cuts the cost effective and successful program               What do cuts like this mean for states   asked Senator Kohl on the Senate floor yesterday   And more importantly  what will cuts like this mean for hard working American families  It will mean more families falling back on welfare  it will mean roadblocks to thousands of families on their way to independence and self sufficiency  it will mean undoing the great progress made by a government program that really works               The current child support enforcement system has historically received bipartisan support  The President  in his 2006 budget  cites the program as  one of the highest rated block formula grants of all reviewed programs government wide  and goes on to praise the effective management and measurable success that the program has produced  In 2004  the program collected  21 9 billion  while total costs were kept at  5 3 billion               The harmful cuts imposed by the House bill  which narrowly passed by two votes on November 18th of this year  would phase in a 40 percent cut to the program over the next ten years  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cuts will reduce collections by  7 9 billion in the next five years and more than  24 billion over the next ten years  Additionally  these cuts will prevent states from using their performance incentive payments to draw down matching federal funds   The impact on individual states could be significantly greater  Currently  Wisconsin is a national leader in child support enforcement  collecting almost  6 00 in support for each dollar spent   Wisconsin s program provides services to more than 300 000 single parent households each year  more than half of whom are current or former welfare recipients   With the cuts in the House bill  Wisconsin would lose  143 5 million in federal funding over the next five years and county child support agency operating budgets could be reduced by as much as two thirds
