KOHL BILL GIVES STATES MORE POWER TO REGULATE SALES   MARKETING OF MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    July 26  2007    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL BILL GIVES STATES MORE POWER TO REGULATE SALES   MARKETING OF MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS Chairman of Aging Committee Delivers on Promise to  Hold Feet to the Fire     WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging  was joined today by Senators Byron Dorgan  D ND  and Ron Wyden  D OR  in introducing the Accountability and Transparency in Medicare Marketing Act of 2007   The bill would give state insurance commissioners the ability to develop standardized marketing and sales regulations of Medicare Advantage  MA  and Medicare prescription drug plans  and regulate both agents and companies in the marketing and sales of MA and prescription drug plans   If passed  the legislation would enable state insurance commissioners to adequately serve and protect Medicare beneficiaries in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS    Currently  states are largely pre empted from regulating the marketing of MA and Medicare Part D plans   The marketing guidelines for these plans were established by CMS and have proven to be inadequate   Instead of regulating these abusive marketing practices themselves  state authorities must refer complaints to CMS where it appears little has been done to quickly resolve the issues and prevent future problems   The Committee s investigation into the sales and marketing of Medicare Advantage plans has uncovered questionable practices that border on outright fraud   said Chairman Kohl    It is clear that a major disconnect in oversight exists  and it is simply unacceptable to leave our seniors unprotected    Since the Administration is not stepping up to protect seniors from abusive marking practices  it makes sense to authorize state governments to do so   Senator Dorgan said   Many state governments have let us know they are very concerned about this problem  They want to act where the Administration has failed to act  I am pleased to co sponsor legislation that would allow them to protect seniors    A decade ago I helped write a law that put an end to Medicare supplement insurance scams  but today some of the same deceptive practices have resurfaced in the marketing of Medicare Advantage   said Senator Wyden    It is time to act to ensure that the promise of health care is no longer used to prey on those who need health care the most   The bill is being introduced in response to the Aging Committee s ongoing investigation of the marketing practices of private Medicare plans and providers  which has uncovered such questionable sales practices as removing seniors from traditional Medicare without their knowledge  signing seniors up for plans they cannot afford  and misleading seniors regarding which physicians and hospitals accept the plan   At a May 16 Aging Committee hearing on the topic  officials representing the state insurance commissions from Wisconsin  Oklahoma  and Georgia described a nationwide pattern of aggressive  and at times deceptive  marketing practices employed by Medicare Advantage sales agents   Executives from three of the companies participating in the voluntary moratorium  Humana Inc   UnitedHealth Group  and WellCare  testified at the hearing that efforts would be made to reform their marketing and sales practice guidelines  Also in reaction to the Aging Committee hearing  seven insurance companieswhich together account for 90 percent of the private fee for service  PFFS  Medicare Advantage marketvoluntarily agreed to temporarily terminate the marketing and sales of their Medicare private fee for service plans to individuals   Abby Block  Director of the Center for Beneficiary Choices at the Centers for Medicare for Medicaid Services  CMS   announced the voluntary moratorium on June 15  saying it will last until such time that the insurers are able to fully comply with the six provisions released earlier this year by CMS as part of new guidelines for 2008    Specifically  the Accountability and Transparency in Medicare Marketing Act of 2007 would direct the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to establish regulations  set standards for agent conduct  and define prohibited activities with respect to the sales and marketing of MA plans   CMS and the states would then adopt these regulations  allowing both federal and state governments to enforce them   The legislation is comparable to a provision that has been included in the U S  House of Representatives  SCHIP package  Thus far  the bill has received a letter of support from the Medicare Rights Center
