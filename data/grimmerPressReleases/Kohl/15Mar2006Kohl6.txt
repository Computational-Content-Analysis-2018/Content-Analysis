OLDER WORKER OPPORTUNITY ACT WILL BOOST RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR WOMEN                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    March 15  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        OLDER WORKER OPPORTUNITY ACT WILL BOOST RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR WOMEN     Washington  D C    Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Ranking Member of the Senate s Special Committee on Aging  participated in a hearing today to examine the gender gap in retirement saving   Kohl noted that his Older Worker Opportunity Act  S 1826  legislation could serve as part of the solution  According to Census Bureau data  women receive about 53 percent of the retirement income received by men and disproportionably rely on Social Security in their retirement  which is the only source of income for over one quarter of single elderly women   Retirement security is often thought of as a  three legged stool     Social Security  employer pensions  and private saving    Kohl said   But it s clear that for too many women facing retirement  that stool is shaky   We must strengthen all three legs  and also promote a fourth leg    the opportunity to continue working past traditional retirement age for those who need to do so   Older women are less likely to participate in the labor force today  making saving for retirement more difficult   First  women are more likely to seek part time and flexible work schedules    and companies are less likely to provide pension plans for part time workers   Second  many are responsible for caring for elderly or disabled relatives  making it difficult to continue working    Kohl s bipartisan legislation would provide tax incentives for businesses to hire and retain older workers  offer them part time and flextime opportunities  and include them in the company s pension and health insurance plans   It also seeks to ease the burden on caregivers    who more often tend to be women    by giving a tax credit to workers for the care of their senior family members  In her testimony  Barbara Kennelly  President and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  lauded the Older Worker Opportunity Act as  a tremendous step in the right direction   Kennelly added    Kohl s  bill focuses on the issues that are key to both employers and older workers  in an effort to address the concerns of both partners in the employment equation I believe this legislation could go a long way toward paving the way for significant increases in older worker employment   Kohl introduced the Older Worker Opportunity Act  along with Senators Thad Cochran  R MS  and Richard Durbin  D IL   following an Aging Committee hearing he chaired in April 2005 that highlighted major barriers that prevent older Americans from working longer   The legislation also expands job training opportunities for older Americans  provides an extension of COBRA health coverage for older workers  and creates a Federal task force to identify additional barriers that make it difficult for older Americans to work longer if they so choose
