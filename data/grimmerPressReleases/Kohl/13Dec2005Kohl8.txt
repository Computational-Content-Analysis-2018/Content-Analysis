KOHL TO FIGHT HOUSE CUTS TO CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT FUNDING                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    December 13  2005    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL TO FIGHT HOUSE CUTS TO CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT FUNDING     Washington  D C    Senator Herb Kohl  along with a bipartisan group of forty seven of his colleagues  will send a letter tomorrow to conferees of the Budget Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 to express strong opposition to cuts imposed by the House to the Child Support Enforcement Program  The Senate version of the bill excludes any cuts to the program that enforces child support payments  one of the most successful and cost effective federal programs currently operating    Simply put  this program works   said Senator Kohl   It is proven that the child support program directly increases self sufficiency and that families receiving child support are more likely to leave welfare and less likely to return    The current child support enforcement system has historically received bipartisan support  The President  in his 2006 budget  cites the program as  one of the highest rated block formula grants of all reviewed programs government wide  and goes on to praise the effective management and measurable success that the program has produced  In 2004  the program collected  21 9 billion  while total costs were kept at  5 3 billion    The harmful cuts imposed by the House bill  which narrowly passed by two votes on November 18th of this year  would phase in a 40 percent cut to the program over the next ten years  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cuts will reduce collections by  7 9 billion in the next five years and more than  24 billion over the next ten years  Additionally  these cuts will prevent states from using their performance incentive payments to draw down matching federal funds   The impact on individual states could be significantly greater  Currently  Wisconsin is a national leader in child support enforcement  collecting almost  6 00 in support for each dollar spent   Wisconsin s program provides services to more than 300 000 single parent households each year  more than half of whom are current or former welfare recipients   With the cuts in the House bill  Wisconsin would lose  143 5 million in federal funding over the next five years and county child support agency operating budgets could be reduced by as much as two thirds  The Senate is expected to name conferees to the Budget Deficit Reduction Act of 2006 either today or tomorrow
