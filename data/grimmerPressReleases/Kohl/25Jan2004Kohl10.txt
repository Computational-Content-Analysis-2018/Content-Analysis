INTERNATIONAL FOOD AID FUNDING                    Press Release      For Immediate Release    January 25  2004    Phone   202  224 5653        INTERNATIONAL FOOD AID FUNDING     Mr  President  very soon the Administration is expected to send to Congress supplemental appropriation requests to address ongoing military needs in Iraq and the humanitarian crisis posed by the tsunami in the Indian Ocean   My hope is that the administration will include adequate food aid funding in that supplemental proposal    Recent press reports suggest they may be moving in that direction    If  however  the Administration s proposed supplemental fails to provide adequate food aid funding  it is my intention to offer an amendment that would essentially accomplish four things  First  my amendment would provide full funding to meet US food aid commitments from the tsunami under PL480 Title II   Second  my amendment will replenish PL480 Title II development funds that help meet our ongoing development programs across the globe  Third  it will shore up PL480 Title I funds that have been used as a stop gap measure to address the crisis   And finally  it will replenish the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust  BEHT  so that our aid workers and development personnel can be  assured of adequate resources to carry out their important  live saving work in future crisis  The Tsunami brought images of destruction and human suffering on a scale that is hard for many of us to imagine   Americans responded with great generosity by committing unprecedented funds through private donations   Some  50 million  I am told  has been pledged through the American Red Cross alone  Federal workers and their cooperators in Washington and around the globe made an extraordinary effort to respond   Food resources that were pre positioned  and even some in transit  were shifted to address this crisis   For all their hard work and creativity  I commend them  What concerns me now  however  is how we proceed after the television networks scale back their coverage   Enormous need will remain even after the emergency is contained   It will be months  perhaps years  before rice paddies are desalinated  fishing boats are rebuilt and fishing nets are repaired   Self sufficiency will not happen over night    And while the people most directly affected by the tsunami are struggling to achieve a measure of self sufficiency  the dire need for food aid continues in places like Ethiopia and Sudan and many others   That is why I believe it is so critical that we reinforce our food aid capacity  In his inaugural address  the President spoke forcefully about ending tyranny and spreading democracy   Everyone shares those objectives   We also know that those objectives cannot be achieved solely by force or gesture politics   They demand a commitment to diplomacy and human compassion   Adequate funding for food aid is central to that process and I invite my colleagues to join me in this effort
