KOHL QUESTIONS RUMSFELD AND RICE ON DIRECTION OF IRAQ WAR                     Press Release      For Immediate Release    May 3  2006    Phone   202  224 5653        KOHL QUESTIONS RUMSFELD AND RICE ON DIRECTION OF IRAQ WAR      WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Herb Kohl today participated in a briefing by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  who were in the Capitol this afternoon for a confidential Senators Only briefing on Iraq  North Korea and other issues  A bipartisan majority of the Senate agreed last year that 2006 needs to be a year of transition toward a successful conclusion to U S  involvement in Iraq    As I ve said on many occasions  President Bush misused and abused Congressional authority leading up to the Iraq war  and has made mistakes at virtually every turn  Looking forward  I remain concerned that the Administration s commitment in Iraq is too broad  and that they still lack a firm timetable for the orderly and honorable withdrawal of our troops  The American people don t want an open ended commitment in Iraq and we are urging the Administration to produce a clear plan for ending our obligations there  Americans    and especially our brave fighting men and women    deserve answers to their legitimate questions about how much longer this bloody war will continue  and to what end   Kohl said   Last year Kohl supported legislation sponsored by Sen  Carl Levin  D MI  which called on the President to make 2006 a year of transition between U S  and Iraqi control  Senator Levin has also suggested that the Shiites  Sunnis  and Kurds are all counting on the U S  presence in Iraq to keep the country from falling into civil war  He argues that the U S  should use that leverage to motivate the Iraqis to make the necessary compromises to achieve the broadly based political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency    that the U S  should tell the Iraqis that if they fail to reach a solution by the time table that they have set forth  that the U S  will consider a time table for the reduction of our forces
