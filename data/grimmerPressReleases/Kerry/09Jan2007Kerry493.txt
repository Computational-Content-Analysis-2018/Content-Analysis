 protects Americans from paying for the benefits of corrupt members of Congress

Today  Senator John Kerry  D Mass   and Senator Ken Salazar  D Colo   reintroduced their ethics reform legislation  The Congressional Pension Accountability Act  or    The Duke Cunningham Act     The bill targets the culture of corruption in Washington by cancelling taxpayer funded pension benefits to Members of Congress who are convicted of serious ethics offenses   crimes such as bribery  conspiracy  The bill was authored by Kerry and is co sponsored by Senator Ken Salazar        Kerry said     The American people knocked some sense into Washington last November  and this new Congress will be the one that finally passes our common sense legislation to stop American taxpayers from paying pensions for lawmakers who break the law  It is disgusting that those who grossly exploited power for personal gain would continue to receive big checks thanks to American taxpayers  This bill will help hold all Members of Congress to the highest ethical standards  and punish those who see the honor of holding public office as an opportunity to indulge in a Cunningham style culture of corruption         Under current law  only a conviction for a crime against the United States  such as treason or espionage  causes U S  Representatives and Senators to lose their Congressional pensions   Members of Congress convicted of white collar crimes still receive these federal retirement benefits   The Kerry legislation will change existing law to insure that the Congress no longer rewards unethical behavior at the expense of American taxpayers          The only thing crazier than giving a member of Congress convicted of a crime a federal pension is the fact that we still need a bill to prevent a convict from receiving their pension   Any member of Congress who abuses their position of authority for their personal profit deserves a prison sentence  not a government pension     said Senator Salazar        In the largest bribery case in the Congress since the 1980s  former Congressman Randy    Duke    Cunningham resigned from the House of Representatives after pleading guilty in federal court to receiving  2 4 million in bribes from military contractors and evading more than  1 million in taxes   In a plea agreement  Cunningham admitted a pattern of bribery lasting close to five years  with federal contractors giving him Persian rugs  a Rolls Royce  antique furniture  travel and hotel expenses  use of a yacht and a lavish graduation party for his daughter   Unless the law is changed  legislators who breach the public trust in the future  like Cunningham  will be allowed to receive his Congressional pension of approximately  40 000 per year        Kerry  Salazar Move to Deny Pensions to Lawbreaking Lawmakers    Under Kerry   s bill  the following offenses would cause a Member of Congress to lose his or her Congressional pension                Bribery of public officials and witnesses  Section 201 of Title 18                  Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud the United States  Section 371 of Title 18                 Perjury committed under the statues of the United States or the District of Columbia in falsely denying the commission of bribery or conspiracy  and                Subordination of perjury committed in connection with the false denial or false testimony of another individual       Although the bill is inspired by the crimes of former Congressman Duke Cunningham  the law would not be retroactive in scope  and therefore would not affect Cunningham directly   A retroactive law of that nature would be unconstitutional   Kerry and Salazar originally introduced this legislation on February 9  2006     If passed  the law will go into affect in 2009
