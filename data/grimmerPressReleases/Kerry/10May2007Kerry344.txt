John Kerry  D MA   Russ Feingold  D WI  and Susan Collins  R ME  introduced an amendment to ensure the U S  Army Corps of Engineers considers the effects of climate change when planning water projects   The amendment  offered to the Water Resources Development Act  requires the Corps to use the best available climate science  account for potential future impacts of climate change on storms and floods  and account for the costs and benefits associated with the loss and protection of wetlands  floodplains  and other natural systems that can buffer the effects of climate change  Senators Bernie Sanders  I VT   Joseph Biden  D DE  and Tom Carper  D DE  also co sponsored the amendment        Senator Kerry said   We must address global climate change before it s too late    the impacts are real and here today   If we are serious about preventing and responding to climate change  we need to start taking those impacts into consideration for every project we start   I strongly urge the Army Corps to incorporate considerations like sea level rise and storm activity into its planning  We can no longer afford to delay           Natural systems like wetlands and floodplains can act as important buffers between hurricanes or other severe storms and coastal communities   Senator Feingold said    When Corps projects destroy these and other types of natural barriers  they may put lives at risk   The Corps must take into account what effects its projects will have on the environment in order to ensure the safety of communities          The Homeland Security Committee s investigation of the Hurricane Katrina disaster showed the catastrophic consequences of being ill prepared for a natural disaster   Our more recent hearing revealed that federal programs have not taken climate change into account in their underwriting or budgets   said Senator Collins    It is absolutely critical that the Army Corps prepare for the potential impacts of global climate change  which are expected to include increased droughts  floods  and more intense hurricanes   I am pleased to join Senators Kerry and Feingold in offering this important amendment         Senator Sanders said   You really can t fool Mother Nature  not even if you re the Army Corps of Engineers   That s why the Corps must consider climate change as it plans projects   Because global warming already is making bad storms worse  we need to protect people from the short term impact of climate change while we work on a long term solution to reverse global warming         A 2007 United Nations Report by the Scientific Expert Group on Climate Change stated that   Human health   will be threatened by increases in the intensity and frequency of storms  floods  droughts  and heat related mortality    The loss of these natural barriers can leave communities vulnerable as demonstrated by the effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005   Healthy wetlands can also help minimize the impacts of drought as well as providing critical habitats for fish and other wildlife             Kerry Feingold Collins Global Climate Change Amendment to WRDA  Planning ahead to protect communities from the effects of global climate change    The Kerry Feingold Collins global climate change amendment requires the Corps of Engineers to account for the potential effects of climate change when planning water projects to better protect communities and the environment          The amendment requires the Corps to use the best available climate science  account for potential future impacts of climate change on storms and floods  and account for the costs and benefits associated with the loss and protection of wetlands  floodplains  and other natural systems that can buffer the affects of climate change   Building on existing law and policy  the amendment also requires the Corps to use nonstructural approaches  where appropriate  in project planning to help protect such natural systems        Global climate change threatens community health and safety   Scientists expect an increase in extreme weather events  including more powerful storms  more frequent floods and extended droughts   All too often  Corps projects damage or destroy healthy streams  wetlands and floodplains that provide important buffers against these effects of global climate change          Healthy rivers  streams  wetlands  and floodplains reduce the impacts of flooding by acting as natural sponges and basins  absorbing flood waters and releasing them slowly over time   Coastal wetlands provide vital barriers between storm surges and communities   When these wetlands are lost  coastal communities are far more vulnerable to disaster  as we saw so tragically during Hurricane Katrina   Healthy wetlands help minimize the impacts of drought by recharging groundwater supplies and filtering pollutants from drinking water   They also provide critical habitat for fish and wildlife  and important recreational opportunities          What the Experts Are Saying        Human health     will be threatened by increases in the intensity and frequency of storms  floods  droughts  and heat related mortality    Scientific Expert Group on Climate Change  United Nations Report 2007        Flood damage reduction management efforts are  shifting away from reliance on physical structures to effective management of flood plains  including restricting development  using wetlands  and trying to re create the ability of rivers to spread floods to avoid concentrated downstream impacts   These adaptations may be effective if implemented in response to climate change  but would be more effective if implemented in anticipation of climate change    U S  National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability
