John Kerry announced today a new funding push he is making in Congress to aid returning war veterans        Kerry made the announcement today at the premier of the groundbreaking new documentary on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder     Hidden Wounds     by New England Cable News   Kerry was joined at the premier today by former Senator and decorated veteran Max Cleland  military veterans  the commanders of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire National Guard  and survivors       Proposal     Add  100 million in the FY06 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act to Vet Centers for expanded PTSD Screening and Treatment Programs     What   The National Guard in New England has pioneered innovative solutions to deal with the stress and strains experienced by all soldiers returning from active duty in combat zones   Under an initiative developed first by the New Hampshire National Guard  and since adopted in Massachusetts  and under consideration elsewhere  service members are required to undergo an in state counseling and readjustment program  part of which includes one on one counseling with a counselor from a Vet Center      Why   Not all the wounds of war are physical   In July of 2004  the New England Journal of Medicine reported that one in six combat veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan showed symptoms of major depression  anxiety  or post traumatic stress disorder    A more recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 19 1  of returning veterans from Iraq  and 11 3 percent of veterans retuning from Afghanistan  reported mental health problems   We know from historic experience that soldiers will return from war having to navigate a range of emotional issues  regardless of whether or not they are diagnosed with PTSD       In FY2004  Vet Centers served 125 859 veterans in more than 1 million visits   Even without the war in Iraq  Vet Centers were already overloaded with cases   Last year alone  Vet Centers expected to provide services to nearly 14 000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan in almost 44 000 office visits   more than 3 800 of these veterans were PTSD clients       In testimony last year  VA officials noted that  except for cost of living increments  Vet Center budgets have not increased in the last ten years      Details   The New Hampshire National Guard pioneered this new approach to meeting the mental health and readjustment needs of its soldiers   It has since been adopted by the Massachusetts National Guard and briefed to enthusiastic leaders from the National Guard in each of the New England States   After spending one day at home  reuniting with family and loved ones  soldiers are required to report to local armories where they are assisted with paperwork  participate in a medical session with VA representatives  and receive instruction from the chaplain   s staff on how best to readjust   Most importantly  members of the National Guard receive one on one counseling with counselors from Vet Centers who specialize in treating war trauma and related readjustment issues       The counseling is both mandatory and confidential   As a result  the New Hampshire approach has destroyed any stigma associated with seeking help for emotional health problems   Of the first 810 soldiers to pass through the screening process  nearly 200 have received counseling       Counselors at Vet Centers are highly trained in readjustment counseling   60  of the counselors in Vets Centers are veterans themselves  40  are combat veterans   All are very experienced helping veterans and their families deal with the challenges of readjustment       Vet Centers are funded through the Department of Veterans Affairs   They provide invaluable service to the country   s veterans   To meet the needs of the New Hampshire National Guard  the Vet   s Centers in New England called in counselors from other states   The New Hampshire National Guard shared the expense of this collaborative effort because it was the right thing to do for returning soldiers       This should be a national priority with federal funding      Legislation   Add  100 million to the FY06 Emergency Supplemental to fund PTSD screening of returning National Guard Veterans through Vet Centers nation wide                                                                                                               Resources          Q and A  Q  What are Vet   s Centers       A   Congress established the provision for readjustment counseling for Vietnam era veterans in 1979  recognizing that a significant number of these veterans continued to experience readjustment problems  In 1991  legislation extended the eligibility of counseling to combat veterans of the post Vietnam era conflicts  including Persian Gulf  Panama  Grenada  and Lebanon  Vet centers are staffed with professionals experienced and trained with working with veterans  Counselors come from many disciplines including psychology  social work  nursing  and rehabilitation counseling  Many staff members are veterans themselves       Q   What is their current annual funding       A   The President   s FY06 Budget proposal anticipated 1 050 readjustment counseling sessions in FY05 and 1075 in FY06   In FY05 and FY06  their budget was just less than  100 million per year      Q   Are there any other legislative proposals to increase funding at Vet Centers       A   S 716  Akaka  would increase authorized funding for Vet Centers to  180 million   It passed the Senate by unanimous consent on December 22  2005
