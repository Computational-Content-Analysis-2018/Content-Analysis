                                                                                                                                                                                  Alexandria  VA     At a time when Congress is debating how to cut federal funding for Medicaid     Kids Come First Act     S  114  proposed by Sen  John Kerry  D MA  recognizes that the big challenges for children receiving care under Medicaid are barriers to coverage and care access     not cost control     S  114 is a model for how Congress should address the needs of uninsured children and children enrolled in Medicaid   If Congress were to focus on what children need  it would increase the federal investment in Medicaid coverage for them  not reduce it     The bottom line is Medicaid matters to children of low income families  to children   s hospitals  and to all children   Medicaid pays for the health care of one in four children  one in three infants  and almost half of the patient care provided by children   s hospitals   When Medicaid is cut  it forces children   s hospitals to curtail services that benefit all children  not just low income children     S  114 directs additional federal funds to states to ensure they have the resources to cover the poorest children under Medicaid and the incentive to extend coverage to lower income children who are ineligible for Medicaid  but could qualify for the State Children   s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP      S  114 reflects the fact that children are not the cost drivers in Medicaid   Although they represent half of all Medicaid recipients  children  including children with disabilities  account for only 22 percent of Medicaid spending   Furthermore  per capita spending for children under Medicaid is comparable to private insurance costs  despite the fact that Medicaid covers a larger proportion of children with disabilities  who have more extensive health care needs   And for years children have led the modernization of Medicaid with their enrollment in commercial capitated managed care plans       Currently  the biggest challenge to covering children under Medicaid is enrolling and retaining uninsured children who are eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP       Two thirds of all uninsured children are already eligible for one of these two programs but not enrolled   If resources were committed to fulfill the promise of Medicaid and SCHIP  virtually all children would be covered   There is strong  bipartisan support in Congress and the White House for doing a better job of enrollment       The second biggest challenge is the growing inadequacy of Medicaid reimbursement to children   s providers   On average  Medicaid pays for physicians    care for children well below Medicare reimbursement rates  despite the fact that Medicare rates are themselves widely recognized in Congress to be insufficient to ensure adequate access to care     S  114 addresses both problems   First  to ensure that states have adequate resources to give eligible children access to the care they need  the bill would authorize the federal government to give states sufficient funds to match or cover 100 percent of the recognized costs of care       Second  the bill encourages states to extend SCHIP coverage to more children  If states were to raise eligibility levels for SCHIP to 300 percent of the federal poverty level  this would result in states    receipt of a 100 percent federal Medicaid match for children with family incomes below the federal poverty level   The bill would also make several other changes in Medicaid and SCHIP  including giving states the ability to streamline and modernize their enrollment systems       For these reasons children   s hospitals support S  114  This bill aims high  striving to ensure all children receive health care coverage that meets their unique needs             Representing 130 children   s hospitals  the National Association of Children   s Hospitals
