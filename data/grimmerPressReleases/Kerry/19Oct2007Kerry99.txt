John Kerry wrote to Treasury Secretary Paulson  asking him to provide a plan to address the national foreclosure crisis  Today  more than two million American families  including thousands in Massachusetts  risk losing their homes to foreclosure in the near future      Im asking Secretary Paulson to take overdue action now before todays housing crunch becomes tomorrows recession  They need to take aggressive action to save homeowners from foreclosure  So far  the Bush Administration has responded to the mortgage crisis just as they respond to most challenges   they protect their friends first while they play a shell game with those being hit hardest  The steps taken so far only scratch the surface of what the government could be doing to respond  Instead of helping banks and bondholders stay on top at all costs  the Treasury should be ensuring American families do not lose the roof over their heads    Only a paltry 1 percent of troubled subprime mortgages have been restructured by lenders   Kerry joined Sheila Bair  Chair of the FDIC  in asking for immediate action to develop a systematic approach for lenders to make loan modifications so creditworthy families can stay in their homes     Kerry also called to immediately increase the portfolio caps for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by ten percent on a temporary basis  to insure that more families get access to fair  non predatory mortgages   Unfortunately  this has been opposed by the Bush Administration     Finally  he is pushing Congress to enact legislation to prohibit the most abusive and predatory lending practices that disclosures cannot protect against  Unfortunately  the Bush Administration has also opposed legislation to stop predatory lending      The text of Kerrys letter to Paulson is below    October 17  2007   The Honorable Henry M  Paulson  Jr    Secretary  Department of Treasury  15th and Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Room 3330  Washington  D C  20220   Dear Secretary Paulson    I am writing to ask you to take additional steps which I believe are critical to help avert a dramatic increase in home foreclosures in Massachusetts and across the United States       Owning your own home is the foundation of the American dream   Home ownership encourages personal responsibility  provides financial security  and gives families a stake in their neighborhoods   Unfortunately  more than 2 million Americansincluding thousands in Massachusettsmay see that dream crumble as they face impending foreclosure      I am pleased that the Administration supports legislation to increase loan limits and lower down payment requirements for the Federal Housing Administration   This will increase access to federally backed mortgages by the lowest income homeowners   I also appreciate your support for changing the tax code so that families wont have to pay additional taxes when theyre fighting to keep their homes   These efforts will help many more families in Massachusetts and across the nation find a way out of the abusive loans under which they are currently trapped      However  I believe there is much more that the Bush Administration can do to head off the increasing numbers of foreclosures expected in the near future   A recent report by Moodys Investors Service Inc  says that less than 1 percent of subprime home mortgages that are in trouble have been restructured by lenders   This is unacceptable   Sheila Bair  Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  has said that the current Bush Administration approach to deal with loan modifications on a case by case basis is not going to work   To avert a dramatic increase in foreclosures  I ask that you immediately begin developing a systematic program to provide mortgage loan modifications to creditworthy homeowners currently facing foreclosure    I am very disappointed that the Bush Administration has previously expressed opposition to efforts to develop a systematic way to work with lenders to help qualified homeowners to restructure their mortgages and avert foreclosure     I ask that you immediately support increasing the portfolio caps for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by 10 percent on a temporary basis to insure that more families can gain access to fair  non predatory mortgages   Right now  too many families cant get a mortgage at a fair price on the open market    Unfortunately  it is my understanding that the Bush Administration is opposed to this common sense action      We in government have an obligation to protect the homeowners from predatory lending practices   We should also prohibit the most abusive and predatory practices by lenders that disclosures cannot protect against   Given the crisis we now face as a nation  it is unacceptable that some predatory lenders continue to target the most vulnerable potential homeowners   This will increase foreclosure rates in the future    Specifically  I ask that you support legislation to lower the interest rate and fees that trigger federal consumer protections and prohibit predatory lenders from instituting charges that are unfair to consumers   I am disappointed that the Bush Administration has previously failed to support legislative efforts to halt the predatory mortgage lending practices that increase foreclosure rates and threaten to undermine our efforts to revitalize neighborhoods and expand homeownership opportunities across the country    We have to help families in Massachusetts and across America find a way out of the abusive loans that now hold them hostage   I believe these efforts will help ease the number of foreclosures  help more families enjoy the benefits of homeownership and help our economy continue to grow    Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request      Sincerely    John F  Kerry                                                                         20510
