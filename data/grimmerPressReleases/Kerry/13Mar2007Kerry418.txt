and Senator Edward Kennedy  along with the rest of the Massachusetts Congressional delegation today urged the Secretary of Defense to reconsider the plan eliminate the designation of the Balkans and Kosovo as Combat Zones         As a result of the designation change  guard members will lose their Imminent Danger Pay and various other economic entitlements  putting an unnecessary financial burden on their families back home             Adding undue financial burdens on our soldiers  economic benefits in the middle of their deployment is wrong  When these brave men and women signed on for their service  they were told one thing   and now they re being told another   said Senator Kerry   The government that sends our troops into harm s way must do better by our brave men and women in uniform  Our troops make the ultimate commitment and we must not fail them  I promise to continue to work with my colleagues in Washington to help prevent these wrong headed changes from taking place          The entire Massachusetts Congressional delegation has spoken out against this sudden change in designation of the Balkans as a combat zone while so many of our soldiers are deployed there  The change in designation would impose severe financial hardship on the 500 Army National Guard soldiers from Massachusetts serving there  It s an unfair burden that will mean real hardship for our soldiers   said Senator Kennedy         The text of the letter is as follows         The Honorable Robert M  Gates      Secretary of Defense      1000 Defense Pentagon      Washington  DC 20301 1000       Dear Secretary Gates                    We re writing about the plan to eliminate the designation of the Balkans and Kosovo as Combat Zones as April 1  We have significant concerns about how this mid rotation designation change will affect the Army National Guard soldiers   including approximately 500 Massachusetts soldiers   who are serving in this region  Recent reports of continued violence make this issue especially pressing                    The loss of Imminent Danger Pay as a result of the designation will have a serious effect on the National Guard members  families  Currently  these service members are receiving an additional  225 a month in Imminent Danger Pay and have budgeted in accord with this allowance  These families are already under considerable financial strain because of the deployments  and the loss of the pay will impose an even more significant burden                    The change in designation also means that these National Guard members will lose their combat zone tax exclusion for their active duty pay  their re enlistment bonus  their leave pay  and other entitlements  Making these changes in the middle of their deployment will make matters worse for members of the National Guard and their families at home  When our soldiers began this deployment they assumed that their pay and benefits would be commensurate with their sacrifice  Reducing their benefits when their commitment remains the same is very likely to undermine their morale as well                    We understand that your Office is conducting a review to determine whether or not the Balkans and Kosovo continue to justify Combat Zone designation  We ask that no change of designation be made during the current rotation  Thank you for considering our request                                                          With respect and appreciation                                                        John Kerry
