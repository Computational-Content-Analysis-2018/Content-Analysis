       Releases                                                                                                                                           06 28 2005 John Kerry Speaks Out on Iraq  Details Concrete Steps President Must Take to Rescue the Mission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   John Kerry went to the Senate floor this afternoon to offer a concrete set of steps the President needs to take to rescue the mission in Iraq  get it right  and deal with a series of mistakes that have brought us to this point   The remarks that follow are as prepared                                                                                                                                           Mr  President  tonight President Bush will speak to the nation about the situation in Iraq   And I think we all have a sense of what he   ll say   He   ll talk about the march of democracy and the courage of our troops across the world   He   ll speak with pride about Iraqi elections and the end of tyranny  and stress the importance of fighting terror   And that   s fine   we all agree with that   but those words alone won   t be enough to improve a situation clearly headed in a perilous direction   We need new  strong policy to get it right in Iraq            Today  we have no realistic strategy to reduce the risks to our soldiers and achieve our goals   While our military has done a superb job  our civilian leadership has not  and our soldiers are paying the price every day   We need a realistic plan for success         To do that  we must tear down the wall of arrogance   When the Vice President absurdly claims the    insurgency is in its last throes    he insults the common sense and intelligence of the American people  and diminishes our stature in the world   And how can we expect the Iraqi people to take us seriously and do their part when the White House says the insurgency is fading  yet they live in constant fear  the explosions waking them up at night  reminding Iraqis of the danger inherent in even the short walk to work or school the next morning              While we shouldn   t dwell on mistakes  we need to understand their consequences on our ability to effectively move forward   With allies reading the Downing Street memo  and the American people realizing the rationalization for this war changed midstream  it becomes that much harder to rally the collective strength of the nation and the world to our cause              We have to acknowledge the past to overcome it  because the truth is the stubbornness of this Administration matters   It hurts our chances for success   It leads to frustrated expectations at home  makes it so much more difficult for the Iraqi people to embrace this cause  and makes it so much easier for sidelined nations to turn their back on a common interest and say     OK  it s their deal               And the bottom line is that when it comes to war and the safety of American troops  there is no time for excuses   It   s time for the Administration to tell the truth about what   s happening on the ground and open up to new ideas about how to get the job done         Admitting mistakes is a necessary hurdle and a constructive tool for this Administration if it wants to build the strength necessary to get it right in Iraq   Admitting mistakes paves the way for elected officials and the American people to come together to move forward   Admitting mistakes lays the groundwork for a climate of cooperation that allows allies to add to our own strength   Admitting mistakes eases the concerns of the Iraqi people  and helps us make them understand that there will be no success unless they embrace the burden of their own future            And that includes acknowledging that Iraq today is something it wasn   t before the war  a breeding ground for jihadists   Today there are 16 20 000 insurgents  and the number of jihadists among them is growing   This is a growing challenge  and we need to take immediate steps to address it   Our officer corps reports that every time our troops kill or capture an insurgent  three more step forward to take his place   That is not a compelling strategy for success         So I hope tonight that we hear something new from the President   I hope the President recognizes that the people demand more than a new communications strategy   they demand real leadership and a strategy for success in this war that gets our troops home   If the President does this  he will begin to restore the confidence of the American people and the respect of the world  In showing real leadership  he will make clear to the Iraqi people that it   s time for them to take the lead          I also hope the American people understand that there still can be a plan for success in Iraq if we move quickly   The mistakes we have made don   t change the fact that our military is the most powerful in the world  and that democracy is one of the world   s most powerful ideas   The mistakes don   t change the fact that the Iraqi people understand through the powerful memory of generations that they have a unique opportunity to shape their own future   If the President gets serious about getting this right and telling the truth  and the Iraqi people get serious about doing their part and bearing the burden  we can have success in Iraq       So what can the President say tonight to get things right in Iraq  and put us on the road to success   The President can start by immediately declaring that the United States does not seek bases or any permanent military presence in Iraq   Erasing suspicion of indefinite occupation is critical to eroding support for the insurgency          Getting it right also means using our overwhelming leverage to get the Iraqis to do their part   Our massive military presence is all that stands between the Iraqi people and complete chaos   Our special forces are protecting Iraqi leaders   With this kind of leverage  it   s shocking that the Administration allowed six months to go by before including Sunnis in the political process   This was an obvious  crucial prerequisite to success  yet there was no sense of urgency  and minimal pressure applied   It   s time for the Administration to use its leverage to insist the Iraqis to do their part  establish a truly inclusive political process  and meet the deadlines for finishing the Constitution and holding new elections in December          Getting it right also means putting together a real plan for the training of Iraqi troops and following through on it   This should be our top priority   It   s the key to getting our troops home and avoiding a humiliating withdrawal   It   s time to move beyond fudging the numbers and finally put the training of Iraqi troops on a true six month wartime footing  which includes ensuring the Iraqi government has the budget necessary to deploy them   It   s also time to stop using the in country training requirement as an excuse for refusing offers made by Egypt  Jordan  France and Germany to do more   Why would we turn down this opportunity to give our troops the relief they deserve          Getting it right also means drawing up a detailed plan with the clear milestone of transfer of military and police responsibilities to Iraqis after the December elections   The Administration   s plan should take into account both political and security objectives  including Iraqi force structure  and be specifically tied to a defined series of tasks and accomplishments   This plan must be more than dates and numbers   it must make clear to the Iraqi government that American patience is limited            The Iraqi people need to understand that in America  when we see Army recruitment suffering  and families organizing to protect their kids from recruiters  and the divorce rate for military officers skyrocketing  we take it very seriously   I know the Iraqi people already understand that our troops are skilled and brave   now they need to understand that we must see legitimate progress that offers a real chance of American troops beginning to come home           At the same time  if the Administration really wants to get the Iraqis to bear the burden  they need to move beyond the hollow    stay as long as it takes no matter what    talk that provides an endless security blanket   a disincentive for Iraqis to stand up for Iraq   and instead talk forcefully about how to transfer of responsibility         If the Administration gets this plan right  and the Iraqis succeed in adopting a new Constitution and holding elections as planned  trained Iraqi security forces should be ready to take on more responsibility at the critical moment when support for the insurgency is diminishing   That   s the kind of careful  strategic planning we need to set the stage for American forces to begin to come home as Iraqi security forces assume more of the mission   But  again  this won   t happen if the Iraqi people don   t do their part   We must make the Iraqi government understand that the patience of America is finite  and that real progress must be achieved          Mr  President  there   s no question that deploying capable Iraqi security forces is imperative to success   But the Administration would have us believe that Iraqi forces alone could end the insurgency   That   s not enough   And I hope that the President strikes a different tone tonight  and commits to work simultaneously on all fronts   security  economic and political          The Administration should know by now that overly optimistic predictions for rebuilding Iraq have been a drag on our mission   Reconstruction lags behind even in the Shiite south and the Kurdish north  where security is less of an issue   This sends the wrong message to those we ask to sacrifice for freedom   We need to speed up work in these areas to demonstrate that progress will be made in the rest of Iraq   If Iraqis  particularly Sunnis who fear being left out in the cold  see electricity flowing  jobs being created  infrastructure being built  and a government of their own choosing being formed  the lure of insurgency will diminish   The violence and risk to our troops will decrease   To get it right in Iraq  we must show all Iraqis that they   re fighting not only for a future of freedom  but for a tangibly improved future for their children            Getting it right also means understanding the neighborhood   and getting those with an interest in Iraq  like the Saudis  to act now   Iraq is surrounded by Sunni neighbors with significant resources  yet complaints about being left out fall on deaf ears   They could do so much more to help  and we should encourage them   Even short term improvements  such as providing electricity from their power grids  or supplying diesel fuel   an offer made yet unfulfilled by the Saudis   will go a long way   But we have to do our part and address their legitimate concerns if we want these nations to step up to the plate and help us secure Iraq   s borders  bring Sunnis into the political process  or rebuild Iraq   s economy and infrastructure   We must offer a coherent strategic plan for regional security   We must address their fears of an Iran dominated crescent  and their concerns about our sporadic mediation between Israel and the Palestinians   This Administration needs to show that it understands there has to be some give and take      The Administration could also give a significant boost to the rebuilding effort by recognizing the great untapped potential of private sector contributions   The Administration  working with the Iraqi government  should organize a development conference for Iraqi businessmen and their regional counterparts who wish to invest in Iraq   Regional investment would not only strengthen Iraq   s economy   it would give neighboring governments a greater stake in Iraq   s success  and another incentive to do more to help  And the Administration might want to consider the effect on regional businessmen when they read headlines about Halliburton   s extraordinary dominance of local contracts      Mr  President  much of what I   ve discussed today  from Administration mistakes to the steps needed to move forward  deal with laying the groundwork for long term success  But the reality is the elections are six months off   Iraq won   t be rebuilt overnight  and it will take time to get the Iraqi troops ready   In the coming months  even with perfect planning  there will be violence  turmoil and hardship            That   s why tonight it   s critical that President Bush makes clear tonight that there are actions we can take in the short term to ease the burden on our troops   He needs to get this right  not only to save American lives  but to elevate the confidence of the American people   For this to happen  the President must reconsider some hastily brushed aside options            To date  the Administration has been unwilling to entertain the idea of empowered militias  instead singularly focusing on a unified Iraqi security force   But Iraq  like Afghanistan  has numerous tribal  religious and ethnic militias such as the Kurdish peshmerga and the Shiite Badr Army   These forces are structured  and most importantly accepted by provincial populations and capable of providing protection while helping with reconstruction   In the interim  while a fully capable Iraqi security force is established  these forces could meet some of the critical security needs   If they can help do the job  why not let them   It   s time for the Administration to put aside its concerns and prod the Iraqi government to give the militias legitimacy   We can do this by integrating them into a National Guard type force and using them to provide security in their own areas  where they are respected            The Administration also needs to get it right on border security if we want to ease the burden on our troops in the short term   The truth is border security has been absent from day one  which is a shame because this is exactly where our allies can help   As opposed to providing security in urban areas  border security is generally less risky for troops   The Administration must work with the Iraqi government to reach out to the world and establish multi national force to secure Iraq   s borers   Such a force  if sanctioned by the UN Security Council  could attract participation by Iraq   s neighbors  and powerful nations with a vested interest  like India          Mr  President  the Administration has narrowed our options in Iraq  but there are still better choices available to us   There is still time to get it right in Iraq  and I hope for the sake of our troops that the President begins to get it right tonight   We are at a critical juncture in this conflict  both at home and abroad  and the last thing we need is the Administration growing even more stubborn or defensive   Today  our nation needs honest leadership and a comprehensive strategy for success  It   s time for the President to reach out and work across the aisle and across the globe to clean up this mess            The President must seize this opportunity to move forward  as the next months are so critical to the future of Iraq and our security   If the Administration fails to take the steps available to them   and fails to hold the Iraqis accountable   we will stumble along  our troops at greater risk  casualties rising  the patience of the American people wearing thin  and the specter of quagmire staring us in the face            Every missed step  every measure untaken  every wise course not followed carries an unbearable cost   The American people have a right to expect accountability from their leaders   We need to decrease the risk to our troops and strengthen our chances for success   Our troops deserve better than what they   re getting   They deserve leadership equal to their sacrifice
