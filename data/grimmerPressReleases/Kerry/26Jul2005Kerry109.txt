year millions of American families  particularly those in the northeast  are being hit hard by a major heat wave     said Senator Kerry      I know that my own state of Massachusetts is experiencing

       Below is the text of the bipartisan letter sent to President Bush      July 25  2005     The Honorable George W  Bush President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW Washington  DC  20500           Dear President Bush      We urge you to immediately release the remaining  47 6 million in emergency Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  funding provided in the fiscal year 2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act   The high energy costs facing low income households and the heat wave experienced throughout the Northeast and Midwest warrants the release of these funds     The first official week of summer brought a heat wave with temperatures climbing into the 90s across states in the Northeast and Midwest   In Michigan  Wisconsin and Vermont  the National Weather Service said June was the second hottest on record in the state    According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration     New York State had its warmest June on record  with 12 other states from Minnesota to Maine ranking much above normal for the month      Temperatures reaching above 90 degrees in Cleveland prompted city officials to test a new system to warn seniors to keep cool   An automated telephone system dialed the homes of more than 57 000 residents 65 and older  who are especially susceptible to the heat   In Boston  temperatures at the end of June reached a high of 95 degrees    the hottest the city has been since August 18  2002   For the July  cooling degree days for the region remained significantly higher than normal       Many low income consumers entered this summer facing high energy debt due to the winter   s unaffordable energy prices and cold weather   The heat wave that affected the Northeast and Midwest states in June  and the current heat wave affecting the nation  is adding to these households    energy burdens  especially low income seniors  as they must run air conditioning to remain cool and safe   For example  on Tuesday  July 19th  ISO New England recorded the highest electricity usage in New England history     We believe the cooling crisis facing low income Americans warrants the immediate release of emergency LIHEAP assistance   Thank you for your attention to this important request     Sincerely     Debbie Stabenow     Olympia J  Snowe Jack Reed     Arlen Specter Tom Harkin     Edward M  Kennedy
