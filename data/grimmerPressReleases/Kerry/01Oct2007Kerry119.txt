                                                                                                                                                                                       BOSTON  Today  in Bostons historic Faneuil Hall  Senator John Kerry laid out a 21st Century economic strategy for Americas middle class in a globalized world  including universal health care  tax reform  green jobs  home ownership  and a renewal of the international labor movement    Below are his remarks as prepared for delivery     Thank you for coming  Gathering here is special  Faneuil Hall is more than an historic building  This birthplace of American freedom has also been a keeper of the American conscience  Here  where we assemble today  abolitionists dreamed of and demanded a nation that would live out its founding ideal that all are created equal  From the fight for womens suffrage to the fight against Fascism  from McCarthyism to civil rights to Vietnam  these walls have rung with words of honor  dissent  courage  and principle     In the last decades  weve worked hard to live up to that heritage even if sometimes weve fallen short of itor of victory  I began my presidential campaign here  and three years ago next month  I ended it here  and yes  the loss still exacts its price     And Im not talking about me  Im talking about all the hard working families whose lives wouldve been better  all the young American soldiers whose lives were and are on the line  and all thosehere and across the worldwho yearn to see America move in a new direction     So on that hard November afternoon  I had no doubt of one thing  my resolve  as I said then  that what we started in this campaign will not end here  I pledged that  rather than walk away  in the years ahead in whatever was ahead for me  I would fight on for the people and for the principles that Ive learned and lived with here in Massachusetts  And thats exactly what together we are doing     That is why  with actions not words  on the floor of the Senate last week  we reminded Rush Limbaugh and all those who think patriotism belongs to one political party  that just saying you support the troops doesnt make it so  You dont support the troops if you force their families to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service  you dont support the troops if you deny veterans health care  no  you support the troops by doing what it took a Democratic Senate to do in the last months and just last week  pass my amendment to fund the vet centers that help returning soldiers heal PTSD and the hidden wounds of war  and make sure that for a generation of veterans returning home with eye injuries  their government will guarantee they get treated  Thats how you keep faith with those who wear the uniform of our country     Again and again since then  I have returned here to address the great issues facing our country     In this hall  weve talked about the need to end a war in Iraq that was rooted in deception and waged with self deception  I argued here and in the Senate and across the country that we will be stronger when we stop a policy that has not weakened terrorism but worsened it  and when we stop helping attract Al Qaeda where it wasnt  in Iraq  and instead fight Al Qaeda where it plotted and planned the attacks of 9 11  And here again we continue to fight to make America safer not by perpetuating a broken policy for the sake of politicians pride  but by pursuing diplomacy to end an Iraqi civil war and bring our heroes home from the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time    Last April  I returned here to defend the deeply American principle that dissent is not a dangerbut the very safeguard of democracy  That it is right to stand up to a President who ignores the Constitution and a Vice President who acts as if he had never read it  to insist that our leaders are strongest when they believe the future belongs not to fear but to freedom  We reaffirm today  America is strongest when we dont just tolerate free speechbut listen to it     I also joined you here to set out a strategy to make America energy independent  to propose specific steps for an energy revolution as far reaching as the industrial revolutiona revolution that can not only light our land  but protect our air  our water  and our environment  a new America that relies on its ingenuity and innovation  not the Saudi royal family     And I came here to discuss health care  the great unfinished business of half a century a fundamental moral commitment that at long last must be kept     These are the great challenges of our time  and they deserve a President committed to meet them head on     Today we return to Faneuil Hallthis time in keeping with this buildings first and founding contribution to the American nation  This is where Americas first middle class gatheredBoston merchants  mechanics  printers and craftsmenthey came here because they were fed up with a leader named King George  Fed up with rule from an ocean away  that seemed as remote then as Dick Cheneys undisclosed locations do today       They believed that rather than the rules working for them  improving their lives  they were working for the rulers and that a distant government was doing the bidding of the powerful fewnot the people who paid the taxes and played by the rules       Sound familiar  Well I think so  too  And just as it did then  its going to take more than a tea party to put this country and our economy back on course       Today were in the middle of another revolution  a whirlwind of technological innovation that constantly shrinks our world  widens our horizons  and flattens out global competition  Weve heard a thousand times how we live in a new economy but we remain prisoners of old economics  Regulators that dont regulate  Politicians who say education is the key  but make educators beg for the resources to open that door  A growth in GDP  but a larger growth in inequality  A middle class steadily falling behind  And trickle down tax cuts for the rich that left most Americans feeling trickled on       Ten years ago  we were ending a decade of sustained prosperity in which middle class Americans  and particularly minority Americans  made big gains in real income and wealth  Those were the Clinton years  Now we are in the middle of an era of not only stagnant real incomes for most Americans but a vast erosion of benefits and security  These are the Bush yearsgood for Halliburton and Blackwater  and bad for hardworking Americans       Ten years ago  we were talking about retiring the national debt  Now we are talking about public and private debts of an unprecedented magnitude  financed by foreign governments which can hold our economy hostageor buy it up piece by piece  That is the Bush legacy to Americas economy       Ten years ago when the tech bubble burst  the losses were mainly on paper  Now our losses are in homes  health care  pensions  and jobs  A decade ago  investors lost the illusion of pain free  perpetual super profits  Today we are ridding ourselves of the Cheney illusion that deficits dont matter  and the Bush illusion that you can borrow  deregulate  devalue and subsidize your way to growth by letting moneyed interests feed at the trough of government favors and borrowed money  That is Bushonomics  those at the top get the benefit  You and future generations get stuck with the bill       But there is more here than just a partisan divide  For too long  Washington has been caught in old debates  Democrats forced to defend the gains of the twentieth century against Republicans determined to take us back to the nineteenth century  And while politicians debate whether to move left or right  too little is being done to move the middle class forward       Were now as many years away from the New Deal as the New Deal was from the Civil War  But weve been responding to transformations in our economy with tinkering around the edges of past policies  It is now time for progressives to match Franklin Roosevelts vision  not just mimic his rhetoric       We need fundamental change not bite sized ideas that are poll tested  sound bite ready and destined to be mere footnotes to the times we live in  Its time we end the era of incrementalism and begin a bold new age in progressive politics       We cant have the economy Americans deserve unless we finally have what we shouldve had for decades and generations  universal health care for all  And we need that not just for the health and moral benefit to our citizens  but because that is the only way to streamline and liberate our economy       This cant be just a plan in a campaign  another political box to be checked off  It has to be a top priority for the next President and the next Congress and it must become a reality for every American family       Todays broken system is an economic disaster  It forces businesses into untenable choices  the GM model of crushing health care costs and the Wal Mart model of minimal or no health coverage at all  The public message to business right now is cut coverage at home  or go to China where you dont have to give your workers health care at all       Our current system is offering more and more middle class Americans the equally lousy choice of clawing to hold onto inadequate insurance at skyrocketing prices  or simply praying for good health  Real leadership should be making the system efficient and effective  and making American businesses competitive at the same time       Truly universal health care is the way  and the only way  forward for businesses and families alike  Im proud that every Democratic candidate for President is  without exception  committed to that goal  as I was in 2004  And I cant help noting that Mitt Romney  the only Republican whos even lifted a finger in that directionwhere the wind was already blowing strong  right here in Massachusettsis running away from his own record so fast that it seems he was for his health care plan before he was against it  In fact  he seems to have turned away from his own record so fast hes going to need a good health care plan to treat him for whiplash         The progressive economic agenda of our time must also demand and deliver energy independence  and an answer to climate change as seriousas realas the problem itself  After years of evasion and denial  George Bush and his administration now pay lip service to the issue  but the rules are still being written in the Vice Presidents office  by the special interests  for the special interests  to serve the special interests  Its time to worry about the next generations world  not the next quarters bloated profits for big oil       Every economist tells us that clean energy will be one of the most dominant drivers of economic growth in this century  But Washington still hasnt figured out how to make that an American century  After years of denial and delay from this Administration  these green jobs are being created in places like Germany and Japan  The choice is simple  we can lead or be left behind  The apologists of the status quo say we cannot afford to act on carbon emissions  The inescapable truth is that we cannot afford not to act  We cannot accept an America mired in fossil fuel dependency while other nations are beginning to leave us in our own polluted dust as they develop clean energy       We passed a bill in the Senate this year to invest billions of dollars in clean energy  Last year the oil companies collectively made  253 billion  the most profitable companies in America  and we paid for the clean energy bill by repealing over  23 billion in tax giveaways to those most profitable companies  But you know what  Even with these record profits from Exxon Mobile and others Republicans are still blocking the bill from passing  Thats another reason to block them from being re elected       Over the last six and a half years  weve witnessed in Washington a remarkable backwards leaning experiment in which our environmental  tax  budget  trade  regulatory  labor  and social policies have been almost entirely subject to the most short sighted interests of the most privileged Americans  and the most influential corporations       They smear their critics by waving the flag of class warfare  while themselves all the time waging an assault on the middle class and the workers struggling to join it  What America needs is neither class warfare nor business bashing but a battle for common sense  and an end to the reverse class warfare of the current administration  Thomas Jeffersons credo should again become the foundation of our strategy for prosperity  equal opportunity for all  special privileges for none       And nowhere has that credo been more absent  or has the assault on the middle class found more favor  than in our tax code itself  Taxes have never been absent from the debate between citizens and their government  When King George chose to raise taxes on paint  paper  and tea in the American colonies rather than tax those in Britain  he unwittingly lit the fires of revolution that burst into flames just blocks away from this hall in the Boston Massacre  Just over one hundred years later  no less a Republican than Teddy Roosevelt said that the first requisite of a good citizen in this republic of ours is that he shall be able and willing to pull his weight  America has always stood for shared sacrifice  and fundamental fairness     No wonder Americans are fed up with a system where the idea of shared sacrifice has been turned on its head  After four years of war  the income gap between CEOs and Army privates is 308 to 1  The army private makes about  25 000 a year and puts life and limb on the line  The average defense CEO makes  7 7 million     This didnt happen by accident  It is long past time to roll back this Presidents unfair  unaffordable tax cuts for those who make more than  200 000 a year  In 2008 alone  these tax cuts give  49 billion to people making a million dollars a year or more  Thats 20  of the whole tax cut to the one third of one percent of the population that doesnt need it at all  Those of us lucky enough to be in a high income bracket ought to be content  and lucky as we are  Teresa and I dont need  and didnt ask for  a tax cut then more than 46 million Americans need health care coverage     So now it falls on us to do more than correct the mistakes of the last seven years  We need to readjust the entire tax code to reflect who we are and what we value  opportunity for the middle class  honoring work not just wealth  and closing the loopholes that reward CEOs for sending American jobs overseas     We need to make it equitable and we need to make it radically simpler  In 1940  instructions to the Form 1040 were about 4 pages long  Today the instruction booklet fills more than 100 pages  accompanied by more than 10 schedules and 20 worksheets  It takes the average person 28 hours to file a tax return  You shouldnt have to hire a CPA just to get your tax refund back from Uncle Sam     We also have to reform the Alternative Minimum Tax which has metastasized into the family tax  Back in January 1969  Americans were outraged to learn that 155 of the wealthiest citizens somehow paid no federal income tax at all  Congress received more letters of protest about that than about the Vietnam War  and Washington responded with the AMT  In 1970  20 000 Americans paid the AMT  In 2007  23 million will  Who are they  Teachers  police officers  nurses and hard working families  Now some people want to patch the AMT and punt this problem down the road  But we shouldnt just band aid an unfair taxwe should bury it altogether       Its also time we end the separate and unequal system that taxes money earned by wealth so much more favorably than it does money earned by work  Anyone who tells you that wealth is the source of work probably thinks the New York Yankees need a bigger payroll  We need to encourage entrepreneurship  not just comfort the comfortable  The tax code should help more families save for college and retirement  not help millionaires hide their money offshore       As we fix the code  we also need to finally put an end to a corporate tax system that rewards sending American jobs overseas  Its just plain wrong to tell American workers to dig their own occupational graves by subsidizing the export of their own jobs       We must also restore accountability and bring todays underground economy into the sunshine  Too many sectors of our economy are moving off the books and working for cash under the table  and everybody loses when that happens       Putting an end to the underground economy will actually save jobs and bring in tax revenue at the same time  You know all of us take pride when corporations produce great products and great jobs  but we should take equal pride when corporate America pays its fair share of the costs of making America strong       Its hard to remember that there was a time not too long ago when this President talked about creating an ownership society  But as the mortgage foreclosures start to pile up  were learning who gets to do the owning  big banks     Buying your own home has always been the foundation of the American dream  but when more than 2 million Americansincluding thousands in Massachusettsrisk losing their homes  for too many the dream of home ownership is becoming a nightmare       Why is that happening  Because we have a sub prime mortgage market thats been abused by lenders deceptive practices and abandoned by the federal bank regulators who looked the other way  in the Bush economy  anything goes but for families in danger of losing their homes  the question why is less important than  What now       Today families fighting to hold onto their homes also find themselves fighting the federal government  When a bank does the right thing to try to lighten a familys mortgage burden  the federal government turns around and taxes this assistance as if it were real income  This is just plain wrong  The government should be helping families pick themselves up  not kicking them when theyre already down  Thats why Im fighting in the Senate to change the law so families dont have to fight the IRS while theyre fighting to keep their homes       We also see that too many families cant get a mortgage at a fair price on the open market  To help them here in Massachusetts and across America to find a way out of the abusive loans that now hold them hostage  we should immediately increase federal loan limits and lower down payment requirements       And third  we should make sure regulators do their job  stopping abusive mortgage practices and guaranteeing that anyone buying a home gets good information and responsible advice  Instead families have been lied to  they have been misled  and its long overdue for Congress to lead by making sure that lenders actually tell Americans the truth       In the end  as we know all too well  owning a home is just one part of an ownership society  Most importantly  the promise means having a sense of ownership over your whole life  being able to save for college  save for retirement  put money away to care for an aging parent  earn a decent living  No amount of White House spin can build an ownership society out of Republican policies that make those things impossible and are really telling most Americans youre on your own       For the first time since the Great Depression  our personal savings rate is less than zero  Since the year 2000  household debt has increased by more than  26 000       And our nations debtpublic and private  is out of control  One answer is creating automatic individual retirement accountsand helping Americans invest in them  Every worker should be able to send part of their salary directly from their paycheck into retirement accountswithout even writing a check each month       And if we want more Americans to take the risks that spark our economy  we cant hold them back at the starting gate with students leaving college burdened with mountains of debt  Two thirds of college students graduate with  23 000 in student loans       After World War II  we invested in those who kept us safe from fascism  and I believe we ought to be making the same kind of deal by sending young people today to work to save post Katrina New Orleans from extinction and to become Big Brothers  Big Sisters and mentors in communities of need  Its high time we made a new deal with Americas young people  with a new Service for College program  If you serve your country for two years  we will cover the cost of a four year public university       Finally  you cant build a modern economy without universal broadband access  Just as FDR fought to bring electricity to rural America  just as Eisenhower had a vision for our highways  we need to bring the Information superhighway  high speed internet  to every home  Three years ago  President Bush talked about delivering universal broadband access by 2007  but here we are  2007 almost over  and less than half the homes in Massachusetts  which is a leader in the nation  have broadbandeven fewer in Western Massachusetts  Instead of marching forward  as a nation  were falling behind  Weve slipped from fourth worldwide to 21st  behind Estonia and tied with Slovenia  Well  I dont think the United States should be second to anyone on the planet  Bottom line  our economy can only go as far as our high tech infrastructure will take us and we have to insist that we take it all the way  right away  to our economic future  because if we build it  the jobs will come       These are the choices we must make to create an economy that works for all Americans again  But more than these choices we must restore a fundamental social contract       Everyday millions of Americans get up and go to work to a job that brings with it a pension  health care  high wages  and safety standards  But fewer and fewer of these workers have joined a union  Let me tell you something  they all owe those benefits to the labor movement in our country       What was true in Roosevelts day is just as true today  we must promote the right of employees to collectively bargain for better wages and benefitsat home and abroad       Theres nothing anti business about being pro union  And theres nothing that contributes more to a socially responsible corporate community than workers who know they have a place at the table in key corporate decisions       Under the Bush administration  the federal government has pursued the most strident anti union policies in memory  I doubt theyve appointed one judge who has voted for workers one time in their lifetime  Then how can they talk about spreading democracy to other countries and then tell workers that they dont have the right to sign a card and elect a union to bargain for a better wage here in America  Congress needs to finally enact basic labor law reforms like the Employee Free Choice Act  which preserves the right of workers to organize without intimidation  And just as important  we have to promote workers rights abroadbecause its right  and because its the only way to create a level playing field for U S  exports  American labor leaders understand this  Andy Stern  head of SEIU  has been to China six times in five years  As President  George Bush has only been there onceand Im sure he didnt once mention workers rights       James Hoffa  of the Teamsters union  sees China as a new frontline for the labor movement  He understands that  at its worst  the global economy is a race to the bottom that pulls the rug out from under American workers       So we have to make it a race for the topbecause globalization isnt going to go away  We need to put our stamp on it and create a fair playing field     because empowering Americas workers means stepping up to bat for workers everywhere       When Democrats took over Congress we said to this President     no more trade deals unless you fight for workers rights  We held his feet to the fire in a trade deal with Peru that does protect workers  But its not enough to have labor rights written on a piece of paper signed in the Rose Garden  We need countries to start enforcing themand we need a President who actually wants them enforced       44 years ago  a very different kind of president  John F  Kennedy  went to Pueblo Colorado and assured America that a rising tide would lift all boats  Back then Pueblo had a steel mine with over 14 000 union workers  Now there are only a thousand  It used to be an industry town  Now it has an industrial museum       Pueblo isnt alone  Look in the Merrimack Valley  which was once the home of our textile industry with 40 000 mill workers in Lawrence aloneimmigrants who walked a picket line during the winter of 1912 for a fair days pay  Union members rallied right here in Faneuil Hall to support them  Today we have a State Heritage Park in Lawrence but not enough living wage jobs for the new immigrants who live there       No  we dont live with the same economy that President Kennedy talked about  as he once said  the world is very different now  But the ideal he spoke of must endure  The economy will never be the same as it once was  but America always needs to stay true to America       Today our economy is living on borrowed money  and on borrowed time  and both will run out soon if we dont get serious about changing course in Washington     We must end the assault on Americas middle class and we must begin to make our economy fair again  The great American middle class doesnt ask for much  but it counts on  leadership that honors work as much as wealth  and leaders who will make economic growth not a spectator sport  but a common endeavor       Our mission is as clear and the cause is just  Health care for all  Energy independence  A tax code that works for working people  Stop making a mockery of the phrase ownership society  A fair shake for the workers who ultimately create our wealth  And a society where wealth comes with responsibility  and not just a ticket to power and privilege       All these goals are within our grasp if we really want them  Those proud Massachusetts patriots of 1776 didnt plead for permission to govern themselves  and they didnt wait to be told what to do by those who misgoverned them  They acted  and now so must we  Thank you                                                                          20510
