Kerry announced today  that he has written to five federal agencies  urging them to comply with pending  Freedom of Information Act Requests  FOIA   Some of the agencies have received  repeated FOIA requests and have resisted compliance  some for months  or even  years    Kerry is a co sponsor of the Openness Promotes  Effectiveness in our National Government Act  or the OPEN Government Act written  by Senators John Cornyn  R  Tx   and Patrick Leahy  D Vt    This legislation is  aimed at improving compliance with FOIA and helping the public remedy any  unfounded FOIA rejections  Kerry is working with his Senate colleagues to lift  the hold placed by a Republican senator on the crucial reform  legislation   Transparency at all levels of government is crucial to  protecting those who expose government corruption and ask the tough questions to  get at the truth  said Senator Kerry  This Administration has  reached Nixon level depths of secrecy  paranoia and skirting accountability and  the systematic delay in processing simple FOIA requests is symptomatic of that  mentality  The FOIA is a tool that supports truth tellers  from scientists who  report the effects of global warming  to those who questioned shoddy work at the  Big Dig  to journalists who protect the publics right to know everyday  I hope  these agencies respond to the public and I hope the Senate has an opportunity to  vote soon on serious FOIA reform legislation   Senator Kerry wrote separately to five agencies with the  largest number of unfulfilled FOIA requests  They include the State Department   the Air Force  the Central Intelligence Agency  the Criminal Division at  Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  A recent study by  George Washington University lists these organizations as  the least compliant when it comes to FOIA requests  with some dating back 15  years or more   The OPEN Government Act would reduce the backlog of FOIA  requests by mandating that missing the 20 day statutory deadline would result in  real consequences for an agency that does not adhere to the law  A Freedom of  Information hotline to track requests would also be created     Perhaps most important  the bill urges agencies to  release information in a timely manner  If an agency disputes a request and is  sued  the agency can not claim compliance by offering the relevant information  the day before the case goes to trial  without taking financial responsibility  for legal costs  The bills also define media to include bloggers  so that they  will be eligible for the same waiver of fees   Below is the text of Kerrys letter  to the State Department   July 26   2007   Dear Mr  Inspector General      I write today with concern over pending  Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  requests to the Department of State  I am  troubled that requests made by private citizens and reporters are not being  processed expeditiously  This important law that has been in effect for 40  years improves transparency and ensures the publics trust in our government   Every agency should take the utmost care to respond to these requests in a  timely manner and those that do not do so are breaking federal law      In the Senate I am a co sponsor of the  Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act or the OPEN  Government Act  As you know this legislation is aimed at improving compliance  with FOIA and helping the public redress any unfounded FOIA rejections  This  important legislation has been stalled in the Senate and while I will continue  to work for its passage this issue is too critical to leave unattended     My purpose for writing you today is to  inquire what the Department of State is doing to respond to FOIA requests  quickly and effectively  I would also like to know how many pending FOIA  requests the Department of State has  and the reason for any delays  A recent  study done by George Washington University lists the Department of State  as one of the least compliant agencies when it comes to FOIA requests  with some  dating back 15 years or more  This is unacceptable  I respectfully ask that  you investigate the Departments compliance with FOIA and respond with any and  all findings    I thank you for your consideration and look  forward to your reply   Sincerely     John F   Kerry
