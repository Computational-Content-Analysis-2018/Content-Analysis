for Energy Independence and Global Climate Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Today  in a speech at Faneuil Hall in Boston  Massachusetts  John Kerry introduced a bold new plan to achieve energy independence and combat global climate change  Kerry   s plan challenges America to accept three big ideas to win energy independence and meet the ten year challenge of combating global climate change      Below are Kerry   s remarks as prepared for delivery   Senator John Kerry  Our Energy Challenge  June 26  2006  Faneuil Hall  Boston  Massachusetts   Here in Faneuil Hall  America   s first great gathering ground of free speech and dissent  we came together two months ago and nearly two and a half centuries after the voices of patriots were first heard within these walls       We came together to affirm that the patriotism of 2006  no less than the patriotism of 1776  demands that we speak truth to power     that for love of country  we must end a war in Iraq that kills too many of our sons and daughters  betraying both our national interests and our ideals        Last week  in the Senate  we stood against appeals to politics and pride and demanded a date to bring our troops home  We did that because that   s the way you get Iraqis to stand up for Iraq and fight a more effective war on terror        We defied the White House tactics of fear and smear  Presidents and Republican politicians may be concerned about losing votes or losing face or losing legacies  We told the truth because we are more concerned about young Americans and Iraqi civilians losing their lives  And I guarantee you  our success would bring less loss of life  less expenditure of   dollars  and it would make America safer         I say    we    because even though our resolution only won 13 votes this time  I know every minute of the debate you were there with us    there with Russ Feingold  there with Ted Kennedy and there with us as we voted our beliefs and yours     that a policy based on deception and filled with blunders is no excuse for its own perpetuation       But while we lost that roll call  I guarantee we will win the judgment of history because Washington is wrong and Americans are right  and we must set a new course in Iraq       Yet our challenge is not just to end this war  it is to prevent the next one  The arrogance of ideology and the willful ignorance of the intelligence led us into a war of choice in Iraq   Now we must act so that at some future date America will never have to fight for its economic security because we are permanently held hostage to foreign oil       We must make the hard choices     about alternative energy and clean coal  conservation and fuel efficiency      that will free our future from the dominance of big oil and yesterday   s fossil fuels  a dominance that in the era of global warming threatens the future itself        So I come here again to Faneuil Hall  which is also the cradle of American independence  to set out a strategy for energy independence  To propose specific steps for an energy revolution as far reaching as the industrial revolution   And to oppose the procrastination  the Washington evasion and the Cheney run secret task forces by and for big oil       How insulting and ridiculous it is to be told that the solution to our problems is to drill in and destroy the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that would yield a few months of oil when we are already importing 60 percent of our oil and climbing  God only gave us 3  of the world s oil reserves  There is simply no way to drill our way out of our problem  We have to invent our way out       To do that  we also have to invent our way out of the politics of greed and empty posturing that has worsened our dependence and denied the undeniable and potentially disastrous effects of global warming        Not long ago  in the face of record gas prices  a volatile Middle East  and hostile rhetoric from a fundamentalist regime in Iran  a President of the United States asked    Why have we not been able to get together as a nation to resolve our serious energy problem          His name was Jimmy Carter     and that steamy summer of 1979 seems as familiar today as the question he raised then  Almost twenty seven years later we face another summer of record gas prices  raging violence across a volatile Middle East  renewed rhetoric of hate from a fundamentalist regime in Tehran  Our national neglect has made the quarter of a century since then what Winston Churchill called    years the locust has eaten      Today we endure another summer of record gas prices  we witness the violence raging across a volatile Middle East  and we hear the rhetoric of hate from a hostile government in Tehran       George W  Bush now says that    America is addicted to oil      His preferred policy has been to feed the addiction  his attitude on greenhouse gases is to let them increase  his energy alternatives are token  again and again his approach to crisis is to denigrate the environment   Mr  President  the people know the truth  America is not addicted to oil because it wants to be   Washington is addicted to oil because that   s the way powerful interests want it to be        And it has been this way ever since President Nixon announced a national goal that by 1980     the United States will not be dependent on any other country for the energy we need      President Ford extended the deadline  energy independence by 1985   Come 1985 President Reagan was promising to    ensure that our people and our economy are never again held hostage by the whim of any country or cartel        The bottom line     whenever we face an energy crisis  talk of energy independence becomes the common currency of the American political dialogue  We have Apollo projects and Manhattan Projects for alternative fuels  summits and conferences and energy expos  And then  as the price of oil falls or supplies increase or a war is put behind us  the sense of urgency evaporates        Too often our leaders in both parties have done what   s easy  turned their backs on hard realities and great possibilities  Renewables  efficiency breakthroughs  clean technologies have been marginalized in the face of self interested forces        In these lost years  we could have created millions of new jobs  opened up vast new markets  improved the health of our citizens  slowed global warming  saved the taxpayers money  earned the respect of the world  and significantly strengthened our long term security  Instead America   s energy strategy has been rhetorical  not real        For evidence  look no further than the fake energy bill Congress enacted over bipartisan objections     a monstrosity with no guiding national goal  no tough decisions  no change in priorities     just a logrolling  back scratching collection of subsidies for any industry with the clout to get a seat at the table and a share of the pork   A few good ideas  a lot of bad ideas and ugly ideas   Washington smiled equally upon all of them        I don   t know how to say it more plainly  Washington   s energy policy is as real as their claims of Mission Accomplished in Iraq   But it is also the latest chapter in the long story in both parties politics at its worst     ducking the difficult choices  giving into the big contributors  substituting words for deeds  postponing the reckoning until the day after tomorrow   If you offend no one  you change nothing   The world is changing and now the reckoning is real         Last Thursday  Brian Williams opened the nightly news with a stark statement     Top climate scientists are saying with a high level of confidence that the earth is the hottest it has been in 400 years       NBC   s science correspondent reported that global warming may lead to    rising sea levels  heavy rains in some areas  drought in others  and an increase in severe weather  including hurricanes      Was there room to argue  Well  as the NBC story concluded    you can  always  make a debate if you can find one scientist who says the earth is flat and have him debate it against everybody else          Well  Washington is full of    flat earth    politicians   No matter how the evidence has mounted over two decades    the melting of the arctic ice cap  rising sea levels  extreme weather     the flat earth caucus can   t even see what is on the horizon  In the Congress they   ve even trotted out the author of Jurassic Park as an expert witness to argue that climate change is fiction   This is Stone Age science        Here   s the bottom line  within the next decade  if we don   t deal with global warming  our children and grandchildren will have to deal with global catastrophe   It is time to stop debating fiction writers  oil executives and flat earth politicians  and actually take on the other mortal threat to America after terrorism  which  because of our oil dependence  is a decisive front in the war on terrorism         We can   t respond to climate change  and we can   t wage and win a real war on terror if we don   t at last take bold  real steps towards energy independence   For too long  we have allowed fundamental problems in the Middle East to fester by signaling corrupt Arab regimes that we don t care what they do so long as they keep the oil flowing         So  energy independence is more than an important economic priority  it is an indispensable element of our national security   Our reliance on oil not only props up decaying and dictatorial regimes  but those that tolerate and sustain terrorist groups   Any long term strategy for winning the war on terror must be matched with a determined effort to reduce our dependence on petroleum   It demands an international response  linked to the rapid emergence of new energy technologies  in order to ensure that emerging economies don t become the new enablers of Middle East autocrats   Make no mistake  our long term mission in the war on terror depends on long term energy independence  We must end the empire of oil        For some  it may be hard to conceive of a world where fossil fuels  and especially petroleum  are not the dominant sources of fuel        In fact  we   ve been here before  One hundred and fifty years ago in Massachusetts  in New Bedford and Nantucket  no one could conceive of a future that didn   t depend on whale oil  But until recently  America   s history has been to drive technology  transform marketplaces  and invent a future never imagined before   In America  making the impossible possible has been a credo and a way of life  In the 1930s only 10 percent of rural America had electricity  Utilities refused to wire rural counties because homes were too far apart  To bring electricity to all Americans  Congress provided more than  5 billion to finance rural electrification  By the 1950s  there was hardly a corner of America that was still dark   Across our history we   ve successfully moved from wood to coal  coal to oil  oil to a mix of oil  gas  coal  nuclear and hydroelectric   Now it   s time to move to solar  wind  biomass  fuel cells  clean coal  and other wonders of American ingenuity  and I believe Washington must lead the marketplace in the right direction        Today there is as compelling a national interest to address the security and environmental threats of fossil fuels as there is to defeat radical  extreme Islamists and global terror  Our soldiers shouldn   t be the only ones to sacrifice in this war  We must all be soldiers  and we must all welcome some sacrifice in that service        As individuals  the change can be as simple as replacing traditional light bulbs with efficient fluorescents   In our communities we should require that new buildings include lights that turn off when people leave the room  We should follow the lead of Tokyo and their energy efficient escalators that shut off when they aren   t being used   There are literally thousands of things to be done  too few of which we are being asked to do       Each of us can do something  And together all of us can insist on leaders who secure our energy independence  not ones who barter it away   We wouldn   t elect a candidate who said terrorism wasn   t a threat  We wouldn   t tolerate a candidate for national office who didn   t say he was committed to capturing or killing Osama Bin Laden  But for too long we   ve tolerated those who treat the threat of energy insecurity and the truth of global climate change as an inconvenient myth  Well  from now on  every American who walks into a polling place can and should vote to kick out anyone who stands in the way of energy independence        But it is also time to put Washington to the test  Time to tell powerful interests that the old era has ended and so have their easy arrangements   Then instead of empty slogans and long laundry lists of bite sized ideas that tinker at the edges of outdated policy  we can embark on revolutions that will put our energy future in our own hands and put global climate change at the top of the national agenda where it belongs         Today I want to focus on the three big steps that are imperative to addressing global warming and transitioning to dependence on homegrown sources of energy   First  I believe we need to establish an oil goal and implement an aggressive set of policies to reach it   Second  I believe we must immediately expand the availability  production  and distribution of renewable fuels to run our cars   And third  we need to get serious about climate change and take measures to freeze and reverse our greenhouse gas emissions       To start  We must establish mandates for reducing U S  oil consumption by 2 5 million barrels of oil per day by 2015     an amount equivalent to the oil we currently import from the Persian Gulf        Yes  I said mandate    and I said it because we have lost too much time for voluntary measures to be put to the test   And we can   t just set a mandate     we have to provide incentives to businesses and industry to make the mandate achievable            We must significantly ramp up our production of Flex Fuel Vehicles   They run on alternative fuels  like E85  a blend of 85 percent ethyl alcohol    a home grown  domestic  completely renewable source of fuel that burns cleaner than gasoline         Other countries already know something we don   t   Actually they   ve been doing something we won   t     something influential interests don   t want us to do   Thirty years ago when Brazil faced an energy crisis they got serious about alternative fuels  Relying on new stocks of homegrown fuels in addition to its own oil production  this year Brazil will achieve energy independence  If Brazil can do it  why can   t we   If a developing country can go from 90 percent dependence on foreign oil to zero percent dependence in three decades  then we    the most powerful  creative  industrial country on Earth     we can change the destructive course we   re on       Today  in this country  only six million vehicles     just 10 percent of all those on the road     can be fueled by E85  and less than one percent of the service stations have even a single E85 pump  To change that we must require     not just recommend     that an increasing percentage of new cars can run on E85 and that by 2020 all new cars will have the capacity to run on E85   20 20  that   s not just a vision  that   s a real program to jumpstart energy independence        But building these cars doesn   t get you very far if there is nowhere for Americans to them fill up   What a Washington solution it would be if we built flex fuel cars but you couldn   t buy the fuel    talk about a bridge to nowhere  We need to immediately expand our investment in E85 infrastructure  Mandate that 10 percent of all major oil company filling stations offer at least one ethanol pump by 2010   And to deploy this technology quickly  provide financial incentives to both independent and retail chains to install the new pumps  Just think    we can put ethanol pumps in every single gas station in America for what we spend in Iraq in just one week  I don   t think there   s a Member of Congress who will want to tell their constituents they didn   t think breaking our dependence on oil was worth as much as one week in Iraq   When the energy spending bill comes before the Senate  I will offer an amendment to get over 1800 E85 pumps across the country in the next year alone  and with your help we   ll make the Congress vote yes or no     choose the status quo or choose America   s energy future        To ensure we have enough ethanol to meet our demands  we must also invest in the kind of ethanol produced from plant wastes and energy crops like switchgrass  And we must set a goal of having 30 percent of our fuels come from biofuels by 2020  Believe me  if we   re spending 2 billion in Iraq in one week  we can commit  2 billion in funding for cellulosic biofuels over the next ten years       Energy efficiency can be a powerful weapon in the arsenal of our democracy and is as indispensable as armor and munitions   We have to combat the threat to soldiers that comes not just from gun barrels but from oil barrels   We should all be incensed that we are in effect financing both sides in the war on terror every time we fill up our tanks  We can   t keep asking American troops to risk the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq if those of us on the homefront aren   t ready to make even the smallest sacrifice to help them         I remember sitting with a top CEO from the auto industry in the spring of 2003  He   d come to see me to talk about automobile efficiency standards   I asked him why the American auto industry seemed unwilling to build more fuel efficient cars  He told me that the American consumer wouldn   t buy a more fuel efficient car   He asked me     Why in the world would we change everything to build more fuel efficient vehicles when no one wants them      Three years later as the demand for hybrids and high mileage vehicles soars  the Japanese are there in the market and our own companies are struggling to catch up and even survive       With leadership in Washington through a combination of incentives  grants and standards  we can and must at last revolutionize the way we drive       We must no longer be afraid of the third rail of energy policy     fuel economy standards  Fuel efficiency standards have been essentially unchanged since 1980   Think about that   Jimmy Carter was President  my daughters were playing Atari and wearing leg warmers  apartheid was a way of life in South Africa  and America was tuning in to find out who shot J R   Since then  because Washington stood still  captive to powerful interests  the average efficiency of vehicles has actually declined   The United States can   t have a serious policy for oil security until we leave the 1980   s behind     entering the 21st century by demanding a major increase in the fuel economy of our cars    Massachusetts and California have led the way cutting CO2 emissions from cars  leading the way for more efficient cars in these states   But state action alone cannot meet this national challenge  Washington must do its job  too  We need to establish a federal standard for controlling carbon dioxide emissions from cars and trucks  If the entire country did what Massachusetts and California are already doing  we could raise fuel efficiency by 40 percent   Building the cars of the future     fuel efficient  advanced technology vehicles     will require automakers and their suppliers to retool their factories   I believe the federal government has a responsibility to help them remain competitive  Tax credits will help support the necessary investments  make the new technologies cost effective  and create jobs for the workers who will build the cars of the future and help consumers buy them   We should commit  3 billion to this effort in tax credits over the next five years     tax credits that will not only help reduce oil dependence but which will pay for themselves through tax revenue generated by the growth and productivity that follow        But like all the funding in my proposal  let   s not leave it subject to the whims of Congress and an army of appropriators  We need to create a new security and conservation trust fund to guarantee the resources to move the nation towards energy independence  This isn   t a matter of capacity  it   s a matter of willpower  We have the money  the question is whether we have the right priorities  Just by rolling back the tax breaks for big oil which even President Bush opposes  and by renegotiating oil leases  we can invest in a fund for energy security       Instead of a tax code that works for the K Street lobbyists  let   s provide an aggressive set of tax incentives and grants to ensure that by 2020  20 percent of all passenger cars and trucks on the road will be fuel efficient  low emissions hybrid vehicles   Sure  hybrid vehicles are more expensive today  But they don   t have to be if we put a little presidential muscle behind them  The doors of college were only open to the rich and powerful until President Lincoln pioneered a system of Land Grant Colleges that gave us UMass and URI and the University of Connecticut  After World War II  highways and roads were underfunded by local governments and some were unusable until President Eisenhower pushed through a national highway system  You want hybrid vehicles out on those highways   Make it affordable for Americans to buy American hybrids     because that   s a hell of a lot better than subsidizing Saudi sheiks who look the other way while madrassas teach kids hatred and violence    Here   s another bottom line  Good energy policy is also fundamental to coping with global climate change        In 1992  I was part of the Senate delegation to the Rio Earth Summit  I was continuing an interest sparked when I lead efforts in the eighties to deal with acid rain    efforts that culminated in our creating a Cap and Trade system for emissions and making it part of the Clean Air Act in 1990   I believe that George Herbert Walker Bush     Bush  41     can be proud that he was a President Bush who signed into law bills to help us reduce pollution       The story since then is not just a disappointment    it is a flagrant  dangerous  arrogant disavowal of science at the behest of the powerful   It is a damning story of public irresponsibility and private profiteering   Those who have encouraged  facilitated and acquiesced in it will go down in history as modern day robber barons who sold out future generations for their own selfish gain  We need to use this November to throw the robber barons and their cronies out of the Congress and put the peoples    interests back in       Each year since 1992  the science has become more certain  What was theory in some areas is now proven fact  Scientific models have become more sophisticated and more accurate   Across the world scientists and national leaders     except ours    have spoken out and acted decisively   Only the United States stands out as a flat earth holdout for inaction   When confronted by scientific facts  leaders must not change the facts to suit their politics  whether the issue is global warming  stem cell research  or Iraq  leaders must tell people the truth         In the last month Al Gore   s  Inconvenient Truth  has brought the science to millions of Americans in a dramatic and persuasive way   Al was an early leader and a visionary on climate change     and if he had not just been elected but been inaugurated as President  America today would be the world   s leading advocate  not the world   s leading opponent of climate change        The question now     even more than it has been for the last years     is not whether climate change is happening but what are we going to do about it    No  I don t mean how does the political system moan and groan and adopt makeshift responses   I mean what are we really going to do  How do we turn this danger into opportunity   How do we meet a challenge of epic proportions with an epic American response      Well we have to start by ending the bizarre disconnect of American politics   Real crises stare us in the face  screaming for solution  But non existent  contrived ones replace the real ones on the agenda of a Congress that wants to change the political climate instead of dealing with climate change  They remain bent on dividing the country with flag burning and gay bashing amendments to the Constitution when we should be strengthening the country with a determined attack on global climate change        Compare that kind of craven politics  to last week   s announcement by the nation   s leading climate scientists    a shocking new report that revealed that the earth s temperature is at a 2 000 year high   The scientists said     let me just read it to you     that the    recent warmth is unprecedented for at least the last 400 years and potentially the last several millennia    and they also stated that  human activities are responsible for much of the recent warming           Unless we deal with global warming boldly and quickly our world will undergo a string of terrible events in both the Atlantic and the Pacific far worse than Hurricane Katrina       Never before have so many people lived so close to the coasts  More than a hundred million people worldwide live within three feet of sea level   Some of the world   s greatest cities like     New York  Shanghai  Bangkok  and Tokyo     are at risk        So we need a plan that actually does what the science tells us we have to do to   That   s why I will be introducing in the Senate the most far reaching proposal in our history   Nothing else will protect our security and our world  And I believe that anyone who knows the urgency of this global challenge  would be fighting to make this our national policy  And that is what I   m going to do       It will stop and reverse U S  emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases   I propose establishing an aggressive economy wide cap and trade program to reverse emissions growth starting in 2010   After that  we will progress to more rapid reductions and end at 65 percent below 2000 emissions by the year 2050       At the same time  we cannot be reckless about the economic impacts   We must ensure American businesses remain competitive with the rest of the world  To achieve that goal  my plan will provide the tools to help the economy transition to new clean energy technologies  protect workers and affected communities  and protect companies and consumers from energy cost shocks   We will provide tax incentives for good behavior and increased funding for research  development and deployment of clean energy technologies   And I believe we should double the federal government funding for research and development to support private sector energy research  demonstration  and deployment       The U S  is the world   s single largest emitter of greenhouse gases  but the U S  alone cannot solve the challenge of climate change   It is going to take action from other countries     both developed and developing  We must re engage in discussions with the international community and work together to plan a path forward  It   s a global problem and it   s going to require a global solution       We have big challenges to solve     and a whole host of people in Washington who don   t know how to tackle them  and a whole cast of political consultants who will counsel their candidates not even to try    That   s where you come in  You need to push the curve  You need to shake things up    A Saudi Arabian oil minister and a founder of OPEC once said   That the Stone Age came to an end not for a lack of stones  and the oil age will end  but not for a lack of oil    We are not about to run out of oil  but the consequences of endless dependence on oil are too great  too profound  and too dangerous for our nation  Rather than have our energy policy be the last big mistake of the 20th century  we can and must create a policy that is the first great breakthrough of the 21st century   So for the second time in our history let   s declare and win our independence   This time not from foreign rule but from foreign oil   If we are as Lincoln said the    last best hope of Earth     let   s stop being the denier of global warming that endangers the Earth  Let   s give our people back the truth  and let   s give the world back its future                                                                           20510
