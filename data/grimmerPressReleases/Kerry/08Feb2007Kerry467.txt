John Kerry will deliver the Democratic response to President s Bush s radio address this Saturday  responding to the refusal of Republicans to permit a full debate on the Iraq escalation plan        Below is a  Dear Colleague  letter Sen  Kerry sent to his fellow Senators this week  urging them to set a deadline for redeployment to force Iraqis to stand up for Iraq       February 6  2007      Dear Colleague        As the 110th Congress begins debate on Iraq  I will be introducing legislation that offers a comprehensive strategy for achieving a political solution and bringing U S  troops home within one year   I write to ask you to co sponsor this legislation       Eight months ago  thirteen of us stood together in calling for a one year deadline for the redeployment of most U S  troops from Iraq  I am more convinced than ever that a combination of serious  sustained diplomacy and the enforcement of benchmarks for progress by the Iraqi government  leveraged by a one year deadline for redeployment of U S  troops  is the best way to achieve our goal of stability in Iraq and security in the region        Let me emphasize that this strategy does not mean abandoning Iraq in one year  in fact  it provides the President the discretion to leave the minimum number of United States troops necessary to complete the training of Iraqi security forces  go after terrorists  and protect United States facilities and personnel        Our country is strongest when we work together to craft solutions that are in our nation s best interest   The bipartisan Iraq Study Group recently issued a series of important recommendations  Many of them  which are consistent with proposals that some here in the Senate have long advocated  are incorporated in this legislation    including launching a major diplomatic initiative  enforcing a series of benchmarks for meeting key political objectives  shifting the military mission to training Iraqi security forces and conducting targeted counter terrorism operations  and maintaining an over the horizon presence to protect our interests throughout the region         The Iraq Study Group report set a goal of withdrawing United States combat forces from Iraq by the first quarter of 2008  or within approximately one year  This date was based upon the timeframe for transferring responsibility to Iraqi security forces set forth by George W  Casey Jr   and on the schedule agreed upon by the Iraqi government for achieving key political and security objectives  It is consistent with the President s stated objective  worked out with the Iraqi government  of transferring full security responsibility to the Iraqis by November of 2007   I believe that a firm  one year redeployment deadline is necessary to make that goal a reality        My recent trip to Iraq and the Middle East strongly reinforced my view that setting this deadline is the key to making Iraqis stand up for Iraq  We must give the Iraqis more control over their own destiny  as they have repeatedly requested    and make them accountable for making the hard political compromises necessary to achieve a lasting political solution   That means recognizing that Iraqi politicians have repeatedly shown they only respond to deadlines   a deadline to transfer authority  deadlines to hold two elections and a referendum  and a deadline to form a government        Conversely  without hard deadlines hopes for progress in Iraq have been frustrated  When Prime Minister Maliki took power in May  General Casey and Ambassador Khalilzad said the new government had six months to make the political compromises necessary to win public confidence and unify the country  They were right  yet with no real deadline to force the new government s hand  that period passed without meaningful action    and we are now seeing the disastrous results        To ensure that history does not repeat itself  we must also enforce the interim benchmarks agreed upon by the Iraqi government for meeting key objectives on national reconciliation  security and governance  Meeting these benchmarks is key to forcing the Iraqis to reach a sustainable political agreement    but without any enforcement mechanism  they are little more than a wish list  That s why  as the Iraq Study Group report suggests  this legislation calls on the President to condition United States political  military  or economic assistance on meeting these benchmarks         This one year deadline is also essential to getting Iraq s neighbors and the international community to play a more active and constructive role in helping the parties reach a political solution and aiding in the reconstruction effort  They all share our interest trying to bring stability to Iraq  and this deadline will help create the sense of urgency that is necessary to bring about real results         Finally  the current military mission in Iraq goes far beyond what Congress approved in the original 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force in Iraq  This legislation establishes that the authorization for use of military force is now limited to implementing the strategy set forth this legislation        We all want stability in Iraq  We all agree on the need to preserve our vital national security interests in the region  and the importance of preventing the violence in Iraq from spreading into a broader regional conflict   We all understand the need to prevent Iraq from becoming a staging ground for al Qaeda and like minded terrorists        The time has come for a Congress that shares some responsibility for getting America into war in Iraq to provide a realistic strategy for getting us out  I believe that the strategy set forth in this legislation provides the best way forward for America and for Iraq  I hope you will join me as a co sponsor   If you have any questions  please contact Frank Lowenstein of my staff at 224 6539   Thank you         Sincerely
