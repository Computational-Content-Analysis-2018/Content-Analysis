Americans

works for Saudi Arabia and big oil  but not for American people   It   s time to tap America   s strength to control our own destiny                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Below are the remarks of Senator John Kerry made late last night during Senate debate on the energy bill   Senator Kerry   s remarks follow as prepared            Our nation   s energy crisis has reached historic levels   We need policy whose boldness is commensurate with that crisis   But that   s not what we   re getting   Instead  we   re getting a pork laden lobbyist driven dream bill   It   s inexcusable          When you look at the outrageous gas prices leaving our families struggling to balance their checkbooks   When you look at our businesses struggling to turn a profit   When you see our children breathing air dangerously polluted by fossil fuels   When you read about rival nations streaking ahead of us in alternative energy technologies and creating high paying jobs that could have been ours   When you recognize our dependence on foreign oil has us entangled with nations who would do us harm   When you take all this into account  it   s clear this energy bill fails miserably          The Senate bill wasn   t perfect  but it was certainly better than this   The conference committee bill takes a huge step backward          The requirement that U S  utilities generate 10  of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020 is gone   The language recognizing the need to address global climate change is gone   And I don   t know how they intend to explain this one to the American people  but the requirement to reduce oil consumption by one million barrels a day is gone too          Instead  billions of American tax dollars go to the oil  gas  and nuclear industries  including a last minute  deal that gives another  1 5 billion to one of the most profitable companies in the world   Halliburton   Our children get weaker environmental protections and dirtier air and water   Americans get no relief at the pump  and we   re left just as dependent and probably more dependent on foreign oil          You don   t have to take my word for it that this energy bill fails to reduce our dependence on foreign oil   The President   s own economists found that oil imports will actually increase 85  by 2025 under a proposal like this   The President   s economists also found that    changes to production  consumption  imports  and prices are negligible     It doesn   t take an expert to understand we   ve only been graced with 3  of the worlds    oil reserves   Saudi Arabia has 65  of them   We can   t drill our way to energy independence  we have to invent our way there          About the only thing this energy bill invents is new ways to fatten the coffers of big energy companies   The Conference version is not even a band aid on the energy crisis itself  and leaves us worse off in many areas          Look at what this bill means for the environment   By amending the Safe Drinking Water Act to allow the unregulated underground injection of chemicals during oil and gas development  clean drinking water is threatened   The oil and gas industries receive an exemption for their construction activities from compliance with Clean Water Act   The energy bill also requires an inventory of offshore oil and natural gas resources meant to pave the way for offshore drilling along America   s coastlines  including areas off Florida where drilling is banned   This energy bill should have been a net plus for the environment   Instead  we   re going backward          We all know there are some positive provisions in this bill   We   re doing more for ethanol and clean coal  although certainly not enough   I   m encouraged by the strong new standards and consumer protections in electricity and the fact that we finally authorized Energy Star   But the bottom line is we should be doing better than this   We shouldn   t be going backward   The energy bill provides a unique opportunity to address many challenges at once          If we end our dependence on foreign oil  we strengthen our national security   If we lead the world in inventing new energy technologies  we create thousands of high paying American jobs   If we learn to tap clean sources of energy  we preserve a clean environment for our families and future generations   If we remove the burden of high gas prices  American consumers can spend elsewhere and give our economy the boost it needs          This energy bill comes nowhere near taking advantage of this opportunity   And we all know how difficult it is to get an Energy Bill passed   We   ve tried a number of times   and this one time we get close we can   t afford to leave good policy on the table           First  we have a powerful opportunity to make renewable electricity the standard in the United States  The bill should increase our electricity supply from renewables by requiring utilities to generate 20 percent of their electricity from wind  solar  geothermal and biomass facilities by 2020  The renewable portfolio standard is a simple mechanism to diversify energy resources  stabilize electricity prices  and reduce air pollution and other harmful environmental impacts of electricity generation while creating tens of thousands of new jobs in the process          Second  we need to help domestic auto manufacturers build the cars  trucks and SUVs of the future  There s no doubt the market for hybrids is set to take off  Over the next three years  the number of hybrid models will increase to almost 20  and by 2012  there could possibly be more than 50 models  These are real volumes  and real value  If we don t build them  someone else will  and they will take our market share and take our jobs  Even under a business as usual scenario  the global market for hybrids by one estimate will be 4 5 million units by 2013    perhaps  65 billion in the U S  alone in just eight years  time  We need to put American ingenuity back to work building clean  fuel efficient cars  And just like in World War II  we need all of America to come together  to pitch in  to help solve these problems  That   s why any energy bill we consider should include both manufacturer and consumer incentives to encourage domestic production and boost sales of efficient hybrid and advanced diesel vehicles          Third  Congress can no longer ignore the greatest threat to the environment  global climate change  Higher temperatures threaten dangerous consequences  drought  disease  floods  lost ecosystems  And from sweltering heat to rising seas  global warming   s effects have already begun  But solutions are in sight  We know where most heat trapping gases come from  power plants and vehicles  And we know how to curb their emissions  modern technologies and stronger laws  We need to pass an economy wide cap and trade bill  and at the same time we need to re engage in the discussions already taking place in the international community          Fourth  to ensure that technologies capable of providing clean  secure and affordable energy become available in the timeframe and on the scale needed  we need to dramatically increase our commitment to research and development  The bill should include provisions to dramatically increase federal government funding for new energy research and development  increase incentives for private sector energy research and development  and expand investment in cooperative international R initiatives          And maybe most important of all  we need to attack this energy crisis with the intensity our nation once showed with the Manhattan Project and the Apollo Program   Our competitors are showing this kind of urgency           A new national campaign in Japan urges replacement of older appliances with new hybrid products as part of their nationwide effort to save energy and fight global warming   In Germany  where heating is a huge drain on energy  a new law sets the standard of a    seven liter house    designed to use just seven liters of oil to heat one square meter for a year   In Singapore  air conditioning is the big drain on energy  so new codes encourage the use of heat blocking window films and hookups to neighborhood cooling systems which chill water overnight   In Hong Kong  an    intelligent    elevator system uses computers to minimize unnecessary stops           If these nations can reduce their dependence foreign oil and invest in advanced energy technology  then surely the United States can  And their urgency is more than justified  because this goes beyond our economy   Energy is a legitimate global security issue         The era when the United States  Japan and Europe comprise the bulk of the world   s demand for oil is over   Oil consumption from developing Asian nations will more than double in the next 25 years  from 15 million to 32 million barrels a day   Chinese consumption will grow from 5 million nearly 13 million barrels per day   India   s will rise from 2 to more than 5 million barrels per day   This global race for oil is potentially a devastating destabilizing force          Increased American energy dependence further entangles our nation in unstable regions of the world and forces us to compromise our values   In exchange for oil  we transfer wealth to people who would do us and others great harm   This is as bad for our troops as it is for gas prices   We risk being drawn into dangerous conflicts  and an already overburdened military is increasingly stretched too thin          In recent years U S  forces had to help protect the pipeline in Colombia   Our military had to train indigenous forces to protect the pipeline in Georgia   We plan to spend  100 million on a special network of police officers and special forces units to guard oil facilities around the Caspian Sea  and continue to search for bases in Africa so we can protect oil facilities there   Our navy patrolled tanker routes in the Indian Ocean  South China Sea  and the western Pacific            The reality is we have to protect the oil we depend on for our way of life   And this is a serious issue with real consequences because the unstable nature of conflict ridden oil producing areas challenges our economic security           In spring 2004  insurgents attacked an Iraqi oil platform   There was violence against oil workers in Nigeria   The result was depressed global oil output and record high gasoline prices   We were helpless to stop it          The most dangerous aspect of all of this is that we   re not alone   International demand for oil is heating up   At the rate we   re going the great powers of the world may resume the race to secure the remaining energy reserves   That   s an alarming scenario  but that is the course we   re on   With strong leadership we can avoid it  but we can   t do it without a balanced energy plan that ends our dependence on foreign oil          If anyone needs an example of how energy dependence can shortchange national security  look no farther than the War on Terror   If we assume oil miraculously drops to  30 barrel  over the next 25 years the U S  will send over 3 trillion American dollars out of the country  much of it to regimes who don   t share our values   Today  America spends more than  200 000 per minute on foreign oil    13 million per hour  More than  25 billion a year goes for Persian Gulf imports alone   It   s bad enough to think these dollars won   t help grow our economy   It   s worse to consider their impact on our volatile relationships with regimes like the House of Saud          And our dependence on foreign oil is a bad bargain in the War on Terror   In the past Hamas received almost half of its funding from Saudi Arabia   We know al Qaeda has relied on prominent Saudi Arabians for financing   Saudi Arabia sponsors clerics who promote the ideology of terror          The bottom line is the Administration   s energy policy works for Saudi Arabia  it works for big oil and gas companies  but it doesn   t work for the American people            Americans deserve better  and they certainly deserve the truth   That   s not what they   re getting when the Administration delays an EPA report slamming the fuel economy until after the bill passes  as we learned in the New York Times today   It tells you a lot about which interests this bill serves when the Administration doesn   t want people knowing the truth until after the votes are counted   And there   s no doubt the Administration and my colleagues Republican and Democrat who vote for this bill are going to sell it as some great national triumph   It   s not   This bill does a great job squeezing in a lot of pork and that   s about it          Washington failed the American people on this one   Whether it   s consumers at the pump  troops risking their lives to protect pipelines around the world  airlines struggling to survive  or kids breathing dirty air  everyone   s losing here   The minimal progress in this bill doesn   t come close to cutting it   And Americans will be able to judge the real world success of this energy bill every day at the pump   They won   t be fooled  and they   ll demand that we take steps to end the crisis with boldness that matches the severity of the crisis itself          It   s time to give America an energy policy that works for America and works for the 21st century   It   s time to tap America   s strength   our markets  our invention  our innovation and our values   to control our own destiny   We need to embrace and foster a revolution toward an energy world that benefits our environment  our economy  and most importantly our security   This energy bill doesn   t even come close                                                                                           20510
