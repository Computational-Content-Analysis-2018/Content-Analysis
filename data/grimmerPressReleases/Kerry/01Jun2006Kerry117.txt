spoke at the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles  The meeting was chaired by former Secretary of State Warren Christopher  who is Co Chair of the Pacific Council   s Board of Directors        John Kerry  who has served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 21 years and has called for the redeployment of American combat troops from Iraq by the end of the year  spoke to the Council on security issues from proliferation in Iran and North Korea  to the need for a change of course in Iraq        Below are Senator Kerry   s remarks as prepared for delivery        Senator John Kerry      Speech to Pacific Council on International Policy      Century City  California      As Prepared for Delivery      Thank you all for coming today  I want to especially thank Secretary Christopher for his kind introduction  It   s truly an honor to be here with Secretary Christopher today  He is a distinguished diplomat in the finest tradition  the embodiment of the kind of statesmanship we need more than ever to keep America safe in these challenging times       From the Middle East peace process to the Dayton Accords for Bosnia  to the Agreed Framework with North Korea and the restoration of civilian leadership in Haiti  Secretary Christopher lived the ideal that that the essence of effective foreign policy is achieving your goals without having to use military force         Unfortunately  our current diplomacy is not anywhere near as effective as it needs to be     and we are much less safe as a result   In fact  so much of what we used to take for granted in national security policy has now been called into question          We used to know that despite our differences in political philosophy and in perspective our two great parties could cooperate to craft international policies in our national interest          We used to understand that the unique and historic role of the United States in world affairs required a far sighted and multi faceted approach to protecting our people and our interests        We used to value as a national treasure the international alliances and institutions that enhanced our strength  amplified our voice  and reflected our traditions and ideals in maintaining a free and secure world          We used to measure America s strength and security by our moral authority  our economic leadership  and our diplomatic skills  as well as by the power of our military          We used to say politics stopped at the water s edge  we used to call on our people to share in the sacrifices demanded by freedom  and our leaders used to raise hopes and inspire trust  not raise fears and demand blind faith        And like Secretary Christopher  we used to understand diplomacy must be the primary means of advancing America   s national security interests        To be sure  America has never hesitated to pick up arms and fight when necessary to repel grave threats or advance freedom  There are times when we have no other choice    most recently in Afghanistan  No president should ever take the option of using force off the table  and no president should ever cede our security to any other country or institution  We never have  and we never will        But it is important to remember that war is the ultimate failure of diplomacy     which is why those who know what war is really like care so much about making sure our diplomacy is as good as it can be         Yet our current leadership has arrogantly discarded this basic principal    that the greatest success comes in reaching your objective without the terrible risks and costs of war    for a new doctrine rooted in the primacy of military force   For all the rhetoric of freedom and democracy  they behave as though might really does make right  For far too long  they dismissed the alliances and institutions that served us so well in the past as nothing more than speedbumps on the road to exercising unilateral power  And all too often they disdained diplomacy as little more than an inconvenient detour on the chosen path to armed conflict          The results speak for themselves  Think about where we were just a few years ago  All the world was united with us after September 11th  in that remarkable period where newspapers across the world proclaimed     we are all Americans now     The Taliban had been toppled  Osama bin Laden was on the run         Soon after that  in January 2002  President Bush declared Iran  Iraq and North Korea an    axis of evil     He warned that if they were allowed to continue their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction     the price of indifference would be catastrophic            Four and a half years later  we   ve paid a catastrophic price     for incompetence  not indifference   We   re bogged down in a war against the only member of the so called axis that did NOT have weapons of mass destruction  The Taliban is resurgent in Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden has still not been held accountable  North Korea has reportedly quadrupled its nuclear weapons capability  and Iran   s radical President is now defiantly seeking nuclear weapons capability while denying the holocaust and flirting with the chilling thought of    wiping Israel off the map           Catastrophic  indeed    and indifferent diplomacy is undeniably part of why we now find ourselves confronted by a world that is less safe and less secure than it was when the President spoke those words        To keep America safe in the 21st century  we must change course and restore statesmanship to its rightful place as the cornerstone of our national security policy  I believe deeply in the power of effective diplomacy    the kind of diplomacy practiced by Dean Acheson  George Kennan  and Presidents of both parties like Truman and Eisenhower         As a Senator  I   ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to work on some important diplomatic initiatives  I know what sustained  hard nosed diplomacy can accomplish  I know the gulfs it can bridge     between people  and between countries  I learned a lot of lessons teamed up with Senator McCain in helping bring about normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam  Let me tell you  if two Senators with very different experiences can return to a country where they once fought a bloody war and help move former enemies toward a new era of reconciliation and cooperation  just imagine what a sitting President could accomplish           Yet starting with the lead up to the war  our diplomatic efforts in Iraq have ranged from the indifferent to the indefensible  Key to any hope of stabilizing Iraq is sustained diplomacy from the highest levels of America   s leadership that matches the effort of our soldiers on the ground         While the Iraqis have made important progress in forming a new government  there is clearly more to be done when  in the middle of an escalating civil war  they still do not have an Interior Minister to run the police or a Defense Minister to run the army  We must not tolerate delays  jockeying for position  and the playing of political games while our troops are putting their lives on the line  All we have heard from the Bush Administration is more platitudes when what we need is more pressure on Iraqi leaders to move forward  It took President Bush three years to admit he was wrong to say    bring it on     We can   t afford years to go by until he admits the standstill in Iraq today is wrong        Beyond the unity government  a true national compact is needed to bring about a political solution to the insurgency and end the sectarian violence   To achieve this  we should immediately bring the leaders of the Iraqi factions together at a Dayton like summit that includes our allies  Iraq   s neighbors  members of the Arab League and the U N   This will enable the parties to engage in the intensive diplomacy necessary to forge a comprehensive agreement that addresses federalism  oil revenues  the militias  security guarantees  reconstruction  economic assistance  and border security         We also need to acknowledge that it takes a deadline to get Iraq up on its own two feet and get American troops home  The fact is that our soldiers have done an incredible job of giving the Iraqis the opportunity to create a democratic future for their country  They are now caught in the middle of an escalating civil war that they are powerless to end   Exactly one year after Dick Cheney declared that the insurgency was in its last throes  they are still being killed and maimed by IED   s they cannot defend against   Our soldiers have done their job  It   s time for the newly elected Iraqi leaders to do their job  And it   s past time for America   s political leaders to do theirs         That   s why we must agree with the new Iraqi government on a schedule for leaving  withdrawing American combat forces by the end of this year   The only troops that remain should be those critical to finishing the job of standing up Iraqi security forces   This will empower and legitimize the new leadership with the Iraqi people  it will expedite the process of getting Iraqis to assume a larger role in running their country  and it will undermine support for the insurgency among the vast majority of Iraqis who want U S  troops to leave         In fact  a recent poll of Iraqis shows that 87  support their government endorsing a timeline for U S  withdrawal  Prime Minister Maliki understands this  and he   s now saying that Iraqis should be able to take over security for 16 of Iraq   s 18 provinces by the end of this year  and all 18 by the end of next year   In short  this approach will give the new Iraqi government the best chance to succeed in holding the country together while democratic institutions can evolve         The withdrawal of our troops from Iraq is necessary not only for Iraq  it is also vital to our national security interests elsewhere  Nowhere is this more important than in Iran  where the world   s leading state sponsor of terrorism is delighted to see us tied down in Iraq as it defies the international community by moving ahead with its nuclear program   Let   s be perfectly clear  an Iranian regime armed with nuclear weapons poses a very grave threat to the United States and our allies  and there   s no question President Ahmadinejad   s threats toward Israel must be taken seriously          While Iran   s nuclear ambitions and support for terrorism must be addressed  many Americans are increasingly concerned that the Administration   s rhetoric regarding Iran sounds eerily familiar  New White House chief of staff Josh Bolten has reportedly outlined a plan for the Republicans that includes using the Iranian threat to their advantage in the November elections  They must not be allowed to play politics with our national security           The bottom line is that we simply cannot make the same mistakes we made in rushing to war with Iraq   I accept my share of responsibility    as I said in 2004  knowing what we know now  I would not have gone to war   But it   s clear that the Administration  determined to use force to change the Iraqi regime  misled the country with manipulated intelligence to justify the invasion  used overblown rhetoric to create a climate of fear  rushed to war without giving diplomacy a chance to succeed  and alienated the nations whose support we needed to win the peace          To make sure this never happens again  Congress must play a much greater role in assessing the threat and determining our response   In fact  Senators have already requested that the intelligence community provide an updated National Intelligence Estimate on Iran so that we can be certain that we have the best available information          As a nation  we must also learn from past mistakes that sound bites do not make for sound policy   This is not about sounding tough  or creating a policy that fits on a bumper sticker  We must not succumb to the parade of false choices  straw men and rhetoric designed to play to people   s fears   We must never again allow the Administration to question the patriotism of those who see a different way forward for our country   When it comes to our security  we must have an open and honest national dialogue         This starts with finding the most effective means of addressing Iran   s nuclear ambitions   While the Administration has talked often about their desire to seek a diplomatic solution  we need much more than rhetoric  As Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert put it when he spoke to Congress last week     The international community will be judged not by its intentions  but by its results             The simple fact is that while using force always remains an option  bombing Iran is a very poor way of dealing with its nuclear ambitions  So the onus is squarely on the Administration to succeed in reaching a diplomatic resolution  And while the potential threat is dire  our intelligence community   s best estimate is that it will be 5 10 years before Iran could have nuclear weapons  Even being cautious  there is time for diplomacy to work          Secretary Rice   s announcement that the Administration is willing to talk with Iran in the context of multilateral negotiations is a welcome development   Distracted by Iraq and torn by internal divisions  they sat on the sidelines for far too long while the Europeans took charge of the negotiations  It is long overdue for them to start showing some leadership by playing a more direct role in moving this process forward         Now  we need to see some results  Before the war in Iraq  the Administration made repeated promises to give diplomacy a chance when they had already decided on regime change  This overture to Iran must be more than an effort by the Administration to    check the box    on diplomacy as they move towards confrontation  as one former official described it   By the same token  if Iran is serious about negotiating they must change course and accept this offer         In any event  history shows that negotiations with Iran are an uncertain proposition  so we must be prepared to move forward with multilateral sanctions if they do not succeed  Flush with petrodollars and emboldened by our compromised position in Iraq  the Iranians have thus far acted with impunity in the face of repeated calls by the international community to forsake its nuclear ambitions   That   s why we must continue working through the UN Security Council to keep the pressure on and demonstrate to the Iranians that there will be a heavy price to pay for pursuing their nuclear ambitions         To achieve this  we must ensure that the international community presents a united front  That means convincing Russia and China that UN sanctions are key to finding a peaceful solution    rather than a precursor to war  Successful diplomacy is more than changing the behavior of your enemies  equally important can be convincing more friendly governments to follow your lead   If Russia and China have agreed to support sanctions in return for our agreement to talk directly with Iran  we need to hold them to their word   And even if the UN effort fails  we must be prepared to work with a coalition of Europeans and other willing partners to impose meaningful sanctions         For diplomacy to succeed  we must also make clear to Iran that there will be significant benefits if they abandon their nuclear ambitions  These incentives  which are now being discussed  must be pegged to verifiable progress by Iran in meeting its commitments   My experience with Vietnam shows that we must also address other issues of concern    including terrorism  Iraq  and human rights    as part of a phased process that could ultimately lead to Iran   s integration into the international community  And just as we should not take any military options off the table  we should not rule out any diplomatic incentives that could lead to a comprehensive agreement with Iran         At the same time  we should also continue to support democratic reform in Iran   While we would all love to see the regime in Iran replaced by a democracy  it would be dangerously na  ve to rely on a moribund reform movement to overthrow the government anytime soon  In fact  if our policy is seen as regime change  this will serve to harden Iran   s position  weaken the very reformers we need to empower  and make it more difficult to engender international support         We must also work to correct the inherent flaw in the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty that allows nations such as Iran to advance their illicit nuclear weapons capability under the cover of permitted civilian nuclear programs   While Iran has violated the NPT by hiding key aspects of its nuclear program  nothing in the NPT actually prohibits them from mastering the uranium enrichment process that can lead to nuclear weapons capability  That   s why we need to rethink the fundamental bargain of the NPT so that countries forsake indigenous fuel cycle capabilities in return for fuel provided by an international consortium  while also stiffening penalties for withdrawal         Finally  we should commit to creating a new regional security structure that strengthens the security of the countries in the region  If Iran cooperates  this security alliance could be used to integrate Iran into efforts to deal with regional concerns  including Afghanistan and Iraq  if they do not  it can provide a means of containing the expansion of Iranian influence       In the end  to keep America safe in the 21st century we need to follow the example set by great statesmen like Warren Christopher  We must return to the core principles that made America the greatest nation in the world and kept us safe for generations  And those of us who care passionately about charting a better course for our country need to work diligently to advance the cause of diplomacy and debate   I look forward to working together with all of you on this critical effort                                                                                          20510
