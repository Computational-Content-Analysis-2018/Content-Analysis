Kerry today sent a letter to President Bush  encouraging him to use this weeks international climate change meetings as an opportunity to announce support for a cap on greenhouse gas emissions  Kerrys letter to the White House was signed by 20 Senators    The full text of the letter is included below     September 26  2007    The President   The White House   Washington  D C  20500    Dear Mr  President     We urge you to mark this week by announcing your support for a cap on domestic greenhouse gas emissions that will put us on the path to climate stabilization and pledge the United States full and unqualified support to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  UNFCCC  negotiation process     This weeks United Nations high level meeting marked the ceremonial opening of negotiations for a new treaty to succeed the Kyoto protocol  the first ever global agreement regulating greenhouse gases  Also this week  fifteen countries with the highest annual greenhouse gas emissions have come to Washington  at your invitation  for further conversations about national and international goals  Statements and decisions made in these meetings will begin to shape the direction of international policy on global warming for decades to come  and we believe it is in our national interest for the United States to lead and shape this effort rather than be left on the outside looking in     In 1992  President George Herbert Walker Bush demonstrated great vision in engaging the United States in the Rio Earth Summit  It was an important first step  The 1992 Rio Accords established a long term objective of stabilizing greenhouse concentrations and set a voluntary goal of reducing emissions from developed counties to 1990 levels by 2000  Sadly  we are long past the time for first steps  We face a ten year window to take concrete and comprehensive action to address global greenhouse gas emissions  We are concerned that the approach you are advocating at the major emitters meeting sounds very much like the pledge and review concept that guided the Rio agreement  But most countries  including the United States  did not meet their Rio goals  In fact  the binding targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol were a response to the global realization that stronger measures were needed  And even in light of the Kyoto goals  United States emissions are projected to increase by about 14 3  during the first phase of the Kyoto protocol  2002  2012   Our experience shows that goals based on emissions intensity and voluntary arrangements have not worked and should not be exported into a future international regulatory framework     The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made it clear that the world does not have time to delay effective action to reduce emissions  Regardless of any actions going forward  our emissions to date have already locked in warming of 0 6 degrees Celsius  The longer we wait to act  the less likely we will be able to reduce our emissions trajectory or adapt to the consequences of our actions  As we begin to construct the international agreement that will determine the future course of global emissions and associated impacts  we must keep this urgency in mind     In order for this weeks meeting of the major economies to provide constructive input to the official international process  participating countries must agree on concrete goals  As the convening nation  it is our obligation to exhibit strong leadership  We encourage you to take this opportunity to set a firm national emission reduction target aligned with the goal of limiting warming to two degrees Celsius  as recommended by the worlds leading climate scientists     As we approach the upcoming UN climate change meeting in Bali  it is critical that the United States reassert leadership and provide strong guidance in this critical multilateral effort  The nations of the world will be challenged to forge consensus on a schedule and a mandate for the post Kyoto negotiations  Such an agreement will be difficult to achieve until the United States clearly indicates its intentions  and goes to work bringing other countries to the table with hard commitments     As Senators  we will actively monitor the UNFCCC process  and we will work to make sure that climate policy in the United States strongly supports the global emission reduction effort  As the worlds leader as well as its largest historical emitter  the United States carries a singular responsibility to help mitigate the impacts of climate change  With the worlds eyes on us this week  we call on you make a specific commitment to the world to do our part     Sincerely     Senator Jeff Bingaman   Senator Bernard Sanders   Senator Ron Wyden   Senator Maria Cantwell   Senator Robert Menendez   Senator Dianne Feinstein   Senator Joe Biden   Senator Joe Lieberman      Senator Richard Durbin   Senator Robert Casey   Senator Barack Obama   Senator Patrick
