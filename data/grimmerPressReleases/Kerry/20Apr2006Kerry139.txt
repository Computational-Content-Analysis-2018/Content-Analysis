Policy in Latin America                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Today Senator John Kerry  D Mass   delivered remarks at the Latin Economic Forum   s second annual summit on competitiveness and poverty reduction in Latin America at the United Nations                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Below are remarks as prepared for delivery     During my campaign for the presidency in 2004  by necessity I spoke frequently about Iraq  Afghanistan  the Middle East and nuclear proliferation  However  other than the immediate challenges of the war on terror  there was only one speech I devoted to a single region  That region was Latin America and the Caribbean  I did so because I felt so strongly about the importance of the relationships between the United States and the other countries of the Americas         The challenge I set forth then     of rebuilding a true partnership among our nations based on dialogue  consensus and cooperation     is even more pressing today  We are long overdue in acknowledging what we have understood previously     that we all have a stake in each other   s future  We are long overdue in creating a new Community of the Americas where neighbors look after neighbors as we strive together towards our common goals           Like any real community  the Community of the Americas must be built on a foundation of mutual respect  And we cannot build this foundation until  as President Franklin Roosevelt once said  we are a good neighbor    who resolutely respects     the rights of others               Of course  President Roosevelt was speaking of Latin America  and the message he sent has influenced every administration  from Kennedy to Clinton   They understood that a strong Latin America is key to a strong America  and that we are all much stronger when we stand together           President Kennedy knew what it meant to be a good neighbor  He realized that abject poverty  inadequate health care  poor educational and housing facilities  and high unemployment were at the root of many of the problems in Latin America   His Alliance for Progress included major multilateral initiatives to promote democracy  relieve poverty and address social inequities throughout the region  And it resulted in a high water mark for U S  relations in the region          President Clinton also saw the importance of working together when he convened the historic Summit of the Americas in 1994  Relations with Latin America progressed during his Administration  and there was an almost universal embrace of democracy and institutional reform in Latin America as it edged ever closer to first world economies and shared values          That was good for the United States as well  because what happens in this hemisphere has a profound effect on Main Street  USA  From our jobs to healthcare  from immigration to schools  it   s fair to say that nearly every corner of the United States feels the effects of our relations with our neighbors  We all have a stake in each other   s future         That   s why it   s been such a disappointment that this Administration has forgotten Roosevelt   s good advice  In fact  after 9 11 the current Administration effectively lost interest in Latin America  Just as the Alliance for Progress unraveled when we became preoccupied with Vietnam  our relationships in the region have been a casualty of our disastrous involvement in Iraq          Instead of being a good neighbor  the President has largely ignored this critical region and a wide range of ills     including political and financial crises  runaway unemployment  and drug trafficking   And his one note policy toward Latin America of one size fits all trade agreements have stripped away the respect and partnership that marked the Clinton years  As a result  relations between the United States and Latin America today are at their lowest point since the end of the cold war        We need to get back to the spirit of cooperation fostered by President Kennedy and President Clinton   We need to build on that spirit to help forge this new and broader Community of the Americas   And for their sake and ours  its time to bring a sense of social conscience back to our relationships with Latin America          Key to this is working with the countries of Latin America to help spur economic growth and strengthen their economies   In 2004  the region   s economy grew by 5 5   Compare that with China  which has experienced a 10  growth rate for the last 25 years  and its clear that more needs to be done to increase growth and create opportunity         Strengthening the economies of Latin America will in turn help strengthen our economy   U S  exports to Latin America are currently valued at more than  150 billion per year     nearly matching our exports to the European Union   But of that amount  some two thirds goes to Mexico    while huge potential markets like Brazil lag far behind  We can do better         International trade enhances economic opportunity  spurs development and can serve to improve workers  rights  If it is pursued correctly  a successful trade policy will ensure that the citizens of the region experience the advantages of liberalized trade   I have long supported open trade in the hemisphere   From the ANDEAN Trade Preference Program and Caribbean Basin Initiative to the recently enacted trade agreement with Chile  pursing open markets in the region must be a priority         But trade without respect is not what our neighbors want   We need to lift up living standards and working conditions for all working men and women in the United States as well as in Latin America   That   s why it is essential that trade agreements include basic worker protections and strong enforcement mechanisms   And our trading partners should be provided technical assistance and capacity building programs to ensure new trade opportunities are shared across all economic sectors and by all citizens         As I made clear with my vote  the Administration missed the mark with the Central American Free Trade Agreement   They did not provide a balanced agreement that ensured economic opportunity for all   That is why I offered an amendment to CAFTA to improve enforcement of worker rights         As we look to the future of our trade relationship with Latin America    including the Free Trade Area of the Americas    we must be sure to negotiate balanced agreements that provide broad economic benefits  create jobs and include strong protections for labor and the environment          There is much more to promoting economic development than free trade  Development assistance can also play a greater role in strengthening these economies  While the Millennium Challenge Account provides some funding for development assistance  many countries in Latin America are ineligible for funds   The United States must understand that making additional resources available for development in Latin America works to all of our advantage   Because we all have a stake in each other   s future        During the campaign  I supported the Social Investment and Economic Development Fund for the Americas that a bipartisan group led by then Congressman Robert Menendez proposed   This  500 million fund was designed to strengthen democracy and combat poverty by investing in human capital in the areas of education  healthcare and economic development   It nurtured public and private partnerships and micro enterprise by providing training and developmental credits to startup companies  And to demonstrate our shared commitment  recipient governments collectively matched the funds that were made available  I continue to support this proposal in the Senate because it   s past time to make this fund a reality        We should also ensure that U S  policies  international lending institutions and Latin American governments direct more resources to vocational training and micro enterprise training and funding   Beyond providing a fair economic opportunity  these strategies would make millions of poor people into    stakeholders for reform           Finally  we should further reduce the costs of sending remittances back to Latin America and the Caribbean by workers in the U S   We should better harness the use of these remittances for public works and education projects by encouraging charitable contributions of remittances sent back through    home town    associations for community development   And we should give serious consideration to creative initiatives that would enable recipients to better leverage these remittances with financial institutions to promote sustainable economic development          At its core  the Community of the Americas must be based on democracy and the rule of law   Strong democratic states with transparent rules and a broad respect for the rule of law are essential to alleviating poverty and inequality in the region   That   s why I believe so strongly in supporting democratic institutions  assisting democracy where it is troubled  and promoting democracy in Cuba       The fact is that far too often  we have sent mixed messages when it comes to supporting democracy in Latin America  This Administration sat by and watched as mob violence drove presidents from office in Bolivia and in Argentina  They even encouraged a president to flee in Haiti  and immediately recognized a government named by a military junta in Venezuela   There is no question that Hugo Chavez has undermined the democratic process in his country  supported narco terrorists in Colombia  and provided massive assistance to Castro   s repressive regime in Cuba   But when we countenance mob rule or military force to oust an elected president    even objectionable leaders like Ch  vez    we lose the credibility necessary to become a true force for democracy   In fact  our policies have been so unpopular that opposition to the United States has become a rallying point for some of the very politicians we would most like to see defeated        We must remember that this is a critical time for the future of Haiti  The election of President Preval was an encouraging step towards establishing a sustainable democracy  Now  the Haitians need unwavering support from the United States and others in the region as they undertake the difficult task of restoring the rule of law  rebuilding governmental institutions and enabling their country to become self supporting  After the last elected leader was deposed  we did not do enough to stop the chaos and widespread suffering in Haiti  This serves as a constant reminder that we cannot sit on the sidelines and ignore our responsibilities in the region   We all have a stake in each other   s future       And as the great Cuban patriot Jose Mart   wrote    It is not enough to come to the defense of freedom with epic and intermittent efforts when it is threatened at moments that appear critical  Every moment is critical for the defense of freedom     That   s why I have advocated creating a Council for Democracy with distinguished international leaders who can work with the Organization of American States to resolve crises before order is threatened and blood is shed   And that   s why we should increase funding for the National Endowment for Democracy s programs that strengthen democracy in Latin America        Finally  we are losing the hearts and minds of a generation of leaders in Latin America by making it harder for young people to get visas to study here   We should triple the number of educational exchanges  and encourage colleges to give tuition waivers to foreign students in exchange for internships overseas for our students         Building this Community of the Americas also means remembering that the United States is a nation of immigrants   America wouldn   t be where it is today     as a country and as a people     if it weren   t for immigrants   And neither would I     because I married one   My wife Teresa was raised under a dictatorship in Mozambique   She didn   t get to cast a vote in America until she was 31   But I can tell you  as much as she loves her roots and loves her heritage  I have met few people who love America as much as she does   Teresa is not alone   From soldiers to students  there are millions of immigrants who have come to our shores and made America a better place         That is why it is so important that we pass comprehensive immigration reform   and so disappointing that the Senate failed to do so before the Easter Recess   We are a country that welcomes those who play by the rules and who contribute to their communities   We are a country that provides shelter to those facing oppression and persecution   History has shown us that these are the people who make us who we are   they are part of the great nation we aspire to be   American should not become  as Congressman Tom Tancredo has suggested     a gated community             Don   t get me wrong   I understand that there are people in this world that would cross our borders to do us harm   That   s why strong enforcement of our laws and our borders is so important  But a policy of arrest and deportation is not a solution   We do not have to compromise our national security in order to continue our tradition as a nation of immigrants   We can make America stronger inside and out          This requires providing a path to legalization for those undocumented workers who are living here  working hard and paying taxes   We need to reunite families more quickly   And as we do all this  we should improve our border security  fix our watch lists  and make other countries our real partners   Making the United States safer and more secure makes the entire region safer and more secure  We all have a stake in each other   s future        With a true Community of the Americas  the potential for our hemisphere is limitless   The stories of progress in Latin America are inspiring   In Chile  when Michelle Bachelet became the country   s first woman president    and only the 11th female elected president in the world     she shared this moving image about her inauguration     In the streets  thousands of women and children put on presidential sashes  It meant everyone was going to La Moneda together with me     And we can learn so much from each other   s successes     like the innovations we see in Brazil  where a 30 year program to invest in alternative fuels will pay off this year when Brazil becomes energy independent          In short  our fortunes are intertwined by geography  shared values and millions of human interactions across borders every day   Now it is our job to build a true community  By treating our neighbors as partners  with dignity and respect  we can ensure that this community we call the Americas will prosper and reach its full potential so this can truly be the Century of the Americas
