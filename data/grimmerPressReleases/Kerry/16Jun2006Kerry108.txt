Inquirer    June 16  2006    By John Kerry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Half of those whose names are inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial were lost after America s leaders knew our strategy would not succeed  It was immoral then  and it is immoral now  to be quiet or equivocal in the face of such delusion       Our soldiers  no matter how brave  can t bring democracy to Iraq simply with a gun barrel  the Iraqis themselves must build their democracy  And it will never be done if Iraq s leaders are unwilling to make the compromises that democracy requires       The confirmation of Iraq s vital cabinet ministers to run the police force and army  coupled with the killing of the brutal terrorist Abu Musab al Zarqawi  are an opportunity to change the course in Iraq    if we seize it       We know the verdict of our generals  the war cannot be won militarily  the only way forward is a political settlement  We need to listen to Gen  George Casey  the U S  military commander in Iraq  who argued that our large military presence  feeds the notion of occupation  and  extends the amount of time that it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self reliant   To make Iraqis self  reliant  we need hard and fast deadlines  not an open ended commitment of U S  forces       Iraqi politicians have proved that they respond only to deadlines    a deadline to transfer authority  and deadlines to hold three elections  It was only the most intense eleventh hour pressure that pushed aside Prime Minister Ibrahim al Jaafari and brought forward a consensus prime minister  It was only the most intense eleventh  hour pressure that forced the Iraqis to complete their government  That is why we need a deadline now for Iraqis to stand up and fight for their own country       It is time to announce that our combat troops are coming home in 2006  It is time to set a schedule with the new Iraqi government for the phased withdrawal of U S  combat forces by the end of the year  Doing so will empower the Iraqi leadership  put Iraqis in the position of running their own country  and undermine support for the insurgency  which is fueled in large measure by the majority of Iraqis who want us to leave their country  Only troops essential to finishing the job of training Iraqi forces should remain  This will put Iraqis in charge    and it will undermine support for the insurgency       Key to this transition is a long overdue engagement in serious and sustained diplomacy  To give Iraq its best hope for a peaceful future  the administration should convene a summit that includes the leaders of that country  its neighbors  and representatives from the Arab League  NATO  the United Nations and the European Union to forge the comprehensive political solution that is necessary to bring stability to Iraq  Making it clear that America will not stay in Iraq forever pressures the regional players to step up and assume their fair share of the burden       We will not leave Iraq vulnerable  Under my plan  the United States will maintain an over the horizon military presence in the Middle East to fight the war on terror and protect regional security interests  We will finish training Iraqi security forces    and hold the president firm to his word that when Iraqis stand up  we will stand down  So far  the Iraqis have trained 265 600 security forces     just 7 000 shy of the Bush administration s stated goal of 272 566  Where s the standing down       The time has come for a Congress that shares responsibility for getting us into Iraq to take responsibility for helping to get us out  Sure  we were misled  But we know it now    and we know the truth  We must demand a change in policy  a change in course  Our soldiers have done their job  It is time for Iraqis to do their job  to stand up for Iraq  It s time for Iraqis to want democracy for themselves as much as we want it for them       This is a moment when American patriotism demands more dissent and less complacency in the face of stubborn pride from those in power  It is not enough to argue with details or logistics  with the manner of the conflict s execution  or the failures of competence  as great as they are       It is essential to acknowledge that the war itself was a mistake     to say the simple words that contain more truth than pride  I was misled  I was wrong to vote for the Iraq resolution  I will fight to set a deadline to redeploy American forces  We cannot change the future unless we are honest about the past  We cannot have it both ways on the Iraq war  It is time at last to make the policy right    for our troops  and for Iraq         ABOUT THE WRITER      Sen  John
