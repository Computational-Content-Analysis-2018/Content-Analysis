                                                                                                                                                                       I am pleased to be here this morning with my friends Senator Tom Harkin and Lance Armstrong   We   re here today to protect our government   s commitment to fighting   and one day curing   cancer       Sen  Harkin and I came to the Senate together in 1984     number 99 and number 100 in seniority then  Tom and I were both great admirers of our late colleague  Paul Wellstone  who we always thought of as the conscience of our caucus  Sen  Harkin remains true to Paul   s ideals  and it   s Tom     always pushing  always fighting     who is the conscience of the Senate today when it comes so many issues that matter to peoples    lives and their well being  none more so than his commitment to increasing funding for cancer research   I   m grateful for Sen  Harkin   s friendship and for his invitation to be here today  and I   m delighted to be by his side here in Iowa    Lance Armstrong an inspiration to all of us       I was given my first    Live Strong    bracelet at a rally in Sioux City by a woman who was in the fight of her life against cancer   and I have worn one ever since   It is a personal reminder of this fight which took my father   s life five years ago   and my former wife   my children   s mother   three months ago   So this fight is intensely personal for me       I can   t tell you how many people on the campaign trail in 2004 noticed my bracelet and told me their stories battling and beating cancer   This bracelet has created an unbelievable sense of community among so many of us  a bond between those of us who   ve beaten cancer and a reminder of our friends and family who weren   t as lucky     In 2000  my father died of prostate cancer   His cancer was caught too late  and our family marched through his debilitating struggle  always grateful that we were able to afford the care he needed  In 2003  I was diagnosed with the very same disease   My doctors caught it early     and I was one of the lucky ones who received excellent treatment  beat cancer  and went on to live as productive a life as I was before   But I want to spare people the suffering my father went through and share with them my own good luck and the  new lease on life that came with early treatment and a cure     I survived because of early detection  and I recovered so quickly thanks largely to great health care   But I also survived because of the progress that cancer researchers have made in preventing  detecting  and treating this deadly disease       I believe strongly that every American deserves a health plan every bit as good as what Members of Congress give ourselves   And I believe strongly that cancer research must be a national priority       We   ve already seen that when we invest in research  the rewards are almost immeasurable   In 1971 fewer than half of all cancer patients lived 5 years beyond their diagnosis   Today  it   s up to 64  for adults and 79  for children under 14   Since 1971  we   ve more than tripled the number of cancer survivors     That is real progress you can   t put a pricetag on because there is no greater success than  saving lives       We have miles to go to save more lives  to alleviate more suffering  This year nearly 565 000 Americans are expected to die of cancer     that   s more than 1 500 people a day  one of every four deaths in America   Only heart disease kills more Americans than cancer       The National Cancer Institute is on the frontlines of our fight against cancer    from understanding the genetic mutations that make us vulnerable to cancer to helping people cancer survivors cope in their daily lives   It is the nerve center that supports major academic and research branch institutions throughout the country   But today   s field hearing here in Iowa is an appropriate setting because the fight against cancer happens largely outside of Washington     in places like the Cancer Center here at the University of Iowa        But amazingly  for the next budget year  President Bush has proposed a  39 million cut to the funding for the National Cancer Institute compared with last year   s funding       Mr  Chairman  we know it is wrong to pretend anyone in Washington is coping with record budget deficits by shortchanging cancer patients  That   s not what   s going on  There   s no shortage of money  there   s a deficit of willpower  This is a question of values     and in Congress we measure our values in the priorities and choices we live out every day in the federal budget      We are here because we believe it is wrong for the federal government  to cut funding for fighting cancer  We are here because we believe something   s wrong when the government can find a trillion dollars for Iraq but we can   t find  40 million to fight cancer right here at home     Today   s hearing is so important because we need to add new voices to the body of evidence telling President Bush his current budget is dead wrong  This hearing is important because the Administration needs to hear from the heartland that we should be INCREASING cancer funding    not cutting it by nearly  40 million       The impact is undeniable  Cutting the government   s commitment to cancer research funding slows advancements in research  in clinical trials  at cancer centers and impedes important technological developments for diagnosis and treatment   We can   t reach our goal of curing cancer if we move backwards     Instead of funding cancer research  we   re giving more tax breaks to millionaires   Mr  Chairman  if there   s one thing you find out when you talk with cancer patients and their families  it   s that when you get that test result back and you hear that diagnosis  cancer doesn   t discriminate between rich or poor  In a test of priorities  let me tell you  millionaires want their cancer to be cured more than they want a tax cut     no one can spend their money from the grave     We   re hitting the home stretch in our race for the cure  and let me assure you that we won   t let up for one instant until we   ve crossed the finish line and found one       So many times in the history of our country  we   ve dreamed of something  then made it a reality   And we have never compromised on our determination to keep fighting the good fight against cancer   in our labs  in our hospitals  and in our homes   and we will never give up on our dream to cure cancer until it   s a reality        Thanks for inviting me to testify today  to share my story and to join in your cause
