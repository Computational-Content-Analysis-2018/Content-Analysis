John Kerry  D Mass   and Representative Bill Pascrell  D N J   today introduced legislation that would help American families who are living below the poverty level  Many families continue to be penalized by the tax code when they take a job  some of them would take more money home if they simply went on welfare  Kerry s plan  the Strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit  EITC  Act of 2007  would help lift more families out of poverty and reward work  It does that by reducing the marriage penalty  increasing the return for families with three or more children  expands the credit for individuals with no children  and permanently extends the provision that allows members of the armed forces to include combat pay as income in EITC calculations         This bill is about helping those who have been left behind and rewarding work   said Kerry   We ve got one in eight Americans in poverty in our country  and a serious income discrepancy that rises every year   The last Congress only exacerbated the problem by deepening tax cuts for those who don t need them  while neglecting the solutions we know work effectively for working Americans  I want to thank Rep  Pascrell for his leadership on this issue in the House  and I look forward to passing this bill in the Senate          This legislation will help Congress fulfill its moral obligation to lift up the most hard pressed people in our society   stated Pascrell  a member of the House Ways and Means Committee    It represents an opportunity for this federal government to finally wake up to the plight of our most underserved communities and narrow the widening gulf between the rich and poor in America   I look forward to working with Senator Kerry to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to those who need it most         Please find details of the legislation  below       Marriage Penalty   Under current law  the income level at which the EITC begins to phase out is  1 000 higher for married than for unmarried filers in 2002  2003  and 2004   2 000 higher in 2005  2006  2007  and  3 000 higher in 2008    The  3 000 is indexed for inflation though 2010  but after 2010 the phase out income level for married taxpayers reverts to the same level as for unmarried filers          This legislation would increase the phase out income level for married taxpayers that file a joint return to  3 500 higher than the threshold for unmarried filers in 2007 and gradually increase the differential by  500 a year until it reaches  5000 in 2010  then index it for inflation   Under current law for 2007  the phase out income for a married individual with one child is  17 390 and this legislation would increase it to  18 890       Combat Pay   For most purposes under current law  combat pay is not treated as taxable income   The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 included a provision which would treat combat pay as earned income for purposes of computing the child credit   While that provision expires at the end of the year  the Kerry Pascrell proposal would make it provision permanent       Families with Three or More Children   Under current law  the EITC has categories for one child and two children or more   The credit for two children or more is 40 percent  The maximum credit amount for 2007 is  4 716        The proposal would create a new category for a taxpayer with three or more children   The credit rate would be 45 percent   The maximum credit amount would be  5 306   The proposal would keep the phase out income level and the phase out rate the same as they are under current law for the two or more children category   Increasing the credit rate results in a larger credit and an increase in the phase out range   For 2007  a family with 3 or more children with earned income of  37 783 and above would not receive the EITC   39 783 in the case of married couples    Under the legislation  an individual with 3 or more children with earned income of  40 582 and above   44 082 for a married couple  would not receive the EITC       No Children   Under current law  individuals with no children are eligible for the EITC   The phase out rate and the credit rate is 7 65 percent          The legislation would double the credit and phase out rate from 7 65 to 15 3 percent  This change increases the maximum credit amount from  428 to  855   Individuals in the same income range as those under current law are eligible for the credit                                                                                       20510
