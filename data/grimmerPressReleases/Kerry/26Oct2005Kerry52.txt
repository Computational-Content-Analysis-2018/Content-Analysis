Responsibly  We Can Stabilize Iraq and Reduce Combat Forces With Successful December Elections  Draw Down 20 000 Troops by the End of 2005                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Senator John Kerry   The Path Forward   Georgetown University  October 26  2005  As prepared for delivery      A few weeks ago I departed Iraq from Mosul  Three Senators and staff were gathered in the forward part of a C 130  In the middle of the cavernous cargo hold was a simple  aluminum coffin with a small American flag draped over it  We were bringing another American soldier  just killed  home to his family and final resting place       The starkness of his coffin in the center of the hold  the silence except for the din of the engines  was a real time cold reminder of the consequences of decisions for which we Senators share responsibility       As we arrived in Kuwait  a larger flag was transferred to fully cover his coffin and we joined graves registration personnel in giving him an honor guard as he was ceremoniously carried from the plane to a waiting truck  When the doors clunked shut  I wondered why all of America would not be allowed to see him arrive at Dover Air Force Base instead of hiding him from a nation that deserves to mourn together in truth and in the light of day  His lonely journey compels all of us to come to grips with our choices in Iraq       Now more than 2 000 brave Americans have given their lives  and several hundred thousand more have done everything in their power to wade through the ongoing internal civil strife in Iraq  An Iraq which increasingly is what it was not before the war    a breeding ground for homegrown terrorists and a magnet for foreign terrorists  We are entering a make or break six month period  and I want to talk about the steps we must take if we hope to bring our troops home within a reasonable timeframe from an Iraq that   s not permanently torn by irrepressible conflict    It is never easy to discuss what has gone wrong while our troops are in constant danger  I know this dilemma first hand   After serving in war  I returned home to offer my own personal voice of dissent   I did so because I believed strongly that we owed it to those risking their lives to speak truth to power   We still do    In fact  while some say we can   t ask tough questions because we are at war  I say no   in a time of war we must ask the hardest questions of all  It s essential if we want to correct our course and do what s right for our troops instead of repeating the same mistakes over and over again   No matter what the President says  asking tough questions isn   t pessimism  it   s patriotism   Our troops have served with stunning bravery and resolve  The nobility of their service to country can never be diminished by the mistakes of politicians  American families who have lost  or who fear the loss  of their loved ones deserve to know the truth about what we have asked them to do  what we are doing to complete the mission  and what we are doing to prevent our forces from being trapped in an endless quagmire    Some people would rather not have that discussion  They   d rather revise and rewrite the story of our involvement in Iraq for the history books  Tragically  that   s become standard fare from an administration that doesn   t acknowledge facts generally  whether they are provided by scientists  whistle blowers  journalists  military leaders  or the common sense of every citizen   At a time when many worry that we have become a society of moral relativists  too few worry that we have a government of factual relativists        Let   s be straight about Iraq  Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator who deserves his own special place in hell  But that was not the reason America went to war    The country and the Congress were misled into war  I regret that we were not given the truth  as I said more than a year ago  knowing what we know now  I would not have gone to war in Iraq  And knowing now the full measure of the Bush Administration   s duplicity and incompetence  I doubt there are many members of Congress who would give them the authority they abused so badly  I know I would not  The truth is  if the Bush Administration had come to the United States Senate and acknowledged there was no    slam dunk case    that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction  acknowledged that Iraq was not connected to 9 11  there never would have even been a vote to authorize the use of force    just as there   s no vote today to invade North Korea  Iran  Cuba  or a host of regimes we rightfully despise    I understand that as much as we might wish it  we can   t rewind the tape of history  There is  as Robert Kennedy once said     enough blame to go around     and I accept my share of the responsibility  But the mistakes of the past  no matter who made them  are no justification for marching ahead into a future of miscalculations and misjudgments and the loss of American lives with no end in sight  We each have a responsibility  to our country and our conscience  to be honest about where we should go from here  It is time for those of us who believe in a better course to say so plainly and unequivocally   We are where we are  The President   s flippant    bring it on    taunt to the insurgents has found a meaning beyond his wildest expectations  a painful reality for troops who went for too long without protective armor  We have traded a dictator for a chaos that has left America less secure  and the mission the President once declared accomplished remains perilously incomplete    To set a new course  we must be strong  smart  and honest  As we learned painfully during the Vietnam War  no president can sustain a war without the support of the American people  In the case of Iraq  their patience is frayed and nearly to the breaking point because Americans will not tolerate our troops giving their lives without a clear strategy  and will not tolerate vague platitudes or rosy scenarios when real answers are urgently needed     It   s time for leaders to be honest that if we do not change course  there is the prospect of indefinite  even endless conflict   a fate untenable for our troops  and a future unacceptable to the American people and the Iraqis who pray for the day when a stable Iraq will belong to Iraqis alone   The path forward will not be easy  The administration   s incompetence and unwillingness to listen has made the task that much harder  and reduced what we can expect to accomplish  But there is a way forward that gives us the best chance both to salvage a difficult situation in Iraq  and to save American and Iraqi lives  With so much at stake  we must follow it        We must begin by acknowledging that our options in Iraq today are not what they should be  or could have been    The reason is simple  This Administration hitched their wagon to ideologues  excluding those who dared to tell the truth  even leaders of their own party and the uniformed military    When after September 11th  flags flew from porches across America and foreign newspaper headlines proclaimed    We   re all Americans now     the Administration could have kept the world united  but they chose not to  And they were wrong  Instead  they pushed allies away  isolated America  and lost leverage we desperately need today   When they could have demanded and relied on accurate instead of manipulated intelligence  they chose not to  They were wrong   and instead they sacrificed our credibility at home and abroad   When they could have given the inspectors time to discover whether Saddam Hussein actually had weapons of mass destruction  when they could have paid attention to Ambassador Wilson   s report  they chose not to  And they were wrong  Instead they attacked him  and they attacked his wife to justify attacking Iraq  We don   t know yet whether this will prove to be an indictable offense in a court of law  but for it  and for misleading a nation into war  they will be indicted in the high court of history  History will judge the invasion of Iraq one of the greatest foreign policy misadventures of all time   But the mistakes were not limited to the decision to invade  They mounted  one upon another     When they could have listened to General Shinseki and put in enough troops to maintain order  they chose not to  They were wrong  When they could have learned from George Herbert Walker Bush and built a genuine global coalition  they chose not to   They were wrong  When they could have implemented a detailed State Department plan for reconstructing post Saddam Iraq  they chose not to  And they were wrong again  When they could have protected American forces by guarding Saddam Hussein   s ammo dumps where there were weapons of individual destruction  they exposed our young men and women to the ammo that now maims and kills them because they chose not to act  And they were wrong  When they could have imposed immediate order and structure in Baghdad after the fall of Saddam  Rumsfeld shrugged his shoulders  said Baghdad was safer than Washington  D C  and chose not to act  He was wrong  When the Administration could have kept an Iraqi army selectively intact  they chose not to  They were wrong  When they could have kept an entire civil structure functioning to deliver basic services to Iraqi citizens  they chose not to  They were wrong  When they could have accepted the offers of the United Nations and individual countries to provide on the ground peacekeepers and reconstruction assistance  they chose not to  They were wrong  When they should have leveled with the American people that the insurgency had grown  they chose not to  Vice President Cheney even absurdly claimed that the    insurgency was in its last throes     He was wrong    Now after all these mistakes  the Administration accuses anyone who proposes a better course of wanting to cut and run  But we are in trouble today precisely because of a policy of cut and run  This administration made the wrong choice to cut and run from sound intelligence and good diplomacy  to cut and run from the best military advice  to cut and run from sensible war time planning  to cut and run from their responsibility to properly arm and protect our troops  to cut and run from history   s lessons about the Middle East  to cut and run from common sense        And still today they cut and run from the truth       This difficult road traveled demands the unvarnished truth about the road ahead       To those who suggest we should withdraw all troops immediately   I say No   A precipitous withdrawal would invite civil and regional chaos and endanger our own security    But to those who rely on the overly simplistic phrase    we will stay as long as it takes     who pretend this is primarily a war against Al Qaeda  and who offer halting  sporadic  diplomatic engagement  I also say   No  that will only lead us into a quagmire         The way forward in Iraq is not to pull out precipitously or merely promise to stay    as long as it takes     To undermine the insurgency  we must instead simultaneously pursue both a political settlement and the withdrawal of American combat forces linked to specific  responsible benchmarks  At the first benchmark  the completion of the December elections  we can start the process of reducing our forces by withdrawing 20 000 troops over the course of the holidays       The Administration must immediately give Congress and the American people a detailed plan for the transfer of military and police responsibilities on a sector by sector basis to Iraqis so the majority of our combat forces can be withdrawn   No more shell games  no more false reports of progress  but specific and measurable goals           It is true that our soldiers increasingly fight side by side with Iraqis willing to put their lives on the line for a better future   But history shows that guns alone do not end an insurgency  The real struggle in Iraq   Sunni versus Shiia   will only be settled by a political solution  and no political solution can be achieved when the antagonists can rely on the indefinite large scale presence of occupying American combat troops           In fact  because we failed to take advantage of the momentum of our military victory  because we failed to deliver services and let Iraqis choose their leaders early on  our military presence in vast and visible numbers has become part of the problem  not the solution         And our generals understand this  General George Casey  our top military commander in Iraq  recently told Congress that our large military presence    feeds the notion of occupation    and    extends the amount of time that it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self reliant     And Richard Nixon   s Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird   breaking a thirty year silence  writes    Our presence is what feeds the insurgency  and our gradual withdrawal would feed the confidence and the ability of average Iraqis to stand up to the insurgency   No wonder the Sovereignty Committee of the Iraqi Parliament is already asking for a timetable for withdrawal of our troops  without this  Iraqis believe Iraq will never be its own country       We must move aggressively to reduce popular support for the insurgency fed by the perception of American occupation  An open ended declaration to  stay    as long as it takes    lets Iraqi factions maneuver for their own political advantage by making us stay as long as they want  and it becomes an excuse for billions of American tax dollars to be sent to Iraq and siphoned off into the coffers of cronyism and corruption        It will be hard for this Administration  but it is essential to acknowledge that the insurgency will not be defeated unless our troop levels are drawn down  starting immediately after successful elections in December  The draw down of troops should be tied not to an arbitrary timetable  but to a specific timetable for transfer of political and security responsibility to Iraqis and realignment of our troop deployment  That timetable must be real and strict  The goal should be to withdraw the bulk of American combat forces by the end of next year  If the Administration does its work correctly  that is achievable        Our strategy must achieve a political solution that deprives the Sunni dominated insurgency of support by giving the Sunnis a stake in the future of their country  The Constitution  opposed by more than two thirds of Sunnis  has postponed and even exacerbated the fundamental crisis of Iraq  The Sunnis want a strong secular national government that fairly distributes oil revenues  Shiites want to control their own region and resources in a loosely united Islamic state   And Kurds simply want to be left alone  Until sufficient compromise is hammered out  a Sunni base can not be created that isolates the hard core Baathists and jihaadists and defuses the insurgency        The Administration must use all of the leverage in America   s arsenal   our diplomacy  the presence of our troops  and our reconstruction money    to convince Shiites and Kurds to address legitimate Sunni concerns and to make Sunnis accept the reality that they will no longer dominate Iraq   We cannot and should not do this alone           The Administration must bring to the table the full weight of all of Iraq   s Sunni neighbors  They also have a large stake in a stable Iraq   Instead of just telling us that Iraq is falling apart  as the Saudi foreign minister did recently  they must do their part to put it back together   We   ve proven ourselves to be a strong ally to many nations in the region   Now it   s their turn to do their part      The administration must immediately call a conference of Iraq   s neighbors  Britain  Turkey and other key NATO allies  and Russia   All of these countries have influence and ties to various parties in Iraq   Together  we must implement a collective strategy to bring the parties in Iraq to a sustainable political compromise   This must include obtaining mutual security guarantees among Iraqis themselves   Shiite and Kurdish leaders need to make a commitment not to perpetrate a bloodbath against Sunnis in the post election period  In turn  Sunni leaders must end support for the insurgents  including those who are targeting Shiites   And the Kurds must explicitly commit themselves not to declare independence       To enlist the support of Iraq   s Sunni neighbors  we should commit to a new regional security structure that strengthens the security of the countries in the region and the wider community of nations  This requires a phased process including improved security assistance programs  joint exercises  and participation by countries both outside and within the Middle East       Ambassador Khalilzad is doing a terrific job trying broker a better deal between the Iraqi parties   But he can   t do it alone   The President should immediately appoint a high level envoy to maximize our diplomacy in Iraq and the region         Showing Sunnis the benefits that await them if they continue to participate in the process of building Iraq can go a long way toward achieving stability  We should press these countries to set up a reconstruction fund specifically for the majority Sunni areas   It   s time for them to deliver on their commitments to provide funds to Iraq   Even short term improvements  like providing electricity and supplying diesel fuel   an offer that the Saudis have made but have yet to fulfill   can make a real difference       We need to jump start our own lagging reconstruction efforts by providing the necessary civilian personnel to do the job  standing up civil military reconstruction teams throughout the country  streamlining the disbursement of funds to the provinces so they can deliver services  expanding job creation programs  and strengthening the capacity of government ministries         We must make it clear now that we do not want permanent military bases in Iraq   or a large combat force on Iraqi soil indefinitely   And as we withdraw our combat troops  we should be prepared to keep a substantially reduced level of American forces in Iraq  at the request of the Iraqi government  for the purpose of training their security forces  Some combat ready American troops will still be needed to safeguard the Americans engaged in that training  but they should be there to do that and to provide a back stop to Iraqi efforts  not to do the fighting for Iraqis          Simultaneously  the President needs to put the training of Iraqi security forces on a six month wartime footing and ensure that the Iraqi government has the budget to deploy them   The Administration must stop using the requirement that troops be trained in country as an excuse for refusing offers made by Egypt  Jordan  France and Germany to do more       This week  long standing suspicions of Syrian complicity in destabilizing Lebanon were laid bare by the community of nations    And we know Syria has failed to take the aggressive steps necessary to stop former Baathists and foreign fighters from using its territory as a transit route into Iraq   The Administration must prod the new Iraqi government to ask for a multinational force to help protect Iraq   s borders until a capable national army is formed    Such a force  if sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council  could attract participation by Iraq s neighbors and countries like India and would be a critical step in stemming the tide of insurgents and money into Iraq        Finally  and without delay  we must fundamentally alter the deployment of American troops  While Special Operations must continue to pursue specific intelligence leads  the vast majority of our own troops should be in rear guard  garrisoned status for security backup   We do not need to send young Americans on search and destroy missions that invite alienation and deepen the risks they face   Iraqis should police Iraqis   Iraqis should search Iraqi homes   Iraqis should stand up for Iraq         We will never be as safe as we should be if Iraq continues to distract us from the most important war we must win   the war on Osama bin Laden  Al Qaeda  and the terrorists that are resurfacing even in Afghanistan  These are the make or break months for Iraq  The President must take a new course  and hold Iraqis accountable  If the President still refuses  Congress must insist on a change in policy  If we do take these steps  there is no reason this difficult process can not be completed in 12 15 months  There is no reason Iraq cannot be sufficiently stable  no reason the majority of our combat troops can   t soon be on their way home  and no reason we can   t take on a new role in Iraq  as an ally not an occupier  training Iraqis to defend themselves  Only then will we have provided leadership equal to our soldiers    sacrifice   and that is what they deserve
