Senator John Kerry  D Mass   addressed the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing to address ways to fix the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT   The AMT  a tax originally enacted in 1969 to have wealthy taxpayers  those making over  200K per year  pay their fair share  now affects more than 3 6 million taxpayers  including more and more middle class families      According to the Congressional Research Service  if no action is taken on the AMT in 2007 more than 886 000 Massachusetts taxpayers will be affected  In 2005  143 039 taxpayers were impacted by the AMT      There are two factors behind the growth of the AMT and the unfair squeeze it s placing on middle class families AMT  the fact that the AMT was not indexed for inflation and the Bush tax cuts  In the 109th and 110th Congress  Kerry has introduced legislation that would fix the AMT by increasing the AMT exemption amount so the tax affects the wealthiest Americans instead of middle class families  Kerrys legislation also allows education tax credits and dependent care credit against the AMT  Kerrys legislation is revenue neutral because it is offset by repealing the extension of the lower capital gains and dividends rates for 2009 and 2010  This legislation makes the point that the capital gains rate should not have been extended for 2009 and 2010 until the AMT was addressed for 2007      Below are Kerrys remarks as prepared for delivery to the Committee       This is an extremely important issue that will touch more than 23 million taxpayers in 2007 if it is not addressed  Under this scenario  in my home state of Massachusetts the individual AMT will affect 24 percent of taxpayers      There may be disagreement among us concerning the impact the 2001  2004 tax cuts had on the AMT  I would have preferred that in the context of the 2001 tax bill that we exempted taxpayers with income less than  100 000 from the AMT rather than increasing the exemption amount  but I did not have the votes  I believe the growth of the AMT is due both to the fact the AMT was not indexed for inflation and the tax cuts  Even though we may disagree on the cause of the growth  we can all agree that it should be addressed and that the AMT no longer serves its original purpose  My preference is that we work together to find a bipartisan  fiscally responsible and permanent solution which simplifies the tax code      The AMT is no longer a tax designed to target wealthy taxpayers that avoid taxation  The title of this hearing refers to the AMT as a stealth tax because taxpayers are not aware of it and are caught off guard  I think it can also be referred to as the family tax  Nina Olson  National Taxpayer Advocate  describes the AMT as penalizing taxpayers for such class tax avoidance behavior as having children or living in a high tax state  We should not have a tax system that punishes families for having children      Often the AMT is referred to as an issue that does not impact hard working families and it has more of an impact on wealthy investors  This is not true  Let me tell you about two individuals who testified before the Ways and Means Committee       Maggie Rauh from Springfield  Massachusetts is a wife and mother of three young children  She has a Masters Degree in Taxation and has been in the tax field for over 17 years  She periodically checks her tax refund to predict the amount   Savings is difficult and she relies on her refund for extras  a new computer or a family vacation  She was dumbfounded to find for 2007 that her refund would be decreased by over  1 300  She and her husband do not itemize and there is no way to plan around the AMT  They pay the AMT because of taking five personal exemptions  one for each child and one for her and her husband      Michael Day from Maryland is a firefighter and is married with three children  Next year  he will be impacted by the AMT and he is certainly not the type of taxpayer that was in mind when the AMT was created      I will continue to fight for legislation to fix the AMT before it unfairly hits more families  and thank my colleagues for their work on this issue
