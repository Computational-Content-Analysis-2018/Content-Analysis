Study  Publicize Climate Change Impacts on Everyday Life    WASHINGTON D C   Senators John Kerry and Olympia Snowe introduced the Global Change Research Improvement Act of 2007 today  to change the way federal agencies prioritize  collect and communicate information on climate change science and impacts  Kerry and Snowe are updating the Global Change Research Act of 1990 in a response to a series of new reports on climate change  which call for an expedited process to review the impacts of climate change on our communities  local economies and natural resources    The senators bill directly responds to updated global climate information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  as well as a number of recent reports critical of the Bush Administrations climate science program   found that the Administrations Climate Change Science Program is not adequately assessing the impacts of climate change  particularly at the regional or local level  or communicating that information to decision makers and stakeholders  The  that climate change will have a significant impact on federal land and water resources  but resource managers do not have the guidance or information they need to prepare for those impacts  A recent Federal District court ruling confirmed these reports  citing the Administrations failure to comply with its mandate to provide regular assessments of the impacts of climate change on critical resources    We cant fight tomorrows climate crisis with yesterdays research  said Senator Kerry  The Bush Administration has failed in its responsibility to conduct research and inform the American people about the impacts of climate change  Our bill will ensure the American people can learn the real story of the climate crisiss effect on our neighborhoods  businesses and families  I want to thank Senator Snowe for her work on this bill  and for pushing for a response to this crisis that matches the urgent warnings we receive every day    Since the Global Change Research Act of 1990 was enacted  there have been numerous developments in earth sciences  global observing systems  and satellite and computing technologies that have greatly advanced our countrys ability to understand the effects of global warming  said Senator Snowe  I am pleased to be working with Senator John Kerry on this legislation that is critical to improving upon the success of previous global warming research programs and expanding our nations ability to predict  mitigate  and adapt to the global warming crisis   Highlights of the Global Change Research Improvement Act of 2007   The Global Change Research Improvement Act of 2007 amends and strengthens the existing U S  climate change research and assessment program  The bill would improve the basic research and products that the Federal government develops on climate change and its impacts  It would refocus the emphasis of the program on the need to provide information and products that are of relevance to State  local and nongovernmental decision makers  It would also create a new National Climate Service within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  to provide climate change forecasting on a regular basis to end users  and create a permanent network for the delivery of such information    The Global Change Research Program  GCRP   our nations existing climate research and assessment program  was established by the Global Change Research Act of 1990  The overall program has seen its budget steadily decline since FY 2004 at a time when the need to better understand and predict climate change is urgent  Over the past several years  independent reports  including a review by the National Academy of Sciences have highlighted weaknesses and gaps in the current implementation of the GCRP  A Federal District Court found that the current Administration had failed to comply with the statutes mandate to provide regular assessments of the impacts of climate change on critical resources  no such assessment has been published since October 31  2000    The legislation makes important changes to address these weaknesses and to strengthen the mandate to provide assessments  These changes will enable the GCRP to perform critical climate observations and research on climate systems  improve our ability to predict climate impacts at national  regional and local levels  and communicate those impacts in a timely and useful fashion to State and local decision makers  resource managers  and other stakeholders
