Kerry and Edward Kennedy  with Congressmen Michael Capuano and Stephen Lynch  today announced that the omnibus appropriations bill approved by Congress contains  106 244 300 in federal assistance for the metro Boston area  Statewide  Massachusetts initiatives received a total of more than  236 million  The Consolidated Appropriations Act  2008 will fund 15 cabinet agencies and other federal agencies for Fiscal Year 2008  It includes the following appropriations bills  Agriculture  Commerce Justice State  Energy Water  Foreign Operations  Interior  Labor Health and Human Services Education  Legislative Branch  Transportation Treasury  and Veterans Administration Housing and Urban Development  The bill now goes to the Presidents desk for his signature  This is a victory for crucial economic development projects throughout the region  From transportation to health care to social services to education  this money will help make a difference in the quality of life of those who live and work in metro Boston  said Senator Kerry  By making these investments in our communities  we are investing in our states economic future  and that is why Senator Kennedy and Congressmen Capuano and Lynch and I fight each year to secure federal funding for these initiatives that make a real local impact  In Massachusetts  we re enormously proud of our world class hospitals  research centers and universities  They lead the nation and the world in improving the lives of our citizens  said Senator Kennedy  These federal investments are vital to the people of metro Boston  and our whole Commonwealth  so that Massachusetts will stay at the forefront of the global economy  and future generations can reach their full potential  These initiatives will have a direct impact on the people of the 8th District  from generating jobs and economic growth to improving the health and safety of our constituents  especially our young people  Many of these projects are also a critical part of our efforts to ensure that Massachusetts remains the leader in life sciences research  said Congressman Capuano  I am very pleased that this bill will bring much needed federal dollars to the towns of the 9th Congressional District  While many of our towns are struggling with budget shortages  our goal was to address a variety of important needs  said Congressman Lynch  Senator Kennedy  Senator Kerry and I have worked together to see that these funds are allocated to maximize the benefits  not only to the Ninth Congressional District  but to all of Massachusetts  The economic benefits  the infrastructure improvements  the public safety upgrades  and greater access to health care are all important initiatives that I am proud to support  The City of Boston has many projects that are slated to receive funding  I applaud the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation for securing targeted funds for the City of Boston  These appropriations will help us fight crime  improve infrastrucure and expand access to community services  Mayor Menino said  This funding is a bright spot in a budget that continues to fall short on funding for domestic programs because of pressure from the administration to fund other priorities  I am proud of our Congressional Delegation for working hard in trying to get a federal budget that is more in line with our local needs such as public safety  education  housing and health care  YouthBuild  a program that works high risk  is another project that will receive funding  We are grateful but not surprised that once again Senator Kerry has organized and influenced his colleagues to increase the appropriation for YouthBuild by 18 5  above the Presidents budget number so that out of school low income youth can complete their education while building homes for the homeless  Senator Kerry has been a passionate champion of YouthBuild students since 1992  said Dorothy Stoneman  Founder and President of YouthBuild  Federal assistance in
