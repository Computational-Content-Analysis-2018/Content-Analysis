Kerry today honored two Massachusetts students for their exemplary volunteer service  Alyssa Bickoff  an 8th grader from Brookline and David Poritz  a high school senior from Amherst  were named Massachusetts honorees in the 2007 Prudential Spirit of Community awards program  The senator hosted the two outstanding students in his Washington  D C  office while they were in town to receive their awards         Kerry entered the following statement about both Bickoff and Poritz into the Congressional Record today     MR  KERRY  Mr  President  today it is my pleasure to congratulate and honor two young Massachusetts students who have achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities  Alyssa Bickoff of Brookline and David Poritz of Amherst have been named State honorees in the 2007 Prudential Spirit of Community awards program  One high school student and one middle school student from each state are honored annually        Alyssa Bickoff  an eighth grader at Solomon Schechter Day School in Newton  is being honored for her efforts in raising nearly  25 000 to help find a cure for ALS  or Lou Gehrig s disease   Alyssa s father lost a best friend to the neuromuscular disease  which motivated her commitment to help raise money to fund the research necessary to find a cure   Alyssa raised this money by selling specially inscribed wristbands and participating in fund raising walks   The money that Alyssa raised has been used not only to fund research  but has also purchased wheelchairs and mobility items for patients   Alyssa s story is a true example of hope for a brighter America        David Poritz  a senior at Amherst Regional High School  is recognized for founding a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping communities adversely affected by oil contamination in the Amazon River basin of Ecuador   David researched cases involving oil contamination in Ecuador   He spent a month learning to speak Spanish fluently  and then organized a drive throughout New England collecting 12 500 pairs of shoes for children in Ecuador   Since then  David s organization  Esperanza International  Inc   has raised money to furnish educational materials to impoverished schools  and provide medical supplies and support to local clinics   He has guided groups of student and teachers to the Ecuadorian jungle  spoken with Ecuadorian cancer patients  and served as a liaison for doctors and other medical specialists visiting the area   David believes in the importance of reaching out and helping those in need   His attitude and dedication to help the people of Ecuador is highly commendable and inspiring to other young Americans        Mr  President  in light of numerous statistics that indicate that Americans today are less involved in their communities than they once were  it s vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions both of these young people have made   People of all ages need to think about how we  as individual citizens  can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods   Young volunteers like David and Alyssa are inspiring examples to all of us  and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow        The program that brought these young role models to our attention   The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards   was created by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School principals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critically important and highly values  and to inspire other young people to follow their example   Over the past 11 years  the program has become the nation s largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service  and has honored more than 75 000 young volunteers at the local  state and national level        Both Alyssa Bickoff and David Poritz should be extremely proud to have been signaled out from the thousands of dedicated volunteers who participated in this year s program   As part of their recognition  they will come to Washington in early May  along with 100 other 2007 Spirit of Community honorees from across the country  for several days of special events  including visits to their Senators  offices on Capitol Hill          I applaud both of them for their initiative in seeking to make their communities better places to live  and for the positive impact they have had on the lives of others   I also would like to salute other young people in my state who were named Distinguished Finalists by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards for their outstanding volunteer service   They are  Matthew Chase of Dover Sherborn High School in Dover  Kelsey Chisholm of Lynnfield High School in Lynnfield  Cieu Lan Dong of Cambridge  Elizabeth Handel of Needham High School in Needham  Gregg Katz of Nipmuc Regional High School in Upton  and Courtney Mota  Dighton Rehoboth Regional High School of Rehoboth        Mr  President  all of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today s world  and deserve our sincere admiration and respect   Their actions show that young Americans can   and do   play important roles in their communities  and that America s community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future                                                                                    20510
