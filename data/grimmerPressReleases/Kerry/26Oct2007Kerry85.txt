John Kerry  D Mass    pressed for more information about Blackwater USAs alleged tax evasion  The private security firm has been under fire for hiding behind a Bush Administration business size ruling that classified some of their workers as independent contractors rather than employees to avoid paying at least  31 million in taxes  As a senior member of the Finance Committee  Kerry sent a letter to the Committees leadership requesting an investigation be conducted into Blackwaters tax filings    Kerry  also Chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship  called on Blackwater to explain their decision to use the Small Business Administrations  SBA  classification of their employees for tax purposes  Earlier this week  Kerry asked the SBA to provide documentation on any rulings made on Blackwater  In a letter to Kerry  SBA Administrator Steven Preston wrote  SBAs size determinations are solely for the purposes of ascertaining eligibility for our small business programs and have no applicability to tax liability matters    The text of the letters sent to the Senators Max Baucus  D Mont    and Charles Grassley  R Iowa   Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance and to Mr  Erik Prince  Chairman of Prince Group  the parent company of Blackwater USA  are below    October 26  2007  The Honorable Max Baucus   Chairman   Committee on Finance   219 Dirksen Senate Office Building   Washington  DC 20510    The Honorable Charles Grassley  Ranking Member  Committee on Finance  219 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510    Dear Senators Baucus and Grassley    Earlier in the week  I sent a letter to Small Business Administrator Stephen C  Preston regarding a press release issued by Blackwater Worldwide in response to House Committee on Oversight and Government Chairmans Waxman inquiry about possible tax evasion by Blackwater Security Consulting  LLC  The letter inquired about the following statement by Blackwater  The U S  Small Business Administration has determined in an official finding applying the criteria used by the IRS for Federal income purpose  that Blackwater security contractors are not employees    I received a prompt response from SBA Administrator Preston indicating that the Small Business Administration issued a size determination regarding Presidential Airways  an affiliate of Blackwater  As expected  the letter states that SBAs size determinations are solely for the purpose of ascertaining eligibility for our small business programs and have no applicability to tax liability matters    I am troubled that Blackwater erroneously and inappropriately relied on an SBA size determination for the classification of its workers  SBA incorporates IRS tax criteria as an element in whether personnel are employees for determination of size  In March 2007  the IRS issued a letter to Blackwater ruling that it improperly misclassified a security guard in Afghanistan as an independent contractor  I am concerned that Blackwater is misclassifying its personnel for tax purposes    Since the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over revenue matters generally  I request that our Committee conduct an investigation of Blackwater to determine if they are evading taxes due to the erroneous misclassification of workers  I share your concerns about the tax gap and believe that the misclassification of workers is a contributing factor and that it is an issue which the Finance Committee should address    I am enclosing for your reference the letter I sent to the SBA and the response  In addition  I am enclosing a letter that I sent to Blackwater inquiring why they relied upon a SBA size determination for tax purposes    Thank you in advance for consideration of this important issue  Please keep me apprised of actions on this issue and let me know if you need any additional information from the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship    Sincerely    John F  Kerry  Chairman   October 26  2007   Mr  Erik Prince Chairman  The Prince Group  1650 Tyson Boulevard  Suite 800  McLean  VA 22102   Dear Mr  Prince    Earlier in the week  I sent a letter to

purposes an explanation of the chain of command of Blackwater workers who are deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan  and the status of any IRS audit of Blackwater and any related companies    Thank you in advance for your cooperation    Sincerely   John F  Kerry  Chairman                                                                         20510
