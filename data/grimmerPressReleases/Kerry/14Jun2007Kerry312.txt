Senator John Kerry delivered remarks at Johns Hopkins University National Security Symposium with the American Security Project  on fighting terrorism and how we can make our country safer  Kerry addressed the current debate of are we safer now than after 9 11 and laid out his argument for new framework for defeating terrorists  addressing head on the ways in which the policy in Iraq has hurt us in this effort  Below are his remarks  as prepared  The American Security Project has a simple goalto restore bipartisan  real thinking about Americas security interests and to communicate those interests directly to the American people  And what weve all witnessed just over the last two weeks has been a case study in exactly why we need the American Security Project  The debate over Americas security has focused on a single question  Are we safer now  today than we were on 9 11  This is a classic campaign over simplification  Its the wrong question to ask because 1  its subject to different interpretations and 2  it tells you nothing about the future  Some can answer yes of course were safer because of increased airport security  a revamped FBI  and improved intelligence coordination  Others will say no and point to an increase in nuclear weapons  failing states  jihadists  and violent anti Americanism  And you know what  Theyre all right  Are we individually safer  In certain situations  yes  But are we collectively  as a country  more secure  Profoundly not  But the question that we ought to be debating  the question that America needs us to wrestle with  is not are we safer than we were the day the Twin Towers fell  The real question is  nearly six years after 9 11  are we as safe as we should be  And what must the next president do to get us there  This much is clear  We are not yet doing all that we should be  We are clearly losing ground in the fight against terrorists worldwide  We have created more terrorists than we have killed  We are more isolated internationally  We are more divided domestically  And more than at any time in modern history  our forces are stretched to the breaking point  The question of our present state of security is not simply an academic one  designed for think tank analysis  Its the essential challenge before our country today  Americans deserve    and policy makers must demand    a better debateand thats precisely why the American Security Project was founded  In recent years  Washingtons preferred currency for discussing national security has too often been cleverly sculpted sound bites  full of simplistic sloganeering  and calculated to scare peoplenot inform them  Often light on strategic thinking  sometimes light on truth  these sound bites  or slogans  are geared to polarize and obscure rather than galvanize and inform  It is no surprise that six months after the invasion of Iraq  7 in 10 Americans believed that Saddam Hussein was personally involved in 9 11  That didnt happen by accident  and it provides a window into the poverty of our political discourse and our failure to communicate reality to the American people  We have to do a better job  We cannot accept a dialogue thatwillingly or otherwiseobscures the reality of the threats we face and drowns out the real choices for making America safer  The truth is that at a time of historic challenge  our struggle remains strikingly ill defined  We are long overdue for a strategy that offers better answers to such basic questions as who  precisely  are we fighting  What is the nature of the battle  What is our strategy for victory  What role can our military effectively play  How important is Americas moral authority in this struggle  How will we isolate radical Muslim extremists from the world instead of having them isolate us from our own allies  The truth is also that far too much of what has been said and written in recent years about the fight against terrorists has been based on several dangerous misconceptions  Building a winning strategy requires us to expose and discard some of the faulty thinking that has undermined our efforts  What are these myths and misconceptions  There are four principal fallacies that led us into this disastrous war in Iraqand one that is still being used to justify our presence there today  The most obvious is the notion that defeating terrorists is primarily a military effort focused on nation states  The phrase war on terror purposefully brings to mind troops deployed to fight armies in battle  And this very mindset tempted the Administration to choose traditional targets like Iraq instead of hunting down non state actors in Afghanistan  In fact  we now know that some in Don Rumsfelds Pentagon initially considered bombing Iraq first instead of Afghanistan because military planners couldnt find enough Taliban targets to bomba vivid illustration of the flaws of an exclusively military driven  state centered approach divorced from the actual threats we faced then and still face today  Make no mistake  the military clearly has a role to play    sometimes even against another government  Exhibit A is Afghanistan    where we were right  and we were unified  in overthrowing a regime that harbored the terrorists who attacked our homeland  But this is the exception  Dont take my word for it  Theres a reason why the Armys own counterinsurgency manual written by General Petraeus makes clear that using massive military force risks playing into our enemies hands  And Osama Bin Laden himself has declared that his strategy is to provoke and bait the United States into protracted bleeding wars that drain our resources and our national will while painting us as the aggressor in the eyes of the Muslim world  Hes gotten exactly what he wanted in Iraq  And we know that conventional military force is not the most effective way to destroy terrorists hiding out in sovereign nations  Getting that job done largely falls to our intelligence agencies and special operations forces  and it will always hinge on coordination with countries where terrorists hide  exactly the areas in which we are the least equipped to work effectively  Why does that matter  Because make no mistake  if an attack on America is ever hatched in a Pakistani neighborhood in London  we wont be bombing Buckingham Palacewell be working with MI5 to hunt down the perpetrators  Fortunately  the American Security Projects own survey shows that the American people are way ahead of the narrow Washington political debate  most Americans now believe that the war on terror will be won primarily through the aggressive use of intelligence and law enforcement  They believe that Military force should be used in a limited and precise way  Theyre just looking for an honest dialogue about how to get there  The second misconception  driven largely by political expediencyis that top Al Qaeda leaders like Bin Laden dont really matter  Eliminating them wont end the terrorist threat  But Osama Bin Laden  alive and well  stands as a monument to the world that extremists can escape and defy the most powerful nation on earth  And this madman continues to inspire  if not plan  more attacks  So we must redouble our efforts to deny al Qaeda leaders sanctuary in the lawless tribal areas  starting by asking more from Pakistan in return for the billions of dollars of counterterrorism aid  We cannot allow failure to simply be explained away   not in Islamabad  and certainly not in Washington  The third fallacy is the simplistic notion that all those extremists who hate us are fundamentally similar  Sun Tzu said  if you know yourself but not the enemy  for every victory gained you will also suffer a setback  Our failure to appreciate the difference between a secular dictator and a religious terrorist led us into an invasion of Iraq that diverted our attention from those that attacked us  Even today  many politicians lump together dozens of competing factions into an undifferentiated they that includes Sunni and Shia  religious and secular  friends and sworn enemies alike  Weve got to know our enemy in order to defeat them  Fourth  it is a misconception that torturing prisoners  as we saw at Abu Ghraib  and detaining them indefinitely  as we are now at Guantanamo Bay  are effective ways of fighting terrorism  In fact they define the word counterproductive  Just this week  a federal appeals court struck down part of the Presidents detainee policy as having and Im quoting judges heredisastrous consequences for the Constitution and the country  It should disturb all of us that a proposal to double Guantanamo is considered red meat for Republican primary voters  Our military leaders tell us that torture does not yield better intelligence  And as Colin Powell has said  the world is beginning to doubt the moral authority of our fight against terrorismour most precious asset in winning the war of ideas  The final and currently most pressing misconception is that by fighting the enemy in Iraq  we will not have to fight them here  This is a dangerous illusion  and a false choice of epic proportions  The National Intelligence Estimate warned that Iraq has become a primary recruiting tool for terrorists worldwide  The CIA recently put it simply  our presence in Iraq is creating more members of Al Qaeda than we are killing in Iraq  In fact  our current strategy in Iraq today rests on circular logic  were staying there to prevent the very chaos and failed state that we uncorked by going there  Were staying to prevent what they are succeeding in doing because we are there  We have to break this cycle  Taken together  what do these misconceptions tell us  For one thing  that Iraq is a case study for how not to defeat the terrorists  We diverted resources from the hunt for Bin Laden to invade Iraq  which had no operational ties to Al Qaeda  We diverted our attention from North Korea  which had nuclear weapons  and Iran  which is closer to acquiring them  to be consumed by Iraq  which had no weapons of mass destruction  Once we were there  we underestimated the insurgency  and lost the trust of the Iraqi people by failing to grasp the moral and non military dimensions of our mission  Now we find ourselves stuck  refereeing a bloody Iraqi civil war that no American army  no matter how brave and skillful  cannot resolve  Every day that we continue on this same path is a day that we play into the terrorists hands  Bin Laden has stated that he wants to subject America to what the Soviets experienced in Afghanistan  Only it turns out that our bleeding war isnt in Afghanistanits in Iraq  To begin fighting terrorism more effectively  we need a change course in Iraq  And we ought to start by listening to General Petraeus  to every other military commander  to the Secretary of State and even to the President himself  They have all told us that there is no military solution to the violence in Iraq  There is only a political solution  Despite the Presidents escalation of the war ostensibly to provide breathing room for Iraqi politicians  its now clear that were unlikely to see any substantive political progress before the end of this year  Kurds are blocking the oil law  Shiites are blocking plans to reintegrate Baathists into the government  Sunnis are demanding broad revisions to the Constitution  If Iraqi politicians fail to deliver  then those Republicans in Congress who are giving the Iraqis until September to make real political progress should be prepared to join Democrats in helping to end this war  The fact is that no American soldier should die for an Iraqi government that cannotor will notdo its part  Instead of bringing Iraq together  this government has become little more than a fig leaf for Iraqi politicians to pursue sectarian interests  If were serious about a political solution  we need a fresh start  Prime Minister Maliki should immediately fire all ministers not committed to political reconciliation and replace them with those who are  And the governing coalition should be realigned to isolate extremists and empower moderates  We must also leverage Prime Minister Malikis personal political future by making it clear that this truly is his last chance  If shaking up the government does not produce meaningful political progress in short order  if Maliki proves unwilling or unable to deliver results  a new leader should be given a chance  But obviously a successful strategy for defeating terrorists involves more than just seeking resolution in Iraq  We need a comprehensive new approach to the entire region and the notion of a war on terror  Many of our best thinkers in the private sector and the Pentagon now speak of fighting terrorism as a global counterinsurgency The goal of counterinsurgency operations is far more than just killing insurgents  Ultimate success depends on winning over the local population and isolating the extremists  Applied to global terrorism  this leads us to focus on winning a global information war  and turning the street against Al Qaeda wherever they seek a base of operations  As weve seen in Iraq  this struggle cannot be won by military means alone  Again  its the Armys new counterinsurgency manual that tells us the more force used  the less effective it is  Successful counterinsurgency relies on every tool in our national arsenaleconomic  political  military   and perhaps most importantly recognizes the power of our ideas  Its the Tip ONeill doctrine applied to a dangerous world  successfully fighting a global counterinsurgency recognizes that  just like politics  all terrorism is local  That means looking beyond catch all phrases like Islamo Fascism that obscure more than they illuminate  After all  Al Qaeda is  as the theorist David Kilcullen says  sixty different groups in sixty different countries who all have different objectives  We must be prepared to respond each situation differently  to adapt as our opponent adapts  and to tailor our response to the local conditions that give rise to terrorism  In some places  that means local development projects and television broadcasts  In others  it means visits to sheikhs in their tents andwhen necessaryit means firing Cruise missiles at high value targets  Some policymakers like to say we need to stay on the offensive against the terrorists  They tend to equate offense with military force  But we must never forget that we are fighting a battle within Islam for the hearts and minds of Muslims everywhere  Al Qaeda understands that we are fighting an information war  they quadrupled their output of propaganda videos last year and take advantage of some 4 500 different jihadi websites  And we know that Al Qaedas  2  Ayman al Zawahiri  urged Al Qaeda in Iraq to stop mass murdering Shia civilians because he worried it would hurt Al Qaedas reputation among moderate Sunnis  Today the sobering reality is that  in many quarters  we are losing a public relations battle to a gang of cave dwelling mass murderers  Hezbollah understands that we are fighting an information war  After provoking Israel into a war last summer  do you know what Hezbollah did  They marked with their party flags all the houses that had been damagedclaiming them for Hezbollah to fix  As David Kilcullen said  thats not a reconstruction operationits an information operation  To succeed in this arena  we must regain our moral authority  Our actions matter more than our words  no Madison Avenue PR firm or public diplomacy czar can make the Arab world forget Abu Ghraib  This self defeating tendency continues today at Guantanamowhich has become a catchphrase in every language for the perceived lawlessness of Americas fight against terrorists  These policies amount to a unilateral disarmament in the war of ideas  Understanding todays struggle as a global counterinsurgency makes clear the dangers of attacking Iran  At a debate last week  most of the Republican candidates seemed almost eager to use nuclear weapons preemptively  We can hope that this was political posturing  but just this weekend  Senator Lieberman advocated military strikes into Iran to disrupt insurgent networks  We all understand the threat Iran poses to the United States  and to our ally Israel  None of us accept the prospect of a nuclear armed Iran  But my guess is Osama Bin Laden would love to see us bomb Iran  because it would stoke anti Americanism  because it would weaken moderates everywhere  because it would unite the Islamic world against us  These are the outcomes which smart  thoughtful  careful planning can help us avoid  My hope is that we can expose the misconceptions that have led us astrayand replace them with a better frame for understanding the threat we face  That is a primary mission of the American Security Project  to foster a national security dialogue worthy of our best traditions  and to shape a policy to tackle todays challenges that is equal to the statecraft that led us through yesterdays  Five years into the Cold War  a Democratic President and a Republican Congress had already worked closely together to create a sustainable strategy for winning the Cold War  We had the Truman Doctrine  the Marshall Plan  the UN  and the IMF  George Kennans Sources of Soviet Conduct and SAIS founder Paul Nitzes NSC  68 clearly defined the enemy  the battlefield  and the strategy for victory  That generation created a bipartisan foreign policy framework that guided our actions for decades under Democratic and Republican administrations alike  Today  more than five years after 9 11  an effective strategy for fighting terrorism remains elusiveand there is precious little bipartisan trust on which to reach and sustain a truly national consensus  That  my friends  is the tough work ahead of us  Just as getting out of Iraq has proved far more difficult than getting in  rebuilding a new bipartisan foreign policy will prove far more difficult than shattering the old one  But that is what this moment requires of usvision  understanding toward those who hold honest disagreements  clear and critical thinking  and above all honesty with the American people  If we stay true to these principles  then perhaps five years from now  instead of asking are we safer  we can share together in the satisfaction of knowing that all of usDemocrats and Republicans alikehave worked together to do all that we could to make America as safe as it can be
