Backward                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       John Kerry spoke on the Senate floor this afternoon about his opposition to the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA    The remarks that follow are as prepared                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I have supported free trade for the past two decades  That includes NAFTA  the Uruguay Round  China PNTR  and the many bi lateral agreements negotiated by the Clinton and Bush Administrations   I continue to believe that open markets and robust trade will benefit America   s workers  consumers  corporations and ultimately our security            At the same time  we cannot hide from the fact that the benefits of global economic integration bring some very real costs and some very real risks   For a number of years now I have been arguing that Washington must set out a strategy for trade and better prepare America to compete in the global economy           As we know  opening markets sets in motion an economic transition that creates winners and losers   And while we may want to mask that reality in the emotionless language of economics here on the Senate floor  let it be clear that that transition can put hardworking men and women in a very difficult transition as their jobs go overseas  leaving our communities economically crippled   We all know the numbers  since 2001 we have shed nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs and endured 42 consecutive months of economic decline in the manufacturing sector           We have long understood that if we want a broad for consensus for free trade in America  we must make these trade agreements work for more Americans   In the 1990   s we initiated steps to find a better path forward          First  we looked at the trade agreements themselves and decided we must protect American workers from unfair competition   American workers should compete on the basis of pay  skill and effort   but it is unfair to ask American to compete against child labor and habitually depressed wages          In the Jordan agreement of 2001  we set a new standard   We gave basic labor protections the same standing as all the protections we rightly provide corporate America            We made a new bargain with the American worker  we will protect your economic interest   your job  from unconscionable competition like child labor  just as we protect a corporation   s economic interest   its product   from dishonest competition like copyright theft          In CAFTA we go backward from that standard  Once again  our corporations get the protections they need with an elaborate system of rules  complaint  appeal  compensation and strict enforcement           But all our workers get is flowery language with no teeth behind it  We will hear that CAFTA has the strongest labor provision of any trade agreement  That   s good spin   and not much else            It comes down to this   There is only one labor provision in CAFTA that is enforceable   a nation   s commitment to    enforce its own laws             That sounds good  or at least it sounds like something  but in reality this provision does nothing to protect workers because there is no stipulation whatsoever as what those laws are   Moreover  if the provision does lead to an attempt at enforcement  the maximum so called penalty is  15 million   I say    so called penalty    because the fine is then returned to the offending country ostensibly to fix the problem  but without any real enforcement mechanism           The other labor provisions in CAFTA ask a nation    to strive to    eliminate the    worst forms of child labor     sweatshop conditions and other problems   But if a nation fails that meager standard  we can only consult   In other words  we can talk about ending child labor in a CAFTA county  but we cannot act to stop child labor   Words alone aren   t going to do much for the kids suffering in the sweatshops  and the Americans off the job          I ask my colleagues to consider a simple question  why the double standard in favor of corporations   Why do Americans not have the same standing to end child labor or sweatshop conditions that corporations have to end copyright and patent theft   Why the double standard that punishes workers          Mr  President  I and many of my colleagues have a long standing commitment to the development and well being of Central America  and we   re concerned that CAFTA is insufficient to provide for steady and balanced economic growth in the region  The Administration claims that supporting CAFTA is a security issue  I agree   this is a security issue   this is about the economic security of some of the more vulnerable economies in our hemisphere   We must ensure that a trade agreement with Central American countries grows their economies  protects their workers  helps them preserve their sensitive ecosystems  and most importantly  encourages balanced and widespread economic growth and opportunity for all people in the region             The most troubling aspect of CAFTA is that its shortcomings  particularly the Administration   s indifference to workers  are part of a far greater problem           The fundamental issue we must address is the need for a national policy to make sure America is competitive   the leader in the global economy of today and tomorrow   And the reality is the Bush Administration has no comprehensive strategy to meet the needs of a fast changing playing field          What can we do   Certainly  when we negotiate trade deals with nations that have checkered labor records  we must give citizens the same standing to end child labor that corporations have to end copyright and patent theft   It is a pro trade  free trade policy that builds consensus and considers all Americans  yet the Administration refused to do this in CAFTA           After we have agreements in place  we must defend America   s interests   The Administration must stop bowing down to our competitors   The Clinton Administration brought an average of 11 trade cases to the World Trade Organization per year  This Administration has brought 12 total cases in its first four years           The Administration also needs to take action against China   s currency manipulation   This Senate has voted for that  but the Administration refuses          And I want my colleagues to know the truth about the Administration   s recent dealings with China  According to our trade representative     counterfeiting and piracy in China are at epidemic levels    and cost U S  companies  20 25 billion annually   And we   re told the problem is getting worse  not better            But according to press reports  in May the United States presented the Chinese with a list of modest proposals to curtail intellectual property violations   The Chinese rejected our proposal outright   The Administration responded not by pressing the Chinese  but by telling U S  companies to go file lawsuits in Chinese courts to defend their rights   This is absolutely ridiculous   It   s time this Administration enforced our agreements and defended our own businesses and workers          Most of us also heard recently about the Chinese firm seeking to purchase UNOCAL  an American energy company   What many don   t know is that the company borrowed money from the Chinese government to make the bid   That has upset a lot of people and generated a lot of press   as it should  But it should concern us even more that America does the same thing   Since the start of the Bush Administration  the federal government has borrowed billions of dollars to fund our national debt and cover reckless tax and fiscal policies   and billions of dollars have been borrowed from none other than the Chinese government          Mr  President  we should also be concerned about the missed opportunities related to Trade Adjustment Assistance   This Senate has supported Trade Adjustment Assistance and tried to expand coverage to service workers and communities   We did this because we understood that the movement to open markets means economic transition  Unfortunately  the Bush Administration doesn   t seem to understand   They have ignored the will of the entire Finance Committee on this issue  who voted to include TAA for service workers in the CAFTA Agreement          In the Commerce Committee  Senator Ensign held an excellent hearing on America   s competitiveness   Our Administration witness was the President   s point person on manufacturing  Al Frink  He told us that he believes there is a shortage of skilled workers in America that is hurting our economy   What the Undersecretary did not say  or maybe did not know  is that the Bush Administration has resisted Congressional efforts to fund worker retraining and vocational education            The Administration   s indifference to competitiveness goes further   We have a tax policy that rewards American and multi national companies for housing operations abroad instead of in the U S   It   s hard to imagine a more backwards tax policy  We should end it  but for this Administration it   s not a priority   it   s not even an afterthought          We also don   t adequately fund the basic science and research that will produce the revolutionary technologies and products of tomorrow   Not surprisingly  fewer and fewer American kids are choosing to study science and engineering   And the Bush Administration has proposed cutting federal research and development spending for the first time in ten years           The story is much the same in our public schools   Bill Gates has called our high schools    obsolete    because they fail to prepare our kids to compete    Alan Greenspan said much the same thing before the Finance Committee last week  And yet every year the Administration refuses to fund No Child Left Behind   seeming perfectly content to leave millions of kids behind          And while we sit here  the Administration foolishly negotiating trade deals that are indifferent to our workers and fail to defend our interests  refusing to adequately invest science  research and training  and ignoring problems that drain our business like health care  the competition is hard at work          While our short sighted policies stunt our competitive advantage  China  India  all of Asia and Europe have developed long term plans and strategies aimed at one thing  eliminating America   s economic dominance   They have national programs aimed at educating workers  reducing capital costs and attracting businesses           In the Commerce Committee we heard how Japan and the EU are implementing large scale  long range R projects aimed at developing leading edge commercial technologies   For example  from 1995 through 2001  the emerging economies of China  South Korea  and Taiwan increased their investments in research and development by approximately 140 percent          It is urgent that we consider real measures to advance America   s competitiveness and forge a new global consensus on trade   It begins with a set of rules that make sense to American workers   rules that work for them   even as we open new markets which we must do   We can do better and we need to          The bottom line is this  CAFTA is not a good deal for America    The Administration has turned a blind eye toward America   s workers   I won   t do that  and I hope my colleagues won   t either            Instead  we should stand solidly for free trade   and more importantly demand a national policy to compete in the global economy on terms that are fair to all Americans   I believe America can stay at the top while making trade fair for Americans whether they spend their day working the boardroom or the factory floor   I believe we can make trade work of all Americans   CAFTA  unfortunately  does not work for working Americans  and I hope my colleagues will join me in standing up for America   s future and voting against it
