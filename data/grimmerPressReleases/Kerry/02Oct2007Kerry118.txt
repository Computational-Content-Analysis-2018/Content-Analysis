Kerry announced today that this afternoon the Senate unanimously approved the resolution he introduced condemning the harsh military crackdown on Buddhist monks and pro democracy protestors in Burma  Sen  Kerry spoke out on the Senate floor last week in strong support of the Burmese people and the monks who had risked their lives demanding a return to democracy  The resolution marks the first official action Congress has taken in the wake of the violent crackdown on protestors that began last week     The world must send a clear message to the junta in Burma that it is unacceptable to respond to non violent protestors with bullets  tear gas and beatings  Ultimately the only solution for Burma can be found in a political dialogue that begins with tolerance and mutual respect  Kerry said  I hope that this resolution and the Senates unanimous strong condemnation reminds the Burmese junta that the United States speaks with one voice against this brutal military regime and that we stand united in support of long overdue dialogue towards national reconciliation and the return of democracy      The Kerry McConnell bi partisan resolution calls for the release of Nobel prize winter Aung Sang Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners  the suspension of military assistance from China  pressures Burmas ruling junta to engage in dialogue with opposition leaders  argues that the U S  and the United Nations encourage China  India  and Russia to use their influence to convince Burma to engage in dialogue towards national reconciliation  and urges the international community to pressure Burma to lift all restrictions on humanitarian aid delivery and allow international humanitarian aid organizations to work unimpeded      Last night  the Senate strongly condemned the violent repression of those seeking democracy in Burma  said Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R  Biden  Jr   D DE   But our condemnation alone wont change anything in Burma  What is needed now is for the international community to bring pressure on the Generals who run Burma to hand over power to a civilian government  Burmas neighbors  China  India and Thailand  hold the key to a peaceful transition in Burma  We should work with them to bring about change      The text of Kerrys resolution is below      Expressing the Sense of the Senate on the situation in Burma     110th CONGRESS    1st Session    S  RES  ______     Mr  Kerry  for himself  Mr  McConnell  Mr  Biden  Mr  Lugar  Mrs  Boxer  Mr  Dodd  Mr  Durbin  Mr  Coleman  Mr  Feingold  Mr  Kennedy  Mr  Menendez  Mrs  Feinstein  Mr  Reid  Mr  Levin  Mr  Hagel  Mr  McCain  Mr  Schumer  Mr  Casey  Mrs  Clinton  Mr  Obama  Mr  Cardin  Mr  Bingaman  Mr  Brownback  and Mr  Sununu  submitted the following resolution  which was referred to the Committee on     Whereas  hundreds of thousands of Burmese citizens  including thousands of Buddhist monks and students  engaged in peaceful demonstrations against the policies of the ruling State Peace and Development Council  SPDC   demanding that the State Peace and Development Council release all political prisoners  including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi  and urging that the government agree to a meaningful tripartite dialogue with Suu Kyi  the National League for Democracy  NLD   and the ethnic minorities towards national reconciliation      Whereas  the State Peace and Development Council violently dispersed the peaceful demonstrators  killing at least 10  and reportedly more than 200  unarmed protesters  including a number of monks and a Japanese journalist  and arrested hundreds of others  and continues to forcibly suppress peaceful protests      Whereas  the National League for Democracy won a majority of seats in the parliamentary elections of 1990  but the State Peace and Development Council refused to uphold the results or to negotiate a transition to civilian rule and subsequently placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest      Whereas  Aung San Suu Kyi has spent most of the past 18 years under house arrest or in jail  and is currently being held in government custody  cut off from her followers and the international community      Whereas  59 world leaders  including 3 former presidents of the United States  have called on the State Peace and Development Council to release Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners      Whereas  the State Peace and Development Council has destroyed more than 3 000 villages  systematically and violently repressed ethnic minorities  displaced approximately 2 000 000 Burmese people  and arrested approximately 1 300 individuals for expressing critical opinions      Whereas  the U S  Department of States 2006 Reports on Human Rights Practices found that Burmas junta routinely restrict its citizens freedoms of speech  press  assembly  association  religion  movement  and traffics in persons  discriminates against women and ethnic minorities  forcibly recruits child soldiers and child labor  and commits other serious violations of human rights  including extrajudicial killings  custodial deaths  disappearances  rape  torture  abuse of prisoners and detainees  and the imprisonment of citizens arbitrarily for political motives      Whereas  the Government of Burma relies heavily on the unconditional military and economic assistance provided by Peoples Republic of China      Whereas  on September 30  2006  the United Nationals Security Council officially included Burma on its agenda for the first time      Whereas  on January 13  2007  China and Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council Resolution calling Burma to release all political prisoners  allow a more inclusive political process and unhindered humanitarian access  and end human rights abuses  and on September 26  2007  China blocked a Security Council Statement from condemning the State Peace and Development Council crackdown against the peaceful demonstrators      Whereas  the prevalence of tuberculosis in Burma  with nearly 97 000 new cases detected annually  is among the highest in the world  malaria is the leading cause of morality in Burma  with 70 percent of the population living in areas at risk  at least 37 000 died of HIV AIDS in Burma in 2005  and over 600 000 are currently infected  and the World Health Organization has ranked Burmas health sector as 190th out of 191 nations      Whereas  the failure of the State Peace and Development Council to respect the human rights and meet the most basic humanitarian needs of the Burmese people has not only caused enormous suffering inside Burma  but also driven hundreds of thousands of Burmese citizens to seek refuge in neighboring countries  creating a threat to regional peace and stability  and      Whereas  the State Peace and Development Council continues to restrict the access and freedom of movement of international humanitarian organizations to deliver aid throughout Burma  Now therefore  be it     Resolved  That it is the Sense of the Senate       1  to strongly condemn the use of violence against peaceful protestors in Burma  and to call on the Government of Burma to refrain from further violence  release the demonstrators it has arrested  immediately cease attacks against ethnic minorities  release Aung Sang Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners  and begging a meaningful tripartite political dialogue with Suu Kyi  the National League for Democracy  and the ethnic minorities       2  to call on the Peoples Republic of China to remove objections to efforts by the United Nations Security Council to condemn the actions taken by the Government of Burma against the peaceful demonstrators       3  to call on the Peoples Republic of China and all other nations that have provided military assistance to the Government of Burma to suspend such assistance until civilian democratic rule is restored to Burma       4  that the Government of Burma should engage in a peaceful dialogue with opposition leaders and ethnic minorities to implement political  economic  and humanitarian reforms that will improve the living conditions of the Burmese people and lead to the restoration of civilian democratic rule       5  to recognize and welcome the many constructive statements issued by various nations  and particularly the statement issued by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on September 27  2007  which demanded an immediate end to violence in Burma  the release of all political prisoners  and a political solution to the crisis       6  that the United States and the United Nationals should strongly encourage China  India  and Russia to modify their position on Burma and use their influence to convince the Government of Burma to engage in dialogue with opposition leaders and ethnic minorities towards national reconciliation      7  to support the United Nations mission to Burma lead by Ibrahim Gambari  and to call on the Government of Burma to allow the mission freedom of movement and access to top government leaders in order to prevent additional violence and to further peaceful dialogue towards national reconciliation  and     8  that the United States should work with the international community to pressure the Government of Burma to lift all restrictions on humanitarian aid delivery and then allow international humanitarian aid organizations to work to alleviate suffering and improve living conditions for the most vulnerable populations
