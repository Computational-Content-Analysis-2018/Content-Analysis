                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  For everyone  the issue of stem cell research is deeply personal and fundamentally moral  We each dread getting a call from a doctor with the results of a diagnosis that makes our heart sink  or the day we say goodbye to a loved one       I ll never forget a woman I met last fall at a town hall meeting on stem cell research  She stood up  her frail body shaking  and pleaded for her government to embrace stem cell research  It was the moral clarity of her message that will stay with me forever          It s too late for me    she said    but we need to do this for those who still have hope         It s not too late for 13 year  old Garrett Burgess of Chelmsford  paralyzed at the age of 5  who traveled to all 50 states with his father to make the case for stem cell research his doctors believe hold the promise that he can one day walk again       In Massachusetts  we need to think of this moral challenge as Gov  Mitt Romney decides whether to sign or veto landmark legislation to allow research that holds out hope for millions  It s a question of our values as a state and a people  and these questions should never be answered lightly   but they must be answered       More than 100 million Americans suffer from illnesses that one day might be wiped away with stem cell therapy  Stem cells could replace damaged heart cells or cells destroyed by cancer  offering a new lease on life to those with a diagnosis that once came with a death sentence  Stem cells have the power to slow the loss of a grandmother s memory  calm the hand of an uncle with Parkinson s  save a child from a lifetime of daily insulin shots or permanently lift a best friend from a wheelchair       Some of the most pioneering cures and treatments are now right at our fingertips  but because of politics they could remain beyond reach       Nationally  America has been losing its lead in science  Our share of industrial patents is down  our share of Nobel prizes is down  our published research is down and the number of doctorates in the sciences is down       This is not the way we do things in Massachusetts  We re a state of discovery   a place where innovators and optimists are free to dream and explore  Where government encourages creativity and entrepreneurship instead of stifling it  Where we re always pushing the boundaries of knowledge       This hasn t just been a story of scientific imagination  but of political imagination   from leaders at every step who recognized the hope and possibilities of science to save lives       And that s why this groundbreaking legislation on stem cell research must become law  Every day that we wait  more than 3 000 Americans die from diseases that may someday be treatable because of stem cell research       We must make funding for this research a priority  Above all  we must look to the future not with fear  but with the hope and the faith that advances in science will advance our highest ideals       Progress has always brought with it the worry that we have gone too far  Some questioned the morality of heart transplants  We heard the same kind of arguments against biotech research that now saves stroke victims and leukemia patients       The question is no different on stem cell research  People of good will and good sense can resolve the ethical issues without stopping lifesaving research  There s already bipartisan support in the U S  Senate to ban human cloning and allow therapeutic cloning to advance  This issue transcends political labels  That s why Sen  Orrin Hatch  R Utah  and Nancy Reagan refuse to tie the hands of doctors and oppose restrictions on lifesaving research       It should be no different in our state  Massachusetts has long led the country in great discoveries  always upholding the highest standards  ensuring our breakthroughs and our beliefs go hand in hand  And when it comes to stem cell research  policymakers have worked to find common ground and draw strict and appropriate ethical guidelines  and they ve succeeded       I hope that Romney signs this bill and makes it clear that in Massachusetts  we say yes to knowledge  yes to discovery and yes to leading a new era of hope for all
