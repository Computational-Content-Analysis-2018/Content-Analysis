Senator John Kerry responded to President George Bushs comments on the State Childrens Health Insurance Plan  S CHIP  and the Administrations health tax proposals  A member of the Senate Finance Committee  Kerry is joining with bipartisan colleagues to renew and strengthen the S CHIP program  Today  nine million kids are uninsured in America  with two thirds of them fully eligible for S CHIP or Medicaid  but not yet enrolled     The White House doesnt want Americans to know that Washington has failed to enroll nine million children for health insurance they desperately need and deserve  said Kerry  The Democratic Congress intends to pass bipartisan legislation this year that brings quality coverage to as many eligible children as possible  and the White House seems willing to say just about anything to block progress       While the President pretends theres a risk of too many kids getting health insurance  we know from nonpartisan reports that Bushs plan to cut S CHIP would actually result in millions of low income kids losing coverage  Americans could care less about petty debating points or partisanship when it comes to making sure Americas kids can go see a doctor and receive medical care  The President needs to stop being a master of misdirection  and start working with Congress to complete the business of protecting our kids        According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  the Bush Administrations S CHIP proposal would dramatically decrease the amount of low income children with health insurance  The S CHIP program is a solid bipartisan issue  It was passed by a Republican Congress  has been implemented and expanded at the state level by more Republican Governors than Democrats  and is championed by many Republicans in Congress today     The text of Kerrys letter is below     June 28  2007     President Bush   The White House   1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W    Washington  DC 20500   Dear Mr  President     I was deeply concerned to hear your remarks yesterday at the White House regarding health care reform  While I appreciate your attention to one of our nations most urgent domestic priorities  I fear that your proposed solutions stand in the way of much needed progress for our nations low income  uninsured children      Particularly troubling to me were your comments on the successful  bipartisan State Childrens Health Insurance Program  S CHIP   As you know  S CHIP is a federal state partnership that was created by the Republican Congress in 1997  It has been implemented at the state level by more Republican Governors than Democratic Governors and continues to enjoy support from both political parties at all levels of government  Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue said it best when he stated  It s  increased funding for S CHIP  a matter of doing the right thing  It s nonpartisan  It s bipartisan  For these reasons  I was surprised to hear you speak of S CHIP in the context of a so called larger strategy by the Democrats to put more power in the hands of government  In fact  most states administer their S CHIP programs using private health plans  Regardless  S CHIP should not be viewed as a divide when  in fact  leaders from both sides of the aisle in Congress are working together to craft legislation that would sensibly strengthen S CHIP and bring new coverage to millions of our most vulnerable children      You also argued that bipartisan efforts to reauthorize S CHIP represent a massive expansion of government health care  Many of us in Congress would like to see action to ensure quality  affordable health coverage for every one of the 9 million uninsured children in America today  not through government health care but through proven  successful federal state partnerships like S CHIP and Medicaid  While it is clear that we are limited by our nations constrained fiscal situation  my colleagues and I are focused on reinvesting in these partnerships to reach as many of the 6 million children who are currently eligible for S CHIP or Medicaid but remain uninsured  I am sure you would agree that we have a moral obligation to see that all of our nations children  especially the most vulnerable at the bottom of the income scale  have access to quality  affordable health coverage      We certainly agree with you that it makes sense to have a program to help poor children get the health insurance they need  We have such a program  it is working  and it deserves to be reauthorized and strengthened further  This should be the focus of Congress and your administration  I hope that your efforts to pursue controversial tax proposals do not signal a retreat from your commitment to see that states provide more coverage for our uninsured citizens  S CHIP must not become a political football  it is far too important to our states and to our low income children and families across the country     Sincerely     John F  Kerry
