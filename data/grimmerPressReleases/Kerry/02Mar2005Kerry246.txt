will temporarily become capital of Red Sox Nation  The Sox will be honored at the White House for their World Series victory  and one of the greatest players in the game s history Jackie Robinson will be honored for his contributions to our nation on and off the field       But Robinson  as great as he was  was denied the opportunity to play for the Red Sox  We all know the emotional story of his tryout  refused the chance to join the Red Sox because of the color of his skin  Racism was a stain on our national pastime  and it wasn t until Robinson broke baseball s color line with the Brooklyn Dodgers that the work of racial healing could begin       Robinson s legacy lives on  and his contributions to history go beyond the ballfield  His fight for racial equality was so profound that the Rev  Martin Luther King Jr  called him  a legend and a symbol in his own time  who  challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration        Before playing professional baseball  Robinson joined the US Army in 1942 and rose to the rank of second lieutenant  Although the Army was segregated  Robinson  with the assistance of friend and fellow service member Joe Lewis  the champion boxer  succeeded in gaining admittance to Officer Candidate School       In July 1944  Robinson was ordered to sit in the back of a bus traveling through Texas  He refused and was court martialed  Robinson fought the charge and was finally exonerated when the order was ruled a violation of Army regulations       After playing one year with the Kansas City Monarchs  a Negro League baseball team  and one year with the minor league Montreal Royals  Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 to become the first African American to play in Major League Baseball  He was immediately confronted with bigotry  Dodgers president Branch Rickey wrote that Robinson  was the target of racial epithets and flying cleats  of hate letters and death threats  of pitchers throwing at his head and legs  and catchers spitting on his shoes        For some Americans it may be hard to understand the significance of Robinson playing in the big leagues  But Robinson broke that color barrier before our military was desegregated  before the civil rights marches in the South  before some of our major universities admitted African Americans  and before the historic ruling in Brown v  Board of Education  Robinson not only persevered  he was great  He went on to win rookie of the year  a most valuable player award  six pennants  a World Series  and induction into the Hall of Fame in 1962  He was a leader within the NAACP  a co founder of the FreedomNational Bank in Harlem  founder of the Jackie Robinson Construction Co  to build low income housing  and an active member of church groups and community organizations       Through the courage of his actions  Robinson engaged Americans in a constructive conversation about race long before the momentous events of the 1960s  He was a true pioneer  His life is a testament to how the struggle for equality has many fronts in America  It is carried on in Congress  in statehouses  on campuses  at the office  on the factory floor  across our kitchen tables  and even on the ballfield  The work continues today  to honor hard work and the dream of a better life  to give every child the best possible start in life  to end the worry of all the mothers and fathers who fear that their children may become casualties of unsafe streets  and to stop the hollowing out of American cities       Robinson once said   A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives   Robinson not only impacted lives  he impacted the very spirit of our country  He is more than a sports hero he is an American hero       For his contribution to civil rights in America  Congress will honor Jackie Robinson with the Congressional Gold Medal today  We hope all Americans will take a moment to appreciate him  recognizing that just as his memory endures  the work of civil rights and equal opportunity is far from over          Rachel Robinson is the widow of Jackie Robinson  John F  Kerry is the Senate sponsor of the bill awarding Jackie
