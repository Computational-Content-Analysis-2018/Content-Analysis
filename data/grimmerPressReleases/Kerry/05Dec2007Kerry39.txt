Winning Strategy in Afghanistan

John Kerry  D Mass   Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East and South and Central Asian Affairs  which includes Afghanistan  delivered a major policy speech on Afghanistan today  Kerry laid out new policies to rescue the NATO mission in Afghanistan and help build a stable country  Kerry called for more troops  a change in mission to help reduce civilian casualties and a new policy to address the growing opium crisis  He also called for an Afghanistan Study Group  Kerry delivered his speech at the Johns Hopkins University Paul H  Nitze School of Advanced International Studies  SAIS   Below are his remarks as prepared  Thanks for coming out on such a snowy day  Its a privilege to be back at SAIS  an institution thats left its mark on every corner of the world and every advance in American foreign policy since the dawn of the Cold War  In the days after World War Two  men like George Kennan and Paul Nitzewho founded this institutionunderstood that defeating communism required more than a collection of ad hoc tactics  They understood the need for a comprehensive long term strategy  and they set about creating the doctrines that America and its allies followed for decades to come  In that same spirit  I came here last June to advocate a new strategy for meeting our generations great challenge  terrorism  I called for replacing todays mismanaged war on terror with a global counterinsurgency effort that places military action in its proper context alongside our moral authority and diplomatic persuasion  Regrettably  that remains an elusive goal  Worse still  lost amid the chaos of Iraq  there is another dangerously overlooked U S  engagement that  in stark contrast to Iraq  still enjoys the support of the American people  a genuine coalition of the willing of 37 nations contributing half the troops  and a fledgling government that has shown clear signs of being capable of getting it right  That mission  of course  is in Afghanistan  which  right next door to a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and to the crisis of Pakistan  remainsas it always wasthe true frontline of the struggle against terrorism  I dont need to remind you whats at stake  The very same people that attacked us on 9 11 are still there  right where we left them  Our nations own National Intelligence Estimate warned us this July that the Taliban and Al Qaeda have reconstituted themselves on the Afghan Pakistan border and are planning more attacks on our homeland  Just yesterday  a senior official warned that we are seeing early indicators that there may be some stepped up activity by al Qaeda in Afghanistan  Also at stake in Afghanistan is the viability of NATO itselfour best chance to share our security burden as it takes on its first mission out of theater and evolves to face new threats  As General James L Jones said  If we dont succeed in Afghanistan  youre sending a very clear message to the terrorist organizations that the U S   the U N   and the 37 countries with troops on the ground can be defeated  You may agree or disagree with the sweeping breadth of this conclusion  but any sound judgment must determine that our core mission is to foster a stable  self governing Afghanistan  free from the Talibans tyranny and Al Qaedas terror  This will take years  but we cant afford to fail  Today we risk repeating the classic mistake that dooms many  perhaps most  counterinsurgencies  a failure to appreciate the difference between tactical success and a winning strategy  The fatal consequence  all too familiar to those of us who lived through Vietnam  is that you win every battle  but fail to win the war  Absent a new focus and a transformation  we are on pace to do just that in Afghanistan  And despite the evidence of thoughtful observers  we are witnessing an alarming lack of urgency from the Administration and some of our allies  The first step in turning the tide is an honest assessment of where we stand  which is why I joined several other senators in proposing a non partisan Afghanistan Study Group  There are already a number of comprehensive assessments underway by outside experts  so it shouldnt take long for our government to complete one and create a baseline for future judgments  Heres what I see  On the positive side  allied troops in Afghanistan are doing a magnificent job when engaging the enemy  The American general responsible for training Afghan soldiers tells us that every significant combat engagement this year has ended in a very decisive defeat of the Taliban  The Afghan National Army is itself something of a success story as well  The Karzai governmentdespite its limited capacity and struggles with corruptionis making a good faith effort at democratic governance in a country whose agrarian economy  tribal affinities  and war torn history present daunting challenges  Most of all  the Afghan people have shown unmistakable signs of wanting a peaceful  modern state  Their patience is finite  but they still support our presence  In the end  theyre our most important ally and asset  and thats why we must immediately shift to a strategy that makes their allegiance to our common causemore than any Taliban body countthe real measure of our success  The bottom line is that  on the current course  were losing ground in Afghanistan  The Taliban and Al Qaeda have regrouped along the Afghan Pakistan border  currently hold large swathes of territory  and are expanding their reach into regions that havent seen the Taliban since 2001  ever closer to the capital city and NATO stronghold of Kabul  Violence is at its highest levels since the invasion  Between 2001 and 2005  there were 5 suicide bombings in Afghanistan  There were 77 in the first six months of this year alone  Reconstruction efforts have stalled  and Oxfam is reporting humanitarian conditions rarely seen outside sub Saharan Africa  Opium cultivation has soared to 93  of the worlds market  Meanwhile  the weak central government lacks the capacity to wage a nationwide counterinsurgency  So  faced with these realities  what do we need to do to get Afghanistan right  First  we need to implement a comprehensive strategy that focuses as much on good governance and reconstruction as it does on kinetic military operations  Victory in a counterinsurgency is measured not just in enemies killed but also in kilowatt hours of electricity delivered  in citizens ability to get justice without paying bribes  in allies won and enemies not made  We must begin winning these battles in a way that also helps us win the war  We should move forward with our eyes wide open  remembering the lessons of Afghanistans history  No foreign power has ever remained welcome in Afghanistan for a sustained period of time  and we all know that empires like the British and the Soviets paid a bitter price for trying  The Soviets invaded with 100 000 troops  bled their army dry  and left humiliated  Why  In part because they killed over a million Afghans and fundamentally alienated the Afghan people  Our goal has never been to dominate Afghanistanbut rather to empower the Afghans to govern their own country in line with their own best interests and our own national security  Nonetheless  we shouldnt delude ourselves into thinking that we are in anything but a race against time in a region suspicious of foreign footprints  Time is not on our side  Clearly  some military steps are necessary to make our crucial non military efforts successful and sustainable  And the most obvious is providing sufficient numbers of troops to stabilize a deteriorating security situation  Ive spoken with top military officials who have emphasized to me just how thinly stretched our troops are in southern and eastern Afghanistan  Unquestionably  if we want to clear  hold  and buildwhich is what you do in a counterinsurgencywe need more boots on the ground  It may seem counterintuitive  but we also need more troops to make our overall counterinsurgency effort ultimately depend less on the use of military force  During the first half of 2007  while the Administration escalated troop levels in Iraq  there were four times as many air strikes in Afghanistan as there were in Iraq  Thats because  without enough troops  we were forced to rely more on air operations against the Taliban and Al Qaeda  Inevitably  that results in excessive civilian casualties that only serve to inflame public opinion in the Muslim world and facilitate recruitment for jihadists  In southwestern Afghanistan  support for NATO forces has plummeted from 83  a year ago to 45  this year  due in large part to civilian casualties  Just last week in Nuristan Province  coalition planes acting on faulty intelligence are said to have bombed and killed 14 Afghan civilians asleep in their tents  The men were a construction crew building roads  We cannot allow warplanes to be the leading edge of our presence in Afghanistan  Thats a recipe for winning the battle and losing the war  In the first half of 2007  the UN estimates that Afghan government and international forces killed 314 civilians while 279 were killed by insurgents  Each civilian deathhowever unintentionalrisks a blood feud and could turn an entire clan or village against us  Our troops on the ground are doing a heroic job with the resources theyve been given to fight an enemy that often hides among civilians  Ultimately  minimizing civilian casualties is a matter of strategic prioritieswhich can be driven by setting policies like a soldiers rules of engagement  To that end  retired Army General Barry McCaffrey recently called for a goal of zero innocent civilian casualtieseven where this means Taliban units escape destruction by hiding among the people  General Dan McNeill  who commands NATO forces in Afghanistan  has asked for 5 000 more troops  and we should make sure he gets them  We need to lean hard on our NATO allies to pull their weight by expanding their current troop commitments and make sure the job gets done  NATO should reach out to Muslim partners in the Mediterranean Dialoguecountries like Algeria  Egypt  Jordan  Morocco  and Tunisia  We also need the right kind of troops  including Special Forces  civil affairs forces  translators  and trainers  We cant win with a duct tape approach  patching up crises as they arise  Our troop presence needs to be the glue that holds the country together so that reconstruction is given a fighting chance  We also need to work to convince our allies to lift counterproductive restrictions on their troops  General McNeill keeps a chart on the wall of his office with a sea of yellow and red blocks  each showing the restrictions that national governments have placed on the forces he commands  Red blocks show tasks a country wont do  like hunting Taliban and Al Qaeda troops  and yellow blocks show missions a country is willing to consider  but only after asking their capitals for permission  Meanwhile  American  British  Canadian  and Dutch troops face the most intense fighting because they are the only countries deployed in the south  All our best efforts will come to naught if we cant convince the Europeans that this isnt just another of George Bushs wars  Their populations remain deeply skeptical of this Administrations adventuresno matter how legitimate the cause  We have to persuade our allies that a broader strategy focused on good governance and reconstruction to help the long suffering Afghan people  not just counterterrorism  deserves a bigger commitment  They need to know the challenge to NATO is real  with real implications for each of their countries  Empowering the Afghan National Army is also an imperative  Just yesterday  senior Afghan military officials pleaded with Secretary Gates for more weapons  armored vehicles  and planes  We should be increasing training and mentoring through Operational Mentor Liaison Teams  giving the Afghans the equipment theyve asked for and increasing funding for salaries to build on our fragile success  Today a new foot soldier in the Afghan National Army receives the equivalent of  100 a month from the government  The Taliban has been known to pay three times that much  Youre not going to win this by buying peoples loyalty  but the other guys can win if they practice better politics on the ground  It would be an epic failure if we lost the hearts and minds of able bodied Afghan fighters because we were only willing to build an army on the cheap  At every turn  we must constantly be aware of the synergy between military and non military strategies  We cant afford to achieve one crucial goal at the others expense  Theres a story about a school we built early on in the Afghan war to show there was a better future than what the Taliban offered  A year or two later  the Taliban overran the area  and started using the school as a base of operations  Eventually  despite our best intentions  our military had no choice but to bomb the school wed built for Afghan children  It was a painful lesson  Theres no reconstruction without securityand theres no real security without reconstruction  Security is an essential preconditionbut ultimately our success depends on bolstering a government that provides basic services to people all across the country and enforces the rule of law  Lets be honest about the challenge we face on this front  Afghanistan now ranks  8 in Foreign Policy magazines Failed States Index  just behind the Democratic Republic of Congo  We dont have a prayer of succeeding unless that index is rapidly changed for the better  Frankly  what Afghanistan needs most is what the President once famously declared he doesnt do  nation building  In parts of Afghanistan  there is a shooting war going on today  But everywhere theres a larger struggle underway for the future  Sarah Chayes  an American living in Kandahar  recently wrote  Proper conduct of government is the best antidote to the Taliban  General Karl Eikenberry put it this way  Wherever the road ends  thats where the Taliban starts  Thats why our generals are asking for more reconstruction funds to win over the local populationand thats why we should give it to them  Its incredible that Iraq has received five times the assistance of Afghanistan despite Afghanistans roughly equal population  larger territory  and more stable aid environment  Moreover  far too little of our money in Afghanistan has gone to reconstruction  The same year the President promised a Marshall Plan for Afghanistan  the country received less per capita assistance than post conflict states like Bosnia  Haiti  and Kosovo  We cannot continue to fake even ourselves out with our own rhetoric  After cutting aid by 38  in 2006  Washington hopes to spend  9 billion in aid to Afghanistan  but most of this money will go to security assistance  not development or reconstruction  This despite glaring shortcomings in our development effort  In a country with an economy thats 80  rural  one senior American commander said  Even as our military force grew in Afghanistan last year  he could count on the fingers of one or two hands the number of U S  government agricultural experts  The bottom line is we could use those missing experts  because its crucial that we find a smarter way to deal with Afghanistans skyrocketing opium production  Opium exports constitute 1 3 to  of Afghanistans GDPand despite our spending  1 6 billion since 2001 on counter narcotics operations  production rose by 17  in 2007  Opium money funds criminal networks tied to the Taliban  but it also feeds farmers across the country  One farmer told an American reporter  I know the opium is turned into drugs that destroy young people  and I am sorry  but we are twenty people and we have no help  We must grow it to survive  If we get help we wont grow it next year  Like illegal drugs everywhere  right now opium is extremely profitable  If a farmer gets 33 dollars from an acre of wheat and between 500 and 700 from an acre of poppies  hes going to feel obliged to grow poppies  Instead of just punishing farmers  we should be subsidizing viable crop alternatives to opium  If we send planes to eradicate that mans fieldsas the Soviets didwe create new recruits for the Taliban and more Afghans who want to kill Americans  Eradication has often worked at cross purposes with our larger goals by alienating the local populace  It has come at the expense of other pillars of our policy that deserve greater emphasis  alternative development  interdiction  judicial reform  and public information  Thats why we should shift our attention toward the processing labs and traffickers  and make sure the Karzai government does its part and targets police chiefs  tribal leaders and even governors who are part of the problem  Otherwise todays narco economy can metastasize into a narco state like weve seen in South America  I dont expect to see wheat fields sprouting up across Afghanistan overnight  but we should be using our full arsenal  not just force  to wean farmers off the opium industry  And make no mistake  there is no solution to the poppy problem and no stabilizing Afghanistan without demanding that Afghan leaders themselves enforce a deeper commitment to the rule of lawand then helping them do so  Today Afghanistan lacks judges  lawyers  and an effective police force  Judges ask for a fortune for a positive verdict  Customs agents expect kickbacks  Cops kidnap people for ransom  Corruption is endemic  and we need to devote more resources to governance at the local levels and in the countryside  We should push Karzai to reform the Ministry of Interior and the National Police  At the same time  we should more vigorously support efforts to educate and empower women  protect them under tougher laws  and bring them into the political process  An illegitimate and isolated central government in Kabul would be the surest way to undo all our best effortsand drive the people into the hands of the Taliban  It doesnt have to be this way  We should be putting the Afghan government and people at the center of our reconstruction effortsnot US based private contractors  Afghanistan remains among the worlds poorest countries  Life expectancy at birth is only 43 years  20  of children die before the age of 5  What better way to win hearts and minds than to save a childs life  Unemployment is estimated at around 40  and adult literacy at 28   What better way to prevent men from joining the Taliban than to offer them a peaceful way to support their families  To date  the international communitys reconstruction and development response has been disjointed  Military and civilian components remain segregated  There are 25 Provisional Reconstruction teams  of radically different sizes and capabilities  with different countries in charge of each one  Until now  there has not been a single authority to coordinate the various components of a very complex mission  Im very glad to hear that talks are now underway to appoint Paddy Ashdown as a joint UN NATO envoy  This should improve coordination among the international community and with the Afghan government  He should have a broad mandate  and the backing necessary to tackle Afghanistans myriad and interrelated problems  Finally  we must recognize that Afghanistan cannot be fully stabilized unless Pakistan and others fully join the effort  As long as the Taliban and Al Qaeda have a sanctuary right next door  weve got a problemand so do the people giving them sanctuary  80  of suicide bombers in Afghanistan now originate in Pakistan  We should bolster efforts to root out extremists in the tribal areasin part by supporting a frontier corps made up of local tribesmen who know the terrain  At the same time  we should ensure that our  750 million aid package actually reaches the people we seek to influence  As we seek to spread economic opportunity  we should push the Pakistani government to do the same and also integrate these areas into national political life  Pakistan also needs to be part of a regional dialogue designed to help stabilize Afghanistan  It is no secret that real tensions exist between Presidents Musharraf and Karzai  We have to redouble our efforts to bring about cooperation between these two governments  You cant have a free flow of extremists along their wide open border  This cooperation must be one of the central tasks of our diplomacy today  Both Pakistans and Afghanistans futures depend on it  Pakistan fears India is trying to improve relations with the Karzai government at its expense  U S  and international community efforts to build trust between these two neighbors  including in Kashmir  could go a long way towards relieving Pakistans need to hedge its bets in Afghanistan  Ultimately  Pakistan must make a strategic decision to support a stable Afghanistan  Ultimately  a Pakistan headed down the path of civilian democracy is best equipped to deal with extremism  It is in our vital security interest to help foster a government with the strength and legitimacy to fight terror  Now that Musharraf has taken off his uniform  we must push him to lift the state of emergency  restore the rule of law and judicial independence  free all political prisoners  and hold verifiably free and fair elections consistent with the Constitution  Thats why Joe Biden and I introduced a resolution that calls for the suspension of aid for strategic weapons systems not directly tied to counterterrorism  if Musharraf does not follow through on his promise to take these critical steps toward civilian democracy  We need to look at how the billions of dollars we provide to Pakistan can most effectively advance our interests  Our massive Coalition Support Funds should be reviewed to ensure accountability and transparency  At the same time  less than 10  of our aid goes to development and humanitarian assistance  We should target more of our aid to projects that directly help the Pakistani people  Getting Afghanistan right is important in itself  but its also part of a larger challenge our country faces  This Administration has devoted far more resources to destroying regimes than to building their successors  This is the case not just in Iraq and Afghanistan  but also in Somalia  where we helped the Ethiopians overrun an Islamist government harboring high level Al Qaeda targets  We changed the regime  but the result has been a humanitarian crisis said to be worse today than Darfur  and not only did we fail to capture the terroristsweve created a vacuum in which they can run amok  Replacing a rogue regime with no regime at all is costly  unpredictable  and far short of the strategic victory were seeking when we risk American blood and spend American treasure to shore up the soft spots in our globalized world  The reality is we may be unable or unwilling to achieve strong  unified governments in complex societies that traditionally have been held together only by despotism and local ties  We need to support allies like Hamid Karzai and work from the top down to create strong national institutionsnot just democracy and human rights but also all the trappings of good governance  We must also get better at working from the bottom up  co opting tribes in places like Helmand in the south and the lawless tribal areas of Northwest Pakistan  As we work to support central governments  we cant put the cart before the horse  In these societies  real authority often comes at the tribal level  and we need to engage there to empower individuals  create security for them  and win people  families  villages  and tribes over to our side and against the terrorists  Its worth remembering  Thats what made the first Loya Jirga  LOY a JUR gah  after the fall of the Taliban successful  Military force will be only a small part of this equation  This is painstaking work that takes on many different faces in different circumstances  But it happens to be our bestreally  onlyhope to contain and eventually defeat the forces of extremism that today are gaining strength and recruits from our own self inflicted wounds  If this all sounds complicated  thats because it is  But if weve learned anything over the years since 9 11 its that the challenge we face doesnt lend itself to simple slogans and solutions  Those often create more complications than they solve  Frankly  weve had about as much of a shoot first  think later  pay tomorrow approach as our budget and our Army  not to mention the region  can stand  Its time for comprehensive  dedicated  thoughtful diplomacy  One of todays preeminent thinkers on counterinsurgency  David Kilcullen  wrote a piece called 28 Articles offering advice for a recruit struggling to make sense of Iraq and Afghanistan  His suggestions range from how to treat children in a war zone to how to train local forces  His final admonition  above all else  is this  Whatever else you do  keep the initiative  In Afghanistan today  we havent lost the warbut we have lost the initiative  and we need to recover it  150 years ago  the British could lose a military campaign in Afghanistan in September and word wouldnt get back to London until spring  They had a very good excuse  Messengers couldnt get through the mountain passes until the snow melted  We have no excuse today for failing to take quick and dramatic action to correct a situation that is rapidly deteriorating  When Colin Powell spoke at SAIS 60th anniversary three years ago  he told a great story hed heard about the 2004 Afghan elections  In one of the outlying provinces  a bridge had been blown so that people couldnt reach the polling station  As Secretary Powell said  People came to the destroyed bridge and they walked along the bank until they could find a ford  and they crossed the icy water to get to a polling station  That was Afghanistan 3 years ago  Despite the heroic efforts of our troops and of Afghans like the ones who crossed the river that day  weve moved backwards since that hopeful dayaway from the stable democracy we promised and toward the failed state turned Al Qaeda safe haven that harbored the killers who struck us on 9 11  With a new approach  we can finally make good on the many promises we made to the Afghan people back in 2001and the promise we made to the American people of a safer world  Thank you                                                                              20510                                                                                                                                                                                          Contact           Sitemap
