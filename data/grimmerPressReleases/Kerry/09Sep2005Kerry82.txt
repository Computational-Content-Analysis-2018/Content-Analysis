that more than 400 000 jobs will be lost as a result of Hurricane Katrina  Senator John F  Kerry  D Mass   today unveiled a package of emergency economic aid and federal assistance for small businesses and others reeling from the destruction in the Gulf Coast          It is clear that our government failed the people of the Gulf Coast   In time  those responsible will be held accountable for what has gone right and what has gone wrong   Right now  we need to make up for lost time and help any way we can  and that means targeting the fastest relief possible     said Senator Kerry     Every small business we can help will help a hard working family start to put the pieces of their lives back together   We should help small businesses rebuild themselves and these communities          Senator Kerry is the Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business Committee   He will offer this small business related relief package today with his colleague Mary Landrieu  D La   as an amendment to the Commerce  Justice  Science Appropriations Bill currently pending in the Senate   A vote on the measure is expected next week   Kerry authored a similar assistance package to small businesses recovering in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks       One of the most far reaching pieces of the Kerry relief package will give small businesses across the country access to low interest disaster loans to cope with the increased costs of oil and gas  This will especially benefit farmers  truck drivers and others whose livelihood relies heavily on the price of gas       In addition  the Kerry relief package also provides small businesses in the Gulf Region       Access to short term loans that will be rapidly approved to help businesses that are waiting for SBA loan approval begin rebuilding immediately         A two year assumption of payments and interest on loans provided through the Small Business Administration  SBA  for working capital and fixed asset loans  known as 7 a  and 504 loans  to help small businesses that are unable to make payments with their existing loans          A two year deferral on the interest and payments for SBA disaster loans      Access to 30 percent of all federal contracts and 40 percent of subcontracting dollars      Expanded Historically Underutilized Business Zone  HUBZone  status  which gives small businesses in the area a preference when bidding on federal contracts          Increased counseling and business assistance provided through the SBA   s entrepreneurial development centers  including Small Business Development Centers  SCORE  Women   s Business Centers  and Veterans Business Outreach Centers         Greater opportunities for small construction companies to receive SBA bonding assistance  which is a type of financial loss insurance on the contract         The ability to refinance existing disaster loans and existing business debt with low interest disaster loans      Kerry is offering additional hurricane response legislation  including        Improve Coordination  Planning  and Execution of Disaster Plans   Senator Kerry is offering legislation to improve several steps  including formalizing the National Guard   s role in the homeland security mission  by creating a Standing Joint Task Force commanded by a National Guard officer responsible for coordinating preparedness and response between the national  state and local governments involved  Given the National Guard s unique responsibilities to both federal and state governments  it is well positioned to coordinate the planning and execution of disaster contingencies whether caused by an act of nature or an act of terrorism   Moreover  the Department of Homeland Security currently lacks a deliberative planning process  like that used in the Department of Defense  which is essential for disaster response         FEMA Regional Emergency Evacuation and Preparedness Centers   The response to Hurricane Katrina has revealed serious shortcomings in planning and infrastructure for disaster preparedness and relief   Thousands of displaced Americans are living in sports arenas and National Guard armories   Instead of relying on ad hoc solutions and improvisation  the federal government should establish regional facilities to help prepare the federal response and assist the citizens affected by disasters   whether natural or man made  In the event of disaster  these facilities will provide temporary or  if necessary  long term shelter for displaced persons   Medical supplies and facilities at each site can treat people in need of care   Functional spaces  including the capacity for plug and play data and communications networks will facilitate the provision of all types of disaster relief services       Helping Deployed National Guard and Reserve Troops   Tens of thousands of troops have been called up for service in Afghanistan  Iraq and now the Gulf Coast   Many of these troops are in the National Guard and Reserves  and when they   re called to active duty  they and their employers struggle financially   Senator Kerry   s proposal would provide tax credits to small businesses employers of National Guard and Reserve members called up to help lessen the burden on small businesses  our troops and their families         Help Youth Rebuild Their Communities  YouthBuild is a federal program that helps disadvantaged young people learn responsibility  leadership and a skill by working with their peers to build homes in their communities   YouthBuild is an ideal program to help the young people of the Gulf Coast  who will need employment and whose community has been severely damaged   Senator Kerry strongly believes the recovery effort in the Gulf Coast could be dramatically helped by an expansion of the YouthBuild program in the region  and his legislation expands the program as part of the long term response and recovery effort       Providing Housing as Part of Long Term Recovery  Senator Kerry believes that the federal government should take an active role in the rebuilding of the thousands of homes and apartments destroyed by Hurricane Katrina   Two housing production proposals he has authored are ideally designed to help those in the Gulf region who have lost their homes   First  the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act will create an affordable housing production program for those who most need assistance  Second  the Community Development Homeownership Tax Credit Act will encourage the construction and substantial rehabilitation of approximately 500 000 homes for low  and moderate income families in economically distressed areas over the next 10 years   Both bills can provide critically needed housing and help the long term recovery of the region                                                                                     20510
