responded to President Bush   s Veterans Day political attacks on leaders who have asked questions about the failed prewar intelligence and the war in Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Last week Kerry introduced the Strategy for Success in Iraq Act  which proposes to bring the vast majority of our combat troops home in a reasonable timeframe tied to specific  responsible benchmarks to transfer responsibility to Iraqis   beginning with the draw down of 20 000 U S  troops after successful Iraqi elections in December    Below are Senator Kerry   s remarks  as prepared        Mr  President  Veterans Day is sacred   or it is supposed to be  Veterans Day is a day to honor veterans  not to play attack politics  The President  who is Commander in Chief  should know and respect this          Veterans Day originally marked the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month  when the guns of World War I  the war to end all wars  finally fell silent  Instead of honoring that moment  instead of laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier at Arlington National Cemetery  instead of laying out a clear plan for success in Iraq  the President laid into his critics with an 11th hour rhetorical assault that dishonored America   s veterans and those serving today  even as he continued to distort the truth about his war of choice          Perhaps most striking of all is that his almost desperate sounding Veterans Day attack on those who have told the truth about his distortion was itself accompanied by even more distortion            Does the President think that the many generals  former top administration officials and Senators from his own party who have joined over two thirds of the country in questioning the President s handling of the war in Iraq are all unpatriotic too  This is America  a place where we thrive on healthy democratic debate   The President does not have a monopoly on patriotism  and this is not a country where only those who agree with him support the troops and care about defending our country   No matter what the President says  asking tough questions isn   t pessimism  it   s patriotism   And fighting for the right policy for our troops sends them exactly the right message to the troops  that we take the decision to put them in harm   s way seriously  and that our democracy is alive and well           The President even used the solemn occasion of Veterans Day to continue his campaign of misrepresenting the facts and throwing up smokescreens  His statement that Democrats saw and heard the same intelligence he did is just flat out untrue   unless of course the President and his Administration didn   t do their job and study the additional intelligence given only to them and not the Congress  As the Washington Post put it on Saturday     Bush and his aides had access to much more voluminous intelligence information than lawmakers  who were dependent on the administration to provide the material               But that whole discussion is nothing more than an effort to distract attention from the issue that matters most and can be answered simply  did the Administration go beyond what even the flawed intelligence would support in making the case for war   Did they use obviously inaccurate intelligence despite being told clearly and repeatedly not to   Did they use the claims of known fabricators   The answer in each case is yes   And the only people who are trying to rewrite that history are the President and his Republican allies           There is no greater breach of the public trust than knowingly misleading the country into war   In a democracy  we simply cannot tolerate the abuse of this trust by the government   To the extent this occurred in the lead up to the war in Iraq  those responsible must be held accountable   That is why Democrats have been pushing the Senate Intelligence Committee to complete a thorough and balanced investigation into the issue           When the President tried to pretend on Friday that the Intelligence Committee had already determined that he had not manipulated intelligence and misled the American public  he knew full well that they have not yet reported on that very question    that is why Democrats were forced to shut down the Senate and go into closed session to make the Republicans take this issue seriously   When the President said that his opponents were throwing out false charges  he knew all too well that that these charges are anything but false           But the President and Republicans seem far more interested in confusing the issue and attacking their opponents than getting honest answers   Let   s be clear   there is no question that Americans were misled into war in Iraq   Simply put  they were told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction when he did not   The issue is whether they were misled intentionally   Just as there is a distinction between being wrong and being dishonest  there is a fundamental difference between relying on incorrect intelligence and making statements that you know are not supported by the intelligence            The bottom line is that the President and his Administration did mislead America into war   In fact  the war in Iraq was and remains one of the great acts of misleading and deception in American history   The facts are incontrovertible  The act of misleading was pretending to Americans that they hadn   t made a decision to go to war  and would seriously pursue inspections when the evidence strongly suggests that they had already decided to take out Saddam Hussein  were anxious to do it for ideological reasons  and hoped that inspections  which Vice President Cheney had opposed and tried to prevent  would not get in their way           The President misled America about his intentions and the manner in which he would make his decision  We now know his speech in Cincinnati right before the authorization vote was carefully orchestrated window dressing where again he misled America by promising that    If we have to act  we will take every precaution that is possible  We will plan carefully      He did none of these things           The act of misleading was just going through the motions of inspections while it appears he really couldn   t wait to just kick Saddam Hussein out of power            The act of misleading was pretending to Americans the real concern was weapons of mass destruction when the evidence suggests that his real intent was to finish the job his father wisely refused and remove Saddam Hussein to    remake the Middle East             The act of misleading was saying in his Cincinnati speech that    Approving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable    when the evidence suggests that all along the goal was always to replace Saddam Hussein through an invasion   For most of us in Congress  the goal was to destroy weapons of mass destruction   For President Bush  weapons of mass destruction were just the first public relations means to the end of removing Saddam Hussein   For most of the rest of us  removing Saddam Hussein was incidental to the end of removing any weapons of mass destruction          In fact  the President was misleading America right up until two days before launching his war of choice when he told Americans we had exhausted all other avenues  The truth is that on the Sunday preceding the Tuesday launch of the war  there were offers Security Council members to pursue an alternative to war  but the Administration  in its race to go to war  rebuffed them  saying    the time for diplomacy is over              By shortcutting the inspections process and sidestepping his own promises about planning  coalition building  and patience  the President used WMD as an excuse to rush to war  That was an act of misleading contrary to everything the President told Americans about the walkup to war          The very worst that Members of Congress can be accused of is trusting the intelligence we were selectively given by this Administration  and taking the President at his word  But unlike this Administration  there is absolutely no suggestion that we intentionally went beyond what we were told were the facts   That is the greatest offense by the Administration   Just look at their most compelling justification for war   Saddam   s nuclear program and his connections with Al Qaeda           The facts speak for themselves   The White House has admitted that the President told Congress and the American public in the State of the Union Address that Saddam was attempting to acquire fuel for nuclear weapons despite the fact that the CIA specifically told the Administration three times  in writing and verbally  not to use this intelligence   Obviously  Democrats didn   t get that memo   In fact  similar statements were removed from a prior speech by the President  and Colin Powell refused to use it in his presentation to the UN   This is not relying on faulty intelligence  as Democrats did  it is knowingly  and admittedly  misleading the American public on a key justification for going to war           This is what the Administration was trying so desperately to hide when it attacked Ambassador Wilson and compromised national security by outing his wife   It is shameful that to this day Republicans continue to attack Ambassador Wilson rather than condemning the fact that those sixteen words were ever spoken  and that so many lies were told to cover it up   How are the same Republicans who tried to impeach a President over whether he misled a nation about an affair going to pretend it does not matter if the Administration intentionally misled the country into war           The State of the Union was hardly an isolated event   In fact  it was part of a concerted campaign to twist the intelligence to justify a war they had already decided to fight   Again playing on people   s fears after 9 11  the Administration made statements about the relationship between Al Qaeda and Iraq that went beyond that what the intelligence supported   As recently reported by the New York Times  in a Cincinnati address the President said    we   ve learned that Iraq has trained Al Qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases    despite the fact that the Defense Intelligence Agency had previously concluded that that source was a fabricator            The President went on to say that    Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons    despite the fact that the Air Force disagreed with that conclusion   As the Wall Street Journal reported     the Air Force dissent   was kept secret even as the President publicly made the opposite case   before a congressional vote on the war resolution      That   s two more memos that Congress never got           In fact  when faced with the intelligence community   s consensus conclusion that there was no formal relationship between Saddam and Al Qaeda  the Administration set up their own intelligence shop at DoD to get them some answers better suited to their agenda   Again  there is a fundamental difference between believing incorrect intelligence and making up your own intelligence          Where would Republicans and the President draw the line  No where  How else would 70  of the American public be lead to conclude that Saddam Hussein was involved in 9 11   This was no accident   In fact  I had to correct the President in the first debate when he said it was Saddam Hussein who attacked us  Why else did Vice President Cheney cite intelligence about a meeting between one of the 9 11 hijackers and Iraqis that the intelligence community and the 9 11 Commission concluded never took place   Why else make false statements about Saddam   s ability to launch a chemical or biological weapons attack in under an hour without clearing that with the CIA    which mistrusted the source and refused to include it in the NIE   Why else would they say we would be greeted by liberators when their own intelligence reports said we could be facing a prolonged and determined insurgency  Why else tell Americans that Iraqi oil would pay for the invasion when they had to know that the dilapidated oil infrastructure would never allow that           And what about the President   s promises to Congress that he would work with allies  that he would exhaust all options  that he would not rush to war   If the President wants to use quotes of mine from 2002  he might look at the ones that were not the result of relying faulty intelligence and trusting the President   s word   As I said in my floor statement before the authorization vote     If we go it alone without reason  we risk inflaming an entire region  breeding a new generation of terrorists  a new cadre of anti American zealots  and we will be less secure  not more secure  at the end of the day   Let there be no doubt or confusion about where we stand on this   I will support a multilateral effort to disarm him by force  if we ever exhaust those other options  as the President has promised  but I will not support a unilateral U S  war against Iraq unless that threat is imminent and the multilateral effort has not proven possible              In my speech at Georgetown on the eve of the war  I said     the United States should never go to war because it wants to  the United States should go to war because we have to  And we don t have to until we have exhausted the remedies available  built legitimacy and earned the consent of the American people   We need to make certain that we have not unnecessarily twisted so many arms  created so many reluctant partners  abused the trust of Congress  or strained so many relations  that the longer term and more immediate vital war on terror is made more difficult   I say to the President  show respect for the process of international diplomacy because it is not only right  it can make America stronger   and show the world some appropriate patience in building a genuine coalition  Mr  President  do not rush to war     Today our troops continue to bear the burden of that promise broken by this Administration          We need to move forward with fixing the mess the Administration has created in Iraq  and I have laid out in detail my views about how to accomplish our goals and get our troops home in a reasonable amount of time   But that does not excuse our responsibility to hold the Administration accountable if they knowingly misled the country when American lives were at stake   We can  and we must  do both   And Republicans need to stop pretending it doesn   t matter if the Administration stretched the truth beyond recognition and start working to find the real answers the country deserves   and the real leadership our troops in Iraq deserve from a Commander in Chief  not just a Campaigner in Chief                                                                                         20510
