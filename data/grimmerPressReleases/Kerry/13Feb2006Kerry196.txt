Leaders Call On  Secretary Rice to Address Addiction to Oil in Testimony Tomorrow

before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tomorrow  Senator John Kerry today authored a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on America   s addiction to oil     In the letter  Kerry and other Senators call on Rice to prove wrong the statement by an Exxon Mobil executive last week that America    can   t achieve energy independence    and to develop an honest    February 13  2006     Dear Secretary Rice       In his State of the Union address last week  President Bush stated   America is addicted to oil   and called for the United States to cut Middle East oil imports by 75 percent within 20 years  Yet last week  the President proposed a budget that does not make that important goal a priority and will not make it a reality       Transportation accounts for the greatest amount of America   s oil consumption   If the President were serious about reducing our oil dependency  he would make a major push to reduce this consumption through new technology   Instead  the President   s energy budget actually cuts vehicle energy efficiency research by nearly 9 percent  and his proposed budget in this area is nearly 18 percent lower than the level prescribed in the energy bill he signed just last August   His proposed funding for hydrogen fueled vehicles is barely a third of the total contemplated for FY 2007 by the energy bill   On top of this  at a time of record high natural gas and heating oil prices  the Administration is proposing to cut funds to vital programs that cut pollution and save energy like Energy Star and Building Codes Assistance  help the federal government save energy and tax dollars  and help low income residents save energy with the Weatherization Assistance Program so they can afford their utility bills       An investment in alternative energy sources is also an investment in our national security   Now is the time to invest more  not less  in technologies and practices that promise the quickest  cleanest and cheapest means of addressing tight energy supplies and extraordinarily high prices       Increased American energy dependence further entangles our nation in unstable regions of the world  In exchange for oil  we transfer wealth to autocratic regimes that too often use the United States as the scapegoat for the ills of their nations  This has a real impact on our ability to win the War on Terror   Today  America spends more than  500 000 per minute on foreign oil     30 million per hour  We paid more than  42 billion for Persian Gulf imports alone in 2005  This hinders our efforts to promote democratic reforms and respect for human rights  And our oil dependence makes it all the more difficult to confront countries like Iran  which are emboldened by their oil wealth and influence to defy the international community  It is bad enough that these dollars will not help grow our domestic economy     it is even worse when you consider their impact on our national security       Moreover  we have to protect the foreign oil we depend on for our way of life  In recent years  U S  forces had to help guard the pipeline in Colombia   Our military had to train indigenous forces to protect the pipeline in Georgia   We plan to spend  100 million on a special network of police officers and special forces units to guard oil facilities around the Caspian Sea  and continue to search for bases in Africa so we can protect oil facilities there   Our navy patrols tanker routes in the Indian Ocean  South China Sea  and the western Pacific       The President   s new goal of eliminating 75  of America s oil imports from the Middle East is commendable  but unfortunately there is no Administration plan to achieve it  The bottom line is that the Administration s energy policy works for Saudi Arabia  it works for big oil and gas companies  but it does not work for the American people   In fact  just last week the senior vice president of Exxon Mobil asserted that   This nation can t achieve energy independence     It is simply not feasible in any time period relevant to our discussion today   When you come before the Foreign Relations Committee tomorrow  we would like to hear how America s diplomacy will help prove Exxon Mobil wrong    and support making America energy independent and free us of the consequences of our addiction       Thank you for your attention to our concerns        Sincerely       Senator John Kerry      Senator Jeff Bingaman      Senator Dianne Feinstein      Senator Jack Reed       Senator Maria Cantwell
