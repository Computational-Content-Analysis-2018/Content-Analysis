John Kerry  D MA  today joined his colleagues Senators Olympia Snowe  R ME   Bernie Sanders  I VT   Pete Domenici  R NM   and Charles Schumer  D NY   in introducing legislation to establish a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund  NHTF   which will address the serious housing needs of millions of households     Affordable housing that working people can count on isnt just part of the American Dream  its good for education  healthcare  jobs  and community building  Helping to provide clean  safe  affordable housing is a measurement of our values  and a test of whether government has its priorities in the right place  said Senator John Kerry  This is the year we need to finally get the government back on the side of people trying to make ends meet and provide for their families  and that means we need to do our part to help people put a roof over their heads    Improving the availability of reasonable housing is a priority  Im pleased to support this legislation  and I expect that it will help direct attention and resources toward ensuring that those who need it are able to attain viable housing situations for themselves and their families  said Senator Pete Domenici     Senator Snowe said  Affordable housing is scarce in Maine  as funding has been stagnate for many government programs designed to create housing for low income residents  The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund would provide another avenue of funding to create and rehabilitate additional affordable housing for those who need it the most  including those who are located in rural areas and on reservations  If fully funded  Maine would receive a minimum of  10 million in the first year alone for the development and rehabilitation of housing for those with extremely low incomes  I urge my Senate colleagues to pass this critical legislation    Senator Bernie Sanders  I VT  said In the richest country on the face of the earth it is simply unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying 50 to 60 percent of their limited incomes on housing  It is even worse that millions of others are sleeping in their cars or out on the street because they cannot afford a roof over their heads  Clearly  the passage of the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund is needed now more than ever  Not only would this legislation provide a serious solution to the affordable housing crisis  it would also lead to the creation of decent paying jobs  I look forward to working with Senator Kerry and my other colleagues in the Senate to pass this important piece of legislation as quickly as possible    The National Housing Trust Fund is a dream that many low housing advocates have had for years  We are one step closer to the dream coming true with the introduction of the Kerry Snowe bill to establish a national housing trust fund in the Senate today  The number of people who are homeless and the number of poor families who pay most of their income for their housing have been waiting too long for the federal government to get back in the business of building low cost rental home  Their wait will end when this bill is passed  said Sheila Crowley  President of the National Low Income Housing Coalition    The bill will establish a dedicated funding source for the production  preservation and rehabilitation of 1 5 million affordable homes in 10 years  At least 75  of the funds will be for housing for households that are extremely low income  earning less than 30  of an area s median income    On October 10  the U S  House of Representatives passed H R  2895  the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007  by a strong bipartisan vote of 264 148  The bill was introduced by House Committee on Financial Services Chair Barney Frank  D MA  with 16 bipartisan cosponsors on June 28  Passage was a huge victory for the National Housing Trust Fund  NHTF  Campaign  The Senate and House bills are nearly identical    The need for a National Housing Trust Fund is well documented  Nationwide  there are only 6 187 000 homes renting at prices affordable to the 9 022 000 extremely low income renter households   a shortage of 2 835 000 homes  Not a single Congressional district has enough rental housing affordable and available to extremely low income families  Housing is considered affordable if it costs no more than 30  of household income    Housing trust funds already have been established by more than 600 state and local governments and have proven to be a successful approach to funding affordable housing programs     Senator Kerry introduced bills to establish a National Housing Trust Fund in the 106th  the 107th and the 108th Congresses  In addition  Senator Sanders championed similar legislation when he was a member of the House in the 107th and 108th Congresses    More information about the National Housing Trust Fund Campaign can be found here  www nhtf org
