PROTECT NURSES AGAINST MANDATORY OVERTIME

CONDITIONS FOR NURSES    WASHINGTON D C Today  Senator Kennedy and Senator Kerry introduced legislation aimed at protecting nurses from forced overtime at the demand of their employers  The bill sets strict limits on health care facilities that are requiring nurses to work mandatory overtime  which can put the patients they care for at increased risk  A recent study by the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing found that nurses who work shifts of twelve and a half hours or more are three times more likely to commit errors than nurses who work a standard shift of eight and a half hours or less    The bill will grant the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to investigate complaints from nurses as well as the power to impose a monetary fine for those employers who violate this act     Improving conditions for nurses is an essential part of our ongoing effort to reduce medical errors and improve patient outcomes  But its also a matter of basic fairness and respect  Senator Kennedy said  Nurses perform one of the most difficult and important jobs in our society  They care about their patients and want to provide the best possible treatment  They cannot do their job when theyre exhausted and overworked  Nurses  and the patients they care for  deserve better     Its wrong to overwork our nurses and put such an enormous strain on these hardworking professionals  their co workers and families  Senator Kerry said  Were all human  Just like anyone  the longer and longer a nurse works without rest  the greater the likelihood of making an error  We owe our nurses better than that and this bill responsibly limits mandatory overtime for nurses  Im proud to have worked with Senator Kennedy in introducing this common sense measure     Banning mandatory overtime is about keeping nurses and patients safe  said Cathy Glasson  a registered nurse with 20 years of experience and President of the Nurse Alliance of SEIU Healthcare  Working 16 hour shifts  caring for 8 to 10 patients at a time  these are the conditions that endanger patients and drive nurses to leave the profession  Some states have already ended forced overtime  its time for Congress to stop the practice in every hospital     We face a critical shortage of nurses and the grueling conditions in which nurses are obliged to work jeopardizes the future of this essential profession  The American Hospital Association reports that hospitals needed 118 000 more RNs to fill immediate vacancies in December 2005  This is an 8 5  vacancy rate  and it is expected to rise to 20  in coming years  undermining their ability to provide emergency care  In addition  nearly half a million trained nurses are not currently working in the nursing profession  even though they are desperately needed      Below is a summary of the legislation       THE SAFE NURSING AND PATIENT CARE ACT    Introduced by Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Senator John F  Kerry  110th Congress     The widespread practice of mandatory overtime in the nursing profession means that over worked nurses are often forced to provide care when they are too tired to perform their jobs  While existing government standards limit the hours that pilots  flight attendants  truck drivers  railroad engineers and other professions can work before public safety is endangered  no similar limitation exists for the nations nurses  who care for so many of our most vulnerable citizens     The Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act takes the important step of strictly limiting the ability of providers to force nurses  for fear of losing their jobs  to work beyond their professional opinion of what is safe      The bill would set strict limits on the ability of health facilities to require mandatory overtime from nurses  Nurses would be allowed to continue voluntary overtime at their discretion  but mandatory overtime would be allowed only when an official state of emergency has been declared by the federal  state or local government  These limits would be part of Medicares provider agreements  They would not apply to nursing homes  since alternative staffing and quality measures are being developed for those facilities     To ensure compliance  the bill provides the Department of Health and Human Services with the authority to investigate complaints from nurses about violations  It also grants the Department the power to assess civil monetary penalties of up to  10 000 for violations of the Act  and to increase those fines for patterns of violations     Providers would be required to post notices explaining these new rights and to post nurse schedules in prominent workplace locations  Nurses would also receive anti retaliation protections for reporting employers who require them to work hours beyond what is safe for quality care  The names of providers who violate the law would be posted on the Medicare website
