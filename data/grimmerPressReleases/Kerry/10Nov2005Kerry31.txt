afternoon  Senator John Kerry introduced in the Senate his plan to succeed in Iraq and bring the vast majority of our combat troops home in a reasonable timeframe tied to specific  responsible benchmarks to transfer responsibility to Iraqis     beginning with the draw down of 20 000 U S  troops after successful Iraqi elections in December   These additional troops are in Iraq only for the purpose of providing security for the upcoming elections  If they remain in Iraq after that benchmark is achieved  it only exacerbates the sense of American occupation          We are entering a make or break six month period in Iraq   We need to be taking action now if we are ever going to bring our troops home within a reasonable timeframe from an Iraq that s not permanently torn by irrepressible conflict   Kerry said      We cannot pull out precipitously or merely promise to stay    as long as it takes   There is a way forward that gives us the best chance both to salvage a difficult situation in Iraq  and to save American and Iraqi lives             Kerry s legislation  the Strategy for Success in Iraq Act  lays out a comprehensive new strategy to complete the mission in Iraq and bring our troops home  Its goal is to undermine the insurgency by simultaneously pursing both a political settlement and the draw down of American forces linked to specific  responsible benchmarks   If followed  the process will be completed in 12 15 months         Kerry   s plan calls for             The U S  to begin a phased draw down of American troops as a series of military and political benchmarks is met  starting with a reduction of 20 000 troops over the holidays as the first benchmark    the successful completion of the December elections     is met            The U S  to immediately make clear that we do not want permanent military bases in Iraq  or a large combat force on Iraqi soil indefinitely            The Administration to immediately give Congress and the American people a detailed plan for the transfer of military and police responsibilities on a sector by sector basis to Iraqis so the majority of our combat forces can be withdrawn    ideally by the end of next year             The Bush administration to prod the new Iraqi government to ask for a multinational force to help protect Iraq   s borders until a capable national army is formed   Such a force  if sanctioned by the United Nations  could attract participation by Iraq s neighbors and countries like India and would be a critical step in stemming the tide of insurgents and money into Iraq  especially from Syria           The Pentagon to alter the deployment of American troops  keeping Special Operations forces pursuing specific intelligence leads and putting the vast majority of U S  troops in rear guard  garrisoned status for security backup   We do not need to send young Americans on search and destroy missions that invite alienation and deepen the risks they face           The President to put the training of Iraqi security forces on a six month wartime footing and ensure that the Iraqi government has the budget to deploy them             The Bush administration to accept long standing offers by Egypt  Jordan  France and Germany to do more training           The administration to immediately call a conference of Iraq   s neighbors  Britain  Turkey and other key NATO allies  and Russia to implement a strategy to bring the parties in Iraq to a sustainable political compromise that includes mutual security guarantees among Iraqis              Iraq   s Sunni neighbors to set up a reconstruction fund specifically for the majority Sunni areas to show them the benefits of participating in the political process            The President to appoint a special envoy to bolster America   s diplomatic efforts           The U S  to commit to a new regional security structure that includes improved security assistance programs and joint exercises             The U S  to jumpstart our lagging reconstruction efforts by providing the necessary civilian personnel to do the job  standing up civil military reconstruction teams throughout the country  streamlining the disbursement of funds to the provinces  expanding job creation programs for Iraqis  and strengthening the capacity of government ministries            We must send this critical signal to the Iraqi people   that we do not desire permanent occupation   and that Iraqis themselves must fight for Iraq   History shows that guns alone do not end an insurgency     Kerry added           Senior American commanders and officials have said the large U S  military presence in Iraq feeds the insurgency   General George Casey  the top American military commander in Iraq  recently told Congress that our large military presence    feeds the notion of occupation    and    extends the amount of time that it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self reliant      Richard Nixon   s Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird   breaking a thirty year silence  recently wrote    Our presence is what feeds the insurgency  and our gradual withdrawal would feed the confidence and the ability of average Iraqis to stand up to the insurgency                                                                                        20510
