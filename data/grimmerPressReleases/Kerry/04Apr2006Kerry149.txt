group of U S  Senators led by John Kerry  D Mass    Ranking Democrat on the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship  is urging the federal government to implement legislation that provides low interest loans to agricultural dependent as well as small firms not dependent on agriculture whose businesses have been impacted by drought   Currently  more than half the states in the country have drought declarations by the Secretary of Agriculture  including Massachusetts       The Small Business Administration  SBA  had repeatedly claimed that only agriculture dependent firms were eligible for assistance   However  in January  legislation sponsored by Kerry and Sen  Mike Enzi  R Wyo   was signed into law clarifying the SBA   s authority to issue disaster loans to all small businesses that face economic injury from drought conditions  This legislation has received broad support from governors and small businesses         We have made it crystal clear that it   s the Administration   s responsibility to get all small businesses hurt by drought the help they need  but small businesses are still waiting for action     said Kerry      No more excuses  No more red tape   Every small business owner whose economic livelihood is hurt by a drought must have the opportunity to keep their doors open  whether it   s fishing guides  bait and tackle shops  or anything else   The SBA needs to stop their foot dragging and start helping small businesses            There are 27 states with open drought declarations by the Secretary of Agriculture  thereby making businesses eligible for disaster loans in  Arkansas  Colorado  Connecticut  Georgia  Illinois  Indiana  Iowa  Kansas  Kentucky  Louisiana  Massachusetts  Michigan  Mississippi  Missouri  Montana  Nebraska  New York  Ohio  Oklahoma  Oregon  Pennsylvania  South Dakota  Tennessee  Texas  Virginia  Washington  and Wisconsin  Yet because SBA has only been allowing agriculture dependent businesses to receive the loans  many small firms have not been able to receive the financial assistance they need        The law requires SBA to implement the policy within 45 days  Given the Administration is more than a month past compliance and the summer     which is peak drought season     is right around the corner  Kerry was joined by Enzi and Senators Carl Levin  D Mich   and Harry Reid  D Nev      who all helped get the measure passed    in calling for the agency   s swift implementation of these changes        The Senators wrote     By applying the law fairly and giving all small business owners access to low interest loans for paying bills and making payroll     regardless of whether or not their business has agricultural ties     this legislation plays an important role in sustaining their livelihoods until  drought  conditions improve           Following is a text of the letter Kerry  Enzi  Levin and Reid sent to the SBA       March 31  2006     The Honorable Hector V  Barreto    Administrator    U S  Small Business Administration    409 Third Street  SW    Washington  DC  20416     Re   Implementation of Law Providing Disaster Loan Assistance to Drought Victims     Dear Administrator Barreto      On January 6  2006  H R  1815  the    National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006    was signed into law   For several years we have fought for legislation to help small businesses damaged by drought  and it was included in this bill   The law requires the SBA to publicize the final rules to carry out this legislation within 45 days of enactment   That timeframe ended more than a month ago on February 20  2006  so we are writing to inquire how and when the Administration will implement these changes         This provision clarifies the Agency   s existing authority to make low interest disaster loans to agriculture dependent as well as non agriculture dependent small businesses   This clarification was necessary because SBA has not complied with the law and for years has treated drought victims differently  only making disaster loans to those small businesses whose income is tied to agriculture   For example  a couple of years ago the entire state of South Carolina had been declared a disaster by the SBA  but the Administration would not help all drought victims   The declaration read           Small businesses located in all 46 counties may apply for economic injury disaster loan assistance through the SBA   These are working capital loans to help the business continue to meet its obligations until the business returns to normal conditions    Only small  non farm agriculture dependent and small agricultural cooperatives are eligible to apply for assistance   Nurseries are also eligible for economic injury caused by drought conditions         Unfortunately  drought impacts not just agricultural firms  but also firms in the tourism and recreation industry   They  too  need disaster loans to keep their businesses open until conditions improve or until they can adjust their business practices   To understand just how devastating drought can be on non agriculture dependent businesses and local economies  we encourage your staff to meet with the small businesses on Lake Mead  outside of Las Vegas  There are fishing guides who are struggling to find ramps that still reach the water to launch their boats   There are boat dealerships in the county that have lost an estimated  100 million in sales because recreation at the lake is down   And marinas are paying millions to move their docks  buildings and utilities  trying to    chase the water      The area usually gets 8 10 million visitors a year  but the impact of drought on Lake Mead has caused the region   s economy to lose more than  1 billion  according to local officials   Lake Michigan has suffered similar economic losses  and the state   s congressional delegation has been looking for small business relief for years   By applying the law fairly and giving all small business owners access to low interest loans for paying bills and making payroll     regardless of whether or not their business has agricultural ties     this legislation plays an important role in sustaining their livelihoods until conditions improve        Over the years  the language in this provision has had the bipartisan support of 25 Senators as well as the endorsement of organizations such as the Southern Governors    Association   As many as 36 states had SBA drought declarations in the summer of 2005   At the time this legislation passed the Senate in the fall  15 states fell under this category  Wisconsin  Tennessee  Kentucky  Virginia  Montana  Nebraska  South Dakota  Iowa  Oklahoma  Illinois  Arkansas  Louisiana  Mississippi  Texas  and Kansas   With drought   s peak season just around the corner everywhere from the Great Lakes region to Lake Mead to Wyoming  it is imperative that the SBA implement these protections and allow all small business owners who are eligible to get these much needed disaster loans        On or before April 14  2006  please submit to the Committee a detailed description of how and when the SBA will implement this law   If you have any questions  please don   t hesitate to call us      Sincerely     John F  Kerry    Michael B  Enzi    Carl Levin    Harry Reid
