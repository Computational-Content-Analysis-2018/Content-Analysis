 Several members of Congress    led by Senators John Kerry  D Mass   and Dick Durbin  D Ill   and U S  Representatives Hilda L  Solis  D Calif   and Alcee L  Hastings  D Fla      today are urging the Environmental Protection Agency to drastically improve the shortcomings in the agency s environmental justice plan   In a letter to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson  nearly 80 legislators asked the EPA to reverse its failed course on environmental justice and start putting forth a real plan to improve the dangerous effects of pollution in our most vulnerable communities       The EPA   s draft Environmental Justice Strategic Plan fails to reduce the existing disparate impacts of pollution on low income and minority communities and may actually contribute to the future increase of these impacts   Specifically  the Strategic Plan disregards race as an environmental justice consideration and fails to provide the necessary tools to identify environmental justice communities  ignoring those communities most harshly affected by pollution  The Strategic Plan also ignores key criticisms of existing efforts at the EPA made by the Inspector General in 2004          At a time when we should be working to help the communities bearing the brunt of pollution problems  this administration is turning the idea of environmental justice on its head  By ignoring our minority and low income communities the Bush Administration is reversing a commitment made to communities across our country   Senator Kerry said   It s time the EPA starts listening to its own Inspector General  changes course and puts forth a workable solution to bring clean air and water to all our communities         The Environmental Protection Agency s strategy plan moves environmental justice and the efforts to help low income communities in the wrong direction  I am concerned that if implemented  it would rollback environmental justice programs and worsen the health of vulnerable working class communities  I hope that the EPA will work with us to come up with a better plan   said Rep  Hilda Solis  ranking Democrat on the House Environment and Hazardous Materials subcommittee          It is beyond irresponsible for the administration to suggest that this plan takes the necessary steps to improve the health and well being of America   s most vulnerable     said Rep  Hastings      It isn   t that EPA doesn   t know what problems exist  it   s their willingness to do anything about it  Shame on them            Senator Durbin closed by noting     Environmental justice should mean more protection  not less  for those Americans most affected by pollution   The Bush Administration continues to disregard years of evidence which show that low income and minority communities are bearing an unfair burden of pollution in America   The Bush Administration needs to move forward with a plan to guarantee that all Americans live in a clean and safe environment          The Strategic Plan has also been criticized by dozens of health  civil rights  and environmental groups  including the American Lung Association  the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund  the National Hispanic Environmental Council  Latino Issues Forum  Earth Justice  and the Center on Race  Poverty and the Environment        Below is the text of the letter to EPA Administrator Johnson       Dear Administrator Johnson       We write to inform you of our concerns with the Environmental Protection Agency s  EPA  June 22  2005  Environmental Justice Strategic Plan Outline  and  Framework for Integrating Environmental Justice   otherwise known as the  Strategic Plan   We believe the Strategic Plan fails to address the real environmental justice problems facing our nation s most polluted communities and violates Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice       For decades  minority and underserved communities have been forced to live in close proximity to industrial zones  power plants  and toxic waste sites  The proximity to these facilities has jeopardized the health of these communities  For example  5 5 million Latinos live within 10 miles of a coal powered plant  and 68 percent of all African Americans in the U S  live within 30 miles of a coal powered plant  the distance within which the health impacts are most acute  In these communities Latinos are nearly 2 5 times more likely to develop asthma than whites and African Americans are also more than twice as likely to die from asthma as whites       Unfortunately  the Strategic Plan would disregard race as a consideration for determining environmental justice  This is a significant departure from existing environmental justice policies and is in direct contradiction with the intent of the Executive Order  We believe it will do nothing to reduce the existing disparate impacts suffered by low income and minority communities and may contribute to the future increase of these impacts       The Strategic Plan also fails to identify the key recipients of environmental justice actions   In 2004 the Inspector General reported that  EPA s ability to comply with the Order s requirement in a consistent manner is impeded if it does not first identify the intended recipients of the environmental justice actions   The EPA s failure to identify the intended recipients in a manner that truly reflects environmental justice communities is ultimately another attempt to de prioritize the importance of focusing on our nation s most vulnerable populations  We reject any plan which does not clearly identify environmental justice communities and reject the reinterpretation of the Executive Order which this strategy supports       We are also concerned about the comparative risk prioritization scheme created by the Strategic Plan  This scheme will require environmental justice issues to be prioritized solely at the national level  requiring the EPA to choose whether it is more important to focus on the prevalence of an issue such as cancer over an issue such as asthma  While we believe it is important to highlight the issues facing environmental justice communities broadly  we believe that policies should be modified to address the specific needs of each of these communities  We are concerned that an issues priority system would automatically de prioritize those issues which are lower on the list        We urge the EPA to seriously consider the failures identified by the Inspector General in 2004 and address these failures in future drafts of the Strategic Plan  The EPA needs to develop a Strategic Plan on Environmental Justice which will take real steps to combat the environmental injustices which continue to plague our minority and low income communities        Sincerely       HILDA
