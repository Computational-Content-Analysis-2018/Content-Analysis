devoted to one of Fairmount s favorite sons  Son of a Philadelphia police officer  Patrick was once named most popular student at Roman Catholic High School       It was 38 years ago in August that Patrick  a door gunner in the U S  Army  was killed in Vietnam after his helicopter was shot down  He was the type of person that neighborhoods devote street corners to and parents name their children after   including Marge and Jack Murphy  the parents of one of the authors of this article       Americans  nearly 40 years later  again find their best and bravest overseas with an open ended commitment and no real plan for victory  More than three years after George Bush declared  Mission accomplished   men and women continue to die in Iraq without a clear mission  without benchmarks to determine success or failure  and without a clear timeline for either coming home or redeploying to fight al Qaeda in Afghanistan  How many street corner memorials are we going to be forced to build for this war       Forty years ago  returning soldiers talked firsthand about how elected officials frightened of their own political shadows had failed them  In exchange for speaking truth to power  they had their loyalty questioned and their patriotism called into doubt       The political posturing on Iraq of George Bush and Rep  Mike Fitzpatrick proves that history repeats itself       Reasonable people can disagree on what to do about the situation in Iraq  but most can agree on two things  It is immoral for old men to send young Americans to fight and die in a conflict without a strategy  And it is egregious that a candidate for federal office would run for re election without a real plan for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan  as Mike Fitzpatrick is doing       Months ago  we both came to a conclusion that prompted us to articulate similar plans for dealing with Iraq  that the only appropriate course of action is to create a timeline to bring our troops home and force the Iraqis to fight for their own democracy       If there is one thing that our service taught us  it is that everything in the military works on timelines  There are timelines for training  timelines for missions and  in Iraq  there were timelines for elections and establishing a constitution       It is clear that we must set another timeline   one to bring our troops home and get Iraq up on its own two feet  We must make Iraqis stand up for Iraq   and bring our heroes home       Only after we refocus our military efforts from the mission in Iraq can we begin doing what we should have been doing all along  tracking down and killing members of al Qaeda  This is why we must redeploy the vast majority of troops from Iraq within 12 months so we can free up resources to fight the global war on terror       Americans don t need to be reminded by politicians that we must win the war on terror  What they need is for their government to offer a real plan to get our troops out of Iraq  protect our homeland  and refocus our efforts on capturing and killing Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda       Without offering a plan to address any of these  George Bush and Mike Fitzpatrick taunt patriotic Americans concerned with the path our country is on with phrases like  cut and run  and  stay the course   The truth is   staying the course  isn t farsighted  it s blind  And leaving our troops in the middle of a civil war isn t resolute  it s reckless  Their lack of leadership on the most critical issue facing our elected representatives disgraces our soldiers and dishonors all of us       Half of the service members listed on the Vietnam Memorial wall died after America s leaders knew our strategy wouldn t work  It was immoral then and it would be immoral now to engage in the same delusion       There are hundreds of thousands of American troops serving in Iraq  We should honor them by bringing them home within 12 months and giving them a real plan to win the war on terror  not a strategy where the only endgame is more street corner memorial parks      Sen  John Kerry is a Democrat from Massachusetts  Patrick Murphy is the Democratic candidate running against Rep  Mike Fitzpatrick in the 8th District in Bucks County                                                                          20510
