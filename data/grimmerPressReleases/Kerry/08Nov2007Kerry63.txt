John Kerry  D Mass   joined colleagues in introducing legislation today that would prevent the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  from ramming through new media ownership rules  Kerry spoke at a hearing today about the dangers of media consolidation  The hearing was called after Kerry and other members of the Commerce Committee were informed that FCC chairman Kevin Martin would try to vote on new media ownership rules in December of this year  A vote called too soon would advantage large corporate media entities and further media consolidation     Were not going to allow the FCC to ram through abrupt changes to ownership rules when there are still major unresolved issues about protecting minority and local media  said Kerry  Americans are not going to accept the same tired excuse that their media choice suffers because of so called unintended consequences of ownership changes  No one benefits from increasingly homogenous media where the only variety left is the choice of which celebrity meltdown to watch  Enough is enough  The FCC needs to know that their preferred approach of advantaging the big interests damages our democracy and smothers the free exchange of ideas  and Congress will not stand by and watch it happen     The bill would require the FCC to have a 90 day comment period on any proposed media ownership rule changes and to conduct a separate proceeding on localism with another 90 day comment period  The bill was sponsored by Senator Dorgan  and cosponsored by Senators Lott  Obama  Feinstein  Cantwell and Snowe     Below are Kerrys remarks from the hearing today       Mr  Chairman  on this Committee and in the Senate  weve been here before  Theres almost a Groundhog Day quality to this discussion       When I think of the FCC Chairmans recent comments on media ownership  I am reminded of Ronald Reagans famous line in his debate with Jimmy Carter in 1980  there you go again       We may have a different FCC Chairman  but it appears we are once again headed down the same  tired ill advised path  and we know where it leads       In 2003 the FCC issued rules designed to loosen restrictions on broadcast media ownership  That decision was met with a public outcry and backlash rarely seen in the telecom and media world       At the time I wrote to the FCC Chairman opposing these changes  Several of us worked on a resolution to disapprove the changes  And the courts eventually recognized the dangers of these changes and pushed back       Fast forward 4 years  We have a new FCC Chairman  We have a new attempt to consolidate media even though we have unfinished business at the FCC on localism and minority ownership  We have an insufficient process by which the public can judge these changes       But little has changed in the approach of this Administration  and I dont think Americans are going to just accept any excuses in the future about unintended consequences  Theyve seen too much  Theyve heard too much       Charlie Brown can only miss kicking that football so many times before people know whats coming       Now  I understand  the FCC Chairman has announced    arbitrarily    that the Commission will vote on December 18th  But he hasnt shared his thoughts on what changes hed like to make       The FCC needs to know that this will not stand and Congress will not allow it       These rules influence the competitive structure of the industry and protect the publics access to multiple sources of information  Any changes must be considered with great caution and diligence       We have several ongoing proceedings that impact our media market  There is a localism proceeding and a proceeding on minority media ownership  a topic that I am very interested in       The facts are clear and compelling  and theyre staring us right in the face       Think about this  in cities with large minority populations such as New York  Washington DC  Atlanta and New Orleans  there is not a single black owned television station  Not one       Since 1998  there has been a 40 percent decline in the number of minority owned broadcast television stations  Who in their right mind can look at this and think its acceptable       Proceeding dealing with these issues must conclude  and must provide concrete and enforceable recommendations  before broader rule changes contemplated       The FCCs first responsibility is to ensure diversity  competition and localism  It has no responsibility to facilitate the business plans of the major networks or any other narrow economic interest  And there is no doubt that these rules have a substantial impact       Weve seen the consequences before  In 1996  we removed limitations on national radio ownership  By almost any measure  that policy has been a disaster       The consolidation in radio has badly weakened the medium  leaving many stations lacking in character and diverse programming and as a result  listeners       The television industry continues to consolidate  as a handful of national networks acquire local stations across the country  Local TV stations are being bought up by mid sized companies  with no commitment to the community that they serve       What is the end result  Local and independent voices    lost  Diverse points of view    homogenized  Consumer choice    compromised  Why  Because the driving consideration is maximizing profits  not providing insightful news and analysis       Mr  Chairman  I intend to closely watch the FCC  I am working with Senator Dorgan on legislation to ensure that we dont worsen the mess we have today  The Commission would be wise to hear our message                                                                          20510
