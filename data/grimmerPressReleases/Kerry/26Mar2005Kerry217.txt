                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Last week   s debate on the federal budget should remind all Americans that Washington is not working for them       In Lowell alone  2 400 adults are eligible for Adult Basic Education programs   If the President gets his way  over half will likely be kicked out of class   Massachusetts will also lose  20 million in funding for vocational education  crippling technical high schools in Lowell  Shawsheen and Nashoba       The votes last week were more than ticks in the won loss column  they were assaults on our nation   s values   Honesty  opportunity and responsibility were all cut from this budget   These cuts should give us all cause for concern  because in the end budgets are a statement of your priorities   They are your values backed up by dollars and cents       When considering the budget of the United States  honesty at minimum means actually counting every dollar we plan to spend   It sounds simple  it   s what every American does  but this budget doesn   t do it       Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will cost at least  400 billion over ten years   That   s not in the budget   The President   s Social Security scheme will cost another  750 billion over ten years   That   s not in the budget   The budget ignores interest on the debt  which not even the most creative accountant would leave out       This budget is like an Enron budget     smoke the numbers  cook the books  hide the truth and hope no one finds out   When Enron went bust  stockholders were the losers   When this budget goes bust  the American taxpayer will be the loser   They   ll lose because this budget does exactly what Enron did  makes irresponsible choices the Administration does not want you to know about       The responsible choice would be to honor those who have worn our nation   s uniform  but the Administration made a different choice   They   re raising veterans  healthcare fees by  250 a year while cutting taxes for millionaires   They welcome home our troops with  2 6 billion in unanticipated co payments and fees instead of cracking down on offshore tax shelters   The result of these irresponsible choices  in Massachusetts alone over 22 000 veterans could be forced to leave the VA healthcare system  including 7 600 active patients   Some in Washington may be quick to embrace the symbols of patriotism with words  but too often deeds lag behind       Responsibility also means keeping our nation on sound financial footing for the long run  but the Congressional Budget Office estimates we ll be facing over  5 trillion in new debt because of this President   These debts not only hurt your children in the future   they hurt you and every family today   Almost eight cents of every tax dollar goes just toward paying interest on the debt    By contrast  you only pay about two cents on the dollar for education    160 billion goes to interest on the debt  not to giving healthcare to every child  fully funding No Child Left Behind  securing our energy independence or funding a Military Family s Bill of Rights   Eight cents on the dollar is a lot of money  and it s not buying you more security and it s not buying your kids a better education   On the other hand  bankers in Japan and Korea and Taiwan are benefiting  and you should be worried about it   Responsible leaders wouldn t turn our economic future over to the whims of foreign bankers  they would fight to keep it in responsible hands here at home       The American people also deserve a budget that keeps faith with the promise of opportunity for all  special privileges for none  One of the dangers in tight fiscal times is you start hearing a lot of empty talk about tough choices that are really nothing more than excuses to destroy opportunity   We heard the excuses from the Administration during the recession  we heard them during the war  and we   ve heard plenty more excuses during this budget debate       The Administration makes a number of    tough choices    in this budget under the guise of fiscal restraint   The budget gives a huge tax cut to people making over  1 million a year  but cuts heating aid and vocational education in Massachusetts by over  20 million   The budget wastes billions of dollars in corporate loopholes  while Boston Children   s Hospital should expect a  7 million cut and almost 28 000 students across the state could be kicked out of after school programs   The budget wastes billions more in offshore tax shelters  but cuts Even Start literacy programs in Springfield  Holyoke  Northampton  Greenfield  Pittsfield  Orange and across the Commonwealth   The Safe and Drug Free School Program is completely eliminated       There is not a tough choice in the list above  and there can be no excuse   The people deserve better  and that starts by demanding our leadership do a better job budgeting our cherished values of honesty  responsibility  and opportunity      Sen  John Kerry has
