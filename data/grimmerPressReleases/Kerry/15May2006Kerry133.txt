Address Emerson College Senator John Kerry       May 15  2006     As Prepared for Delivery    President Liebergott  Members of the Board of Trustees and the Board of Overseers  Robert Steele  faculty and staff  parents  and of course the great graduating Class of 2006  thank you        Before I begin I have an announcement   will the student who owns the brand new cherry red Corvette in the parking lot  with the big ribbon on it  the one with the license plate that reads    Emerson 2006      your lights aren   t on  I just want to tell your parents to send me a campaign check  they can afford it        President Liebergott asked me if I wanted some music played as I was introduced  I said no  Although 2 years ago I did spend  200 million hoping just once to hear hail to the chief          It really is an honor for me to be here  I heard you had a great choice of commencement speakers  I was told you wanted a wealthy guy with a full head of hair who is all over T V  and who desperately wants to be president   But Donald Trump wasn   t available        So instead you got me   I want you to know  running for president wasn   t pressure   trying to decide on the theme of this commencement address was pressure   On one hand I thought about giving an hour 20 minute speech on foreign policy  global warming  third world debt and the importance of public service  Then on the other hand  I thought if I keep this to 10 minutes we   d all have a lot more time to have a beer together          Hour 20 versus 10 minutes  Hour 20   10 minutes and a beer   I ll tell you what  let s go with the short one   And if I see any of you opening up a red bull midway through  I   ll finish even sooner        To start off  let s take a moment right now and give a big hand to your parents         You know  your parents remember that times were different when we graduated   The good news    we had a guaranteed job plan for immediate full time work after college  The bad news  it was called the draft        But that was then and this is now and today we celebrate the fact you just finished 4 years at a great school  Each of you grew a lot   and I don   t mean the freshman 15   You grew as you learned about yourselves  and about life   You no doubt enjoyed the fact that college is a time to ponder the great questions of the universe  questions that there are no answers to   why are we here  What will the future be like   And why in the world does Heather Locklear date David Spade        And I know your parents would be pleased to know you spend your time pondering the big questions   Like  is Tom Cruise   s career over   And why can a 10 year old little leaguer catch a fly ball but Manny Ramirez can t        What impresses me is that not only have you grown but the school is growing   Emerson is building a new gym to open up next fall  But then again  what else would you expect from a football factory        Someone told me you take special pride in the fact you are the Emerson Lions  How many of you have stopped to think how the average lion spends its day   It spends 22 hours napping and the other 2 hours looking for food   Which pretty much sounds like the average frat brother at Alpha Pi Theta        You know  it occurred to me that I have never had so much power as a Senator  I   m all that stands between you and your degree         So here you are  just minutes away from that golden moment and I suppose it   s an appropriate time to ask yourselves  what has Emerson given you          Well  in your four years here many of you have learned about honesty  loyalty  ethics and caring  You will become your parents pride and joy   A few have lost your bearings  become cynical and lost your moral compass   You will become political consultants        Which is a opportunity for me to bring you the latest update on what is going on in Washington DC            the front page is filled with allegations that CIA officials were partying at the Watergate with gambling  liquor and women   Just think  they could be charged with impersonating a Member of Congress          Finally  the Bush Administration has an exit strategy  50 more members of the White House staff have exited their jobs         I know you   ll be pleased we are continuing the much needed investigation into the election fraud and illegal voting  Hopefully  never again will we see what happened to Chris on American Idol        Tonight the president gives a major speech on immigration  That   s what I love about Washington   a president who has difficulty speaking English complaining about people who have difficulty speaking English        So  now that you   re graduating  what   s next         Well  some of you will leave here and become successful writers   Especially if you learn to copy  paste and plagiarize like Harvard sophomores        Some of you will become teachers  Some soldiers  Some lawyers or doctors  And one of you could end up working for the most powerful person in the free world     Oprah        Everyone knows Emerson s great reputation in communications  and there are so many fields communication majors can go into   theater  TV  film   or you can just find fulltime work at the NSA tapping phones        And for those of you who want to be journalists  you really do have a choice  The very top  the very brightest  the A students will go to the New York Times and the Washington Post  The B and C students  will start on smaller papers and work their way up  But the D and F students who are really attractive  you   re gonna make millions in TV news         As every clich   in the world reminds you  today is a commencement  a time you leave here and take a step toward your future   What will tomorrow bring  what will life be like 10 years from now          Just think  the world has changed so much in your 4 years here  Four years ago the longest jinx in Boston was the Red Sox  now it s Democratic presidential candidates        But even without a crystal ball  there are certain things I am absolutely sure of        First  in the year 2016  the average member of Congress will serve 12 years  Actually 10 15 depending on the sentencing judge        In 2016 we will still face the same tirades from the world   s longest reigning dictator as he presides over the collapse of a failed empire  But this is neither the time nor place to talk about George Steinbrenner        Gold will cost  725 an ounce  So will oil  And both will still be cheaper than Starbucks coffee        Sadly in 2016 the price of gas will continue to skyrocket  And that means Anna Nicole Smith will be trying to marry Texaco dealers        In 2016 there were still be too many guns on the street  In fact there will still be too many guns in the hands of Dick Cheney  Actually  that s the only good news to come out of Washington  DC    it s been two months now and the vice president hasn t shot anyone        But I digress  In ten years  young people will be electing their own candidates  I have 3 words for people who think this is a good idea   President Jessica Simpson        In 2016 I will be retired from the Senate  Ted Kennedy will be promising just 3 more terms        And finally  one thing for sure  in 2016  you will all still be paying off student loans        So we ve touched on your career options  and we ve looked into the future which means there is only one thing left for me to do  It is to carry out the most important duty of a commencement speaker   It   s to give you a little practical advice for the life you re about to begin  Because to be honest  college is good for a lot of things but in the end you don   t get the real advice you need to prosper  So here they are   a few rules for succeeding in life         Rule  1   anyone can grow up and be president  That   s what I keep telling myself every night        Remember always  peace is better than war  try to avoid fighting and never ever ever get into an argument with a guy nicknamed Killer  Lefty or Paulie Walnuts        Here   s the key to making real money  Hold on 17  hit on 16 and split aces eights and nines  Or  if that fails  take my advice    marry up        Stop talking when the audience is snoring  If only I had remembered this in 2004       Remember the 12  3 rule  never propose marriage after 12 beers or  after 3 a m   Look what happened to Brittney Spears           and never believe the evidence from the CIA         That   s it  that   s all you need to succeed in life        OK  we ve had some fun    or at least I have        You re about to become Emerson graduates  you don t need someone to tell you how to be successful  But the truth is  there is something else you need to do to make our democracy successful  to renew the best our system of self governing has to offer        We need a whole lot more good citizens        There s a lot that s broken in Washington today  And it s good that we can laugh about it  But it s much more important that we fix it  That s where plain and simple  tried and true citizenship comes in        You want to fix Washington  Speak out        It sounds old fashioned  but it s true  The bedrock of America   s greatest advances   the foundation of all we take for granted today    was formed not by cheering on things as they were  but by taking them on and demanding change  No wonder Thomas Jefferson himself said that  dissent is the highest form of patriotism         I know that the reason many people aren t interested in politics today is because politicians aren t saying anything very interesting         But if you want to change that  speak out    speak out and make your issues the voting issues of this nation         You might say   who s he kidding  We can t do that   But I remember when you couldn   t even mention environmental issues without a snicker  But then in the 70   s people got tired of seeing the Cuyahoga River catch on fire from all the chemicals  So one day millions of Americans marched  Politicians had no choice but to take notice  Twelve Congressmen were dubbed the Dirty Dozen  and soon after seven were kicked out of office  The floodgates were opened  We got the Clean Air Act  The Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water  We created the EPA  The quality of life improved because concerned citizens made their issues matter in elections        So it s up to you now to speak out if you want to restore a politics of big ideas  not small minded attacks         Speak out if you   re tired of seeing America divided into red states and blue states  because you know we can be one America    red  white  and blue         The job of citizens is to speak out so loudly that Washington has no choice but to start responding to the real needs and the real issues of each and every one of you        I know in the age we live in this isn t easy  You ll meet resistance  You ll find plenty of people who think you should just keep your mouths shut or that by speaking out you re somehow less than patriotic  But that s not really new either  When we protested the war in Vietnam some would weigh in against us saying     My country right or wrong      Our response was simple     Yes  my country right or wrong   When right  keep it right and when wrong  make it right            Graduates of the Class of 2006  that s the mission of citzens again today      to get off our rear ends     go out     and make it right today   And I know that s exactly what you can and will do        Congratulations    and God Bless                                                                                     20510                                                                                                                                                                                          Contact           Sitemap
