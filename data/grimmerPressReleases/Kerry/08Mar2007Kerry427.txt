group of Senators introduced legislation today that would provide consumers and businesses relief from high energy prices by extending energy efficiency and solar energy tax incentives enacted by the Energy Policy Act of 2005  EPAct   The EXTEND the Energy Efficiency Incentives Act of 2007  introduced by Senators Olympia J  Snowe  R Maine   Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Gordon Smith  R OR   Ken Salazar  D CO   Norm Coleman  R MN   John Kerry  D MA   Jim Bunning  R KY   Wayne Allard  R CO   and John Cornyn  R TX  would continue to increase energy efficiency  reduce the demand for natural gas  the strain placed on our nation s power grid and offer savings and tax credits for those homes and businesses that work to reduce their energy consumption           Incentivizing energy efficiency and renewable energy is good for the business bottom line and good for the environment   Senator Kerry said   Fighting climate change and global warming starts by changing the way we use energy in our homes and our businesses  This legislation proves that saving energy and money isn t a partisan issue  it s just smart policy  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this bill passed           This bipartisan bill takes a comprehensive and practical approach to maximizing energy savings  reducing greenhouse gas emissions  and giving much needed relief from high energy prices to the American people   Snowe said   This legislation does more than extend the tax incentives for efficient buildings adopted in Energy Policy Act of 2005  it improves and modifies them where necessary  The EPAct was a good first step toward the goal of improved energy efficiency  the EXTEND Act will ensure those steps continue            Energy efficiency must be a cornerstone of any   comprehensive approach to the global warming problem   Senator Feinstein said   This legislation would encourage homeowners and commercial property owners to implement efficient technologies in future building projects  If passed  by 2017  the bill would help to lower greenhouse gas emissions from buildings below projected levels by more than 10 percent  It would also save consumers and businesses as much as  50 billion a year in utility bills  So  it would be a good first step            Efficiently using our energy lowers power bills  benefiting the environment and the consumer  Expanding and extending these tax incentives will help create savings that will last the life of the structure   said Gordon Smith           Extending these tax credits will provide consumers a greater opportunity for energy savings  manufacturers a more predictable marketplace  and Americans another step towards energy independence   said Senator Salazar           I ve long held we need smart energy incentives  This bill will not only make our tax incentives for energy efficient buildings more effective  but it will also extend them to allow businesses to commit to major upgrades in efficiency   said Sen  Coleman   I am pleased to be working with my colleagues on this bill    it is imperative we give homeowners and businesses the tools they need to become more energy efficient            I am proud of the energy efficiency provisions we wrote in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and this legislation will extend those temporary provisions   said Senator Bunning   Energy efficiency  along with clean coal technology like coal to liquid fuels  renewable biofuels  and expanded domestic oil and natural gas production  will be the foundation of kicking our addiction to Middle Eastern oil and making America energy independent            As the founder and co chair of the Senate Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus  I am proud to support this bipartisan legislation   said Senator Allard   It is important to offer incentives to taxpayers who consciously make the decision to be energy efficient           Preliminary estimates by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy  ACEEE  are that if the EXTEND Act were adopted  the two year EPAct incentives plus the additional EXTEND incentives would reduce U S  natural gas use by about 3 trillion cubic feet over the 2006 2020 period  almost enough to serve California and New York for a year   can reduce peak electric demand by about 12 500 megawatts by 2020  equivalent to 42 power plants of 300 MW each  and can reduce consumer energy bills by about  78 billion over the 2006 2020 period       Key Provisions of the EXTEND Act      New tax credit for home retrofits that save energy  The credit starts at  800 for homes that are certified as saving 20 percent and increases on a sliding scale up to  4 000 for homes that save 50 percent  Owners or renters can qualify for the credit  A new deduction for retrofits of rental homes makes a comparable amount of incentive available to landlords            Extension through 2012 of the tax deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings  The EXTEND Act extends the tax deduction for energy efficient property installed in commercial buildings  such as heating and cooling systems  interior lighting systems  and insulation  The EXTEND Act allows property that is certified by 2012  but not placed in service until 2014  to also receive the deduction  The bill increases the amount of the deduction from  1 80 per square foot to  2 25 per square foot  The bill also simplifies the process for certifying compliance while improving the certification s accuracy            Extension through 2011 of tax credits of certain residential energy efficient equipment  Certain non business  residential  energy efficient equipment  such as natural gas furnaces and oil hot water heaters  qualify for the credits  The credits range from  50 to  300 depending on the equipment  The EXTEND Act also establishes deductions for the same equipment covered by the credits  These deductions are available to businesses and individuals who make business use of the equipment  and the deduction amounts are set at levels that achieve the same tax values for the taxpayer as the credits            Extension of the tax credit for energy efficient retrofits to homes to 2009  This credit allows taxpayers to obtain credits for up to 10 percent of the cost of the building envelope components  such as insulation  windows  and doors  These credits are based on a performance based system for calculating total energy saved  The total amount of the credit cannot exceed  500 per taxpayer over all prior taxable years            Extension of the EPAct tax credit for energy efficient new homes to 2011  New owner occupied homes that are certified to have annual heating and cooling energy consumption that is at least 50 percent below such consumption for a comparable home are currently eligible for a  2 000 credit  The EXTEND Act also makes rental homes eligible for the new homes credit  Manufactured homes that are certified to have energy consumption 30 percent below comparable homes are eligible for a  1 000 credit            A new tax credit for those who perform energy efficiency certifications of buildings  The new tax credit covers costs associated with the training  certification  and purchase of equipment for individuals who perform the certifications needed by taxpayers to qualify for the new and existing homes tax incentives covered by the EXTEND Act                                                                                      20510
