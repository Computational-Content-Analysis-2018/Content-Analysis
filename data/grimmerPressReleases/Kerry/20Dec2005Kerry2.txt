John Kerry  D Mass   and Johnny Isakson  R Ga   today introduced legislation to dramatically increase penalties for anyone who downloads child pornography off the Internet   The current penalty for downloading songs off the Internet is three times the penalty for downloading pornographic materials of children and infants   Their bill also will fix the law to allow adults to sue those who download images of them taken when they were children       According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  child pornography has become a multi billion dollar internet business   Every year  the Center   s Cybertipline receives tens of thousands of calls reporting child exploitation and pornography on the internet          It   s really a sad statement that we have tougher penalties for downloading music than for downloading sick images of infants and children   These are the youngest  most vulnerable victims in our society  and it   s our moral responsibility to protect them     said Senator Kerry       The bipartisan bill     Masha   s Law     which is named after a 5 year old Russian orphan who was sexually abused by the American man who adopted her  was authored by Kerry and is co sponsored by Isakson         What happened to Masha was a terrible tragedy that should never be repeated  Unfortunately  reminders of her horrific ordeal remain posted on the Internet for all to see every day     Senator Isakson said     We must impose more severe penalties against those who download these disgusting images of our nation   s innocent children        Kerry was inspired to write this legislation after learning of Masha   a 5 year old girl adopted from a Russian orphanage in 1998 by Matthew Mancuso  who began sexually abusing Masha the first night she spent with him   Mancuso began disseminating Masha   s pictures over the Internet almost immediately  which is what led law enforcement to his home  where they were shocked to find that the victim was Mancuso   s adopted daughter   Subsequently  Masha was removed from the home and Mancuso was arrested  tried and convicted   He was found guilty of 11 counts of child sexual abuse stemming from his abuse of Masha  but her images   hundreds of them   are on the Internet and being downloaded around the world    And while the man who sexually abused Masha and posted the pictures on the web is in jail  the damage will continue until people stop downloading pictures of her off the Internet       Under current law  a victim of child exploitation is entitled to civil statutory damages in U S  District Court in the amount of  50 000   If someone downloads a song off the Internet  federal copyright law provides for statutory damages to be awarded to the copyright holder in the amount of  150 000   Kerry   s legislation increases the statutory damages a victim of child exploitation can recover to at least  150 000   This increased penalty will serve as a deterrent to those who disseminate and possess child pornography  as well as a means of compensating victims of this terrible abuse       The legislation will also fix a flaw in the current law that prevents adults from suing those who download images of them taken as minors   The current statute states that    any minor who is a victim of a violation  of the act  may sue in United States District Court      This language has been interpreted literally by a federal district court to restrict recovery to only those victims who are under 18 at the time of the crime   Thus  when victims turn 18 they cannot recover against their perpetrators even if pornographic images of them as children are still being distributed via the Internet   Kerry   s legislation would clarify the statute to include victims of child pornography who are injured after they turn 18 by the downloading of their pornographic images                                                                                     20510
