Security will release an investigation today into port security     an investigation John Kerry called for eight months ago to fix gaping holes in the security of America   s ports             Today   s Inspector General   s report was required by an amendment John Kerry authored to the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill last year             It   s been more than four years since 9 11  and the government still can   t get port security right   The incompetent handling of the Dubai Ports deal was just the tip of the iceberg   Shiploads of cargo slip into our ports uninspected and the Department of Homeland Security wastes millions on idiotic projects that score zero on their own threat scale while needed security improvements aren   t happening and our ports and cities remain vulnerable     said John Kerry         Kerry   s amendment required the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress on the department   s progress implementing 12 recommended changes to improve the Port Security Grant Program          In January 2005  the Department of Homeland Security   s Inspector General issued a report criticizing the department   s management of the Port Security Grant Program  saying there is    no assurance that the program is protecting the nation   s most critical and vulnerable infrastructure and assets      The Inspector General found that many of the projects that received funding lacked merit  the program   s bureaucracy prevented money from getting to the most vulnerable ports and that available assessments of ports    infrastructure and vulnerabilities were not used effectively          Today   s report shows that bureaucratic bungling continues to hamper work to secure America   s ports   In the report  the Inspector General notes that    it is not clear that DHS knows how much actual risk reduction has been achieved           Summary of today   s report     Of the 132 projects that received funding in the latest round of port security grants  the Inspector General identified 20 projects     totaling  29 3 million  or 20 percent of total grant funds     that Department of Homeland Security reviewers found did not meet    national security priorities but were funded nonetheless      Some of these projects scored zero on the national priority threat scale          After last year   s Inspector General report came out  the Department of Homeland Security started ranking projects on a point scale   A project could get 20 points if it qualified as a national priority  5 points if it is consistent with the Area Maritime Security Plan  5 points if it meshes with local security priorities  and 5 points for cost effectiveness     for a total of 35 points           Although this ranking system shows a preference for projects that have national significance  Department of Homeland Security still has no minimum scoring threshold for projects   The Inspector General said     The absence of a minimum scoring threshold      resulted in the program funding projects that provided no national threat priority reduction or were ranked below other projects      The report also says that    projects not meeting such a threshold should not be funded             Examples of merit less projects that received funding   The Department of Homeland Security funded a  136 000 project to place security lights on a bridge even though it scored zero on the national priority threat    The Department of Homeland Security gave  3 110 to provide generators to power a lighting system for which they had already denied funding     Example of project with merit that was denied funding      Although the Department of Homeland Security favorably reviewed a project to expand interoperability though an expanded central dispatch     and scored the project at 25     it was not funded  The field review even said    the layered security provided by implementing communication interoperability system dramatically reduces the risk for all these critical infrastructures and enables all local law enforcement  as well as Federal and industrial agencies to respond to any potential threats or breaches of security             Millions to Fortune 500 Companies  Of the 20 projects that received a score of 0 in the national threat priority criteria  12 were private sector projects    According to the Inspector General  the Department of Homeland Security awarded  1 million to a Fortune 500 Company for fencing and surveillance upgrades  even though the company had a 3rd quarter net income of  1 2 billion                                                                            20510
