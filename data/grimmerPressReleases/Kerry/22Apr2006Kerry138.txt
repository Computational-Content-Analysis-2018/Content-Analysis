testimony  Kerry says history repeating itself

 s historic Faneuil Hall today about patriotism and dissent at a time of war and the assault on free speech in America today   Below are Kerry   s remarks as prepared for delivery        Senator John Kerry       Dissent       Faneuil Hall    April 22  2006    As prepared for delivery     Thirty five years ago today  I testified before the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate  and called for an end to the war I had returned from fighting not long before        It was 1971     twelve years after the first American died in what was then South Vietnam  seven years after Lyndon Johnson seized on a small and contrived incident in the Tonkin Gulf to launch a full scale war   and three years after Richard Nixon was elected president on the promise of a secret plan for peace   We didn   t know it at the time  but four more years of the War in Vietnam still lay ahead   These were years in which the Nixon administration lied and broke the law   and claimed it was prolonging war to protect our troops as they withdrew   years that ultimately ended only when politicians in Washington decided they would settle for a    decent interval    between the departure of our forces and the inevitable fall of Saigon        I know that some active duty service members  some veterans  and certainly some politicians scorned those of us who spoke out  suggesting our actions failed to    support the troops      which to them meant continuing to support the war  or at least keeping our mouths shut   Indeed  some of those critics said the same thing just two years ago during the presidential campaign        I have come here today to reaffirm that it was right to dissent in 1971 from a war that was wrong   And to affirm that it is both a right and an obligation for Americans today to disagree with a President who is wrong  a policy that is wrong  and a war in Iraq that weakens the nation      I believed then  just as I believe now  that the best way to support the troops is to oppose a course that squanders their lives  dishonors their sacrifice  and disserves our people and our principles   When brave patriots suffer and die on the altar of stubborn pride  because of the incompetence and self deception of mere politicians  then the only patriotic choice is to reclaim the moral authority misused by those entrusted with high office        I believed then  just as I believe now  that it is profoundly wrong to think that fighting for your country overseas and fighting for your country   s ideals at home are contradictory or even separate duties   They are  in fact  two sides of the very same patriotic coin   And that   s certainly what I felt when I came home from Vietnam convinced that our political leaders were waging war simply to avoid responsibility for the mistakes that doomed our mission in the first place  Indeed  one of the architects of the war  Defense Secretary Robert McNamara  confessed in a recent book that he knew victory was no longer a possibility far earlier than 1971        By then  it was clear to me that hundreds of thousands of soldiers  sailors  Marines and airmen   disproportionately poor and minority Americans   were being sent into the valley of the shadow of death for an illusion privately abandoned by the very men in Washington who kept sending them there   All the horrors of a jungle war against an invisible enemy indistinguishable from the people we were supposed to be protecting   all the questions associated with quietly sanctioned violence against entire villages and regions   all the confusion and frustration that came from defending a corrupt regime in Saigon that depended on Americans to do too much of  the fighting   all that cried out for dissent  demanded truth  and could not be denied by easy slogans like    peace with honor      or by the politics of fear and smear   It was time for the truth  and time for it all to end  and my only regret in joining the anti war movement was that it took so long to succeed   for the truth to prevail  and for America to regain confidence in our own deepest values       The fissures created by Vietnam have long been stubbornly resistant to closure  But I am proud it was the dissenters   and it was our veterans    movement   and people like Judy Droz Keyes   who battled not just to end the war but to combat government secrecy and the willful amnesia of a society that did not want to remember its obligations to the soldiers who fought  We fought the forgetting and pushed our nation to confront the war   s surplus of sad legacies   Agent Orange  Amer Asian orphans  abandoned allies  exiled and imprisoned draft dodgers  doubts about whether all our POWs had come home  and honor at last for those who returned from Vietnam and those who did not  Because we spoke out  the truth was ultimately understood that the faults in Vietnam were those of the war  not the warriors     Then  and even now  there were many alarmed by dissent   many who thought that staying the course would eventually produce victory   or that admitting the mistake and ending it would embolden our enemies around the world   History disproved them before another decade was gone   Fourteen years elapsed between the first major American commitment of helicopters and pilots to Vietnam and the fall of Saigon   Fourteen years later  the Berlin Wall fell  and with it the Communist threat   You cannot tell me that withdrawing from Vietnam earlier would have changed that outcome        The lesson here is not that some of us were right about Vietnam  and some of us were wrong   The lesson is that true patriots must defend the right of dissent  and hear the voices of dissenters  especially now  when our leaders have committed us to a pre emptive    war of choice    that does not involve the defense of our people or our territory against aggressors   The patriotic obligation to speak out becomes even more urgent when politicians refuse to debate their policies or disclose the facts  And even more urgent when they seek  perversely  to use their own military blunders to deflect opposition and answer their own failures with more of the same   Presidents and politicians may worry about losing face  or votes  or legacy  it is time to think about young Americans and innocent civilians who are losing their lives        This is not the first time in American history when patriotism has been distorted to deflect criticism and mislead the nation        In the infancy of the Republic  in 1798  Congress enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts to smear Thomas Jefferson and accuse him of treason   Newspapers were shut down  and their editors arrested  including Benjamin Franklin   s grandson   No wonder Thomas Jefferson himself said     Dissent is the greatest form of patriotism           In the Mexican War  a young Congressman named Abraham Lincoln was driven from public life for raising doubts about official claims   And in World War I  America   s values were degraded  not defended  when dissenters were jailed and the teaching of German was banned in public schools in some states  At that time it was apparently sounding German  not looking French  that got you in trouble   And it was panic and prejudice  not true patriotism  that brought the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II   a measure upheld by Supreme Court Justices who did not uphold their oaths to defend the Constitution  We are stronger today because no less a rock ribbed conservative than Robert Taft        Mr  Republican    himself     stood up and said at the height of the second World War that     the maintenance of the right of criticism in the long run will do the country maintaining it a great deal more good than it will do the enemy  and will prevent mistakes which might otherwise occur           Even during the Cold War   an undeclared war  and often more a war of nerves and diplomacy than of arms   even the mildest dissenters from official policy were sometimes silenced  blacklisted  or arrested  especially during the McCarthy era of the early 1950s   Indeed  it was only when Joseph McCarthy went through the gates of delirium and began accusing distinguished U S  diplomats and military leaders of treason that the two parties in Washington and the news media realized the common stake they had in the right to dissent  They stood up to a bully and brought down McCarthyism   s ugly and contrived appeals to a phony form of 100  Americanism        Dissenters are not always right  but it is always a warning sign when they are accused of unpatriotic sentiments by politicians seeking a safe harbor from debate  from accountability  or from the simple truth        Truth is the American bottom line  Truth above all is fundamental to who we are   It is no accident that among the first words of the first declaration of our national existence it is proclaimed     We hold these truths to be self evident              This hall and this Commonwealth have always been at the forefront of seeking out and living out the truth in the conduct of public life   Here Massachusetts defined human rights by adopting our own Bill of Rights  here we took a stand against slavery  for women   s suffrage and civil rights for all Americans   The bedrock of America   s greatest advances   the foundation of what we know today are defining values   was formed not by cheering on things as they were  but by taking them on and demanding change        And here and now we must insist again that fidelity  honor  and love of country demand untrammeled debate and open dissent   At no time is that truer than in the midst of a war rooted in deceit and justified by continuing deception   For what is at stake here is nothing less than life itself   As the statesman Edmund Burke once said     A conscientious man should be cautious how he dealt in blood         Think about that now   in a new era that has brought old temptations and tested abiding principles      America has always embraced the best traditions of civilized conduct toward combatants and non combatants in war   But today our leaders hold themselves above the law   in the way they not only treat prisoners in Abu Ghraib  but assert unchecked power to spy on American citizens       America has always rejected war as an instrument of raw power or naked self interest  We fought when we had to in order to repel grave threats or advance freedom and self determination in concert with like minded people everywhere   But our current leadership  for all its rhetoric of freedom and democracy  behaves as though might does make right  enabling us to discard the alliances and institutions that served us so well in the past as nothing more now than impediments to the exercise of unilateral power        America has always been stronger when we have not only proclaimed free speech  but listened to it   Yes  in every war  there have been those who demand suppression and silencing   And although no one is being jailed today for speaking out against the war in Iraq  the spirit of intolerance for dissent has risen steadily  and the habit of labeling dissenters as unpatriotic has become the common currency of the politicians currently running our country        Dismissing dissent is not only wrong  but dangerous when America   s leadership is unwilling to admit mistakes  unwilling to engage in honest discussion of the nation   s direction  and unwilling to hold itself accountable for the consequences of decisions made without genuine disclosure  or genuine debate        In recent weeks  a number of retired high ranking military leaders  several of whom played key combat or planning roles in Afghanistan and Iraq  have come forward publicly to call for the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld   And across the administration  from the president on down  we   ve heard these calls dismissed or even attacked as acts of disloyalty  or as threats to civilian control of the armed forces   We have even heard accusations that this dissent gives aid and comfort to the enemy   That is cheap and it is shameful   And once again we have seen personal attacks on the character of those who speak out  How dare those who never wore the uniform in battle attack those who wore it all their lives   and who  retired or not  did not resign their citizenship in order to serve their country        The former top operating officer at the Pentagon  a Marine Lieutenant General  said    the commitment of our forces to this fight was done with a casualness and swagger that are the special province of those who have never had to execute these missions  or bury the results     It is hard for a career military officer to speak those words  But at a time when the administration cannot let go of the myths and outright lies it broadcast in the rush to war in Iraq  those who know better must speak out        At a time when mistake after mistake is being compounded by the very civilian leadership in the Pentagon that ignored expert military advice in the invasion and occupation of Iraq  those who understand the price being paid for each mistake by our troops  our country  and Iraq itself must be heard        Once again we are imprisoned in a failed policy  And once again we are being told that admitting mistakes  not the mistakes themselves  will provide our enemies with an intolerable propaganda victory  Once again we are being told that we have no choice but to stay the course of a failed policy  At a time like this  those who seek to reclaim America   s true character and strength must be respected        The true defeatists today are not those who call for recognizing the facts on the ground in Iraq   The true defeatists are those who believe America is so weak that it must sacrifice its principles to the pursuit of illusory power        The true pessimists today are not those who know that America can handle the truth about the Administration   s boastful claim of    Mission Accomplished    in Iraq   The true pessimists are those who cannot accept that America   s power and prestige depend on our credibility at home and around the world  The true pessimists are those who do not understand that fidelity to our principles is as critical to national security as our military power itself      And the most dangerous defeatists  the most dispiriting pessimists  are those who invoke September 11th to argue that our traditional values are a luxury we can no longer afford        Let   s call it the Bush Cheney Doctrine        According to the Bush Cheney Doctrine  alliances and international institutions are now disposable   and international institutions are dispensable or even despicable      According to the Bush Cheney Doctrine  we cannot foreswear the fool   s gold of information secured by torturing prisoners or creating a shadow justice system with no rules and no transparency      According to the Bush Cheney Doctrine  unwarranted secrecy and illegal spying are now absolute imperatives of our national security        According to the Bush Cheney Doctrine  those who question the abuse of power question America itself        According to the Bush Cheney doctrine  an Administration should be willing to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on the Iraq war  but unwilling to spend a few billion dollars to secure the American ports through which nuclear materials could make their way to terrorist cells       According to the Bush Cheney Doctrine  executive powers trump the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers      According to the Bush Cheney Doctrine  smearing administration critics is not only permissible  but necessary   and revealing the identity of a CIA agent is an acceptable means to hide the truth      The raw justification for abandoning so many American traditions exposes the real danger of the Bush Cheney Doctrine  We all understand we are in a long struggle against jihadist extremism  It does represent a threat to our vital security interests and our values  Even the Bush Cheney Administration acknowledges this is preeminently an ideological war  but that   s why the Bush Cheney Doctrine is so ill equipped to fight and win it        Our enemies argue that all our claims about advancing universal principles of human rights and mutual respect disguise a raw demand for American dominance   They gain every time we tolerate or cover up abuses of human rights in Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo Bay  or among sectarian militias in Iraq  and especially when we defiantly disdain the rules of international law        Our enemies argue that our invasion and occupation of Iraq reflect an obsession with oil supplies and commercial opportunities   They gain when our president and vice president  both former oil company executives  continue to pursue an oil based energy strategy  and provide vast concessions in Iraq to their corporate friends        And so there   s the crowning irony  the Bush Cheney Doctrine holds that many of our great traditions cannot be maintained  yet the Bush Cheney policies  by abandoning those traditions  give Osama bin Laden and his associates exactly what they want and need to reinforce their hate filled ideology of Islamic solidarity against the western world        I understand fully that Iraq is not Vietnam  and the war on terrorism is not the Cold War   But in one very crucial respect  we are in the same place now as we were thirty five years ago   When I testified in 1971  I spoke out not just against the war itself  but the blindness and cynicism of political leaders who were sending brave young Americans to be killed or maimed for a mission the leaders themselves no longer believed in      The War in Vietnam and the War in Iraq are now converging in too many tragic respects        As in Vietnam  we engaged militarily in Iraq based on official deception      As in Vietnam  we went into Iraq ostensibly to fight a larger global war under the misperception that the particular theater was just a sideshow  but we soon learned that the particular aspects of the place where we fought mattered more than anything else      And as in Vietnam  we have stayed and fought and died even though it is time for us to go        We are now in the third war in Iraq in as many years  The first was against Saddam Hussein and his supposed weapons of mass destruction  The second was against terrorists whom  the administration said  it was better to fight over there than here  Now we find our troops in the middle of an escalating civil war      Half of the service members listed on the Vietnam Memorial Wall died after America   s leaders knew our strategy would not work  It was immoral then and it would be immoral now to engage in the same delusion  We want democracy in Iraq  but Iraqis must want it as much as we do  Our valiant soldiers can   t bring democracy to Iraq if Iraq   s leaders are unwilling themselves to make the compromises that democracy requires      As our generals have said  the war cannot be won militarily  It must be won politically  No American soldier should be sacrificed because Iraqi politicians refuse to resolve their ethnic and political differences      Our call to action is clear  Iraqi leaders have responded only to deadlines   a deadline to transfer authority to a provisional government  and a deadline to hold three elections  It was the most intense 11th hour pressure that just pushed aside Prime Minister Jaafari and brought forward a more acceptable candidate  And it will demand deadline toughness to reign in Shiite militias Sunnis say are committing horrific acts of torture every day in Baghdad       So we must set another deadline to extricate our troops and get Iraq up on its own two feet      Iraqi politicians should be told that they have until May 15 to deal with these intransigent issues and at last put together an effective unity government or we will immediately withdraw our military  If Iraqis aren   t willing to build a unity government in the five months since the election  they   re probably not willing to build one at all  The civil war will only get worse  and we will have no choice anyway but to leave      If Iraq   s leaders succeed in putting together a government  then we must agree on another deadline  a schedule for withdrawing American combat forces by year   s end  Doing so will actually empower the new Iraqi leadership  put Iraqis in the position of running their own country and undermine support for the insurgency  which is fueled in large measure by the majority of Iraqis who want us to leave their country     So now  as in 1971  we are engaged in another fight to live the truth and make our own government accountable   As in 1971  this is another moment when American patriotism demands more dissent and less complacency in the face of bland assurances from those in power        We must insist now that patriotism does not belong to those who defend a President   s position   it belongs to those who defend their country  Patriotism is not love of power  it is love of country  And sometimes loving your country demands you must tell the truth to power  This is one of those times      Lives are on the line   Lives have been lost to bad decisions     not decisions that could have gone either way  but decisions that constitute basic negligence and incompetence  And lives continue to be lost because of stubbornness and pride      We support the troops   the brave men and women who have always protected us and do so today   in part by honoring their service  and in part by making sure they have everything they need both in battle and after they have borne the burden of battle      But I believe now as strongly and proudly as I did thirty five years ago that the most important way to support the troops is to tell the truth  and to ensure we do not ask young Americans to die in a cause that falls short of the ideals of this country      When we protested the war in Vietnam some would weigh in against us saying     My country right or wrong      Our response was simple     Yes  my country right or wrong   When right  keep it right and when wrong  make it right     And that   s what we must do again today                                                                                     20510                                                                                                                                                                                          Contact           Sitemap
