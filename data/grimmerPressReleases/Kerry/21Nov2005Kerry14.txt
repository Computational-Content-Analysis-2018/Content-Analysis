the following response to the latest attacks by Vice President Dick Cheney this morning   Below are Senator Kerry   s remarks as prepared for delivery                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Vice President Cheney is rewriting the reason the Administration went into Iraq            Instead of engaging in this kind of political spin  the White House should be trying to fix the problems their three years of incompetence have caused   There s no time to wait   Half the Iraqi population thinks it   s okay to attack Americans  over 80 percent of the population wants us gone    and this information comes from our one significant ally in Iraq  Great Britain            Iraq s political leaders today called for a timetable for foreign troops to leave Iraq   We should seize this opportunity to force the Iraqis to accept more responsibility for their own country   Iraqis should be policing Iraqi streets  Iraqis should be searching Iraqi homes  and Iraqis should be fighting for Iraq             Secretary Rumsfeld agreed with me  and announced publicly they are going to withdraw the troops they put in for the election and the referendum  and bring it back to 138 000  just as General Casey has submitted plans to the Pentagon for a phased withdrawal of troops  Americans want the truth  Americans want leadership that is equal to the sacrifice of our troops  and they want real answers about how we are going to protect our troops and how we are going to be successful in Iraq          Again today  Vice President Cheney is trying to avoid the real debate   He continued to insult those of us who think there s a better way in Iraq   No matter what the Vice President says  asking tough questions isn   t pessimism  it   s patriotism   I believe that during wartime we should ask the hardest questions of all   It s the only way to do what   s right for our troops instead of repeating the same mistakes over and over again            The Vice President continued to mislead America today by saying Congress saw and heard the same intelligence the White House did   We did not            Does the Vice President deny what the White House has already admitted    that the President made false statements about Iraq s nuclear program in the State of the Union address even though the CIA told them three times not to   Does he deny that top Administration officials repeatedly made statements about Iraq training Al Qaeda in weapons making  despite the fact the Defense Intelligence Agency has already concluded the source was likely a fabricator           It   s also wrong to continue to pretend that the Intelligence Committee has determined the intelligence on Iraq was not misused by the Administration   That is why Democrats have been pushing the Senate Intelligence Committee to complete a thorough and balanced investigation into the issue  and it   s why Democrats were forced to shut down the Senate and go into closed session to make the Republicans take this issue seriously            No one has less credibility on Iraq than Dick Cheney   His top national security advisor has been indicted   He led the march to war   He fought to kick out the inspectors because they weren   t finding any weapons of mass destruction   And he   s been on the attack   instead of searching for the truth   ever since            The Administration should call off their attack dogs  which have been tearing into Jack Murtha   a Marine for 37 years who lives and breathes concerns of our troops  and who acknowledges what our military knows    the huge problem we face of a long term  massive American presence in Iraq    I won   t stand for Swift Boat style attacks against Jack Murtha   And I won t stand for their continued misleading  about Jack Murtha and about the truth            Q   A TRANSCRIPTION       Question 1  Do you believe that the troops should withdraw from Iraq       KERRY  Over a period of time under proper circumstances  and I have laid out a plan for that  My plan is based on success  I   ve laid out a plan where you establish a series of very specific benchmarks for Iraqi performance  and with each benchmark  our troops should be able to return home   Clearly I   ve laid out a way where we could have made very different choices in Iraq  and I regret that this administration has never reached out to work in a bipartisan way  and has never done the work necessary to put these steps in place       Question 2  Do you think that can been done in six month time frame       KERRY  It can be done in about a year  My plan  others have different plans  but in my plan is about a year or so       Question 3  Do you think the vice president lied to the American people       KERRY   I   ve never used that word  I don   t like the word   I   ve said he misled America and they continue to mislead America      Question 4  What   s the difference       KERRY  I think misleading is a question of intent  I think they misled America and are still misleading America   You can fight about the words                                                                           20510
