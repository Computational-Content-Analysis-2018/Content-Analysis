Deal to Put Fans First                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON D C    Senator John Kerry will chair a Full Committee Hearing called  Exclusive Sports Programming  Examining Competition and Consumer Choice   today at 10 00 a m   in room 253 of the Russell Senate Office Building     Below is Senator Kerry s statement  as prepared for delivery     I would like to welcome our witnesses   We are conducting this hearing today to discuss sports programming in general    and baseball in particular   a very popular topic this time of year in Massachusetts and all over the country        Last year  baseball fans were able to buy what are called  out of market games  through their cable and satellite providers   The package of games is called  Extra Innings   and allows fans to follow their home team   So Red Sox s fans living in Washington or California could still get access to most Red Sox games for about what it costs a family of four to attend a game          Press reports indicated that Major League Baseball was close to announcing an exclusive deal with DirecTV for carriage of these games   We will evaluate this deal         Yogi Berra was once heard to say   You ve got to be very careful if you don t know where you are going    because you might not get there          That sentiment is as timely now as ever   We want to examine where the parties are going   and whether this deal will get them there    Is this type of deal in the best interest of consumers   Does it serve the sports fans   These are legitimate questions           Baseball is an integral part of American culture   Commissioner Selig himself has said that baseball is a social institution with enormous social responsibility   I agree with him          Recognizing that  baseball has benefited from an array of favorable Government policies   The sport enjoys a broad antitrust exemption   It allows them to negotiate carriage deals  and gives them tremendous market power        They receive Billions of hard earned tax dollars to support stadium construction   Right now  only a few blocks away from here  the new Washington Nationals stadium is being built   One Economist estimates that between 1989  2001 16 baseball only stadiums were constructs at a total cost of  4 9 billion    3 7 billion of that cost borne by public revenues    taxpayer money        We should support baseball  and in return  I believe baseball should serve the public interest   It is fair to expect baseball to provide broad access to their games          Last year  it cost a family of four almost  180 to attend a Major League Baseball game   For too many families and people living on fixed incomes  the cost of attending a game is getting out of reach   Still  a record total of 76 million fans attended Major League Baseball games last year          We are now less than a week away from the baseball season and over 250 000 people will lose access to their team s games          Let me say at the outset  I am concerned about exclusive carriage deals in the sports industry   These deals may be good for the short term financial interests of the sports leagues  they may improve the competitive position of the cable or satellite firms that get the rights    I have no doubt that there are business advantages           But we need to discuss the impact of these business changes on baseball fans as well   I am concerned when fans lose access to their favorite team  or  as we will discover today  they are forced to change their TV service just to see games   That is wrong   That is a sign that the system is not working        The sports leagues have tremendous market power   We need to ensure that the deals that are cut serve the public interest         Yogi Berra also was heard saying   You can observe a lot just by watching           Well  the American people are watching  and fans are watching  and they have not been shy to express their feelings about this deal   Truth be told  baseball fans all over this country are disappointed and some are outraged          As we stand here today  approximately 260 000 baseball fans that currently pay a premium to see their team will lose access to those games   unless they switch to DirecTV           Baseball is important to America  I believe that baseball fans living outside the state of their favorite team should continue to have access to Major League games without having to cancel their current service           Why should fans have to do that   We have heard from many fans that do not have the ability to switch to satellite if they want to   That is not fair  and I m not sure it is in the long term interest of the sport        With today s hearing  we will get the facts on the record   And I urge the parties to work together  in good faith  to ensure we have broad carriage of the Extra Innings package this year         I welcome our witnesses          The witnesses testifying at the hearing will be        Mr  Robert DuPuy      President and Chief Operating Officer      Major League Baseball         Mr  Chase Carey      Chief Executive Officer      DIRECTV Group  Inc          Mr  Rob Jacobson      President and Chief Executive Officer      iN DEMAND Networks         Mr  Carl Vogel      Chairman
