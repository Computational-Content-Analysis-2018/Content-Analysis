                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                There   s something much worse than being accused of    flip flopping     refusing to flip when it   s obvious that your course of action is a flop      I say this to President Bush as someone who learned the hard way how embracing the world   s complexity can be twisted into a crude political shorthand  Barbed words can make for great politics  But with U S  troops in Iraq in the middle of an escalating civil war  this is no time for politics  Refusing to change course for fear of the political fallout is not only dangerous     it is immoral      I   d rather explain a change of position any day than look a parent in the eye and tell them that their son or daughter had to die so that a broken policy could live      No one should be looking for vindication in what is happening in Iraq today  The lesson here is not that some of us were right about Iraq or that some of us were wrong  The lesson is simply that we need to change course rapidly rather than perversely use mistakes already made and lives already given as an excuse to make more mistakes and lose even more lives      When young Americans are being killed and maimed  when the Middle East is on the brink of three civil wars  even the most vaunted    steadfastness    morphs pretty quickly into stubbornness  and resolve becomes recklessness      Changing tactics in the face of changing conditions on the ground  developing new strategies because the old ones don   t work  is a hell of a lot smarter than the insanity of doing the same thing over and over again with the same tragic results      Half of the service members listed on the Vietnam War Memorial died after America   s leaders knew that our strategy in that war was not working      Was then secretary of defense Robert McNamara steadfast as he continued to send American troops to die for a war he knew privately could not be won      History does not remember his resolve     it remembers his refusal to confront reality      Clark Clifford  the man who succeeded McNamara in 1968  was hand picked by President Lyndon B  Johnson because he was a renowned hawk  But the new defense secretary reviewed the Vietnam policy and concluded that    we cannot realistically expect to achieve anything more through our military force  and the time has come to begin to disengage     By the time he left office  he had refused to endorse a further military build up  supported the halt in our bombing and urged negotiation and gradual disengagement  Was Clifford a flip flopper of historic proportions  or did he in fact demonstrate the courage of his convictions      We can not afford to waste time being told that admitting mistakes  not the mistakes themselves  will provide our enemies with an intolerable propaganda victory  We   ve already lost years being told that we have no choice but to stay the course of a failed policy      This isn   t a time for stubbornness  nor is it a time for half way solutions     or warmed over    new    solutions that our own experience tells us will only make the problem worse  The Iraq Study Group tells us that    the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating    and joins the chorus of experts in and outside of Baghdad reminding us that there is no military solution to a political crisis  And yet  over the warnings of former secretary of state Colin Powell  Gen  John Abizaid and the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff  Washington is considering a    troop build up    option  sending more troops into harm   s way to referee a civil war      We have already tried a trimmed down version of the McCain plan of indefinitely increasing troop levels  We sent 15 000 more troops to Baghdad last summer  and today the escalating civil war is even worse  You could put 100 000 more troops in tomorrow and you   re only going to add to the number of casualties until Iraqis sit down together at a bargaining table and compromise  The barrel of a gun can   t answer the question of how you force Iraqi nationalism to trump sectarian loyalty      The only hope for stability lies in pushing Iraqis to forge a sustainable political agreement on federalism  distributing oil revenues and neutralizing sectarian militias  And that will only happen if we set a deadline to redeploy our troops      Last May  Gen  George W  Casey  the head of U S  forces in Iraq  and U S  Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad gave the new Iraqi government six months to make the necessary political compromises  But a deadline with no teeth is only lip service  How many times do we have to see that Iraqi politicians only respond to firm  specific deadlines     a deadline to transfer authority  deadlines to hold two elections and a referendum  and a deadline to form a government     before we understand that it   s time to make it clear that we are leaving and that we will not sacrifice American lives for the sake of squabbling Iraqi politicians      Another case where steadfastness long ago gave way to stubbornness is our approach to Iraq   s neighbors  Last week in Damascus  Sen  Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and I met with Syrian president Bashir al Assad  We were clear about U S  expectations for change in his regime   s policies  but we found potential for cooperation with Syria in averting a disaster in Iraq     potential that should be put to the test  Washington can   t remain on the sidelines  stubbornly clinging to a belief that talking to our enemies rewards hostile regimes      Conversation is not capitulation  Until recently  it was widely accepted that good foreign policy demands a willingness to seize opportunities and change policy as the facts change  That   s neither flip flopping nor rudderless diplomacy     it   s strength      How else could we end up with the famous mantra that    only Nixon could go to China     For decades  Richard Nixon built his reputation as a China hawk  In 1960  he took John Kennedy to task for being soft on China  He called isolating China a    moral position    that    flatly rejected cowardly expediency     Then  when China broke with the Soviet Union during his presidency  he saw an opportunity to weaken our enemies and make Americans safer  His 1972 visit to China was a major U S  diplomatic victory in the Cold War      Ronald Reagan was no shape shifter  either  but after calling the Soviet Union the    evil empire     he met repeatedly with its leaders  When Reagan saw an opportunity for cooperation with Mikhail Gorbachev  he reached out and tested our enemies    intentions  History remembers that he backed tough words with tough decisions     and  yes  that he changed course even as he remained true to his principles     President Bush and all of us who grew up in the shadows of World War II remember Winston Churchill     his grit  his daring  his resolve  I remember listening to his speeches on a vinyl album in the pre iPod era      Two years ago I spoke about Iraq at Westminster College in Fulton  Mo   where Churchill had drawn a line between freedom and fear in his    Iron Curtain    speech  I reread some of the words that made him famous  I looked closer and something caught my eye  When Churchill urged us to     Never give in  never give in  never  never  never  never     in nothing  great or small  large or petty  never give in     he added     except to convictions of honour and good sense
