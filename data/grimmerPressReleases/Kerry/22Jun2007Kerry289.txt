Senator John Kerry issued the following statement on the Senates successful passage of comprehensive energy legislation  the National Energy and Environmental Security Act of 2007  The bill passed the Senate on a 65 27 vote  after Senator Kerry brokered a deal with Republicans and Democrats to improve vehicle mileage standards to 35 mpg over the next 10 years    This energy bill represents a long overdue break with the status quo and a first step towards a cleaner future where we break the stranglehold of foreign oil and address climate change  Kerry said  It helps us cut down on use of polluting fossil fuels while simultaneously creating new incentives for alternative fuels and energy efficiency  It supports pioneering scientific efforts to trap the pollution emitted by burning coal  Finally  I am most proud of the first in a generation progress we made on improving the fuel efficiency standards for our vehicles  This was a long time coming and I look forward to a day when every car on the road is getting better mileage than it does today    Kerry also welcomed provisions in the bill that would assist small businesses  Americas small business owners will now have a partner in Washington to help them reduce their energy costs and empower them to be on the front lines fighting global climate change  said Kerry  as Chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship  Our provisions will provide the resources to help entrepreneurs conduct energy audits  access loans for investing in renewable energy  and ensure the Administration implements an energy efficiency information program that Congress enacted two years ago     Below are some of the highlights of the legislation    Reduce petroleum dependence   Establishes an escalating goal for reducing U S  gasoline consumption  starting with 20 percent in 2017   That is enough to reduce world oil prices more than  2 50 barrel under current EIA assumptions and is five times the projected savings associated with drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge   The national goal for gasoline savings ramps up to 45 percent in 2030  equivalent to 5 6 million barrels of oil per day   That is more than twice the amount of oil the United States imported from the Persian Gulf in 2005   The legislation boosts renewable content in U S  gasoline  starting at 8 5 billion gallons in 2008  to 36 billion gallons in 2022 with specific requirements for the production of advanced biofuels from new  more efficient feedstocks   Thats enough to reduce projected U S  oil imports a million barrels per day   In addition  the fuel economy improvements in passenger cars and light trucks would save 1 2 million barrels of oil per day by 2020 and fuel economy improvements to medium and heavy duty trucks would save an additional 300 000 barrels per day  putting America well on the way to achieving the gasoline savings goal   Senate Energy Committee  Union of Concerned Scientists  The Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Bill  5 07    Reduce greenhouse gas emissions   The increased RFS is a positive step toward reducing U S  greenhouse gas emissions to combat the threat of global climate change   specifies that a renewable fuel included in the standard must emit 20 percent fewer lifecycle greenhouse gas  GHG  emissions than conventional gasoline   The Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  has found that biofuels easily meet  and sometimes dramatically exceed  this standard   Corn ethanol emits on average 21 8 percent fewer GHG emissions than conventional gasoline  biodiesel emits 67 7 percent fewer emissions  and cellulosic ethanol emits 90 9 percent fewer emissions  It would cut greenhouse gas emissions from cars by 15 to 18 percent by 2025  the equivalent of taking about 50 million cars off the road   Transportation emissions currently account for one third of U S  greenhouse gas emissions   EPA  Greenhouse Gas Impacts of Expanded Renewable and Alternative Fuels Use  4 07  Union of Concerned Scientists  The Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Bill  5 07  EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2007  data from Figure 92    Reduce taxpayer money spent to power the federal government   The government will help drive markets for new renewables and efficiency technologies  Requires the federal government to purchase ten percent renewable electricity by 2010  increasing to 15 percent by 2015   It will also ramp up federal building efficiency  requiring a 30 percent reduction in energy use by 2015   Cumulatively  a 30 percent reduction is enough to save 60 trillion BTUs of energy  15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide  and almost  4 billion in taxpayers money   More efficient lighting and other electrical equipment in GSA buildings  would not only cut energy bills and reduce energy use for lighting but also reduce the amount of waste heat produced by lighting  as the GSA Administrator testified   This in turn will reduce air conditioning needed to cool a building and result in even greater energy savings   Senate Energy Committee  Testimony before Senate EPW Committee  3 28 07    Boost consumer savings through energy efficiency   Lighting and common household appliances can drive as much as two thirds of an average American familys electricity bills   By improving a number of efficiency standards  and streamlining and strengthening the Department of Energys existing program  consumers stand to collect  12 billion in benefits   All together  the appliance efficiency provisions will save at least 50 billion kilowatt hours per year  or enough to power roughly 4 8 million typical U S  households   The legislation will save 17 trillion BTUs of natural gas per year  or enough to heat about a quarter million typical U S  homes   And it will conserve at least 560 million gallons of water per day  or 1 3 percent of daily potable water usage across the nation   Senate Energy Committee    Boost consumer savings on gasoline   Would save consumers  41 billion by 2025 with gasoline at  2 00 per gallon  even after accounting for the extra cost of purchasing a more fuel efficient vehicle   The additional investment of  1 100 per vehicle would be recovered in less than three years by the owner  faster when the price of gasoline is over  2 00 per gallon   Over the lifetime of the vehicle  the owner would save more than  3 600 in gasoline costs   Union of Concerned Scientists  The Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Bill  5 07    Advance development of carbon capture and storage technology through innovation   Carbon capture and sequestration is key technology to help reduce U S  greenhouse gas emissions   It may hold particular promise in reducing pollutants from power plants  since they produce an estimated one third of U S  carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels   Expands and improves the Department of Energys existing research in this area  and requires a national assessment of capacity to sequester carbon   Senate Energy Committee    Small Business provisions added to the energy bill will      Require the Small Business Administration  SBA  to implement within 90 days an energy efficiency program that was mandated in the 2005 Energy Policy Act      Establish an audit  program to increase energy efficiency using Small Business Development Centers  SBDCs       Promote financing agreements between small businesses and utility companies to increase energy efficiency      Create a telecommuting pilot program at the SBA responsible for educational materials and outreach to small businesses on the benefits of telecommuting      Allow small businesses conducting energy efficiency or renewable energy research and development to be given priority consideration in the Small Business Innovation Research  SBIR  and Small Business Technology Transfer  STTR  programs  and     Establish loans for small firms to invest in use of renewable sources of energy in their business
