Benchmarks Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Mr  Walker  thank you for coming before the Committee today  We appreciate your willingness to adjust your schedule to testify  and look forward to hearing about this significant and timely report  The GAO has earned its reputation for objective  factual  analysis something that has been in tragically short supply in the Washington debate over Iraq before the war  during the war  and still today as the occupation extends into its fourth year    That is why Congress asked for this non partisan assessment on whether the 18 key benchmarks for measuring political  security and economic progress  as originally agreed to by the Iraqi government in June of 2006    have been met  so that we can get an accurate picture of where we are in Iraq  and we go from here     No one should ignore the bottom line conclusion of your report  It clearly states that  The Iraqi government met 3  partially met 4  and did not meet 11 of its 18 benchmarks  Overall  key legislation has not been passed  violence remains high  and it remains unclear whether the Iraqi government will spend  10 billion in reconstruction funds    In other words  only three of these 18 benchmarks have actually been met  No matter what spin we may hear in the coming days  this independent assessment is a failing grade for a policy that simply isn t working    This conclusion appears to contrast with at least some aspects of the Administrations interim assessment of the benchmarks  delivered to Congress in July  which found that satisfactory progress had been made in meeting 8 of the 18 benchmarks  In particular  there seems to be some disagreement over whether the security situation has actually improved  whether the Iraqis have provided the 3 brigades required for the Baghdad security plan  and whether the Iraqis are meeting their commitments with respect to spending reconstruction funds     While we recognize the difference between making progress and actually meeting benchmarks  these discrepancies raise questions about the information that we are receiving from the Administration about the war in Iraq  We also need to be sure that the GAO received the full cooperation and support of the Department of Defense and White House in preparing this report    One thing we all agree on is that the escalation had a single  simple goal  to create breathing room for Iraqis to make the political compromises that will hold their country together and end their civil war  Even the White House acknowledges that there is no American military solution to an Iraqi civil war  Yet still  despite the obvious lack of movement on political reconciliation  we keep hearing that we are making progress in Iraq    The reality  as explained by your report  and supported by the consensus view of our sixteen intelligence agencies in the most recent National Intelligence Estimate  is that there has been no meaningful progress on meeting the key political benchmarks  In fact  your report concludes that the Iraqis met only one of the eight benchmarks for political progress  protecting the rights of minorities in Iraqs legislature  and partially met one other  The Iraqis have not yet agreed on the key issue of amending the Constitution  and crucial legislation on de Baathification  oil revenue sharing  provincial elections  amnesty and militia disarmament still has not been enacted    The GAO isn t alone  Your findings echo last month s NIE  another independent assessment which concluded that the overall level of violence remains high  the level of political progress has been negligible  and the Iraqi government will become more precarious over the next six to 12 months  We can see the unsettling news in Iraqi politics with our own eyes  15 of the 37 members of the Iraqi cabinet have now withdrawn their support  making it difficult to imagine how the national reconciliation efforts of the Shiite dominated government will be improving anytime soon     All summer  supporters of the escalation urged us to wait until September  Wait until September to give the escalation a chance  Wait until September to hear from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker  Well  September is here  and the result is as regrettable as it was predictable three or even six months ago  before hundreds more Americans had died  at an immeasurable cost of American lives  there was an escalation to buy time for political progress in Iraq  and without deadlines  without accountabilitythere has been no real political progress in Iraq    This Administration hasn t just failed to keep its promisesit has proven chronically unable to even hold itself to its own goals  Each time we hear  this is what we were trying to do all along  This is what really mattered  Mistake after mistake has been met not with a changed policy  but with changing rationales    The White House badly wants Americans to forget that the purpose of the escalation was to force political compromise over federalism  oil sharing  and the sectarian balance of powerwithout which there will be no peace  and they instead want to point to a few villages in Al Anbar as proof that the escalation is working  when by their own measurements it is not    In fact  just yesterday the President reiterated the same old line that some U S  forces may eventually be withdrawn if conditions improve  when it s long since been clear that setting a redeployment deadline is key to improving conditions    So as we reach another moment of reckoning this Septemberwith the long awaited Petraeus Report  it should surprise no one that the public report will be written not by the General  not by our Ambassador in Baghdad  but by the White House the White House which has again and again avoided the kind of plain  unadorned facts discussed in the GAO report    Instead of an honest appraisal of the escalation  this White House is again moving the goalposts and the shifting criteria  Their rationales may change  but one thing has been consistent  Their response to bad news has been and continues to be  simply change the story  What they can t change is the fact that time is not on our side  It s wrong to sacrifice so many American lives each month for a policy we know is not working    We need reports like the GAO s to lay out what s really happening in Iraq    and to help force policymakers in Washington to take responsibility and  most importantly  to take action  to take action so that Americans aren t asked to die for a policy that can t work    Thank you again for your testimony today
