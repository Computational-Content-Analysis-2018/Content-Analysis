troops must have every tool they need to succeed  Every recent commitment of American military power  including the    air war    in Kosovo  has required sizable ground forces  at the very least to

need for a Military Family Bill of Rights  a set of policies enshrined in law to meet the needs of America   s military families       Investing in military families isn   t just compassionate  it   s a smart investment in our national security  If we want to retain our most experienced troops  especially the noncommissioned officers who are the backbone of the Army and Marine Corps  we have to keep faith with their families  And if we are to improve recruiting rates  we have to provide for those who serve and their families       The Military Family Bill of Rights will           Expand Tricare to all Guard and Reserve members  whether mobilized or not  Members    failing physicals affects combat readiness  yet as many as one in five do not have health insurance           Allow widows to stay in military housing for one year  For those with young children  the current policy of 180 days can mean starting a school year in one state and finishing it in another           Establish a Military Family Relief Fund  Just as we let Americans donate a few dollars to finance presidential elections on their tax forms  they should be able to thank our troops  This program will meet the needs we can   t predict with the flexibility our service members and veterans deserve           Allow penalty free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts for deployment related expenses  such as increased child care           Offer a tax credit to small businesses that make up the difference between Reserve and National Guard members    civilian and military pay           Expand programs for post traumatic stress disorder and require more outreach  As many as one in six soldiers returning from Iraq show symptoms of the disorder  yet barely half of all Veterans Affairs medical centers have treatment centers           Increase the military death benefit  During last year   s campaign  I proposed increasing the benefit so that  combined with the service members    group life insurance  the families of those who die in service to our nation would receive  500 000  No one can put a price on a life  but the current  12 000 is insulting  The president recently embraced a formula to reach  500 000 but limited it to deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan  Congress should embrace the broader benefit for all troops  regardless of where they die  and act immediately to make it law       We have an obligation to keep faith with our men and women in uniform and their families  Truly supporting our troops requires that we act not just as individuals but as a nation  We owe them action in our nation   s capital  In today   s ever changing world  there is not a moment to lose      Kerry is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee
