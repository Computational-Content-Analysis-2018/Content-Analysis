John Kerry today told NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that he wants the league to take seriously complaints from injured retired players  who say they receive little medical guidance  counseling or assistance once their playing days are over and they live with debilitating injuries       I call on the NFL to get its house in order  said Kerry  I hope both the NFL and the Players Union will work together to eliminate any unnecessary red tape and provide the appropriate resources so that former players  who did so much to make the game what it is today  receive adequate compensation  If it doesnt I am prepared to introduce legislation to create an oversight commission to look at the actions of the retirement board  They must clean it up  or we will      Kerry said that if the NFL does not address this issue  he will introduce legislation that would create a commission to provide oversight of the NFLs Retirement Board  Kerrys remarks were made during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on the issue  Kerry is a senior member of the committee     Senator Kerrys statement as prepared is below      I first want to welcome the retired players who are here with us today  We thank you for your commitment to the game  You built the game of football with your backs and your bodies  and we are honored to have you here      We have heard a lot about the way the NFL has failed to take care of its retired players  particularly its disabled players  some of whom have long term disabilities from the injuries they sustained while playing the game  It is clear  the system has failed      I am glad we are holding this hearing to find out why  and to explore the system of benefits available to players  Today we will hear from retired players  the fathers of the game  who have been let down by the system      Their stories demonstrate a serious and immediate need by the National Football League and the Players Union to start working together to resolve the issue      Football is a dangerous sport  There is no question about it  Nearly half of all players retire because of injury  Sixty percent of players suffer a concussion and at least one quarter suffer multiple concussions      Through the years  too many players who have been sidelined due to injury have been pushed back into the field of play without consideration of the long term consequences of their injuries  While the NFL has been making progress on this front in recent years  I hope we can agree that all former players who need disability assistance should receive it    Unfortunately  despite the obvious violent nature of football  the statistics on how many former players qualify for disability benefits are shockingly low      The numbers are in dispute  but we are told that only 317 former players out of nearly 10 000 receive long term disability benefits  That translates to less than 3  of retired players  Out of 1052 applications filed for benefits  well more than half are denied       This points to a system that is broken  The players who built the game deserve more than delay and bureaucratic red tape  or worse  as some allege collusion and corruption in the process       At a bare minimum we need information and we need oversight  The National Football League  which exists today with unprecedented wealth and popularity  must resolve this  I hope both the NFL and the Players Union will work together to eliminate the unnecessary red tape and administrative burdens and provide resources so that former players  who did so much to make the game what it is today  receive adequate compensation       I call on the NFL to get its house in order  If it doesnt I am prepared to introduce legislation to create an oversight commission to look at the actions of the retirement board  They must clean it up  or we will       Witnesses   Mr  Daryl Johnston  FOX Sports Broadcaster   and former NFL Player  Dallas Cowboys Opening Remarks   Mr  Brent Boyd  former NFL
