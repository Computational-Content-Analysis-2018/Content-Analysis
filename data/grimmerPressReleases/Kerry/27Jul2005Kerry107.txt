       Releases                                                                                                                                           07 27 2005 John Kerry Says Revolution in Telecommunications Must be Addressed in Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Today Senator John Kerry spoke to The New Republic   s conference on telecommunications policy   The forum focused on the reauthorization of the Telecommunications Act of 1996   Senator Kerry   s remarks follow as prepared                                                                                                                                                                                             Ten years ago     broadband    wasn   t part of our vocabulary   Today  35 million households enjoy broadband service   a lot more  but nothing compared to what they   re doing in South Korea and elsewhere   Ten years ago only 25 million people used any wireless device   Today  192 million Americans use cell phones  PDAs or laptops with WiFi access   again  a huge improvement  although not to the level of some of our competitors  There   s no doubt much has changed since Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996  and we all tend to focus on the technological changes   But the important changes have not been limited to technological innovation        The industry has undergone a massive restructuring   Businesses that never competed with each other whether due to differences in technology  geography or regulation are now in direct competition   As a result  telecomm is a fundamentally different industry today than it was in 1996        The same goes for our economy   The rapid globalization of the past ten years has transformed the rules by which nearly every American business must operate   If we handle it right  this new arena can be a mutually beneficial opportunity for the telecom industry and the economy   Innovation is the great currency today  and this industry has plenty to spare   A new wave of change powered by a mass market in broadband and high capacity Internet service can bring interactivity  full motion video and a host of other functions rich in data and experience          It is not hyperbole to say that the innovation still ahead of us will touch almost every aspect of how we communicate in our businesses and our personal lives   It will improve our education  enhance health care services  connect small businesses to markets  drive productivity in the manufacturing and service sectors  and give consumers greater choice in the marketplace   But the conditions must be right for innovation        For this to happen  given the incredible reach of this industry  we need to recognize that all of America has a stake in this debate   All Americans need affordable access to voice  video and Internet services   Millions of companies  large and small  need a reliable network to reach their customers   The reality today is that individuals and businesses cannot compete without access        We have a moral obligation to get this right   Our health care professionals believe a safe system to move data from patient to doctor will save countless lives and reduce costs   Our first responders need a dependable  interoperable system to communicate in emergency situations   And if we expect our rural and inner city areas to begin sharing in our prosperity  we need to make sure we don   t leave them behind        Look  all of these stakeholders have legitimate concerns and all of them need a seat at the table as we move to reform our telecom laws   But we can   t afford to get this wrong   The success of our economy for the next 15 20 years depends on us getting this right   To do that  our policy must be guided by our collective concern for our ability to succeed in an increasingly competitive global marketplace        Business leaders repeatedly tell me that their greatest opportunity and their greatest challenge are one and the same  the global economy   I agree   If we compete globally  we will succeed  and if we can   t  we will fail        Right now  I don   t like what I   m seeing   I read last week that Toyota is putting their new plant in Canada because of they have concerns about the education level of our workforce   China and India are set to outpace us in phD   s in a few years  and they   re already graduating more engineers   And the Administration is set to cut federal research   It doesn   t make sense   We   re falling behind  and we   re not doing anything about it        If we start making the right investments in human capital and our economic future in general  telecom can be a key to our competitive strategy   High speed links are the lifeline to the new economy   Moving vast data quickly and effortlessly will help our companies compete   This is true whether we   re talking about health records  financial data or design plans   I see communications as a critical element in assuring our long term position in the global economy    It may make the difference in whether a business operates in America or abroad   And we know telecom creates jobs   I   ve seen it first hand in Massachusetts        As we move forward to create a legal framework in which telecom can play this critical role  our policies must take into account a rapidly changing world a world in which technology and the marketplace are unpredictable   The new wave of communications driven growth we hope to spur will surely be different than the first   And the laws we have now as well intended as they may have been no longer reflect technology or the marketplace        As we move forward  there are some key issues that demand our attention and some revision in the law   particularly consumer protection  the digital divide  competitiveness and innovation        There are critical issues around consumer demand for affordable access to basic phone and Internet service  and to diverse music  movies and other content  These issues matter a great deal     And as much as advanced communications technology has dispersed throughout the economy and elevated our quality of life  too many Americans are still left behind   We have narrowed the digital divide  but we have not closed it   For that reason  I support attempts by underserved local communities to deliver advanced broadband services to its citizens        We also must foster a marketplace driven by intense competition between and among technologies  companies and other stakeholders   Wireless broadband is a good example of both a new competitor and innovator   It   s time to open a platform for innovative technologies like this to compete with new services and bring down prices   Congress must complete the DTV transition  free up the 700 MegaHertz band  and allow competition to flourish        In addition  several Bell companies have recently announced their intent to offer video programming using broadband platforms   Efforts are already underway in Massachusetts   This decision provides a promise of enhanced competition in the video market  Competition means better consumer choice and competitive pricing   We should encourage that development  and seek balance between competing interests        We also need to be more supportive of innovation   The DTV debate provides an opportunity   We know that a dozen nations are ahead of us in the deployment of high speed Internet service   We can free Spectrum as part of the DTV transition to unleash new wireless technologies   Why not let the established firms  municipalities  entrepreneurs and innovators take that analog spectrum to develop advanced wireless technologies   Allowing a piece of that Spectrum to operate without license should be explored   These are the kind of options we have to consider        As long as we keep the long term interests of the American people at heart  and avoid getting weighed down by inter industry spats   we will have served the American people well   I   m confident if we look at our communications policy through the lens of the American consumer the firefighter  police officer or EMT responding to an emergency the entrepreneur with a revolutionary idea or the well intentioned business we will get it right          I look forward to working with Senator Pryor  Senator Lieberman and the rest of my colleagues to get this right  and as always welcome your advice and support   Thank you                                                                                       20510
