Kerry  D Mass   and Olympia Snowe  R Maine  today joined with Select Committee on Global Climate Change Chairman Rep  Ed Markey  D Mass   in sending a letter to President George Bush urging a strong and productive US role in the climate negotiations  Their letter asks the Administration to stop objecting to important language regarding emission reduction targets  Kerry personally attended the international conference in climate change in Bali earlier this week  The United States can no longer be the leading opponent of action on climate change  This week in Bali is a moment for leaders from all over the world to come together and send a strong  compelling message about our common commitment to a global solution on climate change that reflects the urgency of everything the science tells us  At this critical time  we cant afford to have the Bush Administration muddying the waters and blocking reasonable targets from being established  said Sen  Kerry  The United States needs instead to make it clear we are prepared to lead again  I implore the President to reassert American environmental leadership  and forge a specific science based pathway that will finally reduce carbon emissions  said Sen  Snowe  The opportunity for mitigating climate change is rapidly closing  and I urge the President to heed the call of the IPCC  the international community  and the American people and move forward with meaningful action in the next 10 to 15 years  The president sent 57 administration representatives to Bali so he could have 57 ways to say no to the international community on solutions to global warming  said Rep  Markey  Chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming  Instead of taking real action on global warming  his continued strategy of denial and delay says to a very sick planet take two aspirin and call me when I leave office  Below is the text of the letter  December 12  2007    The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20500 Dear Mr  President  Representatives of 190 nations  including the United States  are meeting now in Bali  Indonesia  to discuss the critical issue of global warming and to plan for further progress under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol  At these negotiations  the United States has a historic opportunity to regain its position as a world leader and to develop a clear roadmap for fighting global warming  In spite of the tremendous urgency for worldwide action  negotiators for the United States are opposing key science based provisions which would chart a path forward for immediate action  In particular  U S  negotiators are opposing any language that would establish the need for action within the next 10 15 years  and which would provide an appropriate range of emission reductions targets for developed countries  The clear implication is that the United States will refuse to agree to any language putting the United States on an established path toward scientifically based emission limits  U S  negotiators are also opposing any reference to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change s conclusions on the emission reductions needed to avoid dangerous global warming  The IPCC  which shared a Nobel Peace Prize for its comprehensive and scientifically based assessment of global warming  was supported by the U S  and relies on the work of key U S  government scientists  We write to express our strong disagreement with these positions and to urge you to direct the U S  negotiating team to work together with other countries to complete a roadmap with a clear objective sufficient to combat global warming  The United States must adopt negotiating positions at the Bali Conference of the Parties that are designed to propel further progress   not fuel additional delay  The world at large is watching the United States closely at this historic moment  As the Bali negotiations come to a close  nothing less than strong leadership from the United States will do  Sincerely  Senate cosigners  Sens  Kerry  Snowe  Sanders  Feinstein
