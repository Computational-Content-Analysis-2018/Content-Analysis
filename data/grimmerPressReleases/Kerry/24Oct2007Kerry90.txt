John Kerry and Edward Kennedy introduced a resolution in the Senate today honoring the Little Rock Nine and their visit to Faneuil Hall in Boston to as part of their 50th Anniversary Celebration      I am proud to help welcome the Little Rock Nine to Boston  and Im glad that with this resolution the United States Senate which once defended segregation now honors those courageous young people who helped break the back of Jim Crow and separate but equal in America  I remember first watching the news of the Little Rock Nine on a black and white television set when I was thirteen years old  It was like a punch in the gut to see that kids just a couple years older than me had to risk their lives just to go to school  all because of the color of their skin  Fifty years later  theyre older and grayer  but they still remind us of the journey we have taken and the march we must still finish to truly overcome  said Senator Kerry  I am proud to do my small part to honor these men and women today and I hope that citizens of every generation will take some time today to learn the courageous story of these living heroes      The Little Rock Nine endured shouting mobs  the taunts of classmates  and violent threats against their families  to ensure America lives up to its highest ideals  Their courage and selflessness transformed our nation for the better  said Senator Kennedy      The text of the resolution is as follows      RESOLUTION     Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding Bostons celebration of the Little Rock Nine on the 50th anniversary of their courageous and selfless stand in the face of hatred  violence and intolerance    Whereas on October 24  2007  the legacy of the Little Rock Nine will be celebrated in Boston s Faneuil Hall    Whereas in Faneuil Hall  Abolitionists of the 19th Century publicly attacked the evils of slavery in America    Whereas Massachusetts was the center of the United States Abolitionist movement and a national leader in providing public education to all students  regardless of race or ethnicity    Whereas Abolitionist leader and Newburyport  Massachusetts native William Lloyd Garrison fueled the Abolitionist movement through his powerful writing in his newspaper  The Liberator  and fiery public oratory    Whereas the Father of American public education  Franklin  Massachusetts native Horace Mann advocated for the

Supreme Court issued its ruling on Brown vs  Board of Education of Topeka and declared that segregated education was unconstitutional     Whereas many elementary and high schools and colleges and universities throughout America continued to enforce a system of educational inequality in which students of color were chronically denied access to their Constitutionally guaranteed right to a quality public education     Whereas three years after the Brown vs  Board of Education ruling  the school board of Little Rock  Arkansas announced it would implement a gradual integration of their school system beginning in September 1957     Whereas the Little Rock chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People selected 9 outstanding African American students to

the Arkansas National Guard and ordered the armed soldiers to block the nine African American students from entering Central High School     Whereas after a federal judge ordered Governor Faubus to remove the National Guardsmen  Little Rock police officers and citizens took up positions at the entrances to Central High School and continued to block nine African American students from entering     Whereas on September 23  1957  after learning that the 9 African American students had successfully entered the school  a segregationist mob gathered at Central High School and the nine African American students had to be escorted from the school for fear that they would be killed     Whereas on September 23  1957  Little Rock Mayor Woodrow Mann  in a telegram to President Dwight D  Eisenhower  appealed to the President to send federal troops to protect the students and ensure the integration of Central High School     Whereas on September 24  1957  President Eisenhower ordered the 101st Airborne Division of the U S  Army to Little Rock and federalized the entire Arkansas National Guard     Whereas on September 25  1957  Thelma Mothershed  Minnijean Brown  Elizabeth Eckford  Gloria Ray  Jefferson Thomas  Melba Pattillo  Terrence Roberts  Carlotta Walls and Ernest Green walked through the front doors of Central High School  as thousands of white students had done before them     Whereas despite the constant presence of U S  soldiers  the nine African American students were physically and verbally harassed throughout the school year     Whereas Minnijean Brown  after enduring months of physical and verbal harassment and assaults  was expelled from Central High School for a verbal retort aimed at one of her antagonists    Whereas at the end of the 1957 1958 school year  Ernest Green became the first African American graduate in the history of Central High School     Whereas Minnijean Brown Trickery became a prominent social activist and works as a writer and

in 1960 and works for the Department of Defense as an accountant     Whereas Carlotta Walls Lanier graduated from Central in 1959  attended Michigan State University and has found success in the field of real estate     Whereas the Little Rock Nine  in brave defiance of segregation  proved that with access to educational opportunity all students are capable of greatness  regardless of race or ethnicity     Whereas the courage of the Little Rock Nine  broadcast for the entire world to see  inspired other students  of all colors  to take stands on behalf of tolerance  integration and equality     Whereas the courage of the Little Rock Nine  demonstrated to segregationists throughout America that hatred and intolerance were no match for the bravery of nine high school students     Whereas fifty years after the integration of Central High School  all Americans must remain vigilant in order to ensure that every child has access to quality public education  regardless of their race or ethnicity  Now  therefore  be it    Resolved  That the Senate      1  joins with the people of Massachusetts in honoring the courage of the Little Rock Nine      2  pledges to advance the legacy of the Little Rock Nine    3  endeavors to ensure that no American is denied access to education because of their race or ethnicity  and    4  encourages the people of the United States to
