and Edward Kennedy teamed up with Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins to urge Congress to provide at least  15 million in emergency funding for shellfishermen  In a letter to key Appropriations Committee members  Kerry and Kennedy explain the significant economic disaster areas of Massachusetts and the New England shore   The  15 million addition to the Commerce  Justice  State appropriations bill would monitor red tide and fund unemployment compensation programs        The entire state of Massachusetts has felt the economic impact of the red tide crisis but it is the shell fishermen and their families who suffer the most from this natural disaster   said John Kerry    Addressing the lingering effects of red tide is vital to the shellfishermen in the Massachusetts  Maine  and New Hampshire         Over 1700 Massachusetts shellfishermen were shut down for weeks because of the worst outbreak in red tide in over 30 years   It s time the federal government stepped up to help these hard working men and woman during this tough time     said Senator Kennedy       The Senate is expected to vote on the appropriations bill in September       Below is the text of the letter       July 29  2005      The Honorable Richard C  Shelby     The Honorable Barbara A  Mikulski    Chairman           Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Commerce      Subcommittee on Commerce   Justice  and Senate Appropriations     Justice  and Senate Appropriations  Washington  DC  20510      Washington  DC  20510         Dear Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Mikulski       As you work on the Commerce  Justice  and Science  CJS  appropriations conference report for fiscal year 2006  we ask you to consider adding  15 million in emergency funding for the CJS appropriations bill or other appropriate appropriation measure to help shellfishermen in our region s coastal communities who are suffering economic impacts due to a disastrous red tide  or harmful algal bloom  outbreak    In May of this year  a convergence of natural forces   including wind patterns  storm events  and unusual ocean currents   created conditions in the Gulf of Maine perfect for the rapid and widespread proliferation of Alexandrium  a microscopic algae that accumulates in filter feeding shellfish such as clams  mussels  and oysters   While the algae do not affect these shellfish  they produce neurotoxins that can lead to potentially fatal paralytic shellfish poisoning in people eating this seafood   Therefore  public health monitors in the States of Maine  Massachusetts  and New Hampshire aggressively monitored and closed a majority of shellfish beds along the New England coast  including 1 2 acres in Massachusetts waters alone   In the farthest reaches of Downeast Maine  several shellfishing areas remain closed  and some previously re opened areas are again off limits as this algae outbreak persists      The scale of these red tide closures  in both duration and geographic reach  has not been experienced in at least three decades  and this year s massive outbreak struck without warning   As a result  this natural disaster   which remains beyond anyone s ability to control   is having significant economic impacts on our states  prompting the Governors of Maine and Massachusetts to declare economic disasters for these fisheries   While states are still working to quantify the full economic impact  early estimates suggest that losses will likely exceed  15 million   Many shellfishermen  including most of Maine s 2 000 licensed clam diggers  live in remote coastal outposts with limited opportunity to generate alternative income  and they now face great uncertainty about their ability to weather this storm        Under provisions of the Interjurisdictional fisheries Act  the Secretary of Commerce can declare a  fisheries failure  due to naturally caused fishery resource disasters   Secretary Gutierrez made this declaration on June 23rd  which would enable him to release Federally appropriated funds to our states in support of fishery assistance programs as needed   However  this fisheries failure assistance fund now contains a zero balance   We ask that you consider adding  15 million in emergency funding to the CJS or another appropriations bill  so that the Department of Commerce can channel much needed economic assistance to our states   Your cooperation will enable state officials to pursue a range of red tide monitoring and unemployment compensation programs for alleviating the red tide s economic impacts on our shellfishermen      We thank you for considering this request      Sincerely       Senator Olympia Snowe       Senator Edward Kennedy      Senator John Kerry      Senator Susan Collins
