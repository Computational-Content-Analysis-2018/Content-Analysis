on War on Terror                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Real Security in the Post 9 11 World                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                So much of what we used to take for granted in national security policy has now been called into question         We used to know that despite our differences in philosophy and in perspective our two great parties could cooperate to craft international policies in our national interest         We used to understand that the vast and unique role of the United States in world affairs required a far sighted and multi faceted approach to protecting our people and our interests       We used to value as a national treasure the international alliances and institutions that enhanced our strength  amplified our voice  and reflected our traditions and ideals in maintaining a free and secure world         We used to measure America s strength and security by our moral authority  our economic leadership  and our diplomatic skills  as well as by the power of our military             And we used to say politics stopped at the water s edge  we used to call on our people to share in the sacrifices demanded by freedom  and our leaders used to raise hopes and inspire trust  not raise fears and demand blind faith       All that has changed in a remarkably brief period of time         In recalling what we ve lost  I m not looking back to the Greatest Generation of World War II  or to the leaders who shaped our Cold War policies  and wore down the threat of totalitarian communism   I m not talking about thirty or forty or fifty years ago  I m talking about what we had just four short years ago         After September 11th  the American people  elected officials from both parties  and much of the whole world offered the President of the United States their loyal support when he announced our intention to wage a global war on terror   Not since the bombing of Pearl Harbor has a president enjoyed a greater reservoir of moral and political capital  or more material and diplomatic resources  at the beginning of a war         Four years later  our reservoir of resources has been diminished and our goodwill has been squandered   And as the 9 11 Commission   s final report has just told us  Washington is failing to take the basic steps necessary to make us safe   It is an inexplicable abdication of responsibility       So where do we go from here        Well  I wish we could have a real debate a real council of war that brings Senators and Congressmen of both parties together to forge a winning strategy for America    But since the current administration confuses examination of failed policies with an admission of weakness  and debate with division  that s not possible today   So those of us who want our country to win the war on terror must take advantage of opportunities like these to show the road not taken  and the right path to success       For all their rhetoric about democracy  human rights  the hateful ideology of our adversaries  and international coalitions against terrorism  the President and his advisors have shown time and time again that they conceive the war on terror as almost exclusively a military operation    That s why they ve been so willing to bend every relationship and international institution  to bend  in fact  our own values and respect for norms of behavior America has long championed   Make no mistake  we are united in our commitment to track down and kill the evil men who would harm us   But that alone will not win the real war on terror         The real war on terror is an even bigger challenge  It is a war that has drawn us smack into the middle of an internal struggle in the Islamic World  It is fundamentally a war within Islam for the heart and soul of Islam  stretching from Morocco East to Indonesia   It leads  ultimately  to a struggle for the transformation of the Greater Middle East into a region that is no longer isolated from the global economy  no longer dependent on despotism for stability  no longer fearful of freedom  and no longer content to feed restive and rising populations of unemployed young people a diet of illusions  excuses  and dead end government jobs         As the 2004 Arab Human Development Report tells us     By 21st century standards  Arab countries have not met the Arab people   s aspirations for development  security and liberation     Indeed  there is a near complete consensus that there is a serious failing in the Arab world    located specifically in the political sphere     And in addition  in regions where the mosque remains the only respected alternative to the autocratic state structures  there is no credible secular alternative  So we are caught in a cauldron of religious struggle where today there is no center of moral authority that forcefully condemns those who murder in the name of Islam         In the long run  and we re in this for the long run the war on terror cannot be won without the successful transformation of the Greater Middle East  and especially its Arab core   And our strategy must do what it takes to increase the internal demand for change in that region          That means we are in a war of ideas and ideologies  but ultimately a war that must be fought and won within the Islamic world        That means we have a huge stake in finding partners in the Arab world who are willing not only to support the transformation of the Middle East  but to reestablish the broad and unchallenged moral authority needed to isolate and defeat terrorists       And ultimately  that means we must liberate ourselves and the Middle East itself from the tyranny of dependence on petroleum  which has frustrated every impulse towards modernization of the region  while giving its regimes the resources to hold onto power         We have to understand that the hostility to America and to our values that feeds the jihadist threat is the product of many decades of repressed debate within the Middle East    We ve become the convenient excuse for the failures of the rulers  and the convenient target for the frustrations of the ruled         And frankly  we ve made that possible by signaling Arab regimes we don t much care what they do so long as they keep the oil flowing and the prices low   That attitude must not only end  it must be reversed   Energy independence is not just a domestic priority for our country   It s also essential to our national security  because our reliance on their oil limits our ability to move them towards needed reforms and props up decaying and sometimes corrupt regimes  including those that support terrorist groups   Any long term strategy for winning the war on terror must therefore include a determined effort to reduce our dependence on petroleum   So many opportunities to do that are staring us in the face  but none have been seized with the urgency our security demands       And these efforts have to be international in nature  linked to the rapid emergence of new energy technologies  in order to ensure that growing economies like China and India don t just replace us as the enablers of Middle East autocrats         So this is the long range mission in the war on terror  one  make sure the right side wins the war of ideas within the Islamic world  two  build up diversified economies and civil society  and  three  end the empire of oil  These three challenges make it abundantly clear this is not a war the United States should fight alone         And that s the basic insight the President and his administration have yet to fully grasp and translate into policies Americans can fully understand         Nothing makes that clearer than their policy in Iraq  where our mismanaged occupation has inadvertently created a new front in the war on terror             In the critical days after Saddam s regime collapsed  we got just about everything wrong  You know the list  failing to seal the borders and prevent sabotage of critical infrastructure  creating a formal occupation  privatizing the reconstruction  disbanding the entire Iraqi security structure  and on and on   No one in the administration has been fired for these mistakes  but our courageous troops  and the Iraqi people  are paying a high price for them every day       Even the President likes to say we cannot succeed in Iraq until the struggle for its future becomes an Iraqi struggle  not an American struggle   All of us accept that whatever happens in Iraq will shape the outcome of the war on terror  even as the administration  ignores the dynamic on the ground expressed by our top military commander in Iraq  As General Casey told Congress  our large military presence    feeds the notion of occupation    and    extends the amount of time that it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self reliant     That s why we need to focus all of our energies on making 2006 the year in which we turn over that struggle to our partners within Iraq  and do everything possible to give the next Iraqi government the local  regional  and global legitimacy it needs to survive and thrive   I   ve set out a series of steps we should take to eliminate the perception of a permanent military occupation  to achieve the political solution our generals say we need to weaken the insurgency  to isolate the foreign jihadists  and to bring Iraq stability        But just as importantly  we have to apply the painful lessons learned in Iraq to the broader and continuing war on terror         The right rhetoric s not enough   Statements of  resolve  are not enough   We need skill as well as resolve  and a strategy as well as an attitude         To begin with  we cannot have effective public diplomacy as a weapon in the war on terror in the absence of basic  sound policies   To be successful in this battle of ideas  we must first undermine the jihadist propaganda about the United States  We have to pay greater attention to how our words and deeds are understood in the Middle East  because our good intentions are doubted by the very people the terrorists seek to turn against us          For this reason alone  we have to get Iraq right to undermine the myth  all too real in many Middle Eastern minds  that the United States seeks to steal Iraq   s oil  insult its religion  and seize its land for military bases   Success there won   t mean automatic victory in the larger struggle  but failure there would only further radicalize the region and the Islamic world         We must also work to address the perception  unjustified as many think it is  that we have done too little to achieve real progress in the Middle East Peace Process   The establishment of a democratic Palestine at peace with Israel is in all of our interest   It is essential for Israel   s long term security and regional stability   It will deny Islamic extremists a recruiting tool and repressive regimes an excuse not to address problems at home   While Secretary Rice has taken a more hands on approach  the long standing violence and distrust between the parties demands sustained and committed leadership from the President        We must also start treating our moral authority as a precious national asset in the war on terror   We play into the hands of our enemies and lose credibility when the Vice President lobbies for the right to torture  even after the Abu Ghraib disaster  when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has to publicly remind the Secretary of Defense that our troops have an obligation to stop torture when they see others doing it  and when we continue to hold detainees indefinitely in a legal no man   s land           We must counter the teaching of hatred in Madrassas by pressing regimes more consistently and effectively to teach tolerance in schools throughout the Middle East and Central Asia  and to broaden educational opportunities  We must work with moderate Muslims  especially clerics  to permanently discredit the belief that the murder of innocents can be justified in the name of God  race  or nation   The people of the Middle East need to learn who we are from direct experience with Americans not from watching a failed Madison Avenue ad campaign or from hearing Karen Hughes tell chauffeur driven women with bodyguards they would be better off getting a driver   s license        And democratic values and openness should be championed not simply as western values but as the universal values that they are   Democratization is not a crusade   If it is seen as the result of an army marching through Muslim lands it will fail   But more importantly  that   s not the way democracy works   Democracy spreads with patient but firm determination  led by individuals of courage who dream of a better day for their country   Viktor Yushchenko had that dream in Ukraine   Hamid Karzai had that dream in Afghanistan   And Lech Walesa had that dream in Poland   We need to create the conditions where this dream can become a reality in the Arab world   If we are serious about spreading democracy and fighting a real war on terror  then  quite simply  our resources must match our rhetoric         We must do everything possible to promote economic  social and political transformation in the Middle East  especially among Sunni Arabs   Nations like Jordan  Qatar and Bahrain are not only moving towards political freedom and pluralism  they are also trying to build real economies built on the talents of their own people rather than trying to simply pump prosperity out of the ground    Every move in that direction in this critical region should not only be praised  but rewarded tangibly as a role model   There   s no way to overemphasize the importance of ensuring that the Greater Middle East does not continue its long trajectory towards a region where an exploding young population collides with dysfunctional and isolated economies  producing instability and ultimately  more and more terrorism   Majority populations under the age of 18 without jobs or futures are a sure recipe for disaster       So we must work harder with our allies in Europe and Asia to strengthen our commitment and enhance our efforts to integrate the Middle East into the global economy   This is the only way to stop economic regression  spur investment beyond the oil industry  and spark trade  investment and growth in the region   It   s the only way to turn young minds and energy away from terror       In the end  these many steps will open a region that for too long has been closed to opportunity and progress  modernize governments and societies that can then better meet the needs of their citizens  respond to their grievances  and provide a more hopeful alternative to the dark ideology of terror   That would be real public diplomacy a real battle of ideas and a vast improvement on the ineffective initiatives of the last four years       The fact is we must demand more of Americans too   We must mobilize our universities and our intellectual capital to understand and address the challenges we face   We need a real investment in language studies and area studies so that our intelligence  our use of force  and our diplomacy are better informed and more effective   There is a great patriotic pool of Arab  and Islamic Americans who should be called to serve in this effort  just as Americans of East European descent served during the Cold War       Doing all these things  and doing them right  is how we can wage and win the long term war on terror   This is the preeminent challenge to our security in the twenty first century  and we have to change our policies right now         Of course there will be times  like in Afghanistan  when direct military engagement will be necessary   And that requires reshaping our military for the missions ahead  a larger infantry and more special forces  more personnel trained and equipped to perform post conflict reconstruction missions  a Guard and Reserve force that meets the nation   s needs overseas and at home         But because this is a long range war  we absolutely have to do a better job of destroying terrorist cells and preventing terrorist attacks here at home         The fact is that al Qaeda has morphed into a global hydra of hidden terrorists who often share nothing more than a common hatred  To disrupt and destroy their networks before they can attack  we must do much more to improve and overhaul our intelligence and law enforcement capabilities by accelerating the creation of a true domestic counterterrorism capability within the FBI  and greatly increasing our overseas clandestine intelligence service  And to be truly effective in the global conflict  we must leverage much greater assistance from foreign intelligence agencies  expand the Anti Terrorism Assistance Program and increase exchange programs and liaison relationships       And we must treat securing dangerous materials around the world with the urgency the threat demands   We can all agree that our top national security priority is to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists   How often do you hear politicians pay lip service to that  yet the 9 11 commission gives the administration a nearly failing grade on that very task   That s just plain unacceptable       One of the worst myths the President has propagated is that we ve somehow bottled up the world s terrorists in Iraq  and by fighting them there  we no longer need fear that they can strike us here         The 9 11 commission s report on the administration s efforts to implement its much praised recommendations gave our government failing grades on homeland security   And the fiasco of the federal Katrina response showed graphically that you have to do more than create a new Department to deal with grave emergencies competently   It s time to finally get serious  with money and attention  to the most urgent homeland security threats  including the extreme vulnerability of our ports  the most likely point of entry for terrorists with weapons of mass destruction         Finally  we must adapt international institutions to meet today   s threats  Of course we have to end corruption and inefficiency at the United Nations   But we must not lose sight of its continuing importance to our own security  We should be leading the negotiations of a meaningful convention against terrorism so that the world  in one voice  finally condemns terrorism and the groups that use it        In other words  at home  in the Middle East  and around the world  we have to convince more people that the war on terror is a common fight against a threat to our collective security  not just America s fight against terrorists         And that is an approach  as you here at the Council well know  that restores a distinctly American tradition         Some say President Bush s preference for unilateral action reflects  American exceptionalism   But I say  what has always made America  exceptional   in the history of great powers is that we have not sought conquest or empire when these temptations were within our reach   Our confidence in our own greatness led us to build an international order of mutual respect and cooperation   That s why America emerged from the twentieth century as the unquestioned leader in the world s march towards freedom  as the authors of a global consensus linking our self interest as a nation to the common interests of all nations   That is the real tradition of American  exceptionalism  the President needs to understand and embrace       Within living memory  we had another president who prided himself on simple virtues and unshakeable resolve         Harry Truman was an uncomplicated man   Yet he was also a man who believed he should be held personally accountable for every decision and every judgment  every day  not just on election days   At the end of one great war against totalitarianism and at the beginning of another  Harry Truman presided over the greatest era of bipartisan  multi lateral foreign policy our country or the world has ever seen   It   s time for the President to put a little more Harry Truman in his foreign policy       And if he won t  then those who admire Harry Truman will keep up the fight at home  in order to win the fight against terrorism around the world   And we ll be joined by other Americans and  I hope  by leaders in organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations  who understand this is a fight we dare not lose  More than that  it is a fight we must win
