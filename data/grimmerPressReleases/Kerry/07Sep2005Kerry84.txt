Senator John Kerry  D   Mass    Senator Edward Kennedy  D   Mass   and Congressman Marty Meehan  D   Mass   released a letter in which they strongly criticize the Environmental Protection Agency s  EPA  failure to clean up the W R  Grace Superfund site       Instead of taking aggressive actions to clean up all the contamination on the site  the EPA has said it will rely on nature to take its course to clean up the northeast plume   The Senators and Congressman said the EPA s failure to act violates the law requiring Superfund sites be cleaned up  and also demanded more time for the public to comment on the agency s decision        The EPA is supposed to be protecting our environment  our communities and our water supplies    not sitting on their hands waiting for contaminated water to just go away on its own   It s ridiculous   The people of Acton and neighboring towns have been waiting for 25 years to get their land and water clean  safe and free of contamination  It s the EPA s responsibility to act  and we re going to be sure they do   said Senator Kerry       Senator Kennedy said     I join with Senator Kerry and Congressman Meehan to express my grave concern for the failure of the EPA to act in a manner that best serves the people of Acton and the neighboring communities  When an environmental problem such as this arises  we can not wait to take action  We must be proactive in doing all that we can to protect our citizens   The EPA must step up now to ensure that this problem is addressed in a timely manner and in a way that protects the health and safety of the affected communities            The EPA has a responsibility to the families who reside in and around Acton   said Congressman Meehan   We have waited long enough for the EPA to act   As a matter and public health and safety  the EPA must begin the process of clearing this site immediately        Below is the text of the letter to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson       Dear Administrator Johnson        We write today on behalf of the thousands of residents living near the W R  Grace Superfund site  For the past twenty five years  these residents of Acton and neighboring towns have dealt with toxics such as vinylidine chloride threatening their drinking water  It is imperative that the proposed cleanup plan is in the best interests of the individuals and families that make up these communities       In keeping with this goal  we urge the EPA to reconsider its decision to take no action for the northeast plume of the site  Your decision to rely solely on natural attenuation processes seems to be inconsistent with your agency   s very own criteria for selecting cleanup alternatives   In EPA   s own words  no action means it does not offer any    protection to human health or the environment     allowing    potential risks from exposure to contaminated groundwater to remain     We are at a loss to understand how refusing to treat this toxic plume meets the intent and purpose of EPA   s own criteria for selecting cleanup alternatives and the Superfund law  We urge you to work with the affected towns to design an active cleanup protocol for the northeast plume that meets the spirit of its own standards  having community acceptance  reducing the toxicity  mobility or volume through treatment  eliminating future risk and providing for an overall protection of environment and human health       In addition  we urge the EPA to grant an extension to the comment period  It is imperative that the citizens have more time to review the proposed actions  Other impacted communities such as Concord and Billerica must also have an opportunity to understand and to comment on the plan  For years  these residents have been part of the solution to this problem  and an extension of the public comment period will permit them to more fully contribute to EPA   s proposed resolution for cleanup       Ultimately  we believe the EPA must rethink how best to actively treat the northeast plume    establishing an acceptable margin of protection for the environment and most importantly  for the health of our communities       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter         Sincerely       Senator John Kerry  Senator Edward Kennedy  Congressman Marty Meehan                                                                           20510
