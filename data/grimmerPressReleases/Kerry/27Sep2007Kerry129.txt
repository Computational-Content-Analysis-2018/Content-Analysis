Kerry  D Mass   wrote a letter to FDA Commissioner  Dr  Andrew C  von Eschenbach  requesting consumer and stakeholder participation in the International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulations meeting in Brussels  which starts today  Currently  the meeting of international regulators excludes all consumers and members of the public     Kerry cited the potential environmental and safety risks posed by cosmetic products  The average consumer comes into contact with at least 126 different chemicals on a daily basis from the use of cosmetic products  many of them completely untested  Kerry emphasized that consumers should be given access to information about those chemicals and their effects  According to the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics  nearly 90 percent of the 10 500 ingredients used in cosmetics have not been evaluated for safety by federal regulators     Below is the text of Kerrys letter     September 26  2007    Andrew C  von Eschenbach  M D    Commissioner of Food and Drugs   U S  Food and Drug Administration   5600 Fishers Lane   Rockville  MD 20857    Dear Dr  von Eschenbach     We are writing to voice our concern with the exclusion of consumers and members of the public from the International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulations  ICCR  meeting in Brussels  Belgium on September 27  2007  The U S  Food and Drug Administrations mission to protect public health by assuring the safety of cosmetics is critical  given that American adults use an average of nine personal care products ranging from shampoo and shaving cream to sunscreen and body lotion that expose them to an average of 126 different chemical ingredients on a daily basis  Equally critical is the ability of consumers to participate in discussions aimed at ensuring cosmetic products safety  Thus  while we appreciate FDAs efforts to guarantee the safety of these products through participation in the ICCR  FDA must also take steps to ensure that consumers and the public can participate in the ICCR process     The ICCR meeting serves as a forum for international cosmetics regulatory authorities from the U S   Japan  European Union  and Canada to identify ways to remove regulatory obstacles among the regions  while maintaining the highest level of global consumer protection  However  while this upcoming meeting will be open to industry representatives  such as the Cosmetic  Toiletry  and Fragrance Association  CTFA   consumer and public health organizations concerned about the safety of cosmetics will be excluded     The importance of consumer participation at the ICCR meeting is demonstrated by government data and independent research showing that the current system of cosmetics safety oversight is woefully inadequate and not sufficiently protective of public health      Nearly 90 percent of the 10 500 ingredients FDA determines to be used in cosmetics still have not been evaluated for safety by the CIR  FDA  or any other publicly accountable institution      FDAs Office of Cosmetics and Colors has described major gaps in federal authority over cosmetic safety     a cosmetic manufacturer may use almost any raw material as a cosmetic ingredient and market the product without an approval from FDA      The limited determinations that CIR has made regarding unsafe uses for hazardous ingredients remain unenforced  a 2004 study found hundreds of products on the market in the U S  in violation of CIR safety recommendations  containing ingredients that may cause harm when used according to package directions     In order to ensure a more complete system of public health protections  it is critical to include the views of the consumer and public health community in the ICCR meeting     We therefore urge FDA to     provide for interactive electronic teleconferencing  recording  transcription  and publicly available posting of the upcoming ICCR meeting and all future ICCR meetings  to enable access and participation for members of the public who are unable to attend in person    notify stakeholders of the availability of this information  and   guarantee that interested stakeholders will be invited via public notice for all ICCR meetings      If the above provisions cannot be implemented before the upcoming ICCR meeting  we respectfully request a postponement of this meeting until adequate public representation and access can be made available for all stakeholders concerned with the safety of personal care products     Sincerely    John F  Kerry  Barbara Boxer    Cc  Murray M  Lumpkin  M D  Deputy Commissioner  Office of
