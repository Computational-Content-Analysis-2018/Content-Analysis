WASHINGTON  SECTION  OTHER OPINIONS LENGTH  737 words    Friday  January 20 TWO YEARS ago  President Bush signed the new Medicare prescription drug benefit into law amid much hype and fanfare  But now the only cheers are from the special interests  Insurance and pharmaceutical companies are thrilled with their profits  but Massachusetts seniors now attempting to fill their prescriptions are finding nothing more than broken promises        Seniors know a bad deal when they see it  That s why Massachusetts seniors and Democrats in Congress joined together to oppose this fatally flawed proposal when it was first introduced on Capitol Hill  Now  we re reminded that this Bush boondoggle is an even bigger real life nightmare for seniors than we ever could have imagined  The time has come to renew our efforts to go back to the drawing board  fix this legislation  and deliver real relief to seniors struggling with       America s seniors deserve a comprehensive and affordable health care system    and that includes a guaranteed  simple and affordable prescription drug benefit  The Bush prescription drug plan fails to meet that standard  In fact  the Medicare prescription drug law does more harm than good  Massachusetts seniors can attest to that        Seniors were first subjected to the dizzying task of choosing a plan among a slew of competing programs  Yet among the countless pages of confusing information  seniors could not find out the one thing they really wanted to know  would their drugs be covered under this plan  I know accomplished health professionals who were unable to help their parents navigate the maze of paperwork and regulations       To make matters worse  seniors are not only locked into the first plan they choose  they face a financial penalty for delaying that choice       Every day my office receives hundreds of calls from nervous  confused  and worried seniors    and they have every right to be concerned  Their options are incredibly confusing  and the government is burdening them with unnecessary pressure on their time and finances       Even the seniors lucky enough to make sense of this new plan understand that this prescription benefit was falsely advertised  They realize this law  despite all the promises  uses a series of holes in coverage and complex rules to provide shockingly skimpy benefits  Now that we re seeing the results  our worst fears have been confirmed  wide gaps in coverage  seniors being forced into HMO style plans  and no price controls  Eventually  elements of this law may even lead to the privatization of Medicare       Our seniors deserve better than this  If Republicans in Congress are unwilling to scrap Part D altogether and start over  we must at least perform some major surgery on the current law  To begin  we must       Simplify the rules  streamline choices  require more transparency  and extend deadlines for making decisions about coverage options       Make the benefit comprehensive and end the outrage of charging seniors premiums even after their benefits shut down       Restrain double digit drug price increases and lower out of pocket costs for seniors by allowing the federal government to use its bulk purchasing power to negotiate volume discounts on behalf of all beneficiaries       Allow for the safe re importation of affordable prescription drugs from Canada and other industrialized countries       Improve the protections for retiree benefits  Millions of seniors are projected to lose their gold plated retiree prescription drug plan and be forced into a lesser benefit under the Medicare plan       Cancel the unprecedented  12 billion slush fund to entice private insurance companies to participate in Medicare  If private companies are unwilling engage in fair competition for customers  the federal government should stand ready to offer a plan as a part of its Medicare package       Affordable healthcare is not a privilege for the elected  the connected and the wealthy  it should be a right afforded to all Americans regardless of their background or social standing  The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 soundly rejects this principle  and we have to pass serious reforms now to repair this program before it becomes entrenched  Our goal should be nothing more and nothing less than assuring that a Medicare prescription drug plan actually does what it s supposed to do  conveniently provide affordable prescription drugs to all seniors       Sen  Kerry is a Massachusetts Democrat
