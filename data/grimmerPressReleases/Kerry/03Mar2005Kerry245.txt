Culminating late tonight in the United States Senate  John Kerry led a successful  bipartisan 11th hour push to stay the deportation of a beloved Boston teacher   By introducing the Kerry bill in the

stay in Boston until 2007   This long fight for a stay in Attouoman s deportation case was marked today by an emotional outpouring when several of Attouoman   s students traveled from Boston to Washington to meet with Kerry and Members of Congress            This is the right way to end a day spent by so many people fighting to keep Obain Attouoman at home in Boston   Democracy works best when we work across party lines  and I m pleased to say that tonight Senator Cornyn has joined us in making it possible for a beloved teacher to stay with his students at least until 2007   It took real cooperation and genuine bipartisanship to overcome the Washington stalemate and make a difference  not only in the life of a teacher  but in the lives of the students who cherish their time with him   Tonight s victory sends a message that when we work together  our government can work for people     Senator Kerry said          It   s a simple matter of doing what   s right for students and
