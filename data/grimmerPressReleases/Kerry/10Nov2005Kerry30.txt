                                                                                                                                                                    Mr  President  later today my Democratic colleagues and I will offer a critical amendment on Iraq   I am pleased to have worked on this amendment and to be a cosponsor  I look forward to participating in the debate when the amendment comes up  But I have come here now to introduce a bill that lays out in greater detail the comprehensive new strategy that I believe the president must implement to complete the mission in Iraq and bring our troops home in a reasonable timeframe        A few weeks ago I departed Iraq from Mosul  Three Senators and staff were gathered in the forward part of a C 130  In the middle of the cavernous cargo hold was a simple  aluminum coffin with a small American flag draped over it  We were bringing another American soldier  just killed  home to his family and final resting place       The starkness of his coffin in the center of the hold  the silence except for the din of the engines  was a real time cold reminder of the consequences of decisions for which we Senators share responsibility       As we enter a make or break six month period in Iraq  his lonely journey compels us to talk honestly about the steps we must take to bring our troops home within a reasonable timeframe from an Iraq that   s not permanently torn by conflict        While some say we can   t ask tough questions because we are at war  I say no   in a time of war we must ask the hardest questions of all  It s essential if we want to correct our course and do what s right for our troops instead of repeating the same mistakes over and over again   No matter what the President says  asking tough questions isn   t pessimism  it   s patriotism   We have a responsibility to our troops  our country and our conscience to be honest about where we should go from here       There is a way forward that gives us the best chance both to salvage a difficult situation in Iraq  and to save American and Iraqi lives  With so much at stake  we must follow it    We cannot pull out precipitously or merely promise to stay    as long as it takes     To undermine the insurgency  we must instead simultaneously pursue a political settlement that gives Sunnis a real stake in the future Iraq and while reducing the sense of an American occupation   That means a phased withdrawal of American troops as we meet a series of military and political benchmarks  starting with a reduction of 20 000 troops over the holidays as we meet the first benchmark   the completion of the December elections       We must send this critical signal to the Iraqi people   that we do not desire permanent occupation   and that Iraqis themselves must fight for Iraq   History shows that guns alone do not end an insurgency  The real struggle in Iraq   Sunni versus Shiia   will only be settled by a political solution  and no political solution can be achieved when the antagonists can rely on the indefinite large scale presence of occupying American combat troops   The reality is our military presence in vast and visible numbers has become part of the problem  not the solution         And our generals understand this  General George Casey  our top military commander in Iraq  recently told Congress that our large military presence    feeds the notion of occupation    and    extends the amount of time that it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self reliant     And Richard Nixon   s Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird   breaking a thirty year silence  writes    Our presence is what feeds the insurgency  and our gradual withdrawal would feed the confidence and the ability of average Iraqis to stand up to the insurgency         It comes down to this  an open ended declaration to  stay    as long as it takes    lets Iraqi factions maneuver for their own political advantage by making us stay as long as they want  and it becomes an excuse for billions of American tax dollars to be sent to Iraq and siphoned off into the coffers of cronyism and corruption       The Administration must also use all of the leverage in America   s arsenal   our diplomacy  the presence of our troops  and our reconstruction money    to convince Shiites and Kurds to address legitimate Sunni concerns about regional autonomy and oil revenues and to make Sunnis accept the reality that they will no longer dominate Iraq   We cannot and should not do this alone           The administration must immediately call a conference of Iraq   s neighbors  Britain  Turkey and other key NATO allies  and Russia   Together  we must implement a collective strategy to bring the parties in Iraq to a sustainable political compromise that also includes mutual security guarantees among Iraqis   To maximize our diplomacy  the President should appoint a special envoy to bolster Ambassador Khalilzad   s commendable efforts       To enlist the support of Iraq   s Sunni neighbors  we should commit to a new regional security structure that will include improved security assistance programs  and joint exercises         To show Iraqi Sunnis the benefits of participating in the political process  we should press these countries to set up a reconstruction fund specifically for the majority Sunni areas         We also need to jump start our own lagging reconstruction efforts by providing the necessary civilian personnel to do the job  standing up civil military reconstruction teams throughout the country  streamlining the disbursement of funds to the provinces  expanding job creation programs  and strengthening the capacity of government ministries         On the military side  we must make it clear now that we do not want permanent military bases in Iraq  or a large combat force on Iraqi soil indefinitely  The Administration must immediately give Congress and the American people a detailed plan for the transfer of military and police responsibilities on a sector by sector basis to Iraqis so the majority of our combat forces can be withdrawn   ideally by the end of next year         Simultaneously  the President needs to put the training of Iraqi security forces on a six month wartime footing and ensure that the Iraqi government has the budget to deploy them   The Administration must accept long standing offers by Egypt  Jordan  France and Germany to do more training      The Administration must prod the new Iraqi government to ask for a multinational force to help protect Iraq   s borders until a capable national army is formed    Such a force  if sanctioned by the United Nations  could attract participation by Iraq s neighbors and countries like India and would be a critical step in stemming the tide of insurgents and money into Iraq  especially from Syria       Finally  we must alter the deployment of American troops  While Special Operations must continue to pursue specific intelligence leads  the vast majority of our own troops should be in rear guard  garrisoned status for security backup   We do not need to send young Americans on search and destroy missions that invite alienation and deepen the risks they face       If the President still refuses to take this new course  Congress must insist on a change in policy  If we do take these steps  there is no reason this difficult process can not be completed in 12 15 months so we can take on a new role as an ally not an occupier   Only then will we have provided our troops what they deserve   leadership equal to our soldiers    sacrifice                                                                           20510
