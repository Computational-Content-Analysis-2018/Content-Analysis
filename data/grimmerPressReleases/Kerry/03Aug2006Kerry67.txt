Sending U S  Troops into Crossfire of Escalating Civil War                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Below John Kerry   s remarks on Iraq on the floor of the Senate this afternoon   In his remarks  Kerry spoke about Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld   s testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee this morning       As prepared for delivery                                                                                                                                                                   Mr  President  yesterday I was at Arlington National Cemetery for the funeral of Lance Corporal Geoffrey R  Cayer  a 20 year old from Massachusetts  and I was struck by the number of funerals taking place and the number of new headstones bearing the inscription    Operation Iraqi Freedom    and    Operation Enduring Freedom            One of those among the fallen is Phillip Baucus  the nephew of our friend and colleague Sen  Baucus  Phillip was a proud and brave Marine Corps Corporal who gave his life serving his country last Saturday in Anbar Province in Iraq   He was an extraordinary young man  and I know from Max what he meant to his family and what a totally devastating blow this is to all of them   My prayers are for Phillip and every family which has endured this kind of monumental loss  Phillip and Lance Corporal Cayer and all those who have given their lives are a tough reminder to all of the incredible sacrifices Americas    children are making every day         Mr  President  with the violence in Iraq growing worse by the day  it was stunning to hear Secretary Rumsfeld come before the Armed Services Committee this morning with a laundry list of excuses and denials about what is happening there and its consequences for the region  General Abizaid candidly acknowledged that the    sectarian violence is as bad as I   ve seen it     that he   s rarely seen the situation    so unsettled and so volatile     He warned of coming civil war  and that    failure to apply coordinated regional and international pressure     will further extremism  and could lead to a widening and more perilous conflict         But this morning Secretary Rumsfeld did not call for that kind of diplomacy  and he did not lay out a plan for that kind of leadership  Nor has President Bush reached out to undertake the kind of crisis diplomacy needed in Iraq or to leverage the regional pressure to stop Iraq from descending into irretrievable chaos        No     Secretary Rumsfeld announced that    there s a number of good things happening    amidst all of this difficulty  the currency is fairly stable  the schools are open  the hospitals are open  the people are functioning     Secretary Rumsfeld waxed optimistic about an Iraq where    you see people out in the fields doing things and people driving their cars and lining up for gasoline and going about their business     He went on to say that    despite all of the difficulties  there are also some good trend lines that are occurring  and I think the period ahead is an important period            Mr  President  this is more than an important period  this may well be the moment that decides the security of the Middle East itself  and it   s time the Administration was candid about the situation and got to work on rescuing what   s salvageable in Iraq        With at least 2 578 Americans killed  over 19 000 wounded  and no end in sight  we simply cannot sit idly by as more of our kids die for a policy that isn   t working  And we cannot be silent while this Administration continues to deny reality and repeat the same mistakes        I   ve said it before and I   ll say it again  this Congress has a constitutional responsibility and a moral obligation to hold this Administration accountable for making the right choices for our troops and our country         That starts with demanding honesty when it comes to the war in Iraq   Because the bottom line is that this Administration is sending more U S  troops into the crossfire of an escalating civil war in Iraq     and they refuse to come clean with the American people about it        No more half measures  no more staged phony political debates    it   s time to tell the truth about the consequences of today   s failed policy in Iraq         No matter what the Administration tells you  there is a civil war raging in Iraq         The President   s policy of standing down U S  troops as Iraqis stand up has finally been exposed as nothing more than a misleading myth  in fact  we are actually increasing our overall troop presence even as they tell us that many more Iraqis soldiers have been trained    and we   ve reportedly all but abandoned hope of withdrawing significant numbers of U S  troops this year  even as the Iraqi President tells us that Iraqis can take over security responsibility throughout their country by the end of the year        Yesterday  we learned more about our dangerously overstretched military when the top National Guard General warned that more than two thirds of the Army National Guard s brigades are not combat ready        And worst of all  there is no end in sight and no realistic plan to turn the tide       To change course we must first confront the realities on the ground  starting by acknowledging that there is a civil war going on in Iraq   The Administration denies that because it doesn   t fit their rhetoric    but by objective standards that is exactly what   s happening  Just look at the facts        In the first six months of the year  14 338 Iraqi civilians were killed  mostly in sectarian violence  Prime Minister Maliki acknowledged last week that an average of 100 Iraqi civilians are being killed every day  Just think about that for a second  100 people killed every day  And the violence has only been getting worse  2 669 civilians were killed in May  and 3 129 civilians were killed in June  That   s nearly 6 000 Iraqi civilians killed in the last two months alone  And since the February 22nd bombing of the Shia mosque in Samarra  the government reports that 30 359 families     or about 182 000 people     have fled their homes due to sectarian violence and intimidation      Mr  President  this is not just a civil war     by historical standards  it   s a relatively large scale civil war  In fact  a recent academic analysis published in the New York Times showed that the median number of casualties in civil wars since 1945 is 18 000  Estimates of total casualties in Iraq vary  but the number is probably at least twice that many   Larry Diamond  a former consultant to the provisional authority in Baghdad  has put it simply   In academic terms  this is a civil war  and it s not even a small one         The Iraqis from all sides understand what   s going on in their country     and they   re not afraid to speak the truth  Haidar al Ibadi  a prominent Shiite legislator  said that  Certainly  what is happening is the start of the civil war   Saleh al Mutlak  a Sunni legislator  also described the recent violence as  the start of a civil war   and another leading Sunni  Adnan Dulaimi  recently said    It   s nothing less than an undeclared civil war            Still  the Administration continues to deny the plain facts about the civil war just as they once downplayed the insurgency   Remember when it was first clear that chaos had given way to a determined insurgency  Secretary Rumsfeld told us they were just a bunch of    dead enders     Vice President Cheney told us last year that the insurgency was    in it last throes      And just look at the results  Since then  the number of Iraqi insurgents has increased by 20 percent  and the insurgency is now more than six times stronger that it was in May of 2003  And once again  it   s our troops that pay the price     in fact  the number of IED attacks on U S  troops has nearly doubled since January          Now  in the face of all evidence to the contrary  the Administration denies that there   s a civil war  Who do they think they   re kidding  Why not just level with the American public  Because this is one more inconvenient truth they   d prefer not to deal with  In fact  Secretary Rumsfeld said just a few months ago that if civil war did break out  Iraqi forces     not U S  troops   would be the ones dealing with it         Yet not only are our U S  troops now caught in this civil war     we   re actually sending more of them into the crossfire  That   s right  the Administration doesn   t want to talk about it  but we are actually sending more U S  troops into Iraq          When the President announced his plan last week to increase the U S  troop presence in Baghdad  he said the troops would come from other areas of Iraq  He did not mention that additional troops have been sent into Iraq from Kuwait  and that current deployments were being extended as new troops arrived   He did not mention what both the Washington Post and New York Times have reported  that the total number of U S  troops in Iraq is going to increase by several thousand  And he did not mention that recently announced deployment schedules could bring the number of U S  troops in Iraq even higher in the coming years         Finally  he did not explain why this strategy will work when similar efforts have just failed  The fact is that a few months ago  U S  and coalition troops in Baghdad increased from 40 000 to 55 000     and the violence has only gotten worse  Now  the President says we are going to send a few thousand more U S  troops into Baghdad  Why is this going to be any different         One thing is clear  under this Administration   s current approach  it   s highly unlikely that we   ll be drawing down any significant numbers of U S  troops from Iraq this year  This is despite the fact that Secretary Rumsfeld said on Wednesday that there are some 275 000 trained Iraqi security forces  with 325 000 expected to be trained by the end of the year   And General Martin Dempsey  the American general in charge of training Iraqi security forces  said in June that the new Iraqi army would be formed and at full strength by the end of this calendar year  In fact  Iraqi President Talabani declared just yesterday that Iraqis could take over security in the entire country by the end of this year          If the Iraqis are standing up  as the Administration is telling us  why are U S  troops not standing down   Because the President   s mantra that    as Iraqis stand up  we   ll stand down    is not a plan   it   s misleading rhetoric that now rings as hollow as    we   ll be greeted as liberators     and    mission accomplished     And given how bad the situation has gotten  does    stay the course    really sound any better         This bottom line is that this approach hasn   t worked because its underlying assumption     that more troops are the real solution to the problem     is fundamentally flawed  As our generals  the Iraqi leaders  and the Secretary of State herself have told us  there is no military solution to the insurgency  And just today  Secretary Rumsfeld acknowledged that there   s no military solution to the sectarian violence  In fact  all can agree that the only hope for salvaging a measure of lasting success in Iraq is finding a political solution that all of the Iraqis can buy into         So how do we accomplish that  By finally engaging in the intensive diplomacy that has been so inexplicably lacking from this Administration   s approach to Iraq         We used to understand diplomacy must be the primary means of advancing America   s national security interests  We used to remember that war is the ultimate failure of diplomacy     and the best way to end it         Unfortunately  our current diplomacy is not anywhere near as effective as it needs to be  In fact  so much of what we used to take for granted in national security policy has now been called into question          We used to know that despite our differences in political philosophy and in perspective our two great parties could cooperate to craft international policies in our national interest          We used to understand that the unique and historic role of the United States in world affairs required a far sighted and multi faceted approach to protecting our people and our interests        We used to value as a national treasure the international alliances and institutions that enhanced our strength  amplified our voice  and reflected our traditions and ideals in maintaining a free and secure world          We used to say politics stopped at the water s edge  we used to call on our people to share in the sacrifices demanded by freedom  and our leaders used to raise hopes and inspire trust  not raise fears and demand blind faith        We used to measure America s strength and security by our moral authority  our economic leadership  and our diplomatic skills  as well as by the power of our military          Think about how much things have changed  when Tom Friedman wrote just days ago that    our President and Secretary of State  although they speak with great mortal clarity  have no moral authority  That   s been shattered by their performance in Iraq            Key to any hope of stabilizing Iraq is changing course and engaging in the sustained diplomacy from the highest levels of America   s leadership that matches the effort of our soldiers on the ground        History shows the results that genuine diplomacy can bring   In 1995  there was a brutal civil war in Bosnia involving Serbs  Croats and Muslims  Faced with a seemingly intractable stalemate in the midst of horrific ethnic cleansing  the Clinton Administration took action  Led by Richard Holbrooke  they brought leaders of the Bosnian parties together in Dayton  Ohio with representatives from the European Union  Russia and Britain to hammer out a peace agreement that brought relative stability to the region         It is past time for the Administration to engage in this type of major diplomatic initiative  While an international process has begun to bring reconstruction and economic aid to Iraq  a true national compact is still needed to bring about a political solution to the insurgency and end the cycle of Sunni Shia violence         My strategy would help achieve this by working with the Iraqis to convene a Dayton like summit that includes leaders of the Iraqi government  the countries bordering Iraq  the Arab League  NATO  the European Union  and the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council   This would enable the Iraqis to engage in the intensive diplomacy necessary to forge a comprehensive political agreement that addresses security guarantees  oil revenues  federalism  and the disbanding of the militias  And all parties would agree on a process for securing Iraq   s borders          These are the key elements of the political agreement necessary to decrease the violence     and they are not tasks that U S  troops can     or should     be responsible for  They are the responsibility of civilian personnel  especially Iraqis  And success will require collective effort that engages members of the international community who share our interest in a stable Iraq  To enlist their support  we must address their concerns about security in the region after we have withdrawn from Iraq  That   s why this summit should lay the groundwork for creating a new regional security structure that strengthens the security of the countries in the region and the wider community of nations         Mr  President  we must also recognize that redeploying U S  troops from Iraq is an essential part of a strategy for success  In fact  our own generals and the Iraqi National Security Adviser  Mr  Rubaie  tell us that the presence of large numbers of U S  troops actually fuels the insurgency   That   s why I say that to change course now  we must acknowledge that it takes a deadline to get Iraq up on its own two feet and get American troops home    My strategy would redeploy U S  forces from Iraq within one year in accordance with a schedule coordinated with the Iraqi Government  leaving only those forces that are critical to completing the mission of standing up Iraqi security forces  conducting targeted counter terrorism missions  and protecting United States facilities and personnel   It also calls for keeping a rapid reaction force over the horizon in Kuwait so that we can always bring overwhelming force to bear on any concentration of enemy forces          Coordinating a schedule for redeploying our troops is not cutting and running     it   s a key to finding the political solution that is needed to stabilize Iraq   As we know from Mr  Rubaie  this will give the Iraqi leadership the best chance to stabilize the country by empowering and legitimizing the new government with the Iraqi people  expediting the process of getting Iraqis to assume a larger role in running their country  and undermining support for the insurgency among the vast majority of Iraqis who want U S  troops to leave         We know that Prime Minister Maliki understands this  that   s why he has talked openly about a timeframe for the reduction of U S  forces  We know that Ambassador Khalilzad and General Casey are discussing with the Iraqi government the formation of a joint commission to outline terms and conditions for the withdrawal of U S  troops from Iraq  We know from Mr  Rubaie that there is already    an unofficial    road map    to foreign troop reductions that will eventually lead to total withdrawal of U S  troops      We know that General Casey has drafted a plan for significantly reducing U S  troop levels by the end of 2007   We know that polls of Iraqis have shown that 87      including 94  of the Sunnis and 90  of the Shia    support their government endorsing a timeline for U S  withdrawal         If the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people  our Ambassador and top military commander  and the majority of Americans can see that the time has come for a timeframe for the redeployment of U S  forces  why can   t the Bush Administration          Think about that for a second  for over three years  the President has said that we   re prepared to stay    as long as it takes     and during this time the insurgency has only grown stronger and sectarian killings are now at an all time high  Does anyone really think more of the same will solve the problem          We simply cannot allow the Administration to undermine this key aspect of a successful strategy in Iraq because they are too stubborn to admit that the timeline they have so adamantly opposed is now clearly an important part of the way forward  The bottom line is that by the middle of next year  the presence of large numbers of U S  troops will have served its purpose  That does not mean we will be abandoning Iraq  it simply means our involvement will change          Mr  President  even as we consider the way forward in Iraq  we must not lose sight of the war raging on the other side of the Middle East in Lebanon and Israel  Watching the news from the Mideast these days is an exercise in continual heartbreak   As Israel continues military operations to defend itself against the grave threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon and missiles still rain on innocents in northern Israel  our hearts go out to people suffering all across the Mideast          We all want peace  and the death of every child   Lebanese in Qana or Israeli in Haifa   is an unspeakable tragedy   But we know from the hard lessons of the past that lasting peace will not come easily     and it will not come without the type of sustained involvement at the highest levels of the U S  government that we have not seen from this Administration              In fact  the violence we are seeing now is in part the bitter fruit of years of U S  neglect in the region  yet another disastrous byproduct of being distracted and bogged down in Iraq  Our inattention to diplomacy and failure to disarm Hezbollah and stop the flow of weapons from Iran and Syria    as required by UN Resolution 1559    left Israel to respond to this terrorist organization   s provocations with a bloody war that threatens to spread into a larger regional conflict   In fact  just a few hours ago General Abizaid testified that if that Resolution 1559 had been fully implemented  we wouldn   t be in this situation today   And it   s clear that our compromised position in Iraq  combined with our diplomatic isolation in the region  has reduced our leverage and undermined our ability to bring about the lasting resolution that is so desperately needed         Make no mistake about it  Israel has every right to defend itself against these terrorists  The people of Israel can count on the stalwart support of the United States during these difficult times  At the same time  the Lebanese people must know that Americans also care deeply about protecting innocent civilians and preserving their fragile democracy         That   s why we must work urgently to achieve a viable and sustainable peace agreement that includes an international force capable of ensuring Israel s security and Lebanon   s complete territorial sovereignty  the return of the kidnapped Israeli soldiers  and the permanent removal of the threat posed by Hezbollah  Given the dire circumstances  it   s imperative that we do everything in our power to accomplish this as soon as possible     and we shouldn   t be afraid of talking to any country that will help us advance this objective          But that cannot be the end of our involvement     in fact  it must be the beginning of a new era of sustained diplomatic engagement in the region   The unmistakable lesson here is that we need more much than just crisis diplomacy     we need preventive diplomacy that addresses the underlying problems before they explode   That means putting an end     once and for all     to state sponsorship of terrorism by Iran and Syria  And that requires a renewed commitment to work ceaselessly to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East                                                                                         20510
