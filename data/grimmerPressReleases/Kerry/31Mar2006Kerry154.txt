Kerry  National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners   March 31  2006  Remarks as Prepared for Delivery   I am deeply humbled by the work you do   Nurses are among America   s greatest heroes    too often unsung heroes         We might not always say it when we are rushing through the emergency room with a child that has a broken arm  or dashing from the school physical to make it to soccer practice  or when a parent leaves your offices upset with a confirmation that a child has a developmental disability     but we appreciate you   We value you   We are comforted by your expertise and the caring  professional manner that you wrap around us and our families when we seek your services   Give yourselves a round of applause       The question is whether Washington is going to change the way business is done and give you more than words of thanks     more than applause     and give you the kind of change that helps you do your job        And if the current leadership in Washington won   t stand with you  the good news is     this is an election year   Let   s make use of it   We need to make your issues the voting issues in our country     and to do that we have to make the every day injustices of our health care system as real for people as the horrific images Katrina left in its wake   Because the truth about health care is more than the faceless  soulless numbers   Any politician can effortlessly recite every statistic about 48 million uninsured Americans  the healthcare premiums increasing at three times the rate of inflation  and the cost of prescription drugs going up over 10  every year   But that doesn   t mean they understand the real human consequences of those numbers like you do       You understand because you know the frustrations of caring for a crying child who suffers unnecessarily because they didn   t have any access to basic preventative care       You understand because you deal with the frustration of day after day  hopelessly prescribing medications you know your patients need but families can   t afford         You understand because you see the frightened look on a parent   s face  wondering if you must ask for proof of citizenship before administering the care their sick children desperately need         We have the best public health professionals in the world  but the bottom line is our healthcare system is broken   It   s not just that too many pay too much  and too many others are left out of altogether   It   s all the pain endured  the promises broken  the families destroyed   all of which could be cured with a little compassion from powerful politicians who forget they were given that power to serve the people       The time has come to demand full accountability in Washington to the millions our healthcare system has forgotten   That   s why this year  I   ll be on the Senate floor pushing for KidsFirst legislation to provide health insurance for every single American child       It is with great pleasure today that we announce the addition of the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners to the growing list of organizational endorsers of our KidsFirst plan   Thank you for this support       Today  the KidsFirst coalition includes over 20 million people   And we need every one of them ready to fight   We all know what   s coming   Those who sit comfortably atop today   s health care industry will try to scare the public and the press with the same health care horror stories       They   ll tell us insuring every child means an unwieldy new bureaucracy   They don   t want people to know that under KidsFirst we can insure every child by expanding existing programs like Medicaid and S CHIP   There is no new bureaucracy  just more coverage and more care for more kids       They   ll tell us insuring every child will burden states with another un funded mandate   They don   t want people to know that under KidsFirst  states will save more than  10 billion every year under this arrangement       They   ll tell us KidsFirst is too expensive   They don   t want people to know KidsFirst costs about the same as the government spends on energy subsidies  including billions in giveaways to big oil   These politicians think making kids less important than oil companies is the right choice  and we need to make sure their constituents know it  so they can make the choice to kick those politicians out of office next November       We can beat these tired old arguments if we fight hard enough and speak truth to power   And that truth is that covering all kids would reduce avoidable hospitalizations by 22  and replace expensive critical care with inexpensive preventative care    Kids with health insurance do 68  better in measures of academic performance   If kids start getting attention in the medical waiting room  they   ll pay much better attention in the classroom       But you know what  as much as the cost savings and academic improvement do matter   the bottom line is this  insuring every child is the right thing to do  and we need to get back to an America where doing the right thing is reason enough   The debate over KidsFirst is more than statistics and political tit for tat   it   s a values debate we have to win       We   re the richest nation on the planet  yet one in four of our children go without immunizations  and one in three children with asthma don   t get medicine   That   s why it   s so amazing that all of these Republican politicians have the nerve to run around talking about values   Eleven million kids are suffering precisely because of the absence of real values in Washington   That   s the values debate we need to have in America       We need to ask where in the Bible it says you should give tax breaks to oil companies instead of health care to children        We need to ask what kind of values are represented when we know mercury has devastating health consequences for our children  yet the administration ignores key studies and lets big business write the regulations       Let   s talk about the values choice on kids    health care   You can insure every child in America for less than it costs to roll back the Bush tax cut for the wealthiest Americans   But Washington chooses the tax break for the few who don   t need it instead of healthcare for 11 million kids who need it desperately   And they lecture America about values   Let me tell you  I think it   s time America started electing people who don   t just talk about values  but who actually value families       Americans know we need to do better   They know there is no more pressing need than improving health care          Unfortunately  under this Congress and this Administration  there is a lot of defense we have to play before we get to play offense on the issues that matter most to us  I   m tired of spending all your time trying to prevent bad things from happening and then fixing them when they do  rather than putting our efforts toward moving forward on a positive health care agenda for our nation       Right now we are in the middle of fighting to fix the devastating changes imposed on the Medicaid program under last year   s so called Deficit Reduction Act       We must overturn the rules allowing increased cost sharing imposed on families that can   t afford it       We must prevent new rules from tossing out the Early  Periodic  Screening  Diagnosis  and Treatment protections for children under Medicaid       We are called to reverse the law   s anti immigrant bias that forces health care providers to verify citizenship status prior to delivery of services       And don   t even get me started on all we have to do to fix the Medicare prescription drug debacle         I think that   s how they   ve decided they will govern   keep the voice of America   s progressive alliances paralyzed to offer any new ideas or rally support for change if we are always having to defend what we like in the current system and fix the problems they create when changing it       They underestimate our passion if they think they can just tire us out or make us more cynical       We can and must do more       We need to make it legal to import affordable prescription drugs from Canada       We need to make it legal for Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices       We need to put medical decisions back in the hands of doctors  nurses  and patients   not insurance company bureaucrats       We need to address our nursing shortage by fully funding the Nurse Service Corps Scholarship Program  the Nurse Retention and Patient Safety Enhancement Grants  and the Nursing Faculty Loan Programs under the Nurse Reinvestment Act we all fought so hard to enact       We need to cut health care costs for small businesses       We need mental health parity       We need to address our growing childhood obesity epidemic       We need to reauthorize the State Child Health Insurance Program       And we need to give families access to the same private health insurance that members of Congress give themselves   It   s time we stood up and made it clear that every family   s health care is just as important as a politician   s in Washington       But we have to start somewhere   That   s why KidsFirst should be the first health care debate of 2006   To make a stand on health care  let   s start by standing next to America   s children       Now that we have our coalition built  in 2006  let   s force a vote on KidsFirst   Let   s hold Congress accountable   Let   s bring parents and doctors and nurses together to get this right for our children       When I first I sent an email telling supporters about KidsFirst  within days over 20 000 parents phoned in recordings of why the KidsFirst health plan is important to their families  I want to read a few of them for you       Jennifer from Central Islip  N Y  called in and said     I have a child who is on medication   that costs me  250 or more a month  I have children who can   t go to the dentist  You know  it   s the worst feeling in the world  as a mother  to know that in order to afford health care  you   re not going to be able to afford the home you live in          Jordan from Reading  PA called in and said     Nalani   my three year old   was born with cataracts   Eventually chances are she will be blind  Unfortunately  times are really hard in my house and we don   t have health insurance and I can   t afford to give her the surgery that will fix the problem that she has  I just can   t imagine growing up knowing that there was a way that you could have been helped  But because nobody thought you were important enough and because your parents didn   t have enough money for health insurance   you went blind          That is what KidsFirst is all about   our families and our children   and they need our action   They need the health care system to start paying attention to kids now   And you can continue to lead the way   When you leave today  call your members of Congress and demand that they co sponsor this bill   Start a letter writing campaign   Get your friends and neighbors involved   Do whatever you can to make Washington pay attention to America   s children   Keep lending your voice to this fight  and together we can provide health care for every child  and finally do what the American people want   put our Kids First                                                                                      20510
