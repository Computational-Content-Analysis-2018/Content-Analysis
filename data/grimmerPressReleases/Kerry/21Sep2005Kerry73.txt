His Opposition to Judge Roberts  Nomination for Chief Justice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Below are Senator John Kerry s full  prepared remarks on the floor of the Senate today on the upcoming vote on Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Mr  President  we all know that there are few things the Senate does which are as important as confirming a Supreme Court Justice  let alone the Chief Justice of the United States   We know that making the decision to support or oppose a nominee is serious and complicated   We don t need to belabor those points   What we do need to talk about is what kind of process must occur before a Senator can vote for or against a judicial nominee   What kind of information must be provided   What kind of discourse we must engage in         I met with Judge Roberts last week   I really enjoyed our conversation   He is earnest  friendly  and incredibly intelligent   On a personal level  I liked him   He has dedicated his life to the law  has given back to the legal community  and is certainly a superb lawyer   It may turn out that he will be an outstanding Chief Justice  but I cannot say with confidence that I know how he will approach constitutional questions of fundamental importance       I have read memos he wrote during the Reagan Administration   I have reviewed the limited materials available from his time in the Solicitor General s office  where he worked under Ken Starr  and in private practice at Hogan and Hartson   I have read the cases that he has participated in on the D C  Circuit   I have listened to the judiciary committee hearings  and I reviewed the transcripts         After all that  I still find something is missing   Something critical to our democratic process   Something to ensure that we have an appropriate understanding of our courts and our judges and their role in America   That understanding requires a real exchange of information and a real development of ideas similar  in fact  to that which occurs during every argument at the Supreme Court   In appellate arguments  judges and Justices question lawyers  probing the depth of their legal arguments and the consequences of potential outcomes   They determine how interpretive principles apply and how they can reconcile apparently conflicting arguments   The result is a better understanding of the record before the court and  hopefully  a principled approach to deciding the case        Judge Roberts  judiciary committee hearings continue an increasingly sterile confirmation process   No genuine legal engagement between the questioners and the questioned   No real exchange of information and little substantive discussion   The confirmation exercise has become little more than an empty shell         The Administration s steadfast refusal to disclose documents Judge Roberts worked on while serving as a Deputy Solicitor General in the first Bush Administration has only compounded the problem   They claim that disclosure of the documents will violate attorney client privilege  This argument is absurd   What client are they trying to protect   The Solicitor General is charged with arguing cases on behalf of all Americans   We were Judge Roberts  client when he worked in the Solicitor General s office   We have a right to know what he thought about the arguments he made on behalf of the American people         When John Roberts served as a Deputy Solicitor General under Ken Starr  he was intimately involved in critical decisions that office made  like whether to intervene in pending cases  what legal arguments to advance in support of their position  whether to push the Supreme Court to review a particular case   These decisions helped shape how federal law was applied and how our Constitution was interpreted   Yet  we the Senators who are constitutionally obligated to give consent to this nominee do not know the positions that Roberts took or the arguments that he made         For example  the Solicitor General s office decided to intervene in Bray v  Alexandria Women s Health Clinic   The case had been brought against abortion clinic protestors during the height of clinic violence and bombings   The plaintiffs argued that the protesters were violating a federal anti discrimination law by blocking access to clinics and inciting violence   The Government intervened and argued that the federal anti discrimination law did not apply and therefore could not be used to stop the protesters   Judge Roberts briefed and argued the case for the Government   I believe that the arguments advanced by the Government and the consequences of those arguments are troubling   But  what we do not know is even more important  what role did Judge Roberts have in making them   Did he consider the consequences   Did he argue for a more narrow or more broad interpretation of the law         At the same time  the Solicitor General s office intervened in a district court case in Wichita  Kansas which raised the same issues that the Supreme Court in Bray was facing   The government tried to get the district court to lift an injunction put in place to protect the safety of the clinic workers and patients   They argued that the plaintiffs could not win and therefore the injunction was improper   The district court denied the Government s request and chastised it for unnecessarily endangering people s lives   The question is what role did Judge Roberts have in making that decision   What was the legal reasoning that prompted it   Did he consider the real life dangers that would result from his legal argument       The Solicitor General s office is never obligated to intervene in private litigation   There are thousands of cases pending every day that  like these cases  raise questions of federal law   The question is why did the Government choose to intervene in these particular cases   And  even more importantly  what role did Judge Roberts have in making that decision       The Administration s refusal to disclose these documents created a serious roadblock in the Senate s ability to evaluate Judge Roberts   But Judge Roberts  refusal to genuinely engage in the confirmation hearings created an even bigger one       Now I understand that a Supreme Court nominee cannot answer questions about cases coming or likely to come before him   I understand that he cannot promise to resolve future cases in a particular way   And  I am not asking him to   But  this does not mean that he should refuse to discuss the principles of decided cases and whether he agrees with them or not   It does not mean he should refuse to disclose his approach to constitutional analysis   It does not mean that he should do nothing more than recite the status of current Supreme Court case law         This is not the first time that Supreme Court nominees have refused to engage in a meaningful discourse during judiciary committee hearings   Justice Souter refused to answer fundamental questions about his judicial philosophy   For that reason  I voted against him  and I am happy to say that I have been pleasantly surprised that my concerns regarding his views on civil rights and privacy did not come to pass   Justice Thomas also refused to answer fundamental questions about judicial philosophy   As I said at the time  Justice Thomas  found a lot of ways to say  I do not know  or  I disagree  or  I cannot agree  or  I can t say whether I agree    I voted against Justice Thomas because I did not know what kind of Justice he would be   And  I believe I was correct in making that decision       At the end of the day  I find myself much in the same position that I was with Justices Souter and Thomas   Notwithstanding his impressive legal resume  I cannot say with confidence that I know who Judge Roberts really is or what kind of Chief Justice he will be   In what direction will he take the Supreme Court   Will he protect the civil rights and liberties that we have fought so long and hard for   Will he support Congress s power to enact critical environmental legislation   Will he be an effective check on executive branch actions   Before I vote for a Chief Justice particularly one who may lead the Court for at potentially 30 years or more  I need to know the answers to these fundamental questions   Unfortunately  in the case of Judge Roberts  I do not       For example  I do not know how Judge Roberts will approach cases challenging Congress s power to enact vital national legislation   Now  I understand that terms like  Commerce Clause    Section 5 of the 14th Amendment   and  Spending Clause  probably mean little to most Americans   Yet  however technical and legalistic discussions about these terms may be  they are critically important to how our government functions   A Justice with a limited view of Congressional power will undermine Congress s ability to respond to national problems   For example  under the Commerce Clause  Congress can only regulate things that affect interstate commerce   When Congress enacted the Violence Against Women Act in 1996  it made numerous findings regarding how such violence affected interstate commerce   The Court  however  found those findings insufficient and struck down this important piece of legislation   When asked by Senator Specter whether he agreed with the Court in this case  Judge Roberts refused to answer   When asked whether he would have found similar congressional findings sufficient  Judge Roberts refused to answer   I believe those answers should have been forthcoming  particularly when they address how Judge Roberts would interpret Congress s fundamental  constitutional powers       Judge Roberts has shed some light on his view of the Commerce Clause because he wrote about it in a dissenting opinion on the D C  Circuit   In Rancho Viejo v  Norton the so called  hapless toad case  Roberts suggested that the Endangered Species Act  as applied to the California toads at issue  might be unconstitutional because they had an insufficient connection to interstate commerce   He also suggested that there might be other ways of looking at the case to preserve the Act s constitutionality   When questioned about it during the hearings  Judge Roberts did not endorse one view or the other         While his refusal to completely condemn the Endangered Species Act was somewhat reassuring  at the end of the day  I am left without any real understanding of how Judge Roberts will approach a Commerce Clause question   I have no idea whether he will undermine Congress s ability to pass needed federal legislation   I have no idea how he will approach challenges to existing federal environmental laws  like the Endangered Species Act   Which of the possible approaches he laid out in Rancho Viejo does he believe is the most correct   This uncertainty creates a risk I am unwilling to accept when voting to confirm the next Chief Justice of the United States         Another area of great concern to me is the area of privacy an area where Judge Roberts skillfully answered a lot of questions without giving a hint as to his own legal positions   For example  while Roberts admitted that the Court has recognized that privacy is protected under the Constitution as part of the liberty in the Due Process Clause  he refused to give any indication of what he thought about the Court s most recent privacy related decisions         The furthest he went was to say he had no quarrel with the decisions in Griswold and Eisenstadt  yet this kind of endorsement is hardly reassuring   In his confirmation hearings  Justice Thomas agreed that the Court had found a Constitutional right to privacy   Like Judge Roberts  he also stated that he had no quarrel with the Court s holding in Eisenstadt   Yet when he got to the Supreme Court  Judge Thomas disavowed the very rights he had said the Constitution protected   In fact  more recently  in Lawrence v  Texas  Justice Thomas stated that he could not  find  neither in the Bill of Rights nor any other part of the Constitution a  general right of privacy    The bottom line is that I simply do not know how Judge Roberts will approach questions implicating our fundamental right to privacy         In addition to what I do not know  what I do know about Judge Roberts is very troubling   I know that in the early 80 s while he worked in the Department of Justice and White House Counsel s Office  Judge Roberts took an active role in advocating on behalf of Administration policies that would have greatly undermined our civil rights and civil liberties        For example  Judge Roberts argued against using the  effects test  to determine whether section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was violated   Instead  he believed an  intent  test requiring proof of a discriminatory motive should be required  regardless of the fact that many victims of discrimination would be unable to prove a real discriminatory intent and therefore unable to enjoy the protections afforded by the Act   In some cases  the effect of Judge Robert s intent test meant that disenfranchised individuals had to prove the motive of long dead officials who crafted the election rules   That is a foolish standard when it comes between citizens and their constitutionally protected right to fair representation in our democracy         Judge Roberts also argued that the obligations imposed on educational institutions by Title IX should apply only to the specific program that received federal funding rather than to the whole institution   Again  by limiting the application of an important anti discrimination law  Roberts  position greatly undermined its purpose         In the area of affirmative action  Judge Roberts argued in favor of limiting race conscious remedies to instances where individuals were proven to be victims of identifiable acts of impermissible discrimination   And  he suggested that black applicants who were victims of discriminatory hiring practices should only be able to recover if they could demonstrate that they were more qualified than the white applicants they hired       Mr  President  I realize that Judge Roberts took the positions I just described some time ago   And  I know he told the judiciary committee that he was simply advocating the views of the Administration at the time   Yet  I find it hard to believe that a staffer at Justice or in the White House Counsel s office never wrote a memo that represented his views rather than the Administration s positions   Particularly when the theme of those memos is consistent across the board  strict adherence to narrow principles of law despite their real world impact   And  particularly when some of the memos released from this time include acknowledgements by Judge Roberts that his own position failed to prevail in internal deliberations   That was certainly true when he argued unsuccessfully within the Administration that Congress could strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over abortion and desegregation cases         I also believe that  given the extremely limited record made available to us  Judge Roberts had an obligation to explain those memos  explain his interpretative philosophy  and answer the committee s legitimate questions in that area   In the absence of the Solicitor General memos  Judge Roberts had a responsibility to dispel the record available  and he did not do it        Judge Roberts  more recent positions trouble me as well  particularly his decision to join Judge Randolph s decision in Hamdan v  Rumsfeld  the military tribunals case   That opinion gave the President unfettered and un reviewable authority to place captured individuals outside the protections of the Geneva Convention   Six retired senior military officials with extensive experience in legal policy  the laws of war  and armed conflict  have filed a friend of the court brief in the Supreme Court arguing that Hamdan must be overturned immediately because it directly endangers American soldiers         I understand that Judge Roberts felt he could not discuss the case while it was pending before the Supreme Court  but  even when asked about his views of the scope of executive power unrelated to the Hamdan case  Judge Roberts was evasive   He did little more than describe the Court s current framework for analyzing assertions of executive power   As a result  I do not know whether he believes that the state of war is a blank check for the President or whether he will closely scrutinize the legality of Executive Branch actions at all times   Given the fact that his Hamdan decision placed our troops at risk  I am forced to conclude that Judge Roberts  future decisions may further threaten the security of our troops abroad and our citizens at home         Now  some may argue that Democrats should vote for Judge Roberts because he is the best nominee we could expect from the Administration   I cannot vote to confirm the next Chief Justice of the United States simply because the next nominee to the Court may be even less protective of our fundamental rights and liberties or less dangerous to our national security   Frankly  I am not sure how I would make that determination given the limited record before me   Some may argue that Democrats should vote for Judge Roberts because of his resume  I  however  do not think that should be the test   A Supreme Court Justice needs more qualifications than an impressive resume   They need compassion and sensitivity   They need an understanding of the consequences of their decisions and how they further our democratic traditions       As a Senator  I must consider each nominee as an individual and how he or she will fit into the current  closely divided Supreme Court   I have a duty to protect the fundamental rights that I believe our Constitution guarantees   I have a duty to preserve the incredible progress that has been made towards the realization of those rights for all Americans         I have a duty to safeguard our national security  and to prevent the executive from using war as a blank check to violate both national and international law   John Roberts will be confirmed   I hope and look forward to decisions that will allay my concerns   He may author or join opinions protecting the rights which we hold so dear   And  I hope he does   But the questions I have raised  the absence of critical documents  and the lack of clarity surrounding fundamental issues like how he would interpret the Constitution require me to fulfill my Constitutional duties by opposing his nomination to be the next Chief Justice
