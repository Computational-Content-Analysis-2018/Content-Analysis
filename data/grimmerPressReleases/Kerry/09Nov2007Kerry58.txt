Kerry and Edward Kennedy today  along with Congresswoman Niki Tsongas  announced that the FY 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations Conference Report includes  8 6 million for the purchase of protective military clothing which is made at Polartec in Lawrence  Massachusetts    This investment helps a great company and its workers who have made huge sacrifices to keep good jobs right here in Massachusetts while strengthening our military and securing our homeland  said Senator Kerry  Polartec has long been a leader and Im happy that it will continue to design better  safer protective clothing for our troops    Since the days of the Minutemen  Massachusetts has been at the forefront of the defense of our nation  and today Polartec is an important part of that effort  protecting our nations finest in dangerous parts of the world  said Senator Kennedy  Im delighted that Polartec is receiving this vital federal funding to continue the innovative work they do so well for our troops    Senators Kennedy and Kerry  as well as former Congressman Meehan  have been critical supporters of Polartec and of our men and women in uniform  said Rep  Tsongas  I look forward to joining their efforts to support Polartec in its continued mission to provide our troops with world class equipment and to stimulate the local economy through keeping good jobs in the Fifth District  Polartec is a model for what a partnership between the federal government and local business can look like    Senator Kennedy  Senator Kerry and Congresswoman Tsongas commitment to ensuring that our men and women in uniform receive this vital gear remains unwavering  said Polartec President Andy Vecchione  It is an honor to work with them to facilitate getting top notch products made by our workers into the hands of those who need them most  our soldiers  Their combined efforts continue to directly impact our 1000 employees here in Massachusetts and we are extremely grateful for their hard work   The Polartec projects receiving funding are the following     3 2 million for the Fleece Insulating Liners for Extended Cold Weather Clothing System Generation III  ECWCS GEN III  Currently soldiers and units of the Army use obsolete cold weather clothing  The ECWCS GEN III was developed in direct response to soldiers complaints of bulkiness and lack of breathability as an existing issue  Soldiers stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan often suffer from overheating when active and cold when standing still  This radical redesign of ECWCS requires 33  less space and weighs 25  less than previous generations  allowing soldiers to move with greater ease     2 million for the Multi Climate Protection System  MCPS  The Multi Climate Protection System is a modular ensemble that provides total performance by layering thermal protection shell garments  Polartec Thermal Flame Resistant  FR  with NOMEX fleece knit structures provide aircrew with enhanced thermal protection  flame protection and reduced thermal burden via dimensional moisture management  Wind and water resistance capabilities are obtained using Polartec WindPro with NOMEX in the outer layer wear     1 million for Responsive Textiles The US Army Natick Soldier Center has recognized a need for reducing the weight and bulk of the war fighter while maintaining breathability and as needed insulation  A single responsive garment would replace a multitude of layers  allowing for maximum mobility in varying environments  This funding will research the feasibility of a Responsive Textile concept  estimate costs  manufacture a prototype concept  and conduct fabric testing  bulk testing  and thermal analysis of the prototype concept under varying temperatures     2 4 million for the Cold Weather Layering System  CWLS  The requested funds will be used to provide war Fighters with a capability set of clothing to facilitate expeditionary operations in mountainous and cold weather environments  It will reduce the weight and volume that a Marine operating as dismounted infantry must carry to accomplish combat missions in those conditions  Malden Mills is currently developing Polartec Poweder Dry Silkweight  and Polartec Dry Grid with flame resistant properties for use in the CWLS  in direct response to the U S  Marine Corps unique combat needs  Roadside bombs kill or wound more troops than any other weapon in Iraq  The heat and flame produced by roadside bombs presents a significant burn threat  and the USMC has called for the use of flame resistant textiles to maintain safety in harsh combat conditions                                                                                20510
