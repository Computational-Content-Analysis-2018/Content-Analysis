John Kerry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I still remember just two years ago  standing in a packed amphitheater in Denver talking with thousands of people from across Colorado who believed in the promise of stem cell research to find cures and save lives       In the shadow of the Rocky Mountains  many in wheelchairs  many who had lost loved ones to disease  and many who knew a cure wouldn t come in time for them but could save others wanted leadership that fought for them back in Washington  I have not forgotten the looks in their eyes  or my promise to them       That s why I was stunned that the president s political adviser  Karl Rove  chose Denver to announce that President Bush is threatening to use the veto pen for the first time in his presidency to strike down a stem cell research bill that offers hope to millions of Americans suffering from devastating illnesses       President Bush has signed 1 163 bills into law without vetoing a single one of them  A veto now would send a message to all Americans that  on crucial issues  our differences are greater than our shared convictions  It would tell the world that America no longer wants to be the country that pushes the envelope of scientific knowledge and discovery       Congress has taken the politics out of stem cell research  It s time the White House does  too       What a tragedy it would be if the first veto of Bush s presidency were used to make a political wedge of something that Washington and the rest of America overwhelmingly support   regardless of their political party   and a promise that offers hope to millions and could put American on the path to leading the world in the discovery of cures       The issue of stem cell research is deeply personal and raises profound moral questions  But people of goodwill and good sense can resolve these complex ethical issues without stopping lifesaving research  The House of Representatives has passed bipartisan legislation led by Rep  Diana DeGette  and the Senate is poised to pass groundbreaking stem cell legislation in the next few weeks  with the support of Republicans like John McCain  R Ariz   Bill Frist  R Tenn   Orrin Hatch  R Utah  and Nancy Reagan       Growing numbers of conservatives have looked at the scientific facts and searched their own consciences in realizing that opposing this groundbreaking research isn t a  pro life policy   that an ethical consensus can be found to ban human cloning while protecting stem cell research       The stakes couldn t be higher  More than 100 million Americans suffer from illnesses that might one day be cured away with stem  cell therapy  Stem cells could replace damaged heart cells or cells destroyed by cancer  offering a new lease on life to those with a diagnosis that once came with a death sentence  Research has the potential to slow the loss of a grandmother s memory  calm the hand of an uncle with Parkinson s  save a child from a lifetime of daily insulin shots or permanently lift a best friend from a wheelchair       Some of the most pioneering cures and treatments are now right at our fingertips  but because of politics they could remain beyond reach  Every day we wait  more than 3 000 Americans die from diseases that may someday be treatable because of stem cell research       Americans have been presented with a false choice between the sanctity of human life and the scientific knowledge that can save it  The president s veto rests on the false assumption that we have to choose between our dreams and our principles  We can have both       We can support our scientists  help the sick and ensure that our legal and ethical boundaries reflect our unshakable sense of human dignity       I ll never forget a woman I met at a town hall meeting on stem  cell research  She stood up  her frail body shaking  and pleaded for her government to embrace stem cell research  It was the moral clarity of her message that will stay with me forever   It s too late for me   she said   but we need to do this for those who still have hope   It s not too late for this President to change his mind before tying the hands of doctors and ethicists with a veto  It s not too late to give millions of Americans what they want most of all  hope       John Kerry is a U S  senator from Massachusetts and was the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee                                                                          20510
