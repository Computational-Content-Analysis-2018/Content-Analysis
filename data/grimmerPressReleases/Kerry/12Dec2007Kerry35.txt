Kerry sent a letter to National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell and to cable executives from Time Warner and Comcast today  asking them to meet with Kerry next week  Kerry is inviting the executives to Washington with the goal of brokering a deal between the League and the cable companies  over how to ensure that a maximum number of viewers are able to watch the December 29th game between the New York Giants and the New England Patriots  The game is currently scheduled to be televised on the NFL Network  As a result of the current standoff between the League and Cable  millions of fans across the country are unable to view certain games on the NFL network without paying extra for a premium tier  Last week  Kerry wrote to cable and the NFL and asked that the two sides come to an agreement quickly to ensure that fans across the country are able to tune in to this potentially historic football game  The Patriots are aiming to finish the season as the first team to go undefeated since the Miami Dolphins accomplished the feat in 1972  Kerry has strongly advocated for sports fans in the past  most recently when he held a hearing on a similar deal between Major League Baseball and major cable corporations earlier this year  The companies eventually reached a deal that accommodated fans  Below is the text of Kerrys letters  December 12  2007 Mr  Roger Goodell  Commissioner  National Football League  280 Park Avenue  New York  NY 10017 Dear Commissioner Goodell  Thank you for your prompt response to my letter of last week  I appreciate the expressed willingness of both the NFL and the cable companies involved in the NFL Network dispute to reach an agreement regarding the broadcast of the December 29th game between the New England Patriots and the New York Giants  The Patriots pursuit of a perfect season has attracted a legion of new fans to the sport and has been an important financial boost for the NFL  Given the unique circumstances surrounding this game  we cannot allow proprietary interests to trump commercial interests and prevent an agreement from being reached in time to ensure the broadest possible level of viewership  The popularity of the National Football League was built around the accessibility of the game to the fans  If possible  such a principle should be upheld with respect to a game of this significance  I remain hopeful that an agreement can be reached in time to ensure that a maximum number of Massachusetts residents  as well as football fans across the country  are able to view this game  Since time is of the essence  I would ask that representatives from the NFL  Time Warner and Comcast join me in a meeting next week in my Washington office to discuss potential solutions to this problem  Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns  Sincerely    John F  Kerry cc  David L  Cohen  Executive Vice President
