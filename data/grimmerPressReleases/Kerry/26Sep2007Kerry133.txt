John Kerry spoke from the floor today in support of the peaceful  democratic uprising in Burma  praising the bravery of the demonstrators while condemning Burmas brutal junta  Kerry emphasized the need for strong U S  diplomatic leadership to rally the international community in defense of the Burmese people      Below are Kerrys remarks  as prepared      Mr  President  Against all odds  the long suffering people of Burma have risen up against one of the worlds most repressive regimes  What began a month ago as modest  impromptu protests has since mushroomed into a nation wide  peaceful democratic groundswell  Tens of thousands of students have joined Buddhist monks in the streets  marching and chanting in unison against Burmas brutal military rulers       The Burmese people should know that America and all free peoples across the globe stand in awe of their commitment and courage  Their actions follow in the venerable footsteps of Mahatma Gandhi  Nelson Mandela  Lech Walesa  and all those heroes who understood that nonviolent resistance is humanitys greatest weapon against tyranny and injustice  I want to join the President of the United States  Prime Minister Gordon Brown  Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and many others in letting them know  We support your struggle  We stand with you       What is happening today in the streets of Rangoon is as tenuous as it is unexpected  The cabal of generals  who pillage Burma under the guise of governing it  could easily meet these non violent protests with a bloodbath  just like they did in 1988  And we must do all that we can to ensure that this does not come to pass      No one should doubt the Burmese juntas potential for brutality and large scale violence  Since taking power  they have killed tens of thousands of Burmese and razed more villages than have been destroyed in Darfur  Over half a million have been internally displaced  and an additional one million refugees have fled the country  These tyrannical thugs have engaged in the systematic use of forced labor  human trafficking  forcible recruitment of child soldiers  torture  and rape  an appalling laundry list of human rights violations       And  yet  despite such grave danger  the people of Burma have stood strong in the face of this extraordinary evil  to demand democratic reforms and basic human rights  They have done so with dignity  and they have done so peacefully       The United States and the rest of the free world must stand with the people of Burma  The Presidents decision yesterday to target the top generals for financial sanctions is a step in the right direction  but it will not solve the problem  And it is not enough       The massive pro democracy demonstrations in Burma represent the best opportunity for genuine political change in nearly twenty years  Burmas Saffron Revolution is also an excellent chance for America to finally show greater diplomatic leadership on the world stage       The United States must lead the international community in pressuring the military junta to release all political prisoners  starting with the venerable Nobel Peace Prize laureate and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi  and take steps down the path towards political change      This weeks gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly is a tailor made forum to get tough with Burmas generals  From the halls of the United Nations to the headquarters of the Association of South East Asian Nations  ASEAN   the message to the Burmese military must be clear  The world is united behind the people marching in your streets  Do not meet peaceful protest with still more butchery  We are prepared to act in concert against you unless you immediately embark on serious negotiations toward sharing power with the people of Burma      Showing diplomatic leadership on Burma also requires that we demand better from those countries that have propped up this brutal regime and are thus best equipped to pressure it  India and  in particular  China  The President and the United Nations must engage in strenuous diplomacy with Beijing  which carries the most sway with Burmas generals  and urge the Chinese to press for political reform       China has in its grasp a momentous opportunity to demonstrate leadership commensurate with its growing power and status  Beijing can host the 2008 Olympics as an enabler of cruelty and repression or as a responsible stakeholder in the world community  This is an important test  The world is watching      As the international community exerts greater pressure on the military junta  it must also reach out more aggressively with humanitarian assistance for the Burmese people       The people of Burma have suffered not only under the bullets and bayonets of the current regime  but also from decades of misrule that have transformed their resource rich nation into one of the poorest in Asia  Many of Burmas 52 million people live in abject misery  About one third are mired in poverty  Nearly half of all children never get to go to school  Malaria and tuberculosis are widespread  and mortality rates in Burma are among the highest in Asia  At least 37 000 died of HIV AIDS in 2005  and over 600 000 are infected with HIV       Burmas suffering destabilizes Southeast Asia  Heroin and methamphetamines  HIV AIDS and other infectious diseases  as well as hordes of refugees are spilling across Burmas borders into neighboring countries      The international community must respond to this ongoing tragedy by providing humanitarian aid to a desperate and deserving people  Current levels of international assistance are woefully insufficient  We need a network of public and private donors to fund health  education  and infrastructure projects  The resilient and brave Burmese people have shown they are more than worthy of our support and compassion      I want to close by offering a final word of warning  We must not forget Burmas last great democratic uprising in 1988  one that was brutally crushed by the military at the cost of some 3 000 innocent lives  That day and the repression that followed show the horrible human toll of our collective failure to act       A peaceful  pro democratic outcome in Burma is within reach  the UN  ASEAN  India  and especially China must stand with the United States in solidarity with the Burmese people  We must not fail the people of Burma once again
