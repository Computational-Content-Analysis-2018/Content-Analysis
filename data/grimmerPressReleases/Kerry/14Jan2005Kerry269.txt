ENACTING A MILITARY FAMILY BILL OF RIGHTS    John Kerrys Plan  Increase the Size of the Military and Stand By Military Families This week  Senator Kerry will introduce legislation to expand the Army and Marine Corps and help meet the needs of Americas Military families  Expanding the Active Duty Army and Marine Corps are essential first steps in strengthening our military  relieving the stress on the force  preventing the emergence of a hollow military and keeping America strong  Senator Kerrys legislation will grow the Army by 30 000 and the Marine Corps by 10 000  Given recruitment and training times  it will take approximately two years for these new troops to be ready to deploy  The American military must also be reshaped to meet todays threat environment  The Pentagon should ensure the new troops are trained to perform stability operations  such as civil affairs  psychological operations and military police  The U S  military is too small for our national security needs  Current deployments have stretched the American military to its breaking point  Active duty troops are facing lengthy and repeated tours  Of the National Guards 15 most combat ready brigades  14 are either in Iraq  recently returned or on alert to deploy in the next year  The Chief of the Army Reserve recently warned that his force was rapidly degenerating into a broken force  Our military must have the strength and resources to meet any challenge  now and in the future  Challenges to Americas security do not start and stop with Iraq  The war in Iraq taught us that a lightening fast  information age military can drive to Baghdad in three weeks  but it also reminded us that there is no technological substitute for boots on the ground  Our ongoing commitments in Iraq  the nature of the War on Terror and the need to be ready for any future challenges mandate larger ground forces  equipped and trained for any mission  Our armed forces must be ready to meet tomorrows challenges  wherever and whenever they occur  Keeping Americas military strong also means keeping faith with Americas Military Families  About half of todays military is married  Good commanders know that even if you recruit an individual soldier  you retain a family  Providing for Americas military families isnt just the right thing to do  its also a smart investment in American military strength  During the 2004 campaign  Senator Kerry proposed a Military Family Bill of Rights  Several of those provisions  including protecting imminent danger pay and family separation allowances  were acted on by Congress last year  This year  Senator Kerry will continue to fight for the unfinished portions of that agenda  introducing an updated Military Family Bill of Rights to improve the way our government treats military families  The proposal focuses on fundamental needs like health care  housing and financial security when a loved one is killed or injured  The Kerry plan will   Allow Americans to donate to military relief charities on their income tax forms  similar to the current earmark that can be made to public financing of elections   Allow surviving widows and children to remain in military housing for up to 365 days  rather than the current 180 days   Increase the death benefit to the families of troops who die in action to  250 000  Doing so  when combined with the  250 000 insurance policy already carried by service members brings total compensation to  500 000   Allow penalty free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts for expenses associated with deployments   Extend TRICARE eligibility to all members of the National Guard and Reserves  whether mobilized or not   Provide COBRA eligibility to Reservists who prefer to keep their families covered with private health insurance   Expand Post Traumatic Stress Disorder programs in the Department of Veterans Affairs   Establish economic injury disaster grants for small businesses that employ Reservists   Empower the Small Business Administration to help Reservist owned small businesses prepare for potential mobilizations  and  Create Veteran Entrepreneurship Loans to help veterans start new businesses  Cost of the Legislation The total cost of the Kerry plan would be approximately  6 5 to  8 billion  Taken separately  raising the armed forces by 40 000 personnel will cost between  4 5 and  5 billion per year  and the Military Family Bill of Rights would be between  2 and  3 billion per year  By comparison  the United States is currently spending about  5 billion a month on military operations and reconstruction in Iraq                                                                          20510
