                                                                                                                                                                            Remarks by Senator John Kerry     Security in the 21st Century      March 5  2006  University of Ulster  EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY   What a wonderful privilege to be part of the Tip O   Neill lecture series here at the University of Ulster   I had the pleasure of working with Tip in Congress  and had the even greater pleasure of calling him a friend   He campaigned for me  and I for him     and I am privileged that every one of his children have helped me over the years  Tip didn   t just tell us that all politics is local     he showed us   I will never forget when I was a young prosecutor in Cambridge  Tip came by to campaign  It was a joyous  raucous visit  Amazingly  Tip called everyone he met by their first name  He was incredibly proud of his Irish roots  and all of us were proud of him for his decades of public service to his country and the world        I would also like to extend a special thanks to my friend John Hume for inviting me to speak here today   I don   t need to tell anyone here about the accomplishments of John Hume     you live them every day  With his courage  sacrifice and creativity    his vision for peace and prosperity     his uncanny ability to find optimism in the midst of great adversity     he exemplifies the kind of leader we need to meet the extraordinary challenges of this new century   But I can tell you this from the graciousness and patience he showed in scheduling my visit here today  it   s clear that the qualities that were the hallmark of his public life continue to serve him well now          When John Hume accepted his Nobel Peace Prize in 1998  he told a story that remains as powerful today as when he first told it eight years ago   He said          On my first visit to Strasbourg in 1979 as a member of the European Parliament  I went for a walk across the bridge from Strasbourg to Kehl  Strasbourg is in France  Kehl is in Germany  They are very close  I stopped in the middle of the bridge and I meditated  There is Germany  There is France  If I had stood on this bridge 30 years ago  after the end of the second world war when 25 million people lay dead across our continent for the second time in this century  if I had said     Don   t worry  In 30 years    time we will all be together in a new Europe  our conflicts and wars will be ended  and we will be working together in our common interests     I would have been sent to a psychiatrist          Well  who knows  he may yet have to see that psychiatrist     but the fact is he   s always been driven by a great sense of optimism for the possibilities the future could hold  and we all admire him greatly for that        This January  I took a trip of my own where I saw first hand the importance of applying this lesson of hope and perseverance to the challenges we face today    I saw emerging democracies in Afghanistan and Iraq struggling to overcome terrorism and sectarian strife as they work to create a better future   I saw Israel   s democracy persevere despite the incapacitation of its leader   I saw high tech companies thriving in India in the midst of great poverty  In Pakistan  where tensions between a secular leader and a restless Islamist movement run high  thanks to the response of the world I saw 9 000 children emerge from the devastation of a massive earthquake go to school for the first time         I saw open societies and closed societies  rich and poor  high tech and low tech  secular and religious  Everywhere I turned  there were disconnects   So many people desperately trying to connect to the rest of the world to make a better future  while so many others desperately cling to the past  doing everything in their power to prevent connection to anything unfamiliar         These disconnects map the fault lines of today   s conflict and future conflicts   It is in these fault lines that radical Islamists recruit their followers by playing to stereotypes of western civilization   But it is here that the critical challenges of our time are defined  winning the struggle against terror and stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction       Frankly  we should start by better understanding what we are up against   The war on terror     as it is so often called     even exploited    is really a far bigger challenge than the words suggest   Terror is only a tactic  The bigger struggle we are engaged in is much more than a military operation in Iraq and Afghanistan  and it started long before 9 11  It is  above all  a much more complicated undertaking than some have made it sound  In fact  our long term security is today as it has always been  dependent on addressing the multi layered fabric of life which motivates those who use terror       The truth is that we are caught in the middle of a decades old internal struggle in the Islamic World   It is fundamentally a war within Islam for the heart and soul of Islam  stretching from Morocco east to Indonesia   In regions where the mosque remains the only respected alternative to autocratic state structures  there is no credible secular alternative   And no center of moral authority has emerged to stop those who would murder in the name of Islam       So ultimately  this is a struggle for the transformation of the Greater Middle East into a region that is no longer isolated from the global economy  no longer dependent on despotism for stability  no longer fearful of freedom  and no longer content to feed restive and rising populations of unemployed young people a diet of illusions  excuses  and dead end government jobs       To succeed  we must have a strategy that does everything possible to increase the internal demand for transformation in the Greater Middle East  especially its Arab core  This means we must become significantly more engaged in leveraging transformation     we must wage a more effective war of ideas and ideologies   But make no mistake  in the end  this war must be fought and won within the Islamic world  So we have a huge stake in finding partners in the Arab world who are willing not only to lead the transformation of the Middle East  but to reestablish the broad and unchallenged moral authority needed to isolate and defeat terrorists       We must also  finally  liberate not only ourselves  but the Middle East itself from the tyranny of dependence on petroleum  which has frustrated every impulse towards modernization of the region  while giving its regimes the resources to hold onto power   The international community of democratic nations cannot afford to continue funding both sides of the war on terror   We must end the empire of oil   And these efforts have to be truly international    all linked to the rapid emergence of new energy technologies  in order to ensure that growing economies like China and India don t just replace us as the enablers of Middle East despots       These are daunting challenges  To wage this war with any credibility in the Muslim world  we must work to address the impression that we have done too little to achieve real progress in bringing peace to the Middle East   The victory of Hamas in the Palestinian elections makes the prospect of establishing a democratic Palestine at peace with Israel seem even more distant  But we must not lose sight of the fact that lasting peace there is key to denying Islamic extremists a recruiting tool and denying repressive regimes an excuse not to address problems at home         History is replete with examples of conflicts that at times seemed endless and intractable   But history also teaches us that if the desire for peace stays strong  it is always possible to prevail   There are lessons of perseverance and determination for peace to be learned from your experience here in Northern Ireland   You know better than anyone how long and arduous this process can be   The citizens of Northern Ireland have proven that progress is possible for those with the courage to seize it       We have also learned from experience that successfully meeting great challenges like winning the war on terror requires more than just one nation changing its policies   Great American presidents from Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy understood that success requires a community of nations working together  drawing strength from shared sacrifice and steadfast commitment to our shared ideals  We must once again forge great alliances of common purpose that increase our collective strength and amplify our collective voice  so that we defeat any form of tyranny in a battle of ideas  That means strengthening and reforming not weakening and walking away from the ability of the U N  to play a forceful role in troubled places like Iraq and Darfur        Literally  the west must reclaim its moral leadership   To be successful in this battle of ideas  we must undermine the jihadist propaganda about the west  All allied nations have to pay greater attention to how our words and deeds are understood in the Middle East  because our good intentions are doubted by the very people the terrorists seek to turn against us   And these efforts must be bolstered with tangible investments  not just in foreign aid  but in the Arab people themselves in the form of schools  hospitals and other institutions that give people a voice and a stake in civil society       All of the allies  from Europe to the Americas to Asia  must work harder to strengthen our commitment and enhance our efforts to integrate the Middle East into the global economy   This is the only way to stop economic regression  spur investment beyond the oil industry  and spark trade  investment and growth in the region   It   s the only way to turn young minds and energy away from terror       In addition  all our allies must join together to counter the teaching of hatred in Madrassas throughout the Middle East  We must press regimes more consistently and effectively to teach tolerance in schools and broaden educational opportunities throughout the region  And we must work with moderate Muslims  especially clerics  to permanently discredit the belief that the murder of innocents can be justified in the name of God  race  or nation       This will be difficult  but it can be done  There is a serious fight going on right now for the soul of Islam  As is so often the case  an extremist minority has captured the attention of the world  But despite what you see on the news  this isn   t a one sided fight   In 2004 in Amman  Jordan  senior Islamic leaders and leading moderate statesmen like King Abdullah of Jordan came together to preach religious cooperation and non violence   In July of 2005  moderate Muslim clerics again came together in Amman and issued a formal fatwa  or religious edict  against terror         That may not sound like much to us  but the terrorists apparently took this threat from moderate Muslims very seriously   In the weeks and months after the 2005 Amman fatwa  Muslims were attacked from Amman itself to Sharm el Sheik to Pakistan   In fact  the overwhelming majority of recent terrorist victims have been Muslims   And the voices of moderation responded again this past January at the Hajj pilgrimage  where Saudi Arabia   s leading cleric condemned the use of terrorism in the name of Islam        Obviously  the struggle for the future of Islam isn   t a fight the west can win alone    but we can offer critical support as we spread our democratic message  To do that  democratic values and openness should be championed not simply as western values but as the universal values that they are   Democracy spreads with patient but firm determination  led by individuals of courage who dream of a better day for their country   Viktor Yushchenko had that dream in Ukraine   Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan   And Lech Walesa in Poland   We need to create the conditions where this dream can become a reality in the Arab world       Above all  we must remember  democratization is not a crusade   If it is seen as the result of an army marching through Muslim lands it will fail   Perhaps more importantly  that   s not the way democracy works  Creating a democracy requires more than an election  as the defeat of the ruling Fatah party by Hamas in the Palestinian elections further illustrates   The challenge requires building transparent  accountable and functioning democratic institutions that will enable democratically elected governments to provide basic goods and services to their people       In the end  these steps can open a region that for too long has been closed to opportunity and progress   And they will help to modernize governments and create societies that can better meet the needs of their citizens  respond to their grievances  and provide a more hopeful alternative to the dark ideology of terror   That would be a real battle of ideas   a battle I believe we can win if free nations fight together       Taking these steps is the key to effectively addressing the root causes of terror  and beginning on a path toward long term victory   But terrorism is not the only threat to our security   We must also do a better job stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction  and preventing the transfer of those weapons to terrorists       It was a notable moment in the 2004 presidential campaign when President Bush and I agreed that terrorists armed with nuclear weapons posed the greatest security threat of the 21st Century   To meet this challenge  we are going to have to be strong   but also smart   The most obvious example of this potentially devastating nexus is Iran  where the world   s leading state sponsor of terrorism has defied the world by moving forward with its nuclear program   A nuclear armed Iran clearly poses an unacceptable threat to global security   To make sure that never happens  America must lead an unrelenting collective effort that matches the urgency of the threat         To be smart  however  we must also correct the inherent flaw in the nuclear Non  Proliferation Treaty that allows nations such as Iran to advance their illicit nuclear weapons capability under the cover of permitted civilian nuclear programs   The fact is that once a country can create its own nuclear fuel  it can probably build a nuclear weapon  To prevent this  America and other nuclear powers must establish international control of the nuclear fuel cycle by creating a reliable  affordable  and accessible bank of nuclear fuel  This will allow us to provide reactor fuel to states that conform to non proliferation agreements while keeping that fuel under strict international safeguards        America can also provide more determined leadership in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons by setting the right example ourselves  By advancing negotiations on a global fissile material cut off treaty  foreswearing the development of new nuclear weapons  and ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  we can send the right message to the world about our commitment to creating a more effective global non proliferation regime        To meet these great challenges of terrorism and proliferation  we must reinvigorate alliances so we can marshal the collective will and resources of America and our allies  The United States has been at its best when working together with other countries in an international system of global reach and power that links the security and welfare of all free nations around the world   It was this system that won the Cold War and made possible the incredible progress of the last 60 years  It is an approach that restores traditions that have passed the test of time    and that is the message I take home with me after traveling the world from India to Pakistan to Iraq to Israel        So as John Hume once said     The challenge now is to grasp and shape history  to show that past grievances and injustices can give way to a new generosity of spirit and action     We have a long way to go before we have met the great challenges of the 21st Century  But with inspired leadership and unwavering commitment  I believe that together we can create a world in which wars are rare  a world in which America and her allies are protected by alliances forged in common interest and purpose  and a world in which order is preserved by the will of democratic nations who understand that all ships rise on a rising tide  And as we have learned from John  even though it may sometimes feel like we should have our heads examined  we must never stop believing that day will come         Thank you all for coming tonight                                                                                   20510
