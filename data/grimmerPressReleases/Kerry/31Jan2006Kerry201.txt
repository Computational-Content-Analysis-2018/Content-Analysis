Union Address                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Below is a statement from Senator John Kerry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           President Bush tonight described a very different state of our union than the one most Americans live with every day  In fact  he described a fantasyland  In Republican Washington  the rhetoric continues to mislead and the promises continue to be broken  It   s going to take more than poll tested lines in a speech to strengthen our union  It   s going to take change in Washington to make America stronger         President Bush refuses to tell the truth about America   s dependence on oil  It   s the Bush Administration and Washington Republicans who are addicted to oil  and this Administration refuses to break the dependence that undermines our economy and threatens our security  America   s dependence on oil has gotten worse on this President   s watch  He won   t acknowledge that Vice President Cheney let lobbyists write an energy bill behind closed doors that   s helped the big oil companies earn record profits while Americans are squeezed at the pump  We can   t drill our way to energy independence  we must invent our way there  but we can   t do it if this President won   t tell the truth about our energy future         President Bush uses national security as a political weapon while day by day we become less secure  We   re bogged down in Iraq where there were no weapons of mass destruction while Osama bin Laden is still on the loose  North Korea has quadrupled its nuclear weapons  Iran is closer to nuclear weapons  and Hamas has come to power   Our brave men and women in uniform deserve presidential leadership equal to their sacrifice   Americans deserve the truth  President Bush needs to stop retreating from reality  We can   t afford leadership that still cuts and runs from the truth        Here at home  middle class families work harder to make ends meet as pensions disappear  credit card debt mounts  and health care costs soar while President Bush   s tax policies continue to shift the burden from wealth to work  President Bush won   t tell the truth about their America   Health care premiums are up  the ranks of the uninsured continue to grow  and seniors still struggle to afford prescription medication while lobbyists for the big drug companies write legislation that guarantees big profits  President Bush won   t tell the truth about that America                                                    The Washington corruption and cronyism that got top White House aides indicted and left a political hack in charge of FEMA when Hurricane Katrina struck still run rampant  But President Bush won   t reform the party he leads  and the Gulf Coast is still waiting for the help the president promised months ago  For Americans whose trust in government has been broken or Louisianans waiting for relief  this Administration isn   t doing a    heck of a job     Hurricane force spin won   t change that  only real leadership will          In our America  we can achieve anything we set our minds to   It   s time for President Bush to be straight with the American people about the challenges we face and the consequences of his failed policies  Only then will we build a stronger union in 2006                   State of the Union Reality Check    Tax Policy     President Bush   s tax policies have shifted the tax burden from wealth to work  President Bush advocates that making his tax policies permanent will keep the economy and the small business sector strong  but his tax policy has turned surpluses into deficits  His tax policy is skewed towards the highest income earners  Ninety nine percent of households with small business income do not benefit from a reduction in the top income tax rate or the repeal of the estate tax     Competitiveness     President Bush claims he wants to increase American competitiveness by improving the quality of education in our country   However  tuition and fees have increased 57 percent for a public four year college and 32 percent for a private four year college since 2000  and the President just signed an education appropriations bill that fails  for the fourth year in a row  to increase the maximum Pell Grant award   4 050    In fact  only 9  of Pell Grant eligible students will receive funds under the current reconciliation bill   President Bush talks about investing to keep this country competitive but continues to reduce federal funding for research   The President   s last budget request included cuts in many critically needed federal research programs within the Department of Defense and the National Institute of Standards and Technology   Funding for other critical research programs such as the National Institutes of Health  the National Science Foundation  and other federal civilian research and development programs received only a nominal increase   These irresponsible choices made by the Bush Administration are causing America to lose its edge over the rest of the world in math and science       Iraq     The President painted a rosy picture of progress in Iraq  but he still refuses to give Americans any idea of when our troops are coming home  or how we will bring about the political solution to the insurgency that our generals tell us we need  John Kerry   s Strategy for Success in Iraq calls for the Administration to provide a proposed timeline for the redeployment of U S  troops as key security and political benchmarks are met     with a goal of having the majority of our forces withdrawn by the end of 2006    and sets forth a series of steps necessary to bring about a political solution to the insurgency  He believes the Administration misled the country about Iraq   s WMD program  and has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to complete its investigation into misuse of pre war intelligence      NSA Domestic Spying     The  President continues to claim that he did not violate the law by authorizing spying on American citizens without a warrant  and that the program is necessary to keep the country safe  John Kerry believes the President violated the law by authorizing domestic spying without a warrant in clear contravention of the FISA statute   He agrees that we need to listen to Al Qaeda   s phone conversations  but believes that FISA allows this while still preserving the rule of law   John Kerry has called for an independent council investigation to get to the bottom of the domestic spying program  and for the Administration to come to Congress if the FISA law needs to be changed       War on Terror     The President continues to tout his success in the War on Terror despite the fact that Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al Zawahiri are still at large  John Kerry believes that the Administration made a grave error by failing to get bin Laden and Zawahiri at Tora Bora  then diverted resources from pursuing these terrorists to invade Iraq      Ethics and Lobbying Reform     President Bush talks about lobbying reform  But published reports show that Bush Administration officials met approximately 200 times with Jack Abramoff  who recently pleaded guilty to conspiracy  mail fraud and tax evasion charges   The Bush Administration has repeatedly refused to provide any substantive information regarding those meetings  John Kerry has written a letter to White House Chief of Staff Andy Card requesting they release a detailed list of all contacts between federal officials and Jack Abramoff since the Bush Administration took office       Energy Relief     President Bush claims he supports policies that promote reliable supplies of affordable  environmentally responsible energy to keep our economy growing   However  the Bush Administration fought John Kerry   s provision  which was supported 96 0 on the Senate floor  to provide low cost loans to small businesses and farmers suffering from those high prices     Dependence on Oil   President Bush responds to high energy prices by acknowledging we have to reduce our dependence on oil  but he has repeatedly opposed legislative measures to curb our consumption of oil  During his presidency  America   s dependence on foreign oil has increased and there have been dramatic increases in gas prices  While Bush proposed an energy bill with billions in tax breaks and regulatory relief for the gas and oil industries  these same companies recorded historic profits upwards over  100 billion in 2005  John Kerry has repeated warned of the dangers to our environment  economy and security regarding our dependence on oil and proposed a multi pronged approach to end our dependence on foreign oil in ten years     Energy Independence and Nation Security   The President has failed in safeguarding one of the most critical aspects of national security  energy independence  We know groups such as Hamas and al Qaeda have received funding from Saudi Arabia  while we know how energy dependence can shortchange national security from the billions of American dollars sent out of the country to many regimes  who don   t share our values  John Kerry has proposed ways of inventing new energy technologies by tapping into America   s strength   our markets  our invention  our innovation and our values   to foster a revolution toward an energy world that benefits our environment  our economy  and most importantly our national security     Hurricane Disaster Relief     The President says he won   t forget the people of the Gulf   However  after five months  out of almost 320 000 applications from homeowners for help  more than 100 000 have been denied and almost half of the business owners are in limbo  still waiting for their loans even to be processed   John Kerry introduced an amendment to CJS appropriations giving the SBA more tools to help the victims  but the Administration blocked that and other proposals      Health Savings Accounts     President Bush continues to push tax cuts and health savings accounts as his solution for covering the uninsured   But his prescription is seriously flawed   Health savings accounts ask people to pay more money out of pocket for their care  take higher risks that they won   t get sick   John Kerry believes there is a better way   We should expand coverage and make health care more affordable by giving Americans access to the same highly rated health plan that Members of Congress give themselves    Small Business Assistance     President Bush has claimed for five years that he is a champion of small business  Yet President Bush has slashed the Small Business Administration   s budget by 50 percent since coming to office  John Kerry has offered real assistance to America   s small businesses with legislation to increase opportunities for small business Federal contractors  provide relief from confusing and burdensome regulations  and hold large prime contractors accountable for unscrupulous actions towards their small business subcontractors    S  137  The Small Business Contractor Safeguard Act      The Bush Economic Record    SINCE PRESIDENT BUSH TOOK OFFICE IN JANUARY 2001     Unemployment Up     1 4 million more people are unemployed      Unemployment rate is up 0 7 percentage points to 4 9 percentage points      Long term unemployment has doubled to 1 4 million people     Lackluster Job Creation     Job growth has averaged just 34 000 jobs per month  16 000 per month in the private sector  monthly growth of 125 000 to 150 000 is necessary to absorb a growing labor force       2 8 million manufacturing jobs have been lost     Falling Wages     Real wages have fallen in the past two years and are up only 2 percent for the 5 year period      The usual weekly earnings of the typical full time worker have declined by 0 9 percent after inflation      Hourly and weekly wages for working families when adjusted for inflation were  46 058 in 2000  and have declined to  44 389 today      Lower Income  Rising Poverty     Median household income has declined by  1 669 or 3 6 percent after inflation     5 4 million more Americans live in poverty  for a total of 37 million people in poverty     1 4 million more children live in poverty  for a total of 13 million children in poverty    Sustained  Record Deficits     A  128 billion federal budget surplus in FY 2001 turned into a  318 billion deficit in FY 2005      A  5 6 trillion 10 year projected surplus from 2002 to 2011 has turned into a projected deficit of at least  2 7 trillion      Congressional Budget Office  CBO  predicts a deficit of  337 billion for 2006   This is the third worst deficit in U S  history and  19 billion worse than last year this prediction does not add in likely policy changes such and AMT fix and an additional Iraq war supplemental       Increased Debt     Republican policies will require another debt limit increase   When this administration took office in 2001  it estimated that no debt limit increase would be required until 2008   In reality  the Republican Congress had enacted three debt ceiling increases   totaling  2 2 trillion   At the end of December 2005  Secretary Snow wrote to Congress to request a fourth increase of  781 billion and this will bring the total increases in the debt limit since 2002 to  3 0 trillion       The total debt is approximately  8 2 trillion and each individual   s share of the debt is approximately  27 500       Under a budget scenario that makes tax cuts permanent  AMT reform  and ongoing war costs  the debt would increase at a rate of more than  600 billion in every year over the ten year window  and increase by nearly  900 billion in 2016 and would reach a total of  16 1 trillion by 2016        As of October 2005  U S  taxpayers owed  682 billion to Japan and  245 billion to China      Record Trade Deficits     The U S  current account deficit  a broad measure of the trade balance  has soared from  389 5 billion in 2001 to  668 1 billion 2004      Tax Cuts for the Wealthiest     The average tax cuts in 2005 for those with  1 million or more of income was  103 086 while a middle class family with income between  40 000 and  50 000 received an average tax cut of  874        Nearly half of the benefits of tax cuts on capital gains and dividends will go to those earning over  1 million   In 2009  the average benefit from reducing taxes on capital gains and dividends for those with more than  1 million in income is  32 111   The average tax cut for families with  50 000 in income or less is  20        Total cost of making tax cuts permanent would exceed  2 trillion       99 percent of households with small business income do not benefit from a reduction in the top income rate and the repeal of the estate tax        A SNAPSHOT OF THE ECONOMY    Deficit  For FY 2005  the deficit was  319 billion  the third largest in history   CBO predicts a deficit of  337 billion for 2006 and  1 1 trillion deficit from 2007  2011       Debt  Current debt is approximately  8 2 trillion     Economic Growth   During the fourth quarter of 2005  GDP grew at a rate of 1 1 percent  This was the worst quarter in 3 years   The economy grew at a rate 3 5 percent for all of 2005       Job Growth  Private sector employment has grown at an average annual rate only 0 7 percent since November 2001  as compared with an average for previous comparable post World War II period of 2 6 percent   Even the most recent pace of job growth lags behind the typical pace   In the final quarter of 2005  an average of 135 000 private sector jobs was created per month   If the pace of job creation had been the same as the average pace of job creation of all other recoveries since World War II  some 234 000 jobs would have been created per month       Income Inequality  CBO data shows that between 1979 and 2003  the average after tax income of the top one percent of the population more than doubled  rising from  305 800 to  701 500 for an increase of 129 percent   By contrast  the average after tax income of the middle fifth of the population increased by 15 percent  reaching  44 800 in 2003     Savings Rate  The savings rate for 2005 was minus 0 5 percent  This is the first time since 1933 that savings rate has dipped into negative territory   The savings rate has been negative for a full year only twice before  in 1932 and 1933 during the Great Depression    The savings rate for 2004 was 1 8 percent
