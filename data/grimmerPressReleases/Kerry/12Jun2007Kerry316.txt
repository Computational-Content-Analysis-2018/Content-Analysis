John Kerry spoke to 65 college and university presidents about the urgent need to address climate change today  and thanked them for their promise to make their campuses carbon neutral  Kerry was one of the keynote speakers this morning at the American College and University Presidents Leadership Summit  Kerry said that Congress must take firm steps to address climate change during this weeks debate on a broad re write of energy legislation  This week  Kerry will introduce amendments to fund research on reducing emissions from coal burning power plants  and to mandate increased levels of renewable energy  Kerry has also introduced separate legislation to make the Capitol Complex  including the Capitol  House and Senate office buildings   carbon neutral by the year 2020  The college and university presidents are meeting in Washington DC this week after signing the American College  University Presidents Climate Commitment  Over 280 presidents made this promise by recently signing on to eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions and integrate sustainability into their curriculum  The group represents more than two million college students in 45 states  including the University of Massachusetts and over 30 colleges from the Bay State  Below are his remarks  as prepared  Its great to be here with you  I especially want to thank President Kathleen Schatzberg of Cape Cod Community College  President Jackie Jenkins Scott of Wheelock College  President Robert Gee of The National Graduate School  President John Sbrega of Bristol Community College  and President Timothy Flanagan of Framingham State College  Thanks for keeping Massachusetts at the forefront of making this a cleaner  greener country  You  as University Presidents across the country  are providing something that is sorely needed  If and when Washington finally makes a serious effort to tackle climate change  it will be initiatives like yours that offered the spark and proved that it could be done  But its not just universitiesentire sectors of the economy are transforming  Major hotel chains like Hilton  Marriott  and Wyndham are encouraging the building of eco friendly hotels  Today just four US hotels are certified green  but fifteen times that many green hotels are under construction  Earlier this year  the CEOs of ten major corporations including Alcoa  BP America  Dupont  and General Electricall urged Congress to cap greenhouse gas emissions  And Wal Mart is replacing all its bulbs with green bulbs that burn longer and emit a fraction of the greenhouse gases  But there is something special about universitiestheyre factories for leadership and symbols of our future aspiration  To some extent  they are cities on a hill  Now few would mistake Congress these days for a city on a hill  but were hoping to send the same message by turning the entire Capitol complex carbon by 2020  These kinds of measures make an important but incremental contribution to energy conservationbut they also represent an important statement that we are living our values and an opportunity to educate people about the challenges we face  As University leaders  one of your most important jobs is to educate citizens and foster the values of citizenship in your studentsand I applaud all of you for recognizing that the environment belongs at the heart of that effort  For years now  some in Washington have clung to any excuse or rationalization they could findno matter how thin to avoid confronting the imminent threat of climate change  We all know that until this country breaks its dependence on foreign oil  we will be undermining our efforts in the two greatest struggles we face  the fight against global terror and the race to stop global warming  And yet  when it comes time to pass the legislation that actually sets our countrys energy policy and research priorities on the right path  Washington has never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity  But this weeks energy bill is a chance for the new Democratic Congress to prove that we are serious about our campaign promise to deliver bold change to the American people  The energy bill the last Congress passed was a hollow exercise masquerading as a new direction while channeling the majority of the spoils to the same old special interests  It was one ugly chapter in a decades old story of procrastination  evasion  and  above allfailed leadership  If Democrats write an energy bill indistinguishable from those that we criticized Republicans for passing  then we will not have earned our majority  So what will this Democratic Congress do to break with the past  A serious energy bill must include three components  a major increase in efficiency  a dramatic new investment in renewable sources  and a comprehensive plan to develop and implement clean coal technologies  Efficiency  Raising fuel efficiency standards is the cornerstone of our strategy to reduce our reliance on imported oil  But since 1980  the share of oil that we import from overseas has jumped dramatically  while our average fuel efficiency remains mired at 25 miles per gallon    The current energy bill would increase fuel efficiency to 35 mpg by 2010  We should remain vigilant against special interest efforts to water down the requirements  Congress must support the fuel efficient vehicles of the futuremany of which are being designed right now  Today  A123 Systems in Massachusetts has developed the technology for a plug in hybrid car that gets 150 miles per gallon  Can you imagine if the average Americans daily commute  less than 30 miles roundtriprequired almost no fuel  But energy efficiency doesnt begin and end with automobiles  Building green can make an enormous difference  too  We should be raising energy efficiency standards across the board  Renewable Sources  As of now  the energy bill offers no mandate for renewable energy sources like wind and solar  Thats obviously unacceptable  24 states and the District of Columbia have implemented local requirements that a certain percentage of energy come from renewable sources  I have proposed that 20  of our energy come from renewable sources by the year 2020  and I hope that the bill will be amended to match that standard  In the absence of Congressional leadership  states have taken the initiativebut a federal standard is better public policy  and we cannot let Republicans continue to block it  Clean Coal  Finally  we must make a dramatic investment in developing technologies to bring clean coal off the drawing board and under construction  Coal is available  abundant  and cheapbut unfortunately its also a huge source of US greenhouse gas emissions  If we stand a chance at addressing climate change  we cannot afford to expand on the 1 5 billion tons per year of carbon dioxide currently being emitted by coal fired plants  While its not a magic bullet  clean coal technology could allow us to meet our energy needs without sabotaging our efforts to fight climate change  Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen from pre industrial levels of 280 parts per million to 380 todayhigher than at any time in the last 650 000 years  Scientists now tell us that atmospheric carbon dioxide must remain below 450 parts per millioncorresponding to an increase of 2 degrees Celsiusto avoid large scale catastrophe  If we fail to act  were expected to reach 600 700 parts per million by 2100  Carbon capture and sequestration technologies that remove greenhouse gases from burning coal are immensely promising  butlike many green technologiesthey have not been tested on a scale commensurate to the problem  I will be introducing an amendment that provides  1 billion for clean coal research  Those are the critical steps that Congressand especially Democratsought to have the courage to take  And if Congress fails to be bold  we ought to have the courage to vote the bill down  And its time for Democrats do something that my party has not always done as boldly as we should have  stand up to Big Oil  This Democratic Congress wasnt elected to be the party of Big Oil  only a little less obviously  With oil companies making  255 billion in profits since the start of 2005  we must roll back subsidies for big oil  I have a bill that does just that  saving taxpayers over  20 billion dollars  This is about priorities  Whether its through the ferocity of our fight or the weakness of our willpower  this will be the challenge that defines us  And the American people should accept nothing less from this Democratic Congress than a bold vision for a cleaner and greener America  I want to thank you for what youre doing to educate a generation of environmentally conscious citizens on green campuses  And I want you to know that I will work in Congress to make sure that our work there is worthy of your efforts                                                                              20510
