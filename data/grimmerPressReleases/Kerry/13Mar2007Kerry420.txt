and Edward Kennedy  along with 50 other senators  today sent a letter to the Senate Budget Committee urging it to provide  5 1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in the fiscal year 2008 budget         They also requested that the allocation provide advanced funding for fiscal year 2009  which would enable states to pre purchase fuel and begin planning for next winter          High energy prices continue to threaten the health and economic well being of low income households across the United States and we need to be prepared  LIHEAP is a commonsense solution  I will continue to fight in the Senate to ensure funds are available for this vital program   said Senator Kerry   No working family   in Massachusetts or anywhere   should have to choose between heating their home and buying food for their family  Yet  without adequate funding for LIHEAP this is precisely the decision we force on families in need  We can and we must do better            Congress should commit to fully funding this vital program which assists those in need of help to stay warm during the winter   It s unconscionable how the Bush Administration has repeatedly sought to cut this program which primarily serves those on fixed incomes  including the elderly and the disabled   Fully funding this program will allow more of these families to access essential heating assistance so they won t have to make impossible choices next winter between heating their homes or putting food on the table or purchasing necessary medications   said Senator Kennedy         The

and Ranking Member Gregg                    The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  provides a vital safety net for our nation s low income households  LIHEAP helps low income families and seniors remain healthy and secure from bitter cold winters in the North and hot summers in the South  We are writing to request that the budget provide  5 1 billion for LIHEAP in fiscal 2008  the full amount authorized  and that the allocation provide for advance appropriations for fiscal 2009                    Our request to fund LIHEAP at its full funding level is consistent with the  5 1 billion LIHEAP allocation included in the Senate passed fiscal 2007 budget resolution  S  Con  Res  83   Funding LIHEAP at this level in regular funding and advance appropriations can help working low income families  senior citizens  and disabled individuals maintain economic stability                    For many low income families  disabled individuals  and senior citizens living on fixed incomes  home energy costs are unaffordable   These families often carry a higher energy burden than most Americans   spending up to 17 percent of their income on home energy bills  Each year  this burden grows as natural gas  heating oil  propane  and electricity prices continue to increase                    In addition  the program helps low income homeowners weatherize their homes to save energy and lower their energy burden  Weatherization  on average  reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by  200 to  250 per year                    Energy is a basic need  and without LIHEAP assistance  low income families and senior citizens face the impossible choice between paying their home energy bills or affording other basic necessities such as prescription drugs  housing  and food  In 2005  the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  NEADA  surveyed over 2 000 LIHEAP recipients on the choices made by households when faced with high energy bills  The survey found that in the last five years                   44  skipped paying or paid less than their entire home energy bill in the past year   Households with children or households with income below 50  of the poverty level were more likely to do so                    47  went without medical or dental care due to unaffordable energy bills in the past five years                  32  did not fill their prescriptions or took less than their full dose of a prescribed medicine due to energy bills in the past five years                   16  became ill in the past five years because their home was too cold         We also request  5 1 billion in advance funding for LIHEAP in fiscal 2009  Advance funding enables states to pre purchase fuel and start planning for the winter heating season in spring and early summer as well as plan for a summer cooling program  Advance LIHEAP funding allows states to plan more efficiently and improve program management  and therefore  be more economical with limited federal resources  It also ensures that states provide timely assistance to low income families who cannot afford to wait                    Thank you for your consideration  We look forward to working with you to make sure that working families  seniors  and disabled individuals have the resources necessary to provide for their basic energy needs
