John Kerry  D Mass   today introduced legislation that would direct the Army Corps of Engineers to factor climate change into all future water projects and no longer build bridges  levees  damns or other projects with no regard for the environment        Kerry s legislation is co sponsored by Senators Russ Feingold  D Wisc    Susan Collins  R ME   Bernard Sanders  I Vt    Tom Carper  D Del    Joseph Biden  D Del    Jack Reed  D R I    Sheldon Whitehouse  D R I    and Maria Cantwell  D Wash           A link to the Kerry legislation is here  http   kerry senate gov v3 press pdf 5_10_07_WRDA_climate_change pdf         Today we have an historic opportunity to make it clear that global warming is real and must be factored into every realm of our public policy   Kerry said    Whether it s reducing greenhouse gas emissions in cars  reducing pollution  or ensuring our water projects go forward in a responsible way  climate change must be addressed  This amendment is a chance for Senators to put themselves on record that we ll do everything we can to pursue good policies that combat global warming         Kerry s legislation directs the Army Corps of Engineers to use the best available climate science  account for potential future impacts of climate change on storms and floods  and account for the costs and benefits associated with the loss and protection of wetlands  floodplains  and other natural systems that can buffer the effects of climate change         For far too long  the issue of global climate change has been pushed aside as unsolvable  incomprehensible  or simply someone else s problem   Kerry added    But the stakes could not be higher  The reality could hardly be more stark  Consideration of this amendment is right at the heart of long overdue and very welcome change         The current guidelines for Corps project planning were written in 1983   long before scientists were focusing on the existence  threat and impacts of climate change   In the wake of Hurricane Katrina  It is critical that the Corps begin to account for climate change and protect natural systems that can buffer the impact that we expect climate change will have
