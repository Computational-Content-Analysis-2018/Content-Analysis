of the Voting Rights Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Below is a statement by Senator John Kerry on the upcoming 40th anniversary of the landmark Voting Rights Act  which is August 6  2005   He is an original co sponsor of the Count Every Vote Act of 2005  the key election reform legislation currently pending in Congress   Senator Kerry is also a co sponsor of Senate Resolution 232  which celebrates the 40th anniversary of the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and reaffirms the commitment of the Senate to protecting the voting rights of all American citizens       This month we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act   It   s a time to honor the law that helped make the United States the world   s greatest shining example of democracy   It should also be a time to acknowledge that we   ve got work to do to ensure that every American   s right to vote is a reality            No one in the United States should walk out of a voting booth on Election Day and fear their vote might not be counted   No eligible voter should approach their polling place and fear that they will be intimidated or denied their right to vote   And no American should lose their chance to vote because the lines were too long due to a shortage of machines            Real election reform means passing the Count Every Vote Act of 2005  which seeks to end absurdly long lines  the erroneous purging of voters  voter suppression and intimidation  and unequal access to the voting process   The Count Every Vote Act would also incorporate a voter verified paper trail for use by all voters  including those for whom English is a second language  illiterate voters and voters with disabilities     and mandates national standards in a variety of areas  including voter registration and counting provisional ballots            Real electoral reform also means fully funding the Help America Vote Act  funding the activities of the Election Assistance Commission  and helping states invest in better voting machines with paper trails   That means putting partisan politics aside and joining together as proud citizens to eliminate barriers to voting  encourage the greatest level of civic participation possible  and restore the confidence of the American people          One of the most significant ways we must continue the fight for civil rights and voting rights is with the nomination of our next Supreme Court Justice   We all know the crucial role the Supreme Court plays in protecting and preserving voting rights and civil rights   So far  what we   ve learned about Judge Roberts    record on these areas is troubling  and I intend to keep pressing for all the relevant information on his record so the Senate can make an informed decision on this lifetime appointment            I hope Washington can come together to make election reform a reality  because there is no greater right than the right to vote   This precious right was hard fought by brave American citizens who risked their lives to register voters  who marched  who stared down Bull Connor   s police dogs  who faced the threat of lynching  and some who even lost their lives fighting to open up the polls and make the right to vote real for every American            Our troops have helped people in Iraq and Afghanistan vote   It   s our responsibility to do everything we can to strengthen democracy for all Americans here at home            Summary of The Count Every Vote Act of 2005   On February 17th Senators John Kerry  Hillary Clinton  Barbara Boxer and Frank Lautenberg introduced S 450 the    Count Every Vote Act of 2005    to fully fund the Help America Vote Act  fund the activities of the Election Assistance Commission  and help states invest in better voting machines with paper trails       The Count Every Vote Act of 2005 seeks to address concerns about the security of voting machines and the inability of the majority of voters who may use these machines to be able to adequately verify their vote and ensure that the vote they intended was both cast and counted   The act also addresses many other problems in our federal election system     including long wait times in which to vote  the erroneous purging of voters  voter suppression and intimidation  and unequal access to the voting process     remain   The bill establishes  among other initiatives  a voter verified paper trail for use by all individuals  including language minority voters  illiterate voters and voters with disabilities  and mandates national standards in a variety of areas  including the registration of voters and the counting of provisional ballots        All provisions of this legislation are to be in effect no later than the November 2006 federal election  The Count Every Vote Act requires that all provisions be in place for the next major election cycle in 2006       Representatives from civil rights organizations and voting rights advocates have praised the legislation  including People For the American Way  Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law  NAACP  Common Cause  the National Voting Rights Institute  DEMOS and the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
