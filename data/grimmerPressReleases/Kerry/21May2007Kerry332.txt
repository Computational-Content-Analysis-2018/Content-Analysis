Troops  Not Short Change Soldiers on Memorial Day

Kerry today asked President Bush to back off his plan to cut a proposed military pay raise  Kerry also asked Bush not to cut a proposed benefit for surviving spouses  which Congress and veterans groups say would help grieving families with a  40 month benefit to help cover expenses when a loved one is killed in action   Last week  the White House opposed both of those provisions in the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Bill        It s unacceptable that this White House continues to choose more tax breaks for the richest Americans and less pay and fewer benefits for our military families   Senator Kerry said   Our Democratic Congress has put forth a plan to give our troops a raise at a time of war  and no White House opposition will stand in the way of our commitment to our military  Our troops make incredible sacrifices for our country and we owe them a pay raise and benefits that make it clear we honor their sacrifice  We will fight for this pay raise for our troops until it becomes a reality        The Office of Management and Budget said that the House bill s moves to increase military pay by  5 percent  from 3 0 to 3 5 percent  and give a  40 monthly benefit for surviving spouses and military families were unnecessary  On the same day  the White House expressed opposition to the FY 2008 Budget Resolution Conference Report because it failed to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans       Last year s pay increase for members of the uniformed services was just 2 2 percent  the lowest since 1993  Congress has made a commitment to keep pay raises for the military ahead of private sector pay raises        Kerry is the author of the Military Family Bill of Rights  which has become law   Kerry s Bill increased the death benefit for surviving spouses and families of troops who die in action to  250 000 and extended the amount of time they can remain in military housing to one full year  along with increasing TRICARE benefits and promoting better care for those suffering from PTSD and other mental illness       Below is text of the letter Kerry sent Friday    May 18  2007      The President  The White House  Washington  D C  20007      Dear Mr  President       We are all proud of our men and women in the American military who continue to perform magnificently in Iraq  Afghanistan and around the world  They represent the best that this country has to offer  and America owes them and their families a special debt of honor and gratitude   In light of their sacrifice  I ask you to change your position and support a 3 5 percent increase in military pay and an increase in the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance to help American military families         On May 16  the Office of Management and Budget s Statement of Administration Policy for the House FY 2008 National Defense Authorization bill opposes Section 644 of the bill  which would pay a monthly Special survivor indemnity allowance of  40 from the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund  calling the existing benefits  sufficient    The Statement of Administration Policy also  strongly opposes  Sections 601 and 606 of the House bill  which provide a 0 5 percent increase in military pay above the President s proposed 3 0 percent across the board pay increase  calling it  unnecessary        I am extremely disappointed in these decisions   This position fails to honor our military families who have made the ultimate sacrifice   It also stands in direct contrast to the will of the American people who support all efforts to support our troops       Most disappointing  on the same day your position on a military pay increase was announced  the Office of Management and Budget Director Rob Portman expressed opposition to the FY 2008 Budget Resolution Conference Report because it failed to extend tax cuts to provide billions for the wealthiest in our country           Those who have stood for us should know that we stand with them  today and always  These provisions can do something to ease their burden  but truly supporting our troops requires that we act not just as individuals  but as a nation        Thank you for your consideration of this request       Sincerely        John F  Kerry                                                                                      20510
