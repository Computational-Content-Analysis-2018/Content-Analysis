Climate Change

John Kerry at the Brookings Institution conference on Climate Change Policy in Washington  D C   today       Remarks by Senator John Kerry  AS PREPARED  Climate Change Policy  What s Next                                                                                                                                                                                        I m very grateful to the Brookings Institution for putting this panel together  I know that under Strobe Talbott s leadership Brookings is increasing its investment in environment and energy work and nothing could be more important right now        You have had a terrific discussion group this morning with individuals I have had the privilege of working with  all of whom have enormous expertise  They know this issue inside out and backward       The challenge of global climate change is urgent and it continues to receive far too little serious focus on Capitol Hill  notwithstanding its importance to our security and the potential impacts both positive and negative to our economy   As you know  I tried to make the environment one of the central issues of my campaign  but with only one environment question in three presidential debates  we ve obviously got a lot of work to do       So here we are   Thirteen years after the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 and the world s first effort at crafting a global response to the threat of climate change         It was at those talks that the American delegation  led by EPA Administrator Bill Reilly and under the tight control of the White House  ultimately embraced the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change         As we know  in that agreement  more than 100 nations accepted the scientific evidence that pollution is altering the composition of the atmosphere and set a voluntary goal to  prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system        In other words  thirteen years ago we recognized climate change as a global problem in need of a global solution   We defined a global goal   And we set a path for future negotiations   It was a small step  but it was a first step  and it was progress       It was then only a few years later that President Clinton started to build on the foundation laid at the Earth Summit    In Japan  Argentina and the Netherlands  I watched and worked with American delegates as they hammered out the framework of the Kyoto Protocol         Thanks to the leadership of President Clinton and Vice President Gore  the Protocol sets the first ever binding targets to reduce pollution and incorporates a distinctly American approach to a global challenge by creating a market for pollution credits that can drive efficiency  savings and innovation         Let me emphasize  We knew at the time  the Kyoto Protocol was a work in progress after its initial negotiation    I counseled the President against submitting it to the Congress without more progress on developing nations   We knew there was work to do         When President Bush took office in 2001 he had any number of options before him to move the ball forward   He might have used the bully pulpit to push for greater participation from the largest emitters in the developing world   He might have focused on targets beyond 2012   He might have pushed for a more robust trading program or greater technology transfer       But President Bush took a decidedly different tack   He flatly rejected the active and mandatory approach of the Clinton Administration  and in many ways  he even rejected the incremental and voluntary approach of his father s administration         Instead  in the months after taking office  the President questioned the underlying science  broke a campaign promise to cap carbon emissions from power plants  rebuked his EPA chief for positive comments about Kyoto  proposed an energy plan that would only increase pollution  and withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol and the international process altogether       In sum  our nation has been forced into a great step backward in our work to protect the global environment       This is not a political assessment   These are the facts   The Bush Administration made clear to all who cared to listen that America would not lead nor would it follow the global effort to avert harmful climate change         It is a matter of policy  and the Administration remains disengaged to this day  despite the fact that the United States is the world s largest emitter of greenhouse gases       As you discussed this morning and after seven years in critical condition the Kyoto Protocol in one week will enter into force without the United States        And while the pact was left to whither  while many of its flaws remain unfixed and while its future is uncertain  its true importance may rest in what it says about America s changing relationship with the world and the future of climate change diplomacy       Kyoto shows that our allies are prepared to set the global agenda without the United States  That is neither good climate policy nor good for the United States   Sadly  around the world  people are questioning our moral authority   People are questioning our commitment to universal values  such as environmental protection and sustainable development        And our absence proves that while America dithers  others will act  And this is not without a price       Just last month  Prime Minister Tony Blair cautioned us that   If America wants the rest of the world to be part of the agenda it has set  it must be part of their agenda  too         It s against this backdrop of retrenchment and isolation that the Bush Administration must decide its next move  It will come as no surprise to you that I have no privileged insight into the President s plans         The President s dismissal of the science  his aversion to innovation and his skepticism of international cooperation present us with an even greater challenge         Despite the scientific evidence that the threat is real  dangerous and irreversible  the political evidence is that ideology will trump reason in the White House  and there will be no affirmative  real  Next Step  for America until we have a change of heart and mind  or a change in leadership at the top       So it is up to those of us who believe the threat is real to argue the case for action against the President s do nothing policy       There are clear principles that should drive and shape our actions as we do that  They are         The science is compelling and demands action         The challenge will become more difficult the longer we wait         The problem and the solution are global         Markets will drive down costs and drive up innovation         Sound domestic policies will contribute to the strength of our economy  our security and the environment         And at least for now  Washington is far behind the American people when it comes to understanding and meeting this challenge       If we accept these principles  there is only one course of action  We must engage in the international effort       The diplomatic issue is no longer Kyoto  yes or no  The world understands that we need to move beyond Kyoto   Kyoto is limited in time and participation  and it may well be limited in its success   But we should see it as a foundation for global cooperation with principles of binding targets and emissions trading that can serve as a blueprint       Others nations are ready to start a dialogue about the future  Prime Minister Blair is capitalizing on his chairmanship of the G8 to press for broad  cooperative action   But the United States has stood alone and silent   That must stop       We cannot wait for Kyoto to expire to consider next steps   We need to evaluate options now  We need to signal to the world that we are prepared to shoulder our fair share  And we need to put action behind our words  accepting the principle of binding pollution limits and engaging the developing world        A number of proposals have been put on the international table  from a G8 program to promote renewable energy to technology funding to development aid to the Framework Convention   We don t suffer from a lack of ideas at the international level       What we need now is leadership that engages the developing world   No climate plan can work without these nations and no climate plan can pass Congress without their participation   Their emissions may be a fraction of the developed world now  but without action they will skyrocket and soon exceed the largest nations of the developed world   That is unacceptable       All of us are aware of America s tremendous leverage in the world economy   And with financial assistance and technology transfer whether it is direct aid  export credit agencies or multilateral development banks we can spur the growth of clean energy technologies   With a future agreement that rewards developed nations for sound investments in the developing world  we can show these nations that clean energy investments will stimulate and not stifle economic growth       I believe developing countries can become partners in addressing climate change provided we engage and make it a matter of public health  economic growth  international security and not just a matter of the environment         And frankly  the same is true in developed countries  as well  including right here in America   We need policies that address both climate and our core economic and security priorities         One place to start is with an economy wide cap and trade system that sets a national limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allows companies the flexibility to trade pollution credits to capture the least cost reductions       This is the approach we developed when dealing with acid rain years ago and has been embraced in a bill that I have supported with Senators McCain and Lieberman        We know that trading drastically cut the cost of reducing acid rain emissions and now  inspired by Kyoto  the European Union is on the verge of launching the broadest ever pollution trading system  And I know from negotiations in Rio  The Hague  Buenos Aires and Kyoto that this is imminently marketable on a global basis       And as we approach our national energy policy  certainly supply  price and our economic security must be priorities  but  frankly  so must the environment be a priority  on its own merits  That is why supporting national markets for domestic  reliable  efficient and clean energy technologies are so important       That is why we must specifically target investments in our industrial base   During the past year  I put forward two proposals to do that   The first invested in the future of clean coal in America s energy supply   It dedicated resources to basic research  commercial viability  and technological deployment into the marketplace         The second proposal invested in the transformation of American automobile manufacturing   We need to re tool our auto plants to build the more efficient  advanced technology automobiles of the future        I want the cars of the future built here in America  and we should create incentives to move in the right direction  I will push for both of these proposals in the upcoming debate on energy policy in the Senate       But as anyone who follows this debate knows  there is fierce resistance to even incremental initiatives in the White House and on Capitol Hill   To wait for Washington to act by itself will be to wait in vain       Instead  we have no choice but to encourage and embrace local  state and private action   As I traveled the nation over the past two years  I learned firsthand that Washington is far behind the American people when it comes to understanding and meeting this challenge       It is not just that Americans have come to understand the threat of climate change through press reports  It is more powerful than that  It is that people are starting to experience changes in their hometowns       In Arizona and Nevada  I met with officials trying to find solutions to the dwindling water supply after the West suffered through its fifth straight year of drought        In Ohio  I spoke with hunters who have watched as the birds are changing their migratory patterns with warming temperatures  And I heard countless other stories       It is not just that Americans want answers from Washington it is that they are starting to see the answers in their own states and communities         In Missouri  I spent time on a family farm tapping into the growing market for biofuels       And in New Mexico  I learned about the state s push for wind energy and its benefits to the economy and the environment       So while our capital city is gripped by special interests thoroughly invested in the status quo  our states have become the frontline of policy incubation and innovation       State leaders see economic opportunities in producing and selling alternative fuels  exporting renewable energy  attracting high tech businesses or even selling carbon reduction credits  We should be helping       Governor Schwarzenegger a Republican has endorsed a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles sold in the California by 2015         In the Northeast  nine governors  led by New York Governor George Pataki  are developing a multi state regional cap and trade initiative aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants         Eighteen states have created markets for renewable electric energy       States are paving the way  and for many the environmental potential is significant   But all of this is still a patchwork of regional efforts none of which will get the job done by itself  That is why we need national leadership to move us  as a whole  in the right direction       We are at a moment in this debate that reminds me of my home state s efforts to reduce acid rain some twenty years ago   As Lieutenant Governor I found nothing but resistance in Washington   The White House criticized the science  the technology and the cost and then threatened peoples  jobs         With all the doors closed in Washington  we forged ahead with a state based initiative for a regional plan to cut emissions through a tradable credit program   In the end  it provided political momentum and informed the creation of the federal sulfur trading program in the 1990 Clean Air amendments     And it is not only governments that are acting  Many companies are adopting voluntary pollution targets   Dupont a  27 billion corporation operating in more than 70 countries worldwide set a target to sharply cut its emissions by 2010  and exceeded its goal by 2002 eight years early  All in all  there are some 40 American companies that have voluntarily established targets to reduce their pollution   Executives want to be on the cutting edge of clean and efficient technologies   They manage global operations  including in nations that are party to the Kyoto Protocol   And while they may now be reluctant to support better policies in the United States  these companies understand the science  they see that regulation is inevitable  and in many cases they view the drive for climate solutions as a business opportunity          The lesson here is clear   The American people see the irrationality of our national energy policy  They understand we cannot pollute the environment without consequence    They understand our dependence on unreliable foreign fuels is dangerous   They believe in our capacity to confront a challenge through cooperation and innovation   They believe in a better future forged by American leadership  And we need that leadership       So for those of us who ask  What is Next for Climate Policy    the answer cannot be to just wait on Washington         We can do our best to inform the elected here in Washington  but they may refuse to change course   If so  we must inform the electorate and call on them to change the elected         We have to educate and organize   We need your expertise Brookings and others to defend the science and advocate for action   We have to build the political will so that it is as strong as the special interests just as we did when we created the Clean Air Act  Clean Water Act  the Environmental Protection Agency and environmental progress of the past 30 years   And we must build on the momentum of state and private leadership         If we can do that  we can answer our own question   What s Next    We can answer it with real action to protect the global environment       I look forward to working with many of you in the coming years  pressing our case inside and outside Washington                                                                           20510
