introduce an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill that will redeploy U S  combat troops out of Iraq by the end of 2006         John Kerry is calling for the withdrawal of United States forces under a schedule agreed upon with the new government of Iraq   This will legitimize the new Iraqi government  enable the Iraqis to become more self reliant  and undermine support for the insurgency        In fact  Senior American commanders have said the large U S  military presence in Iraq feeds the insurgency   General George Casey  the top American military commander in Iraq  testified to Congress that our large military presence    feeds the notion of occupation    and    extends the amount of time that it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self reliant            The goal of John Kerry   s plan is to undermine the insurgency by simultaneously pursing a political settlement and the military draw down of American forces   Kerry   s plan calls for        The redeployment of U S  combat troops out of Iraq by the end of 2006            Only U S  troops essential to completing the mission of standing up Iraqi security forces would remain           President Bush has repeatedly said that when Iraqis stand up  we will stand down   However  that has not been happening   So far  the Iraqis have trained 265 600 security forces   The Bush administration   s stated goal is 272 566 Iraqi security forces   Yet just two weeks ago  the Pentagon announced that they are sending 3 500 additional U S  troops from Kuwait to Iraq            The United States to maintain an over the horizon military presence to prosecute the war on terror and protect regional security interests           The President to convene a summit that includes the leaders of the new Iraqi government  leaders of the governments of each country bordering Iraq  representatives of the Arab League  the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  representatives of the European Union  and leaders of the governments of each permanent member of the United Nations Security Council  to reach a comprehensive political agreement for Iraq that addresses fundamental issues including federalism  oil revenues  the militias  security guarantees  reconstruction  economic assistance and border security            History         John Kerry first called for the redeployment of U S  forces out of Iraq by the end of this year on October 26  2005   In a major address at Georgetown University  Kerry said the next six months were critical to the future of Iraq   At that time  he introduced his Strategy for Success in Iraq Act     a comprehensive new strategy to complete the mission in Iraq and redeploy the vast majority of American combat troops  beginning with the draw down of 20 000 U S  troops after successful Iraqi elections in December          Following up on his plan in April 2006  John Kerry laid out two important deadlines for Iraq     if Iraqi leaders couldn   t form a unity government by May 15  American troops would leave immediately rather than be stuck in the crossfire of an escalating civil war  if they did form a government  we would empower the new Iraqi leaders by agreeing on a schedule to withdraw American combat forces by the end of 2006         On April 5  2006  Kerry wrote in the New York Times      Half of the service members listed on the Vietnam Memorial Wall died after America s leaders knew our strategy would not work  It was immoral then and it would be immoral now to engage in the same delusion  We want democracy in Iraq  but Iraqis must want it as much as we do      So far  Iraqi leaders have responded only to deadlines     a deadline to transfer authority to a provisional government  and a deadline to hold three elections   Now we must set another deadline to extricate our troops and get Iraq up on its own two feet      For three years now  the administration has told us that terrible things will happen if we get tough with the Iraqis  In fact  terrible things are happening now because we haven t gotten tough enough
