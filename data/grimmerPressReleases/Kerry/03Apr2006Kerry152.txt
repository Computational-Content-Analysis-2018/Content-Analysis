John Kerry  D Mass   sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and John Tanner  Chief of the Voting Section at the Department of Justice  urging them to immediately reconsider approval of a voting plan that will disenfranchise tens of thousands of voters in the upcoming Louisiana elections       Kerry opposes the Department of Justice   s decision to allow the April 22 election in Louisiana to take place without first addressing the fact that tens of thousands of residents     disproportionately African Americans     will be unable to cast their votes        Kerry is urging the Justice Department to set up satellite voting stations in cities outside Louisiana where large numbers of Katrina evacuees are living  similar to the satellite voting opportunities made available to Iraqi voters living in the United States during the recent Iraq elections   Kerry is also calling for the voting system to be strengthened in communities affected by Katrina before the elections take place      Below is a copy of the letter       April 3  2006     Attorney General Alberto Gonzales    United States Department of Justice    950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  D C  20530     John K  Tanner  Esq     Chief  Voting Section    Civil Rights Division    United States Department of Justice    950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  D C  20530      Dear Attorney General Gonzales and Mr  Tanner     I am writing to express my disappointment in your decision to pre clear the state of Louisiana   s election plan for the April 22 election in New Orleans and to urge your reconsideration   In light of the tremendous number of displaced citizens who would be disenfranchised in next month   s election  as well as problems that face voters who remain in the city  the Department of Justice should not have given its approval       The people affected by Hurricane Katrina are disproportionately African American   Orleans Parish lost up to 48  of its voting population and 75  of those displaced voters are African Americans   The Voting Rights Act was passed to protect all voters and ensure that minority voting strength is not diluted at the polls   Intentional or not  allowing next month   s election to take place will exclude an inexcusably large number of New Orleans   s African American voters     Hundreds of thousands of displaced New Orleans citizens are spread out across the country  with significant numbers in dozens of cities from Los Angeles to Chicago  According to the Louisiana Secretary of State  two thirds of those people who were displaced currently reside outside the state of Louisiana   Although the state government has chosen to create satellite voting locations within the state for displaced voters  it has refused to create similar satellite voting locations outside the state in cities where thousands of New Orleans voters find themselves stranded       Without satellite voting locations outside the state of Louisiana  tens of thousands of residents will be denied the right to vote   As a practical matter  the city   s current infrastructure could not handle the return of these voters   even if they were able to make the long and costly journey back in order to cast their vote   The only way that these citizens will be guaranteed the right to vote is to provide for satellite voting outside of Louisiana   Cities hosting Katrina evacuees have the facilities  they have the election workers  and they have the voting machines   The magnitude of this national disaster has not diminished as time as passed  protecting evacuees    right to vote now is just as critical as providing food and shelter was in the immediate aftermath   During the recent elections in Iraq  the American government provided satellite voting for Iraqi citizens who had not lived in their country for years   It was the right thing to do then  and we ought to extend the same service to our own citizens now      Even voters who remain in Orleans Parish are likely to face great difficulty in casting a ballot   Many of the voting sites used for years were destroyed by flooding  and a number of the new polling places submitted by the state for pre clearance are unsuitable   Furthermore  little information has been provided to city residents about changes that have been  or will be  made in election procedures     The strength of our democracy rests on the integrity of our elections   If we are to have faith in the representative nature of our government  we need to take every reasonable precaution to ensure that every one of our eligible citizens has the opportunity to cast a ballot     I do not understand how the Department of Justice could approve a plan that threatens the civil rights of hundreds of thousands of citizens rather than postponing the upcoming elections until a suitable plan could be developed   I urge you to reconsider your decision      Sincerely      John F  Kerry    United States Senator                                                                                  20510
