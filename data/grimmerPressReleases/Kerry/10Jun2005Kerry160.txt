the federal government provide the necessary assistance   I hope the Commerce Department will treat this issue with the attention it deserves        Congressman Stephen F  Lynch said   Fishermen

Attached is the letter sent to Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez         June 9  2005      The Honorable Carlos M  Gutierrez  Secretary  U S  Department of Commerce  14th   Constitution Ave  NW  Washington  DC 20230      Dear Mr  Secretary       We are writing on behalf of the thousands of Massachusetts fishermen and their families in Essex  Plymouth  Barnstable  Bristol  Dukes and Nantucket counties who have been affected by the closure of shellfish beds due to red tide   As you know  Massachusetts waters are being plagues by the worst outbreak of red tide since 1972  which has resulted in the closure of most shellfish areas in the state   And while the length of the closure is unknown  it is expected some areas will remain closed for up to another month       The situation is so extreme that we are writing to urge you to declare a commercial fishery failure  as provided for under Section 312  a  of the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act  to provide financial relief for the individuals  businesses and communities affected by the fishery resource disaster       The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries estimates the closures are currently affecting about 1 700 full  and part time commercial fishermen   Shellfish aquaculture occurs in 11 affected towns involving 241 growers at 289 sites   In addition  the quahog  dredge fishery  which involves 8 boats  16 people   and the surf clam fishery  which has 11 boats  22 people   are also affected  Altogether  the total landed value for all commercial shellfishing and shellfish aquaculture in the currently closed areas is  600 000 per week  This represents a potential loss of  2 700 000 weekly to the local economy resulting from the red tide  Such economic losses would be catastrophic for fishing families and for fishing dependent communities  The situation for others  including processors  port communities and related on shore businesses will be disastrous        We urge you to instruct NOAA Fisheries to expedite preparation of a disaster analysis and your immediate disaster declaration  Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter       Sincerely       John F  Kerry      Ted Kennedy  Stephen Lynch   John F  Tierney  William Delahunt     Barney Frank  Jim McGovern                                                                            20510
