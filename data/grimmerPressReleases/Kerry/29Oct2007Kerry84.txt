Climate Change Approach

Talks in Bali  Kerry Pushes U S  to Lead  Engage Developing Nations in Solution    New York  N Y   Senator John Kerry will speak to the Council on Foreign Relations today  His address  After Kyoto  Eyes on Bali  Global Climate Change and American Leadership  will focus on the security challenge of global climate change and the way forward as the United States approaches the next round of global climate change talks in Bali in December  Sen  Kerry and Sen  Boxer are leading the Senate delegation to this next round of international discussions  The speech begins at 12 30 at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City  The text of Kerrys speech is below  Id like to focus my introductory remarks on an issue which frankly not enough people are talking about in the context of our foreign policy  but which could have a greater long term impact on our security than any other  and that is global climate change  There will be critical meetings this year about our security     Secretary Rices Mideast Summit in Annapolis  perhaps some meetings between US and Iranian officials  But potentially just as important is the meeting which will happen just over a month from now  when delegates from 154  nations arrive in Bali to start work on a new international climate change treaty  and Ill be leading a bipartisan delegation from the US Senate  The road to our present predicament is littered with missed opportunities  but we still face the same  ever more acute  choice  either America finally leads the world in crafting a comprehensive new international agreement  or the countries of the world will pollute our way into a catastrophe of unknowable parameters but undeniable peril  Weve all heard the warnings  Drought  Famine  Floods  Refugees  Devastated crops  Lost GDP  Instability  Border tensionsand more of the failed states that shelter and breed terrorists  The plagues seem to stop just short of the Old Testament slaying of the firstborn in Egypt  But we cant wait for divine interventionwe have to act  Hows this for a call to action  Heres a recent headline from Time magazine  How to prevent the next Darfur  Step One  Get serious about climate change  Im pleased but not surprised to hear that the Council is once again ahead of the curve  and I look forward to hearing from the Independent Task Force chaired by Tom Vilsack and George Pataki  I dont intend to use this forum to dwell on or re litigate the science  but let me say briefly  since the start of the industrial age  atmospheric CO2 levels are up 35   to 380 parts per million  Scientists say that anything above 450 which means a total warming of 2 degrees centigradepasses a tipping point into catastrophic climate change  And guess what  Unless we slam the brakesnowwell hit 600 700 ppm by 2100  Mobilizing to solve climate change is especially tough because of the delayed onset of its impactemissions stay in the atmosphere for 100 years  so the window for preventing climate change may close before we even begin to feel its full force  But the first signs are there  Recently we learned that Arctic sea ice is down 39  from its long term averageand maybe as much as 50  since the 1950s  Two weeks ago  Nature warned that oceanswhich historically absorb about a quarter of our CO2are losing their capacity to serve as a sink for our emissions  As a result  the increased CO2 in the atmosphere has outpaced even our own dire predictions by 35  over the last 7 years  Thats the evidence  clear  growing  and urgent  I dont have to emphasize just how much weve been set back by 8 years outside the international system  It is crucial that our delegation to Bali send a clear message to the world that America is finally serious about fixing climate change  Were ready to end the era of obstruction and start leading by example  We  as a nation  are indispensable to this process  Our inaction is a green light to all the worlds polluters  But its humbling to remember that even when we had leadership that recognized the problem  a White House that signed a treaty  we still couldnt put a system in place that reduced CO2 emissions  Kyoto failed  And it failed because we werent able to bridge the gap between developed and developing nations  Our primary goal in Bali must be to arrive at a mandate for future negotiations to finally reach a truly global agreement on a truly global effort   not one that leaves the worlds largest emitter of the past and the largest emitters of the future outside the system  Thats why we failed last time  Ten years ago  the issue simply wasnt ripe for solutionit wasnt possible to craft a treaty that China would sign and the US Senate would ratify  I cant emphasize enough how muchand how quicklythings have changed in both countries  Youve witnessed the sea change here over the past few years  What is less well known is that today  a country like China finally grasps that they have an immediate and vital interest in getting this right  China has 16 of the world s 20 most polluted cities  Chinese villagers in Yunnan have watched their sacred Mingyong Glacier disappear before their very eyes  China put forth a climate change plan this year  Theyve already begun setting ambitious goals  such as a 20  cut in energy intensity by 2010  Next year  Chinas fleet wide fuel efficiency will be 36 7 mpghigher than the Senates proposed target for 2020  Theres a cartoon out there that China wont listenbut the reality is that a diplomatic breakthrough may be within reach  Thats the best thing that could come out of Balian agreement on a serious mandate for moving forward  Ultimately  it boils down to this  the only fair  realistic solution is shared but differentiated responsibility  The US and other industrialized nations must accept mandatory caps and acknowledge that poorer nations wont forego economic growth or bear the cost of others past emissions  China and other developing countries will have to take on their own binding commitmentsnot the same form as ours but perhaps a commitment per unit of GDP growth instead of population or a single industry cap  Down the road  China  India  Brazil  Mexico and other developing nations will have to lower absolute emissions  But today we must share the challenge of putting China on a path to doing so without infringing on its right to economic development  The consequences of Chinas failure will be ours too  That is why  in Bali and beyond  we must also commit ourselves to a massive new campaign aimed at fostering green development  And at the heart of that effort must be coal  We have to spread carbon capture and sequestration techniqueswhich can capture up to 100  of coals emissionsto China and the rest of the developing world  We must be realistic about the fact that a developing county like Chinarich in coal  growing at 11   and in need of a cheap source of energywont adopt clean coal technology unless we help them  And their decisions may be irreversible  Today the Chinese are building one coal fired power plant per weekmost are not even designed so that they might be retrofitted later with clean technology  Thats the real cost of inaction in real time  Coal accounts for 80  of Chinas CO2 emissions  and the EPA tells us that Chinese pollution accounts for  of the smog over Los Angeles  That too is a cost of inaction  We should create an internationally funded research consortium devoted to developing green technologies and spreading them to developing countrieswe need to do everything we cannot just to develop green technologies  but to see them actually adopted by billions of people  We should be reducing tariffs on green producers overseas  rewarding countries that meet emissions standards  and helping US companies to sell green products overseas  We should be financing low carbon energy sources and vehicles through institutions like the World Bank  and building capacity for energy and environmental data collection  Finally  we must address deforestationwhich accounts for 20  of emissions  Because they pull CO2 out of the air  forests are the planets natural defense  This needs to be a major part of our next agreement  and in the meantime we need to make sure these countries have tools to measure the problem and capacity to start addressing it  We must begin thinking of climate change as a major issue in our foreign policy and national security  We should recognize that the solutions to many of our greatest challenges   energy security  terrorism  democracy promotion  and climate changeall intersect when it comes to our use of energy  Over the next 25 years  oil consumption in developing Asian nations will double to 32 million barrels per dayaccounting for 80  of increased global demand for oil  much of it housed in unstable  authoritarian regimes  All of our most pressing geopolitical concerns point us in the same direction  a massive investment in alternative energy and green technology  This is a test of America as a world leader in the 21st century  We need a new environmental diplomacya commitment to make the fight against global warming an integral part of our foreign relations and our national security strategy  Just ask the 11 high ranking retired soldiers from every branch of the military who called it a serious national security threata threat multiplier that sparks and exacerbates conf   In the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis  the worlds two superpowers walked back from the brink of mutual assured destruction  Kennedy and Khrushchev set up a hotline between Washington and Moscow because they understood that  at the end of the day  the buck stopped with them  Thats where America  China  and the developing world stand today weve taken brinksmanship as far as it goes  Now its time to reach for the phone and give diplomacy a try  Our security depends more than ever before on our ability to influence others we must get back into the business of good old fashioned persuasion  Ultimately  the threat of climate change demands a new approach from America that looks an awful lot like the America we remember  the place Lincoln called the last best hope of earth  We should recommit to the hard but vital work of diplomacy and reengage with the rest of the planet  We must return to an understanding of the world where real strength means not just the absence of restraints but also the moral leadership that comes from leading by example
