                                                                                                                                                                      Below are the remarks of Senator John Kerry at the annual Worcester Telegram   Gazette Visions Ceremony in Worcester  Mass   today   The remarks that follow are as prepared                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Remarks by Senator John Kerry     Strengthening America   s Military     AS PREPARED      Last month  I traveled to Iraq where I visited some of the most remarkable young men and women our country has ever produced   I met hundreds of American soldiers and Marines  including many from Massachusetts  and I am proud to report that they are doing a magnificent job in very difficult conditions       I wish I could report as proudly about what is happening in Washington to make sure these brave Americans have the support they need to succeed in their dangerous mission  and to return to a hero s welcome rather than families and businesses in crisis         Regrettably  the polarized and partisan spirit in Washington confuses  supporting the troops  with just supporting the current administration s policies   This idea is factually and morally wrong  We support the troops by giving the troops what they need to succeed   and sometimes that means actually challenging the policies that have put them and kept them in harm s way  and harmed the families who pray each day for their safe return        When the Administration in charge can   t bring itself to admit mistakes   supporting the troops  means that the rest of us  especially in Congress  have a special responsibility to demand that failed policies be acknowledged and changed          Supporting the troops  means paying attention to the needs of our troops in the field and at home  understanding their lives both as warriors fighting for the defense of their country and as parents  brothers and sisters  sons and daughters  struggling for the prosperity and happiness of their families         And in the long run   supporting the troops  means supporting changes in our defense policies  in our systems  our budgets  and our military planning  that ensure that the brave American warriors of the future are fully prepared to fight and win tomorrow s battles in defense of America s safety  values and vital interests   Supporting the troops means strengthening America   s military  not just talking about it       So it s time to take a long and honest look at what we need to do to build a twenty first century military  and to provide a twenty first century support system for our troops and their families         And the first step is to acknowledge that we are years and even decades behind in meeting this challenge  despite the victories our military has achieved in places ranging from Kosovo to Afghanistan and Iraq          Despite the obvious and central importance of such military missions as  peacekeeping  and  stability operations   these concepts still remain outside the day to day debate and the military planners who understand these new missions have to fight hard just to have their voices hard  Too many of the planners who designed today s defense policies are still mired in the post Vietnam doctrine of only fighting  big wars  against strong hostile states  not wars in and against  failed states  in which enemy armies are the least of our problems      Wars are won  not merely by breaking the enemy   s army  but by breaking his will to fight  But in the decade after the 1991 Gulf War  we built a military prepared to break armies   We   ve invested in the tools of war and we are supreme in our ability to project force around the world   We   ve failed to invest sufficiently in the types of forces that win the peace we   ve failed to invest in the people  the men and women  who turn battlefield success into strategic victory   Combined with failed diplomacy and poor judgment in Iraq  these failures have produced an Army stretched to the breaking point        So I   m here today to talk to you about the need to expand the Army and the Marine Corps  to better invest in the skills our forces will need on future battlefields  to better shape the force for the missions it may face  and to provide a Military Family Bill of Rights that truly supports the troops by protecting their loved ones      One thing is clear  the American military today is both too small and ill designed for today   s dangers   A force designed for the post Cold War 1990s is too small for the war on terror and the challenges of the new century   The administration   s failure to address this issue  quickly and wisely  has only deepened the hole in which we find ourselves        I first called for expanding the Active Duty Army in the summer of 2003 when it became apparent that the Iraq invasion had stretched our forces to the breaking point  Let me be clear  this was not  and is not a proposal to increase U S  forces in Iraq itself  But our experience in Iraq is instructive   If we had acted to expand the Active Duty Forces in 2003  the Army would not be as stressed as it is today  The evidence is everywhere to be seen       In the past  the Army gave units two years to reset  re train  and prepare between combat deployments   Instead the 3rd Infantry Division is headed back to Iraq after only one year   The 101st Airborne and the 4th Infantry divisions are headed back later this year after less than two years   The First Marine Expeditionary Force is already in the middle of its second deployment to Iraq       Even with this timetable  we ve made ends meet only through large contributions from the National Guard and Reserve   But in planning the next rotation of U S  forces  we re running out of Guard and Reserve units to call on because they   ve already been deployed   14 of the National Guard   s 15 most combat ready units are either in Iraq now  recently demobilized  or on alert for duty in the coming year   Of the 205 000 Army Reservists  only about 37 000 remain available for deployment for the types of missions needed in Iraq   Last year the Army dipped into the Individual Ready Reserve   More recently  the Army has even begun to call back military retirees  ranging in age from their mid 40s to their late 60s       The situation is so grave that Lt  General James Helmly  chief of the Army Reserve  recently warned that the reserves are    rapidly degenerating into a broken force      and cautioned that  at this rate we couldn   t meet the needs of    future missions          The war on terror which we know requires a comprehensive approach will have a military component   Surprises happen and our armed forces must be ready to meet those challenges  wherever and whenever they occur       Since the end of the Cold War  every major commitment of American military power  including the    Air War    in Kosovo  has required a sizeable commitment of American ground forces  at the very least to provide post conflict security and stability  There   s no technological substitute for boots on the ground  and we must always plan for the worst  so we never expose our troops to the unintended consequences of wishful thinking       We saw that in Iraq  The administration told us our troops would be greeted as liberators   They said the reconstruction would be painless and self financing   They believed that U S  forces in Iraq would be quickly reduced to 50 000 troops  They told us to expect further reductions by the end of 2003   They were wrong   And American forces have paid the price ever since         We have to act today to make sure they don   t pay that same price in the future       The CIA   s internal think tank  the National Intelligence Council  recently drew an important conclusion about conflict over the next 15 years     Weak governments  lagging economies  religious extremism  and youth bulges will align to create a perfect storm for internal conflict in certain regions      That   s a warning about the danger of failed states   and this should be a wake up call for American strategy       Failed states can become havens for terrorists   It was a failed state in Afghanistan that provided a training ground for al Qaeda   It was a failed state where al Qaeda made its plans  grew its forces  and emerged to threaten our national security         We need a comprehensive foreign policy strategy to deal with failed states  but we must also have a military ready to act if necessary  For the foreseeable future  the United States will need a larger ground force   Failure to build one now will only diminish our national security in the future       The war in Iraq proved that lightening fast  high tech force can smash an opposing Army and drive to Baghdad in three weeks   But there is no substitute for a well trained and equipped infantry to win the peace or secure a failed state   Those missions require an investment in the men and women of the American military to expand their number  and to increase the number of forces that specialize in certain skills       When I return to Washington  I will introduce legislation to increase the size of the military by 40 000 30 000 in the Army and 10 000 in the Marine Corps to meet the challenges of the new century       I will do so  mindful of what we ask our soldiers and Marines to do  It takes a special individual to see your buddy get hit  and put yourself between him and incoming fire so that medics can tend to him   It takes a special person to work day by day in an environment where it is impossible to distinguish friend from foe       But they do it   And they do it well       They are sustained by the bonds they share within their unit  and by the love and strength they draw from home from their families  their spouses  their children  their parents     Military families are unsung heroes who receive neither medals nor parades giving everything they can to the men and women they love  men and women who have been called to war   They answered the call   And so must we with a new commitment to smarter defense policies  like those I outlined earlier  and better care for military families       Over the last year  I talked day in and day out about the need for a Military Family Bill of Rights  a set of policies enshrined in law  to provide assistance to the families of the American military   The need has not diminished since November 2nd       Investing in military families isn   t just an act of compassion it   s a smart investment in America   s military   Good commanders know that while you may recruit an individual soldier or Marine  you    retain    a family   Nearly 50  of America   s service members are married today   If we want to retain our most experienced service members  especially the non commissioned officers that are the back bone of the Army and Marine Corps  we have to keep faith with their families   If we don   t  and those experienced  enlisted leaders begin to leave  America will have a broken     hollow    military       We can begin by increasing the financial support military families receive   We can help them meet the increased expenses every military family faces when a loved one is deployed  Thousands of reservists  for example  take a cut in pay when called to active duty   Some employers make up the difference in lost wages   We should reward those patriotic business leaders  And since small businesses don t have the workforces that make it possible to spread such costs  we should offer a Small Business Tax Credit to those who make up the difference between a reservist   s civilian and military pay   For all service members  we should permit penalty free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts for deployment related expenses  such as increased child care and other costs         As many as one in five members of the National Guard and Reserves don   t have health insurance   That   s bad policy and bad for our national security   When units are mobilized  they count on all their personnel   But when a member of the National Guard or Reserve is mobilized  and unit members fail physicals because they haven   t seen a doctor in two years  that   s bad for readiness and that   s bad for unit effectiveness  As part of the Military Family Bill of Rights  we will extend military health insurance eligibility to all members of the National Guard and Reserve  whether mobilized or not       One of the unfortunate truths about war is that it takes lives and mostly young lives   For their survivors  much of life remains  and we must be generous in our efforts to help them put their lives back together   During last year   s campaign I proposed increasing the military   s death benefit to  250 000   When combined with the Servicemembers Group Life Insurance  a family would receive  500 000 when a loved one dies in the service of our nation   Now  no one can ever put a price on a life  but we ought to do what we can to help families coping with the worst of news   The President recently embraced a formula to reach the  500 000 threshold  and I   m glad he has joined this effort      Our generosity must not stop there   At present  survivors of those killed in action have 180 days to move out of military housing   But for those with young children in school  180 days may mean starting a school year in one state  and finishing it in another   With all the disruption the loss of a parent will bring to their lives  survivors should have the flexibility to stay in military housing for one year after the death of a service member   It   s the least we can do for those who have paid the ultimate price       But let   s be honest  no piece of legislation will ever anticipate all the needs of America   s military families   Someone will always fall through the cracks   And the legislation I intend to offer will try to fix that  Take the case of Jay Briseno   Jay was wounded in Iraq and left paralyzed from the neck down   The law authorizes the VA to provide  11 000 to modify a disabled veteran   s vehicle  but it doesn   t provide the resources a family needs to buy the specially out fitted vehicle Jay needed   In his case  a generous member of the community donated the van the Briseno   s now use to drive Jay to doctors appointments and hospital visits   And we are all grateful for that act of generosity   But no family should ever have to be so dependent on charity to meet a basic need       Americans will do everything in our power to help military families   But not all Americans can afford to buy modified minivans for wounded veterans  and not all military families have the same needs   So as part of my Military Family Bill of Rights  we will establish a Military Family Relief Fund   Every American who pays taxes will be able to contribute by checking a box on their income tax returns   Just as we let Americans donate a few dollars to finance our presidential elections on their tax forms  we should give them this opportunity to say thank you to our troops   The program will meet the needs we can   t expect with the flexibility and responsiveness our service members  veterans  and their families deserve       Supporting military families must also extend beyond service in uniform with programs across government to help with jobs  VA benefits  healthcare  and education   But in this time of war  we have another obligation to meet the needs of those suffering with the experience of war       The Pentagon believes that as many as 100 000 new combat veterans across the country will need some level of mental health care  The New England Journal of Medicine has reported as many as 1 in 6 soldiers returning from Iraq show symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder   Fewer than 40  of those have sought help   Military officials and mental health providers predict that up to 30  of returning soldiers will require psychiatric services associated with their experience in war   Through July of last year  31 000 veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom had applied for disability benefits for injuries and 20  of those claims were for psychological conditions  These are levels not seen since the Vietnam War       Our VA medical facilities are not ready for increased demands for the treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder   In fact only 86 of 163 VA Medical Centers have PTSD treatment centers  We must do better   The wounds of war are not always visible  and we cannot not sit back and wait for people to ask for help   We have to be proactive       Soldiers and Marines returning from war want to go home   They don   t want to do anything that could jeopardize their homecoming   That   s what happened to Jeffrey Lucey  a Marine Reservist from Belchertown   When he was leaving Iraq  his first instinct was to report traumatic memories of things he had seen in the war   But someone told him it might delay his return home  so Jeff kept quiet  But the safety  security  and joy of homecoming eluded Jeff   Haunted by the war and what he had seen  he began to drink heavily  He was plagued by recurring nightmares  and began talking about suicide   Last summer  Jeff took his own life  Jeff   s story is a preventable tragedy  and a call to action   As part of the legislation I plan  keeping faith with Jeff   s family who have become committed advocates in his memory  we will expand PTSD programs within the VA and require outreach efforts to find the veterans who need the care       Our obligation is to keep faith with the men and women of the American military and their families whether they are on active duty  in the National Guard or Reserves  or veterans       Those who have stood for us should know that we stand with them  today and always  Each of us here today can do something to ease their burden    but truly supporting our troops requires that we act not just as individuals  but as a nation   We owe our troops the opportunity to serve in the best planned  best equipped  and best led military force in the world  and we owe them the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they and their families will be taken care of if they sacrifice life  limb or the ability to sleep without war s nightmares   We owe them not just thanks and best wishes  but action  and action in our nation s capital   In today s ever changing and perilous world  there is not a moment to lose                                                                                      20510
