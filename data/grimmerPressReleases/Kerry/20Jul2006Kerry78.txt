sent a letter to Secretary of the Treasury  Henry Paulson  and Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service  Mark Everson  to request information on how the IRS oversees the practice of backdating stock options for corporate executives       The practice makes executive pay packages increasingly opaque  hiding from the public the exact of amount an executive receives   Recategorizing the stock options may result in advantageous tax treatment for executives by circumventing the rules that apply to performance based incentives  This practice will not only increase individual executives    profits  but will also lessen their incentive to improve the company as a whole  A recent academic study revealed that backdating is widespread among corporations      Kerry said     There needs to be a certain degree of transparency in corporate America     it   s what keeps investors    faith in the market   Backdating stock options should not be mistaken as some kind of benign creative accounting    it   s harmful to American companies  shareholders  and the market as a whole  This is an issue that needs to be investigated thoroughly and aggressively by federal authorities to make sure that tax laws are not being violated         The letter asks whether the IRS is aware of this practice  or whether the Treasury has been coordinating with the SEC to monitor backdated stock options       Below is a copy of the letter     July 19  2006      The Honorable Henry M  Paulson  Jr                The Honorable Mark Everson       Secretary of the Treasury

 1111 Constitution Avenue  NW    Washington  DC  20220                                               Washington  DC  20224      Dear Secretary Paulson and Commissioner Everson      Recently  there has been news coverage of companies backdating stock options in order to give top executives generous pay packages   The Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  is currently investigating this practice   I am concerned that backdating stock options has tax implications because it results in an undisclosed paper gain   Backdating also hides the exact amount of compensation being received by the executive      There are provisions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that should prevent the backdating of tax options resulting in advantageous tax treatment   Code section 162 m  addresses the tax treatment of executive salaries by limiting the amount that can be deducted from an employee   s salary to  1 million   Other compensation such as stock options is not included in this limitation if rewarded based on performance   If stock options are backdated  the link to performance is severed   The concept of stock options is to provide non cash incentives to improve a company   s stock price   An executive would profit from the difference between the cost of the stock under the option grant and the price of the stock after holding it for a minimum of six months   The practice of backdating the option price to a date when the stock is at a lower price increases an executive   s profit and lessens the incentive to improve the performance of the company      The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 includes a provision to address the tax treatment of nonqualified deferred compensation which would prevent the improper deferral of income   The combination of code sections 162 m  and 409A should prevent the backdating of stock options resulting in favorable tax treatment   However  it is unclear if the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  was aware of the practice of backdating stock options and has been reviewing tax returns to make sure that the executive stock options were taxed properly      I would appreciate if you could provide me information on what the IRS is doing to make sure that the backdating of tax options has not led to tax benefits   Additionally  I would like to know if you have been coordinating with the SEC in an effort to focus on the tax returns of companies that have admitted to using this practice of backdating   A recent study conducted by Professors Erik Lie of Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa and the Randall A  Heron of the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University shows that the practice of backdating is prevalent among corporations      Finally  I would to know if our current tax laws provide you with the adequate tools to prevent the backdating of stock options resulting in benefits for corporations and executives      Thank you in advance for your consideration of this important matter      Sincerely     John F  Kerry                                                                                   20510
