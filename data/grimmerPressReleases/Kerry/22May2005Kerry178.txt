       Releases                                                                                                                                           05 22 2005 Senator Kerry delivered at BU Medical School                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Dr  Antman  thank you for that generous introduction   I   ll tell you  it   s nice to be able to speak without the Republican Senate trying to cut me off   Your leadership at ASCO  the National Cancer Institute  and in our nation   s healthcare debate has been just superb   I know you   ll enrich an already much respected tradition here at Boston University   And you and I both get to look forward to our daughters graduating from medical school two years from now     I must say  on a personal level I have learned much about the journey that brought all you graduates here today   The fun of taking the boards      the nervous excitement before starting clinical rotations     the struggle to choose a specialty     the extreme reverence and respect you showed your cadavers in anatomy lab   I remember receiving an unbelievable excited mid day call from my daughter     Dad  I just held a beating human heart in my hand      That was a decidedly better call than the one that went     Dad  I was in ER today and when I bent over to examine a patient he vomited all over me      So I do know something of how you feel today     And I also know something of what you   re thinking today  a few more votes here and there and one of us could have ended up Surgeon General     Though today you become doctors     as we all know  residency  fellowship  and so much more hard work lies ahead   But still  the fact remains  you have already taken on responsibilities greater than most will ever know   We     parents  friends and faculty     all congratulate you on becoming doctors  and thank you not only for the lives you will save  but for choosing a life of service  __________    But as much as I extend congratulations  and celebrate with you and for you  there is one big question that must be asked  what will that life of service be   The question  frankly  is not what kind of doctors you will make     but rather what kind of citizens you will become     I understand the practice of medicine can be difficult   Malpractice premiums are skyrocketing   HMO   s can be extraordinarily difficult to contend with   So many physicians feel powerless under the weight of a seemingly inflexible  bureaucratic healthcare system     I also understand it   s particularly frustrating to turn on CNN and see nothing but partisan bickering about rules  Senate procedure and a few judges   You watch the week long coverage of the tragic Terry Shiavo case  knowing full well that thousands in similar circumstances are ignored   You hear false claims about Social Security bankrupting in 2042 when Medicare is set to go bankrupt in 20 years   You know that the real crisis is in healthcare     but Washington just doesn   t seem to focus or respond       The temptation to take the easy path is staring you in the face   You know you can keep silent  do your job  and still be an outstanding doctor   But don   t fool yourself   If you think you   ll be able to practice medicine the way you want to in the next few years under this system  you   re wrong     We have the best healthcare in the world  but ironically the system in which it   s delivered is increasingly coming apart   The bottom line is the system remains broken because  frankly  we have a bad habit in America  the government only responds to those most involved     those who make direct contact     those who wield power through influence  not substance   I know you   re upset about the 45 million living without health insurance today and the elderly forced to choose between food and medicine   But caring and being upset isn   t enough today     it doesn   t change anything or create accountability where there is none   On the other side of the ledger  the insurance companies and drug companies aren   t upset and they haven   t demonstrated that they particularly care  except to send legions of lobbyists to Washington every day to make sure nothing changes     You and everyone here understand better than anyone that healthcare is the real crisis of our country   Premiums have gone up over  3 500 for the average family   Over 45 million Americans have no healthcare at all   Benefits are going down while deductibles and co pays are going up   Doctors increasingly perform services that cost more than they are likely to be paid     Notwithstanding this crisis  accountability is harder to find in Washington than at any time in my two decades as a Senator   I have concluded  no rhetoric and no wish will change anything without grassroots energy   Nothing will change unless you take matters into your own hands   What   s encouraging is that many of you have already decided to do that   Members of this graduating class have worked with Medical Missions for Children  lobbied in Washington for healthcare reform  and traveled to provide healthcare to underserved people in far away places like Nicaragua  Bolivia  and Costa Rica   Many of you are already setting an example that your profession needs to follow     But I   ll tell you what  if you log on to Google you will find thousands of articles about doctors mobilizing     lending their passion  time and expertise to a cause     and you know what that is      the singular cause of medical malpractice reform   Now  obviously  medical malpractice is an important issue   You have to be able to practice   I proposed malpractice reform measures on the campaign last year and I am convinced we can make progress relatively easily   But we all know the malpractice issue is only a symptom of a larger problem  and if your profession focuses solely on is tort reform we   re all in trouble   Medical malpractice comprises less than 1  of total healthcare costs  and it   s going down   The situation has gotten to the point that this issue alone dominates the discussion so much that in Washington doctors now are too often considered just another special interest group   But you know you are so much more   And if you have any intention of practicing medicine under your high standards     you don   t have the luxury of sitting on the sidelines   Fixing our healthcare system as a whole is our primary challenge  and to make it happen you need to get engaged     to pound the pavement  get your hands dirty  endure real sacrifice  take on antiquated thinking and help lead the public debate    But that   s only part of your challenge   Your challenge is also to assure that ideology doesn   t impede the next frontiers of scientific discovery   The Human Genome Project  stem cell research  and nanotechnology promise new life saving treatments   Advances in medical imaging allow non invasive surgeries and new ways to detect diseases well before advanced stages   Well  imagine you spend the next decade developing the next procedure promising to save thousands of lives     and all of a sudden it   s taken away     not by the FDA  but by ideologues   In the 1940   s some argued heart transplants went too far   Imagine where medicine would be today if they had won       Your challenge is also to figure out why America is the only industrialized nation with such a catastrophic number of uninsured despite spending over  5 000 on healthcare per citizen   As residents you   ll have the privilege to practice in America   s emergency rooms  which have increasingly become primary care facilities     overflowing with the uninsured   You   ll deal with the nursing shortages   You   ll watch patients with real emergencies suffer helplessly in endless lines burgeoning with the uninsured with nowhere else to go for a routine check up   You won   t have enough time with each patient to give them the care you think they need  and know they deserve     Your challenge is to modernize an antiquated paper based healthcare delivery system that drives up costs while costing lives   If you don   t  you   ll suffer the fate of so many well intentioned doctors     who lacking accurate medical records prescribed medicine leading to an adverse drug event     who misread a handwritten note to the detriment of the recovering patient   The career threatening malpractice cases come next     Your challenge is to expand access and affordability as we encourage research and innovation   We have a great tradition of innovation in America  but research in health and fundamental sciences face dramatic cuts   Imagine yourself on the verge of discovering the next MRI  only to have your funding cut to finance a corporate tax loophole that passed only because big business knocked on a few more doors in Washington     So realistically  I   m sure you   re wondering  How do I change all this   The answer is you have to make your issues the voting issues of this nation   That may sound corny  but you   re not the first generation to face significant challenges   Women wouldn   t have gained the right to vote if they hadn   t fought for it   No one gave blacks civil rights out of the goodness of their hearts     they demanded it       Not to wax nostalgic about the 1970   s  but back then people got upset when they saw injustice   They got tired of seeing the Cuyhoga River light on fire and on one great day 20 million American marched all across this land   Politicians had no choice but to take notice   Eventually 12 congressmen were labeled the Dirty Dozen  and soon after seven of those dozen congressmen who voted against common sense were kicked out of office by the voters   The floodgates were opened   We got the Clean Air Act  The Clean Water Act  Marine Mammal Protection  Clean Drinking Water  and Coastal Zone Management   We created the EPA   The quality of life in America improved because 20 million concerned citizens made their issues matter in elections     Rather than wasting our attention on a runaway bride and Michael Jackson  we need to get back to fighting the real issues of our nation   We need to get back to making smart choices   We   re busy exporting Democracy abroad to Afghanistan and Iraq  which is fine  but what we really need to do is a better job at making our Democracy work right here at home     We have 11 million uninsured children in America today   I talk to family physicians and they tell me about the chronic asthma     the chronic ear and eye problems that develop in children who for too long had no care at all   We continue to under invest in early childhood education  pre natal care and after school programs   These efforts are very expensive  but we always end up paying more later   Covering all kids would reduce avoidable hospitalizations by 22 percent and replace expensive critical care with inexpensive preventive care   And kids with healthcare do 68  better in measures of academic performance     It shouldn   t be hard to connect the dots for the American people on these issues   And it shouldn   t be hard to get them mad about what   s happening   In 22 states parents can   t take kids fishing and eat the fish if they   re lucky enough to catch anything because of mercury   Think about that   In 44  of all river bodies and streams it   s not safe to fish or swim   And yet industrial polluters continue to block legislation that would prevent mercury and MTBE from polluting our water supplies and leaving children with debilitating diseases   Our infant mortality rate is going up   We   re the richest nation in the world and our infant mortality rate is going up     higher than the Czech Republic  Greece  and Portugal   We are now 42nd in the world   Is that acceptable     Big oil companies continue to delay development of clean  renewable forms of energy that would keep toxic fumes out of the air   Powerful special interests continue to prevail on government policy regarding smoking  drug treatment and other public health issues   All of these terrible choices will compound the deficit you have to make up as physicians   But your help will be worthless if you don   t attack the problems with the same vigor that these corporate interests protect their profits     Look  you have a choice  either the politicians can talk about these issues among themselves and do nothing  or you can talk about these issues and make them do something about it   The politicians can hear from special interests on these issues  or from you on these issues   When you see Washington consistently turning a blind eye to suffering  don   t sit back and apathetically blame indifference   The loudest voices are delivering the worst messages   In 2004 insurance companies gave  36 million in political contributions   Pharmaceutical companies contributed almost  18 million   Their power may seem insurmountable  but it   s not       By becoming doctors you have won a very special position in our society   When you leave today you will have the credibility to challenge Washington   You will have a more powerful and respected voice than you can possibly imagine   My message to you is  use it     live up to the special position you   ve been granted   __________    Challenge the Congress to put voice behind values   In an era when politicians like to use the word    values     I believe insuring kids is the surest test of who only talks about family values and who really values families   Fight for a Kid   s First bill that would insure every one of the 11 million uninsured children in America today   It   s a battle worth fighting     and you think it   s just common sense     but oh no      Leadership in Washington fights against kid   s healthcare and makes a very different choice   Our budget gives a tax cut for millionaires     that   s right  people making over  1 million a year     that will cost over  32 billion next year alone   The Administration chooses not to provide healthcare to every child  even though that  32 billion could insure every one of the 11 million American children living without health insurance   And they tell us it   s a tough choice that must be made because of a phony crisis  when the corporate tax loopholes are still on the books  and the Administration uses tax dollars to produce fake newscasts   What kind of values choice is that   No one is better qualified than you to question that choice     You also hear a lot of politicians talking about how religion should affect our nation   s policies   Well  I went back and read the New Testament to make sure I didn   t miss anything     and nowhere in Jesus    three year ministry does he say we need to sacrifice kid   s healthcare so millionaires can have tax cuts and people can put social security on the stock market     There is a lesson to be learned here for all of you   As you fight against a failing healthcare system you will also fight against deception and untruth   We need you to bring to real values back to the table and end the hypocrisy of people who talk about values but don   t value families   If you can help bring some honesty and accountability back to politics  it may be your greatest accomplishment of all  __________    The fact that you   re here today indicates you have made a set of bold and brave choices up to this point   Don   t stop now   As you treat your patients  never forget the patients who will never be treated unless you insist on it     Today you will take an oath to    do no harm       I know you will take that oath seriously  and will treat your patients with the utmost care   But remember that indifference can be as harmful as recklessness     silence as damaging as ignorance     Members of the Class of 2005     today you have earned a special place in our society   I hope you will be more than doctors  and use your opportunity to help us give this nation the healthcare system it deserves  and restore honesty and accountability to the debate   If you do that  you will also become the special citizens our nation so desperately needs
