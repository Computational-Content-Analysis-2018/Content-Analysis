Kerry  D Mass    and Barack Obama  D Ill   asked Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin to delay a vote on media ownership until the FCC has followed the will of Congress and established a commission to look into minority and women media ownership  Kerry and Obama made clear that if Martin once again bucked the Congress  they would ask the Appropriations Committee to deny funding for implementation of the rule produced by the forced vote    This is a show down with an FCC Chairman who is letting the FCC do the bidding of big corporate conglomerates without giving smaller media outlets a chance to fight back  said Senator John Kerry  I want to thank Sen  Obama for joining with me to help hold the FCC accountable  and ensuring that it promotes a more diverse  independent media in America    We must ensure that we have an open media market that represents all of the voices in our diverse nation  and allows them to be heard  said Senator Obama  The FCC must meet its obligations to our countrys minority communities and not special interests by ensuring that broadcasters are doing right by the communities they operate in before it considers loosening media ownership regulations  I reiterate my call to the FCC to conduct its rules changes in a transparent and inclusive process  respect minority interests  and delay its upcoming vote until further evaluations are completed     Earlier this month  the Commerce Committee sent Chairman Martin a message with its unanimous approval of a bill that would require Chairman Martin to address the state of minority and women ownership as well as localism before acting on larger media ownership rules  By moving forward with Tuesdays vote  Chairman Martin is directly contradicting the will of Congress     Senators Kerry and Obama sent a similar letter urging the FCC to act on this issue in July  2006    Earlier this month  the Commerce Committee sent Chairman Martin a message with its unanimous approval of a bill that would require Chairman Martin to address the state of minority and women ownership as well as localism before acting on larger media ownership rules  By moving forward with Tuesdays vote  Chairman Martin is directly contradicting the will of Congress     Below is the text of the letter    December 14  2007  The Honorable Kevin J  Martin  Chairman  Federal Communications Commission  445 12th Street SW  Washington  DC 20554   Dear Chairman Martin    Your testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee on December 13  2007 restates your intention to move forward aggressively with a proposal that would relax media ownership rules with respect to the Newspaper Broadcast Cross Ownership Rule  We reiterate our call from July of last year and in various forums over the last two months for you to delay this vote for a period of time sufficient for the Commission to examine the status of minority and women media ownership in the United States  and to establish a policy to effectively address the need to promote greater diversity in media markets     With respect to this issue  the intent of the Senate Commerce Committee was made clear with its decision to unanimously report S  2332  the Media Ownership Act of 2007  Section 2 of this bill would require the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  to establish and convene an independent panel to make recommendations for specific rules to increase the representation of women and minorities in the ownership of broadcast media  The bill further states that the FCC must act on the panel s recommendations before voting on any changes to its broadcast and newspaper ownership rules    We recognize the widespread animosity aimed at the direction of the Commission regarding Tuesdays scheduled vote  We understand that for a variety of reasons you are being asked to postpone the vote to permit more time for the Commission to fully understand how a relaxation in the Cross Ownership Rule will impact other important issues such as localism  It is our hope that the sum of these objections will convince you to delay this vote until a time following the Commissions consideration of other pressing matters  Specifically  we believe that moving forward with this change will have a direct and detrimental impact on the state of media diversity  Should you decide to move forward with this vote against the expressed bipartisan  bicameral intent of Congress  we will approach Appropriations Chairman Byrd with a request that funds be denied for the implementation of this rule     Thank you for your consideration  Should you have any questions regarding this request  please do not hesitate to contact any of us at any time    Sincerely    Sen  John Kerry  Sen  Barack Obama   Kerry and Obama co sponsored a bill that would require the FCC to have a 90 day comment period on any proposed media ownership rule changes and to conduct a separate proceeding on localism with another 90 day comment period  The bill also requires the FCC to convene an independent panel to make recommendations regarding specific rules to increase women and minority ownership of broadcast media  The FCC would be required to act on the panels recommendations prior to voting on changes to broadcast ownership regulations  The bill was sponsored by Senator Dorgan  and also cosponsored by Senators Lott  Feinstein  Cantwell and Snowe                                                                                20510
