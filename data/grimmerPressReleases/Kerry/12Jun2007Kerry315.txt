Massachusetts Senators John Kerry and Edward M  Kennedy called on the Department of Defense to restore  260 million to Army and Air Force Small Business Innovation Research  SBIR  programs  This funding was temporarily reallocated within the agency earlier this year with the understanding it would be restored once the emergency supplemental appropriations bill passed  Although the bill was signed into law two weeks ago on May 25th  many small research and development firms have yet to receive their funds and resume their projects  This is harmful to many SBIR firms  with a particularly large impact in Massachusetts  the second largest recipient of all SBIR funds in the country  Each year about 200 Massachusetts firms receive Army and Air Force SBIR contracts  and in 2005  the contracts were worth  55 million  SBIR contracts help create the technologies of the future that will help keep our troops and our country safer  Massachusetts firms are leading the way in developing innovative solutions  and I am hopeful that the Defense Department will restore the money they borrowed from this important small business program quickly  as promised  said Kerry  Chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship  The funding crisis that necessitated this reprogramming has subsided  and it is vital for these funds to be restored to the Small Business Innovation Research Program as quickly as possible so that this important research can continue with minimal impact  These SBIR programs provide cutting edge knowledge and technology to protect our troops and keep them out of harms way  said Kennedy  Massachusetts firms began receiving letters in early May stating that their funding would be delayed  While the funding shift was necessary earlier this year  funds are now available allowing the Department of Defense to take action to get funding to small firms  If the agency does not replace the  260 million in the SBIR program  small businesses in Massachusetts could potentially miss out on as much as  24 million in contracts for research and development of new technologies  The SBIR program has allowed the Department of Defense to move projects through with shorter planning times  For example  in 2005  the Defense Department awarded 38 Phase I SBIR contracts to address the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices  IEDs   Within five months  18 of these projects were in the next phase and prototypes were expected to be tested in the field within another six months  The Small Business Innovation and Development Act  which became law in 1982  required federal agencies with large research budgets to grant a small percentage of research contracts to small businesses  creating the SBIR program  SBIR has been phenomenally successful  allowing growth in sectors of the economy which may have otherwise remained stagnant and creating competition to drive technological innovations  Following is the text of the letter Senators Kennedy and Kerry sent to Defense Secretary Robert Gates  June 11  2007 The Honorable Robert M  Gates Secretary U S  Department of Defense The Pentagon  Room 3E880 Washington  DC 20301 1000 Dear Secretary Gates  We are writing to respectfully urge the Department of Defense to submit a reprogramming request to transfer back  260 million in funding to the Small Business Innovation Research  SBIR  programs of the Air Force and Army  These funds were designated for the SBIR program and were temporarily reprogrammed within the Department of Defense earlier this year  It is our understanding that the U S  Troop Readiness  Veterans Care  Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act  2007 provides the money that will allow the funds previously reallocated from the SBIR program to be replenished  It is imperative that these funds be restored to the SBIR program as soon as possible and that the Air Force and Army disburse awards to the small businesses that need those funds to resume important research and development projects for the government  As the governments only program of its kind  SBIR plays a critical role in the development of military weaponry and equipment that protect our national security interests at home and abroad  Cybernet Systems of Ann Arbor  Michigan  is just one example of SBIR research helping our military  That company developed a technology to sort bullets that allows one soldier to do the work that used to be done by 40  The machine uses lasers and computer cameras to sort and inspect bullets at a much finer level of detail than the human can manage  This not only frees up our soldiers for other important missions  but it also saves a tremendous amount of money that would otherwise be spent on wasted  lost  and damaged ammunition  The prompt reprogramming of  260 million in Army and Air Force SBIR funds will allow thousands of small businesses to resume the development of similar important and cost effective technologies  Please provide us with a copy of the reprogramming request as soon as it is available  as well as any documentation that demonstrates action by the Department to return SBIR activities to normal  Thank you  Sincerely  Edward M  Kennedy   John F  Kerry Cc  The Honorable Michael W  Wynne Secretary U S  Air Force The Honorable Preston M  Geren  III Secretary  Acting   U S  Army
