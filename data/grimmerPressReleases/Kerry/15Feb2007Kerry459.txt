Kerry addressed the GLOBE International Washington Legislators Forum on Climate Change today  highlighting the urgent need for action to reverse global warming  Kerry  who is a former president of GLOBE U S   called for a sustained series of actions not just here in Washington but around the world to reverse the destructive impact of climate change  He said that world leaders  can no longer sit around and talk while the earth s temperature increases         Below are Senator Kerry s remarks  as prepared for delivery        I want to start today by thanking GLOBE International for providing this important forum for legislators  business leaders and others to discuss global climate change        I understand much of the discussion   for obvious reasons   has been focused on the United States  role in meeting this challenge  And as someone who has been working on climate change in the US Congress for more than a decade  I m both frustrated by our lack of progress to date and encouraged by our resolve to finally get something done        We all know that for far too long  in the Senate and elsewhere  this issue has been neglected or pushed aside as unsolvable  incomprehensible  or simply someone else s problem   But the stakes could not be higher  and the reality could hardly be more stark         The issue of global warming has finally reached critical mass in America s public discussion   Suddenly  on a variety of fronts  it s moving toward its rightful place  front and center in the dialogue about our environment  our security and our economy          From the State of the Union to states across this country  from the Academy Awards to the National Academy of Sciences  people are finally waking up to see that we re in the middle of a crisis  and we have ten years to put our country on a different path before its too late         It was 1987   1987     when we first started talking about climate change  The Commerce Committee  under Senator Al Gore of Tennessee  held the first congressional hearings that year   And I ve been working on this issue ever since  In June 1992 I was part of a Senate delegation to the Earth Summit in Rio where I met with leaders from across the globe and discussed various ways to tackle this problem          At the time  there was a ray of international hope as well as a promise   The hope stemmed from a sense of relief that we had recognized the problem of climate change in time  and the promise was that as members of the global community we would commit ourselves to efforts to address it   The hope was translated into the Framework Convention on Climate Change  a treaty we adopted after the summit outlining how participating countries could stabilize greenhouse gas   The Senate approved it unanimously  and we all thought we were on the way to an unprecedented bipartisan implementation of visionary  responsible policy   That was fifteen years ago        Unfortunately  from a policy perspective little progress has been made  Instead we entered a period of procrastination and evasion  And more recently  under President Bush  of stonewalling unilateralism  of energy policy made by secret CEO task forces and trumped up industry funded  studies  that challenge the ever growing scientific consensus that the threat is real           Recently  however  the American people have begun demanding better  and politicians are actually listening   States are taking action    California passed a landmark bill that establishes a first in the world comprehensive program of regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of greenhouse gases   And my home state of Massachusetts   under the leadership of Deval Patrick   has rejoined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative  now an eight state effort to reduce global warming pollution from power plants  Across the nation  376 mayors from 50 states have signed onto the US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement  an initiative to advance the goals of the Kyoto Protocol  And even President Bush finally saw fit to mention  the serious challenge of global climate change  in his State of the Union address         What s driving this sea change  On nearly a weekly basis  we see mounting scientific evidence highlighting the need to act  Just last week we read a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change   written by more than 600 scientists  reviewed by another 600 experts  and edited by officials from 154 governments   which raised the alarm bell  The fact of global warming is   unequivocal    The certainty of the human role is now somewhere over 90 percent  Which is about as certain as scientists ever get         Everyone in this room knows the basic facts                   At both poles and nearly all points in between  the temperature of the Earth s surface is heating up  and at a frightening and potentially catastrophic rate                   Global temperatures have increased an average of 1 4 degrees Fahrenheit during the twenty first century                   The Earth is hotter today than at any time in at least the past thousand years        Science tells us that this heating is the result of human activity        As much as science tells us about the current state of the planet  science also helps us identify the solutions  In order to minimize large scale adverse impacts to humans and the environment  we must adopt a long term objective of CO2 concentration of about 450 parts per million  Senator Snowe and I have introduced bipartisan legislation to achieve that goal  Our bill establishes an economy wide cap and trade program to reverse carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2010   and mandates a 65  cut in emissions by 2050     And  knowing that we will need help transitioning to a green economy  our plan uses tax incentives and increased research funding to protect affected workers  communities  companies  and consumers from energy cost shocks          In doing so  the United States will be positioned as the world leader in reducing the risk of potentially devastating and wide ranging impacts associated with climate change and in developing and implementing low carbon energy technologies and strategies       Key features of our bill                   Vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards for cars and light duty vehicles as well as medium and heavy duty vehicles                   Research and development program on global climate change  ocean acidification and abrupt climate change research                   A renewable portfolio standard requiring a minimum annual percentage of 20 percent renewable electricity by 2020                  Contains a standard that 50  of fueling stations contain at least one E85 pump by 2016                  Tax incentives for advanced technology vehicles by both providing consumers with additional advanced technology vehicle purchase incentives and manufacturers with credits for building advanced technology vehicles        This is one of the great challenges of our times   Failing to even acknowledge it publicly for years  the Bush administration of course failed to see that  as with any kind of change  there is an opportunity  As a result of this myopia  the United States is ceding its leadership in developing the new technologies that will undoubtedly be a significant economic driver for America s 21st century economy  Other countries are happily filling the void  By abandoning the playing field  we are disadvantaging ourselves economically  In stark contrast to some of our government leaders  many prominent business leaders    the CEOs of Dow  Alcoa  and BP among them   have long accepted the facts about climate change and have pursued visionary policies to match the nightmarish threat of catastrophic climate change        Rather than arguing against the supposed economic turmoil that will befall our nation  we should be embracing what these business leaders have accepted long ago  There is huge economic potential in the response  The new technologies required to reduce emissions  and the means of remedying the harm we have already done  should be viewed as a key part of our economic future  Every schoolchild learns that the history of this nation has been written through a spirit of innovation   from the Wright Brothers to Henry Ford to Bill Gates  from the Model T to the iPod  I ask you this  why would we stop now          This is the new frontier for America s technological ingenuity  If we rise to meet this challenge  we stand to gain whole industries of new  high value jobs  leading to better quality of life  better technical assistance to the world  and a competitive edge in a new marketplace  Some businesses across the globe and here in the United States are already proving that there are enormous profits to be made in developing technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  And just as it makes economic sense for individual businesses  tackling this problem makes economic sense at the government level as well        Heads turned last fall when Sir Nicholas Stern  a distinguished development economist and head of the Government Economics Service for the United Kingdom  issued a report on the economics of climate change  It was the first comprehensive  serious cost benefit analysis of such change  His findings were dramatic and unequivocal  His fundamental conclusion said this   This Review has assessed a wide range of evidence on the impacts of climate change and on the economic costs  and has used a number of different techniques to assess costs and risks  From all of these perspectives  the evidence gathered by the Review leads to a simple conclusion  the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting         So prompt and strong action is clearly warranted        Stern  like many of the world s leading scientists  identifies the next ten years as our last best chance to tackle global warming and to avoid the scenario in which our children and grandchildren are left with a global catastrophe   That is not the future we want them to inherit          It is time to stop debating fiction writers  oil executives  and flat Earth politicians and address  in a very real way  what can rightly be called a mortal threat to America        There are clear principles that should drive and shape our action        The challenge will become more difficult the longer we wait  The problem and the solution are global  but it is better that we begin locally rather than not at all  Sound domestic policies will contribute to the strength of our economy  our security  and the environment  And at least for now  Washington is far behind the American people when it comes to understanding and meeting this challenge        Increasingly  homegrown efforts by concerned that citizens are outpacing political  leaders    many of whom have done precious little leadership on this issue     in forcing change  From school kids engaging in local activities to spread awareness steps their fellow students can take  to dedicated professionals in government agencies like Jim Hansen  to creative business leaders like Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric  to powerful activists like Laurie David  who produced Al Gore s documentary and has founded the StopGlobalWarming org Web site  to longtime  dedicated environmental leaders     there is a growing awareness that the clock is ticking and that showing responsibility is imperative        As Teddy Roosevelt once said   Great thoughts speak only to the thoughtful mind  but great actions speak to all mankind   As imposing as the facts of climate change may be  there are countless practical actions that each of us can take to make a difference  The single most significant thing all Americans can do is elect leaders who understand that there is only one course of action that will truly solve this problem  an innovative and strategic national energy policy                                                                                    20510
