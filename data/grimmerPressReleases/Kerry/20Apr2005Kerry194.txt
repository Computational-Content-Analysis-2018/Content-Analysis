Must Choose Between Special Interests and the American People                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Senator John Kerry went to the Senate floor today to demand the president stop talking about his failed energy policies and instead do something about rapidly increasing gas prices and reducing America   s dependence on Middle East oil   Below are his remarks          Mr  President  once again today President Bush will talk about the rising cost of gas hurting Americans at the pump   and he   ll talk about our dangerous dependence on foreign oil        The issue today is not that the President doesn   t understand the problem  it   s that he has no solutions  Just last weekend President Bush used his radio address to urge Americans to support his energy legislation   He said     American families and small businesses across the country are feeling the pinch from rising gas prices      President Bush is right that families are struggling  he   s wrong about the energy bill        The energy plan he continues to campaign for will make us more dependent on foreign oil  it will keep gas prices at record highs instead of making them affordable for consumers  and it will make our air and water more polluted instead of investing in a cleaner future          Mr  President  we need honest leadership and sound solutions to solve this very real energy crisis   This crisis affects our economy  our security  and our environment         The President   s status quo energy policies are hurting consumers at the pump  and no amount of tax payer funded  campaign style events can cover it up  because the evidence is posted on signs at every gas station in America  Americans are paying an average of  2 28 gallon at the pump   That   s up six cents in just the last week and over 50 cents in the last year   For the fourth week in a row gas prices are at an all time high  and have now increased a staggering 56  since 2001        A recent Gallup survey revealed that 44  of Americans believe it   s    extremely important for Congress and the President to address gas prices      But you only need to look at the legislation promoted by the President and set to be voted on in the House this week to see that yet again Washington isn   t doing the work of the American people         Under this Administration  higher gas prices cost American consumers an extra  34 billion   Airlines  truckers and farmers spent an extra  20 billion last year alone   That   s a regressive energy tax on the backs of working Americans if I   ve ever seen one         But the Administration   s friends got off a lot easier  and this energy bill will make their load even lighter  While American workers and families were struggling  oil companies earned record profits in the fourth quarter of 2004  ExxonMobil up 218   ConocoPhillips up 145   Shell up 51   ChevronTexaco up 39  and BP up 35   What   s the President proposing  Just think about this  Ninety five percent of the tax benefits included in the package   more than 8 billion dollars   goes directly into the pockets of big oil and gas companies   At a time when oil prices are at historic highs  our energy policy should be aimed at investing in new and renewable sources of energy  not lining the pockets of big special interests         What   s good for is the Administration   s contributors has not been good for our economy   Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan has said     Markets for oil and natural gas have been subject to a degree of strain over the past year not experienced for a generation      The Chairman of the President   s own Council of Economic Advisors has admitted     High energy prices are now a drag on our economy           The problem goes even deeper  The Administration   s failure to propose a real energy policy also threatens our national security   We are more dependent on foreign oil than ever before  forcing us to into dangerous and compromising political entanglements with nations in the Middle East    America will never be fully secure until we free ourselves from the noose of foreign oil        Unfortunately  this so called energy plan does nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil  But don   t just take my word for it   the President   s own economists found that oil imports will actually increase 85  by 2025 under a proposal like this   The President   s economists also found that    changes to production  consumption  imports  and prices are negligible     You don   t have to be an expert on oil or energy to understand this  you just have to able to count to figure out that God only gave us 3  of the worlds    oil reserves   Saudi Arabia has 65  of them   we can   t drill our way to energy independence  we have to invent our way there        Mr  President  this energy bill isn   t even a band aid on a very real energy crisis that threatens our economy and hurts our national security   About the only thing it does well is fatten the coffers of big energy companies   There is a reason Senator McCain  called the energy bill the    No Lobbyist Left Behind Act           What kind of message do these policies send   If your profits go up  so do your subsidies  If the policy makes us more dependent on foreign oil  make the status quo even worse        Mr  President  we should be doing better than this  Energy policy gives us a rare chance to address so many challenges at once        If we end our dependence on foreign oil  we strengthen our national security        If we lead the world in inventing new energy technologies  we create thousands of high paying American jobs        If we learn to tap clean sources of energy  we preserve a clean environment for our families and future generations        If we remove the burden of high gas prices  American consumers can spend elsewhere and give our economy the boost it needs        Unfortunately  this energy bill accomplishes none of these goals  Instead  it is laden with handouts to corporate special interests   When it comes to real energy policy  President Bush has run out of gas   The solutions to our energy crisis are staring us in the face  yet we continue to ignore them          Mr  President  it is long since time Washington came together on real energy policy    to Americans who are suffering the consequences of Washington   s failure  we owe more than staged events to promote policies that don   t hold the answers           David Wade or April Boyd
