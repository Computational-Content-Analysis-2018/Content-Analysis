John Kerry  D   Mass   along with Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D   Mass   sent the following letter to President George Bush urging him to fully fund LIHEAP to help families who will struggle with rising home heating costs this winter  Kerry will join his colleagues   Senators Reed  Collins  Kennedy and others   in offering the amendment to fully fund LIHEAP this week          How long is it going to take for this Administration to realize that not fully funding LIHEAP will mean millions of families and seniors will be unable to stay warm this winter      Senator Kerry asked     I am happy that Senator Kennedy and I could send this letter to the President today  and I hope he hears our concerns before it   s too late  With home heating costs going through the roof  pretty soon families across the country will be forced to make a choice between heating their homes and putting food on the table  Fully funding LIHEAP will help the families who need it most   it   s time we get this done          Senator Kennedy said     The American people won   t stand for a government that puts irresponsible tax breaks for the wealthy ahead of funding for assistance for our families that need help the most   LIHEAP funding has been stagnate over the past decade and the Bush Administration has failed to make energy conservation a priority  America deserves better  We have the ability to tell the elderly  and the disabled  and many others that we hear them  and that we won   t leave them shivering in the cold this winter  I   m offering an amendment to the Transportation  Treasury  Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill tomorrow to include additional funding for our families            Below please find a copy of the letter to President Bush        October 18  2005       President George Bush   The White House   1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW   Washington  DC 20500       Dear President Bush        Last week  the Energy Information Administration released an updated outlook on the costs of winter fuels  Based on their forecast  we learned that families all over this country are going to pay more to heat their homes this winter than they ever have before   The average heating bill may climb more than  600  and that comes on top of a record increase last winter   Without a doubt  this is going to be one of the most expensive winters on record         Millions of families  who simply need to heat their homes  are going to face prices they cannot afford   They will choose between medicine  food and warmth   To combat this impending crisis  we offered an amendment last week to fully fund the LIHEAP program at  5 1 billion     the level authorized in the energy bill which you signed into law   The amendment had support from across the country  and it was endorsed by the AARP because this is such an important issue for seniors living on a fixed income  Unfortunately  the amendment was defeated on procedural grounds        We are not giving up  however  and we will be joining Senators Reed  Collins  Snowe and others in offering the amendment again this week in the Senate  It   s true that we have received some bipartisan support for additional LIHEAP funding  Unfortunately  about the only message we   ve heard from the White House is politics        Last week  Secretary of Energy Bodman stated that the Administration does not intend to seek additional funding for LIHEAP   This week  it was reported that the White House is worried not about high energy prices  but about the politics of high energy prices  A key Republican strategist highlighted concerns about the rising heating costs on the mid term elections and even went so for as to call it  a sleeper issue     It   s time your Administration provides help       The  2 billion requested in your budget for fiscal year 2006 will not meet the needs of low income Americans given the energy crisis we know is coming  We write today to urge you to work with us  This isn   t just a debate about another political issue  It   s a debate about how we help working families pay to heat their homes this winter  It   s a debate about whether we force seniors to choose between prescription drugs and a warm home  And it   s a debate about whether or not we put politics aside and work together to provide the necessary  5 1 billion in LIHEAP assistance for America   s families        We hope you will join us in this bipartisan effort                                           Sincerely                                              John F  Kerry   Edward M  Kennedy
