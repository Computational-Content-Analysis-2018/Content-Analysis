John Kerry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              US Senator John F  Kerry is a Democrat from Massachusetts       PEOPLE SAY nothing is happening in Washington on healthcare  They say the only thing that has happened is that the crisis has gotten worse  They re right       But while Washington waits  Wall Street has acted  Too many big businesses are deciding that to compete and win in the global economy  many jobs no longer will come with healthcare       While companies such as  General Motors struggle under enormous healthcare obligations  companies such as  Wal Mart are opting out of employers  traditional healthcare responsibilities   Wal Mart currently insures fewer than half of its employees that s 800 000 workers left outside the system  some turning to Medicaid just to get healthcare at all  It s not right  but it shouldn t be a surprise  Good corporate citizens are coping with a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace  GM pays  1 500 in healthcare costs on every vehicle it manufactures   Toyota pays only  200       We re stuck with a 20th century healthcare system that just doesn t work for a 21st century economy       The traditional employer based healthcare system can no longer meet all our needs  Costs are too high  and businesses overseas are operating on a whole different playing field       Healthcare for a family of four now costs more than a minimum  wage worker earns in a year  Certainly  things have gotten worse  Under this administration s watch  the number of uninsured Americans has grown by 6 million and premiums are up a whopping 73 percent       This affects all of us  It matters if the kid down the block isn t immunized  It matters to your tax burden when simple  treatable illnesses turn into expensive emergency room visits often the only option for those without insurance  And it matters if we care about our moral obligation to others       We need to cut healthcare costs  And we need a healthcare system that ensures quality  affordable healthcare for every American man  woman  and child       We need big ideas and bold solutions  not more of timid Washington tinkering around the edges  If Americans can discover cures for the most devastating illnesses  we can surely find a way to make sure that all Americans benefit from those cures       Right now the most expensive 0 4 percent of insurance claims account for 20 percent of all healthcare costs  We need to lower costs to businesses with a new federal reinsurance plan for catastrophic care those with the most serious  and expensive  illnesses  Reinsurance is a simple concept  It s insurance for insurers  a way for health plans to manage their risks and lower your costs       Second  no child in America should lack health insurance  Leaving 11 million American children uninsured is wrong and  from the administration that brought us  No Child Left Behind   it is breathtakingly hypocritical       Most single moms raising two kids on  36 000 a year don t qualify for any help  My Kids First plan would change that  covering all children up to three times the poverty level       Finally  it is untenable for 35 million adults to go without insurance  We need to use every weapon in our arsenal until everyone is covered  including making the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program affordable and accessible for everyone in America with targeted tax credits for small businesses  middle class families  and people between jobs  Members of Congress give themselves great healthcare and give taxpayers the bill if it s good enough for senators and congressmen  it should be good enough for every American who wants to choose it       Doctors follow the motto  First do no harm   So should Washington  We don t want to reinvent the wheel on healthcare  we need to take what s already working for those of us who are lucky and make it work for the millions of Americans being passed by  And we need to improve quality and lower costs for those with coverage today       All of this and more could be paid for by simply repealing President Bush s cripplingly expensive tax cuts for those making more than  200 000 a year       Americans have a choice  If Congress won t fix healthcare  then Americans will fix Congress       It s time for Washington to act to free Americans from the fear of being one healthcare bill away from financial ruin  and leave our businesses more competitive and our kids a lot healthier  It s time for a national commitment to a healthcare system that can be a reflection of our ambitions and not an accident of our history
