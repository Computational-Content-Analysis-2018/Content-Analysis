Against Alito Nomination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Below is the transcript of Senator John Kerry   s remarks on the floor of the Senate today on Judge Samuel Alito   s nomination to serve as a Justice on the United States Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mr  President  let me begin by congratulating the Senator from Minnesota for an absolutely superb presentation of the arguments that are at stake in this choice the Senate faces   I think he has done a terrific job of summarizing a great many of those issues in the broad scope of those issues  and I particularly appreciate the last comments he made about the absence of unanimity and the divisions in the Senate over their vote             None of us should forget the debate Harriet Miers met with a storm of criticism    not from this side but from the other  from the right wing   In fact  she became more unacceptable to the Republicans because she did not make clear which ideological direction she would take the Court  rather than for the very broad based appeal she would pose to the country           So the reason we are here with this decision is not because of a choice we have made   It is because of a choice the President has made   It is because that   s the direction the President wants to move in   We have had countless opportunities in the Senate where we have had votes on nominees which have garnered 100 votes  98 votes  95  90   Anyone who is watching this understands that the Senate is divided on this nominee   At this pivotal moment in our country s history with the issues we face  that is not the way to tip the balance of the Court or to move the Court in an ideological direction           The critical question here is  Why are we so compelled to accept in such a rush a nominee who has so clearly been chosen for political and ideological reasons   That is the real question   Our job is to advise and consent   No one understands better than I do the consequences of an election and what happens when a President wins   I have heard colleagues say   Well  the President won   He has a right to make his choice   Yes  he does   And the choice he has made is an ideological choice to take the Court in a certain direction   That is his choice             Our choice depends on our rights as Senators and depends on what the Constitution tells us we should do in terms of giving advice and consent   My question to the Senate is  What is our advice with respect to the rights of a young person to be strip searched or with respect to people in their homes or with respect to a whole series of other critical things that define this country   What is the advice of the Senate in this year           These are not small issues to be expedited away by some kind of a symbolic timetable  a State of the Union Message   Our advice and consent ought to be weighed just as carefully and as importantly as the impact this choice is going to have on the Court for years to come   This is not the vote of Monday afternoon   This is a vote of history           Deciding on whether to confirm Judge Sam Alito to be an Associate Justice is one of the most important votes I will cast in the time I have been in the Senate because of what it means to the Court and to these critical choices            Confirming Judge Alito to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court would have irreversible consequences that are already defined if Senators will take the time to measure them             In my judgment  it will take the country backwards on critical issues   I will not talk about them all now  we do not have time   I know there is a pre agreement   I understand that  and I respect that             I am proud to join my friend  the senior Senator from Massachusetts  in taking a stand against this nomination   I know it is an uphill battle   I have heard many of my colleagues   I hear the arguments   Reserve your gunpowder for the future   What is the future if it changes so dramatically at this moment in time   What happens to those people who count on us to stand up and protect them now  not later  not at some future time             This is the choice for the Court now   I reject those notions that there ought to somehow be some political calculus about the future   This impact is going to be now   This choice is now   This ideological direction is defined now           This fight is not a fight for the short term   This is a fight over two very fundamentally different views about what defines us  what is appropriate in the relationship between government and citizen  and the right of our citizens to be free from unlawful government action   These are not just words   This is not something we just casually throw out there      Unlawful government action    is part of what motivated people to come here in the first place and to fight for what we love and cherish             I used to be a prosecutor  and I worked closely with police   I loved my work with the police   I respect the police   They do unbelievably dangerous work on behalf of our country every single day   They may walk into a home  into a dark corner  not knowing who is there or what evil awaits them   I understand that   I also understand when you assume that responsibility  you assume a responsibility to uphold the law  to uphold the Constitution  and to help protect people   That is part of the risk  part of what you take on                     What about the right to equal justice under the law   I heard one Senator the other day come to the Senate and say it isn t the job of a Supreme Court Justice to protect the downtrodden or the disenfranchised  it is their job to interpret the law   On countless occasions we all know the weight that comes to bear in that decision making process between powerful interests and those who do not have a voice   That is also part of what defines us   What makes America different from every country on the face of the Earth is that the average citizen can go into a courthouse in America and hold the most powerful corporation to account for their safety  for their livelihood  for their welfare   These are rights that Americans care about deeply             The importance of this choice is highlighted by focusing on the seat that this nominee has been chosen to replace            Look at Justice Sandra Day O Connor  a deciding vote  a vote that will likely be lost if Judge Alito takes her place   Look at the case of Grutter v  Bollinger  which held that State colleges and universities have the right to use affirmative action in their admission policies to increase educational opportunities for minorities and promote racial diversity on campuses             What about Tennessee v  Lane  which upheld the constitutionality of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act that required that courtrooms be physically accessible to the disabled   Or Rush Prudential HMO v  Moran  which upheld state laws giving people the right to a second doctor s opinion if their HMO tries to deny them treatment   That is a classic example of power against the powerless   It happens every day in America   An HMO decides  no  an individual citizen wants the coverage they think they got   Will they have the right to have the access on that             Hunt v  Cromarie  affirming the right of state legislatures to take race into account to secure minority voting rights and redistricting    we all know what has happened in this country  the challenge to the rights of minorities to vote   We still see it   As recently as in the last election we saw minorities denied opportunities to register  opportunities to have equal numbers of voting machines in their district   These are the things that define us           Brown v  Legal Foundation of Washington  which maintained the key source of funding for legal assistance for the poor  Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation v  EPA  which allowed the EPA to step in and take action to reduce air pollution under the Clean Air Act when a State conservation agency fails to act    there is not an American that doesn t understand we are going backwards with respect to air quality   What are the rights of the EPA going to be where Justice Sandra Day O Connor was the swing vote  5 4  the only one who held the line on the right of the EPA to do that             Steinberg v  Carhart  which overturned a State law that would have banned abortion as early as the 12th week of pregnancy without providing an exception to a woman s health    the list goes on   These are the issues which are at stake             Throughout his legal career    these are not things that are made up   These are defined by the writings  by the decisions  by the memoranda  by the speeches that Judge Alito has made   In each of those  in all of those  there is a startling lack of skepticism that is healthy in judges towards government power that infringes on individual rights and liberties   Professor Goodwin Liu of the University of Berkeley Law School concluded after analyzing those             Judge Alito    is less concerned about the government overreaching than Federal appeals judges nationwide  less concerned than Republican appointed appeals judges nationwide  and less concerned than his Republican appointed colleagues on the Third Circuit              Aren   t we going to be concerned that he is less concerned than those of the same stripe   Not only is his record outside the mainstream of the judicial spectrum  but    it is at odds with the Supreme Court s vital role in protecting privacy  freedom  and due process of law     That is Professor Liu           In 1984  for example  Judge Alito wrote a Justice Department memorandum concluding that the use of deadly force against a fleeing unarmed suspect did not violate the fourth amendment   The victim was a 15 year old African American   He was 5 foot 4   He weighed 100 to 110 pounds   This unarmed eighth grader was attempting to jump a fence with a stolen purse containing  10 when he was shot in the back of the head in order to prevent escape   The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals found the shooting unconstitutional because deadly force can only be used when there is    probable cause that the suspect poses a threat to the safety of the officers or a danger to the community if left at large      That is what we teach law enforcement officials                       But Judge Alito disagreed   Judge Alito said   No  he believed the shooting was reasonable because    the State is justified in using whatever force is necessary to enforce its laws     even deadly force   That is his conclusion   That is the standard that is going to go to the Supreme Court if ratified   It is OK to shoot a 15 year old  110 pounds  a 5 foot 4 inch kid who is trying to get over a fence with a purse  shoot him in the back of the head           Otherwise  Judge Alito believed that any suspect could evade arrest by making the State choose between killing them or letting them escape   That is the conclusion   Think about that   Judge Alito believed that the State could use whatever force was necessary to enforce its laws regardless of whether the suspect was armed or dangerous   Does the Chair believe that   Do the other Senators believe that   I don t think so   Do mainstream Americans believe that           Lucky for us  we did not have to answer that question   Why   Because in 1985  Justice White rejected Judge Alito s position  and the court held that deadly force is not justified    where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others      The court stated unequivocally     a police officer may not seize an unarmed  nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead              So Judge Alito is out of touch with mainstream jurisprudence with respect to the use of force in America   Becoming a Federal judge did not make Judge Alito any more protective of an American s personal privacy and freedoms when it comes to government intrusion   That ought to concern every conservative in this Nation   Every conservative in America ought to care about the government s power to just walk into your home  to intrude on the rights of individual Americans            In Baker v  Monroe Township  over a dozen local and Federal narcotics agents raided the apartment of Clement Griffin  just as his mother and her three children were arriving for a family dinner   Officers forced the family down to the ground  pointed guns at them  handcuffed and searched them   Two Reagan appointees to the court held that a jury should decide whether excessive force was used  but Judge Alito disagreed   He agreed that the search was    terrifying    and    most unfortunate      But he did not believe that the family had a right to make their case to a jury in court   He would have denied those American citizens  terrified as they were  their day in court             Judge Alito  I regret to say  often goes out of his way to justify excessive government actions   Many have talked in the Senate about Doe v  Groody  where Judge Alito  dissenting in an opinion by our current head of the Department of Homeland Security  then Judge Michael Chertoff  concluded that the strip search of a 10 year old girl was unreasonable   That was the conclusion of Judge Chertoff   Judge Alito concluded that the strip search of a 10 year old girl was reasonable            He reached this astonishing conclusion on a technicality   Rather than relying on the search warrant to determine whether the strip search of a child was authorized  Judge Alito argued that the court ought to look to the police officer s supporting affidavits             As a rule  however    now  I can say this as a former prosecutor because we used to labor over those warrants very carefully  knowing they were going to be scrutinized    affidavits are not part of the search warrants unless the trial judge decides they are   That    goes to the heart of the constitutional requirement that judges  not the police  authorize the warrants      But Judge Alito said   No  no  no  no  it is OK to go look behind what they were intending  and decided they must have intended to include the search of the entire family  including a 10 year old child   Is that the standard we want on the Court             Judge Alito s minimalist view of the fourth amendment s right to privacy is not limited to claims of excessive force   In United States v  Lee  he upheld the FBI s installation of a video and audio surveillance device in a hotel room in order to record conversations between the target of a bribery sting and a police informant   The FBI conducted the surveillance without a warrant  arguing  first  that the target had no expectation of privacy in a hotel room  and  second  that the device was turned on only when the informant was in the room   Judge Alito accepted the FBI s argument  and found no constitutional violation             His eagerness to buy the FBI s arguments  particularly in light of the Supreme Court decisions to the contrary  raises serious questions about how he would approach serious constitutional violations to the National Security Agency s program of domestic eavesdropping   Americans across the board are concerned about the violation of the law with respect to what we passed in the Congress overwhelmingly   After all  with the eavesdropping in Lee and the eavesdropping being conducted now  we see some startling similarity   Both are defended on the basis of Executive discretion and self restraint             The fourth amendment is not defined that way   It is defined by judicial restraint itself  not the Executive restraint  and by judicial review             We also should never forget  as we think about this issue  the words of an eminent Justice  Justice Brandeis  who said         Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government s purposes are beneficent    The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal  well meaning but without understanding             I believe that is what we need to protect ourselves against   That is what the Framers created the judiciary to do   And that is what I fear the record shows Judge Alito has not been willing to do             Now  if his judicial opinions and legal memoranda do not convince you of these things  you can take a look at the speech he gave to the Federalist Society in which  as a sitting judge  he    preached the gospel    of the Reagan Justice Department nearly 15 years after he left it  a speech in which he announced his support of the    unitary executive theory    on the grounds that it    best captures the meaning of the Constitution s text and structure                As Beth Nolan  former White House counsel to President Clinton  describes it             Unitary Executive    is a small phrase with almost limitless import   At the very least  it embodies the concept of Presidential control over all Executive functions  including those that have traditionally been exercised by    independent    agencies and other actors not subject to the President s direct control   Under this meaning  Congress may not  by statute  insulate the Federal Reserve or the Federal Election Commission   from Presidential control           Judge Alito believes you can   The phrase is also used to embrace expansive interpretations of the President s substantive powers  and strong limits on the Legislative and Judicial branches   This is the apparent meaning of the phrase in many of this Administration s signing statements            Now  most recently  one of those signing statements was used to preserve the President s right to just outright ignore the ban on torture that was passed overwhelmingly by the Congress   We had a long fight on this floor   I believe the vote was somewhere in the 90s  if I recall correctly   Ninety something said this is the intent of Congress  to ban torture   But the President immediately turned around and did a signing in which he suggested an alternative interpretation   And Judge Alito has indicated his support for that Executive power             During the hearings  Judge Alito attempted to convince the committee that the unitary executive theory is not about the scope of Presidential power   But that is just flat wrong   Not only does the theory read Executive power very broadly  but  by necessity  it reads congressional power very narrowly   In other words  as the President gains exclusive power over a matter  the Constitution withholds Congress s authority to regulate in that field   That is not  by any originalist interpretation  what the Founding Fathers intended             Let me give you a real life example  as described again by Beth Nolan          W hen the Reagan Administration undertook the covert arms for hostages operation that eventually grew into the Iran Contra scandal  it triggered the requirement of the National Security Act that the Administration provide Congress    timely notification    of the covert operation  Reading the phrase    timely notification    against the background of the unitary executive theory  the Justice Department stated     The President s authority to act in the field of international relations is plenary  exclusive  and subject to no legal limitations save those derived from the applicable provisions of the Constitution itself                                               According to Justice  under that interpretation  Congress s role in this matter was limited because its only constitutional powers in the area of foreign affairs were those that directly involved the exercise of legal authority over American citizens   Justice even qualified this statement  saying that by    American citizens    it meant    the private citizenry    and not the President or other executive officials   According to Ms  Nolan           I f such claims are taken seriously  then the President is largely impervious to statutory law in the areas of foreign affairs  national security  and war  and Congress is effectively powerless to act as a constraint against presidential aggrandizement in these areas             Does that sound familiar   It ought to sound familiar   The Bush Administration   s legal opinion on torture  the administration   s response to the McCain anti torture amendment  and the justifications given for the NSA s domestic spying program have all been based  in large part  on this exact same theory of the unitary executive             Given Judge Alito s history in the Reagan Justice Department  given his writings on the Third Circuit  given the year 2000 speech to the Federalist Society  a central question is whether you can trust that he  in fact  is going to protect the rights of the Congress and the legislative branch as well as those personal freedoms of individual Americans from those governmental intrusions            I believe the record says    no              Now  as I mentioned earlier  I know this is flying against some of the sort of political punditry of Washington   I understand that   But this is a fight worth making because it is a fight for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court of the United States  with a series of decisions that suggest a view    however brilliant a legal mind    he has a brilliant legal mind   I met with him   He is a nice fellow    we all understand that    well regarded by some people in the judicial system   He was looked at by the ABA   And they make a judgment based on sort of just legal decisions  not necessarily the ideological impact  the larger implication  all the other conditions that we need to consider as we give advice and consent             Perhaps Professor Liu of the Berkeley Law School put it best when he wrote this   He said         Judge Alito s record envisions an America where police may shoot and kill an unarmed boy to stop him from running away with a stolen purse  where federal agents may point guns at ordinary citizens during a raid  even after no sign of resistance  where the FBI may install a camera where you sleep on the promise that they won t turn it on unless an informant is in the room  where a black man may be sentenced to death by an all white jury for killing a white man  absent a multiple regression analysis showing discrimination  and where police may search what a warrant permits  and then some   This is not the America we know   Nor is it the America we aspire to be             So these are the reasons we need to take a hard look at what we are doing  even if it means swimming upstream   There are consequences to this nomination that I do not believe all the American people got out of the hearings because the hearings did not answer questions   And when you pose some of these choices to Americans  they come down on the side that I have described  being protected  not making those kinds of choices about a young kid  making sure that our privacy is protected             So for those reasons  and others I will discuss starting on Monday  I oppose Judge Alito s nomination   And I hope that colleagues  others  will join in that effort in the end             I yield the floor                                                                                          20510                                                                                                                                                                                          Contact           Sitemap
