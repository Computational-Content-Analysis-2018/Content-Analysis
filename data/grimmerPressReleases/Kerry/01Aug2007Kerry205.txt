Senator John Kerry made the following remarks on the floor of the Senate  Kerry introduced his amendment to fully fund SCHIP to  50 billion over 5 years  the level originally allocated in the budget  The additional  15 billion proposed by Kerrys amendment is paid for by rolling back the Bush tax cuts for those making more than  1 million a year and would impact only two tenths of one percent of taxpayers  Kerrys amendment is supported by ACORN  American Academy of Nursing  American Academy of Pediatrics  American Federation of Labor Congress of Industrial Organizations  Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs  American Medical Student Association  Child Neurology Society  Child Welfare League of America  Childrens Defense Fund  Childrens Dental Health Project  The

Behavioral Health  National Association of County and City Health Officials  National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners  PICO National Network  SEIU and Voices for Americas Children  Below are Kerrys remarks as prepared for delivery  First  Id like to extend a much deserved thank you to my colleagues on the Finance Committee  Senators Baucus  Grassley  Rockefeller  and Hatch  who have shown such tremendous leadership in bringing this bill to the floor this week  This legislation is good for our nations children  Though I hope we can come together to do more  I will support this bill  And as we debate the future of childrens health care today  I want to honor the work of Senator Kennedy  whose visionary leadership helped create S CHIP in 1997 and whose tireless bridge building has helped sustain the program ever since  Mr  President  This week  Washington has a great opportunity to extend health insurance to millions of children who lack coverage today  Our choices here will have a major impact on families across the country  The real face of this debate doesnt belong to a Senator or the President or a health care bureaucrat somewhere it belongs to people like 9 year old Alexsiana Lewis and her mother Dedra  from Springfield  Massachusetts  Alexsiana was losing her vision due to a rare eye disease  and her mother Dedra lost her health insurance when she cut back her hours to care for her daughter  Listen to what Dedra said  If I didnt have MassHealth right now S CHIP funded health caremy daughter would be blind  Do we really want to leave children to go blind  Do we really want to leave our families hoping to dodge a bullet  one that comes in the form of an illness they cant afford to treat or a doctors bill they cant afford to pay  At a moment when people across the country are losing faith in Washington  this is a moment for this Democratic Congress to remind the voters why they sent us here  to deliver on our promises and get things done that improve the lives of Americas families  We should be building on the success of a wildly popular bipartisan program like the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  And  outside of the Administration  Republicans and Democrats alike  in overwhelming numbers support spending more money on childrens health  This should be easyand the proposal reported out of the Finance Committee represents a solid start toward addressing the moral and economic injustice of leaving 9 million children uninsured in the richest country in the world  It also includes a provision I authored with Senators Smith  Kennedy  and Domenici to ensure mental health parity in the S CHIP program  Parity for mental health treatment is a significant  much needed improvement to S CHIP  Instead of discriminating against mental healthwhich is effectively what were doing nowwe can offer services that improve childrens performance in school  keep them out of trouble and the juvenile justice system  and lead to better lives filled with greater opportunity and promise  This is a good investmentit can literally transform a young persons life  The bill has many good and important provisionsbut  35 billion over five years is far too little for such an important national priority  I believe that we must fight for a better option  and I ask my colleagues today to support an amendment Im offering that would add  50 billion to S CHIP and Medicaid over the next 5 years  How do we pay for it  Well  we pay for the  35 billion in the current bill by raising federal taxes on cigarettes to one dollar per pack  This tax itself will save adults lives as well as childrensand  by reducing smoking related illnesses  it will as well save our states money  How do we pay for the extra  15 billion that I propose we spend  By rolling back tax cuts for those earning more than a million dollars a year  Were presenting Congress with a simple and obvious choice  tax cuts for millionaires or insurance for over a million uninsured children  If we  as senators  dont stand for insuring every child in America  then what do we stand for  If America can spend  10 billion each month in Iraq  surely we can also spend  10 billion each year on childrens health  I would like to be able to tell a father in Fall River who was laid off when the Quake Fabric Plant closed that his child matters to us here in Washington  Id like to be able to tell a Farmer in Hadley who is barely scraping by that his child deserves access to health care too  Meanwhile  the President is threatening to veto the new money for S CHIPeven at  35 billion  When it comes to insuring all of Americas children  Congress and the White House should not be offering the voters a choice between doing too little and doing nothing at all  Troublingly  this President has recently launched a disinformation campaign to denounce this bill as a larger Democratic strategy or plot to massively expand federalized medicine  He stubbornly pledged to veto this bill   before he had even read it  Apparently  confronted with a bipartisan compromise to extend health care coverage to half of the 9 million American children without insurance today  the president sees only a vast  left wing conspiracy  The S CHIP program is not some Democratic plot to socialize  or federalize medicine  First off  S CHIP  like Medicaid before it  is a federal state partnership  Using partial funding from Washington  each state has broad flexibility in how it structures and implements its S CHIP program  Another misleading statement weve heard is that S CHIP is a Democratic Trojan Horse for socialized medicineOf course its not  It was passed in 1997 by a Republican Congress run by Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott  working with President Clinton  Since 1997  when Senators Kennedy and Hatch worked across the aisle to launch this program  more Republican Governors have implemented and expanded S CHIP than Democrats  If S CHIP is a Democratic plot  then why do so many Republican governors support it  Take Indiana  for example  The Republican governor  Mitch Daniels   Bushs former budget chief   recently expanded eligibility for S CHIP to 300  of the federal poverty level  or roughly  60 000 for a family of four  The President claims that new S CHIP funding would push families like these from private insurance to government health care  But Mitch Daniels and other Republican governors understand that simply isnt the case for most families  With the cost of private insurance for that same family approaching  12 000 per year  the real choice most eligible families face is this  S CHIP or no health care at all  In fact  the National Governors Association just this past week sent yet another bipartisan letter to the President stating their support for the bipartisan reauthorization bill that provides increased funding for S CHIP now moving through the Senate  And finally  S CHIP is not government run health care  either  The vast majority of S CHIP and Medicaid enrollees receive their coverage through private insurance plans working under contract with the states to administer benefits  Far from socialized medicine  S CHIP represents the type of common sense public private partnership that should be a model for broader health care reform  Mr  President  we all know what matters to families in this debate  For parents  nothing is more important than the health of their children  and nothing more frightening than the fear that when a child gets sick  a visit to the doctor is out of reach  Our families are scared they wont have adequate care for their kids  and what is this Presidents response  He says  well  everyone has access to health carejust send your kids to the emergency room  Hospitalized children without health insurance are twice as likely to die from their injuries as those with coverage  and uninsured kids are only half as likely to receive any medical care in a given year  Is there anyone here who has ever been responsible for caring for a child  who honestly thinks this is a good way to do business  To ask the least well off among us to get their basic health care in the emergency room  Our families are afraid that their children are vulnerable  But what is the President worried about  Tobacco companies and HMOs  Hes threatening to veto this bill because hes afraid that insuring a million more children will move a fraction of them from private insurance to government financed programs  the so called crowd out effect  I find that strange given that economists estimate that nearly 80  of the benefits from the Presidents health tax proposal would go to those who already have insurance  Not to mention that experts estimate that the rate of crowd out in the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan is up to two thirds  Ultimately  this decision boils down to a question of prioritiesnot ideology  as the President would have you believe  Washington politicians like to talk about values  but heres a simple test of who actually values families  how much is it worth to you to insure every child in America  The President says he has made his decision  but I urge him to reconsider a deeply misguided veto of legislation that would help Americas children  This is also a test for Democrats  We must not bend to pressure from the White House or from special interests  We must not be afraid to spend the money necessaryand I believe thats no less than  50 billionto enroll millions of children who lack insurance today  I realize that Senators Baucus and Rockefeller negotiated the best bipartisan package they could  and I commend them for doing sobut its just not enough  I believe we have come up short on the amount of additional money we are investing in S CHIP and Medicaidwhich means we are also coming up short on the number of low income children who can receive life changing health insurance coverage  And that is simply unacceptable  We can  and we should  be investing at least  50 billion  15 billion more than the Finance Committees packagethe amount we agreed upon just a few short months ago in our bipartisan budget resolution  The best way to finance those extra  15 billion is to roll back the top rate cuts for people making over a million dollars a year  As I recall  those people did pretty well back in the 1990sbefore the Bush tax cuts took effect  What do those additional  15 billion buy  Coverage for more than 1 million additional low income  uninsured children  The current package reaches 3 3 million uninsured kids  but my amendment raises that number to approximately half of the 9 million children lacking insurance today  This amendment helps states enroll the lowest income uninsured children by increasing bonus payments available to states that meet or surpass their enrollment targets  This new investment is aimed at the poorest of the uninsured  those eligible forbut not yet enrolled inMedicaid  The President says he is concerned that the government is stealing clients from private insurance  But what about these low income kids  These children truly have no other option  This body has allotted a great deal of moneyin the form of tax breaks  spending provisions  and wasteful spending left intactto various causes  some more noble than others  And so I repeat  this is a matter of priorities  and what is more important than childrens health  If Alternative Minimum Tax relief is extended  tax cuts for those with cash income of  1 million  that will cost  43 billion in 2007 alone  Compare that with  10 billion each year for S CHIP    Weve refused to close a loophole in our tax on poor fuel economy that rewards gas guzzling SUV manufacturers with  13 billion annually    Unless we reform Medicare Advantage  a program I support by the way  we will overpay private plans by more than  50 billion over the next five years  require traditional Medicare beneficiaries to subsidize those in Medicare Advantage  and reduce Medicare solvency by two years    My amendment is fully paid for  in accordance with PAYGO  by restoring the top marginal tax rate to pre 2001 levels on taxable income in excess of  1 million  This would impact just two tenths of one percent of taxpayers with positive tax liability  The President hasnt always talked this way about childrens health care  In 2004  when this President accepted his partys nomination at the 2004 Republican Convention  he said  in a new term  we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for government health insurance programs  We will not allow a lack of attention  or information  to stand between these children and the health care they need  Today the President opposes more funds for S CHIP and Medicaid  yet supports continuing overpayments to private plans in Medicare  He says hes standing on principle  but it just defies logic  What principle could justify standing in the way of providing health coverage to a million more American children  Today the president calls a  35 billion investment in childrens health care a massive expansion of federalized medicine  I call it a good start  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Bingaman  Sanders  Casey  Menendez  Durbin  Reed of Rhode Island  Brown  and Whitehouse who have cosponsored this amendment  and the dozens of national organizations who have endorsed it  including health care providers  child and family advocates  labor  and faith based networks  from ACORN to Voices for Americas Children  I urge my colleagues to make a bipartisan down payment of no less than  50 billion toward heath care coverage for all of our children
