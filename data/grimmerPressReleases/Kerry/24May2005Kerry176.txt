                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  THE REPUBLICAN leadership s  nuclear option  would eliminate the filibuster and turn the Senate into a rubber stamp for even the most controversial of President Bush s judicial nominations  The arguments can seem obscure  but there will be consequences for all of us         The Bush administration s new plan on mercury pollution  for example  illustrates the importance of maintaining a strong and independent judiciary  Mercury is a potent neurotoxin harmful to fetuses  and infants  nervous systems         Frighteningly  one in six American women carries enough accumulated mercury to potentially harm her children  Mercury has been linked to developmental disabilities such as autism  and researchers suspect a connection with cardiovascular disease in adult men         The Bush administration does not seem particularly concerned with the mercury threat and proposes rolling back current law and allowing more of this toxic chemical to stay in the environment  The administration s corporate driven plan does too little  too late to protect our families and our communities  Their plan may also violate environmental and health laws         Eleven state attorneys general  including Tom Reilly  recognize that mercury pollution presents a danger to the public health and have taken the only course of action available to stop the president s harmful plan  filing suit in federal court         This is exactly why the federal courts exist and why an independent and fair minded judiciary matters  Our courts are obligated to objectively review actions like the mercury plan to ensure consistency with federal law and our Constitution  The courts are a vital check on abuse of power from Washington  If the Republican leadership triggers its nuclear option  the administration will gain unprecedented power over the selection of federal judges and leave our democracy in a weaker position         Imagine  for example  that the mercury challenge came before Janice Rogers Brown  who has been nominated to the very court set to hear the mercury case  Justice Brown has little faith in government s ability to do good  calling our government a  leviathan  that is  crushing everything in its path   She called New Deal programs such as Social Security  the triumph of our own socialist revolution   Her legal views are hostile to bedrock laws that protect public health  workplace safety  and our environment         Or consider what might happen when a critical environmental case comes before William Myers  another of Bush s controversial nominees  Myers called environmental laws  outright  top down coercion  and has criticized  the fallacious belief that centralized government can promote environmentalism   Myers has repeatedly voiced his extreme opposition to almost any environmental  protection based on an activist interpretation of the Constitution         It s hard to see how Attorney General Reilly or any citizen concerned with mercury pollution would get a fair hearing before Myers or Justice Brown  Both seem ready to set precedent and fact aside to promote their personal political agenda         The filibuster fight is more than a beltway battle  The very foundation of our government an effective system of checks and balances is at stake  Over 200 years ago James Madison warned us   The accumulation of all powers  legislative   executive  and judiciary  in the same hands  whether of one  a few  or many  and whether hereditary  self appointed  or elective  may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny   We must remember that warning  and remember that the greatest strength and virtue of our democracy is the protection it provides to the minority         If the Republican leadership gets its way  America will lose the protection of a strong  independent judiciary for the first time in history  In 1937  President Roosevelt attempted a court packing scheme to assert his influence on the courts  His own party said no  Thomas Jefferson once attempted to impeach a Supreme Court justice who disagreed with his political agenda  His own party said no  I hope some Republican senators look at history and find the courage to speak truth to power in defense of our democracy                                                                           20510
