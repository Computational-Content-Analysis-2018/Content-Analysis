                                                                                                                                                                       Annie Aumueller  25  a nursing student at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell  typifies thousands of college students across the state  When she graduates  she   ll have thousands of dollars of debt  Paying for college is    hard  It   s really hard  For a self supporting college student  I have rent  a car payment  car insurance     that   s all in addition to my educational expenses     she said           Unfortunately stories like Annie   s are all too common  Too many young people  from all walks of life  are either struggling to pay for college or flat out can   t afford it  Those who aren   t able to incur such steep costs are not only losing out on a degree  but setting themselves up to face a lifetime of lost opportunities  as study after study shows college graduates make more money and can get hired for the fastest growing and best paying jobs of tomorrow     According to an analysis released last month by the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education  more than two thirds of families in Massachusetts last year still required approximately  6300 beyond financial aid to afford a college education  Faced with such a hardship  many students drop out  saying the costs are too steep  Those who do complete their degrees are often saddled with thousands of dollars in student loans  which can take years  often decades  to pay off  In today   s competitive workforce  a college education is more important than ever  But thanks to skyrocketing tuition and student loan interest rates  it is becomingly increasingly out of reach for millions of America   s youth     many of them right here in Massachusetts     A college education means more than ever in today   s economy  yet the administration in Washington  which promised to leave no child behind  has done nothing to make college more affordable for young people  In fact  President Bush recently broke his famous 1999 promise to veto ANY tax increase by signing into law a tax cut bill which TRIPLES the tax rates for teenagers with college savings funds  The wealthiest Americans once again received a fat check in the mail courtesy of the federal government  while students who scrimped and saved for college are picking up the taxpaying slack  That   s not leadership  That   s failure on the part of a president who is out of touch and out of credibility  This president   s priorities are dead wrong  and it   s young Americans  like Gina  who are paying the price     While the government continues to spend billions of dollars on the war in Iraq and tax cuts for the ultra rich  the average student loan debt is approaching  20 000 and the loan interest rate has reached a six year high  It is time for us to have the courage to stand up and say that it should be a right     not a privilege     to have access to a four year college education  For America to compete and win in the global economy  we need an educated  skillful workforce ready to meet the demands of the 21st century  Making college education affordable for all is nothing less than an investment in our country   s future     There   s a lot of rhetoric on this subject from politicians of every stripe  but few solutions  Education is one of those issues that provokes feel good sound bites on the campaign trail  but is quickly tossed off to the side after the election to be forgotten for another four years  It   s time that Washington stop paying lip service to our children   s future and start taking real steps to make college education as universal as a high school diploma  That   s why I   ve proposed a four point plan to put college within reach for every American family     First  the government must help at risk students prepare for college  Too often  underprivileged youth are not prepared  academically or socially  for attending college  This must change  The government should create    I Have a Dream    scholarships which would provide  1000 for students to participate in an early intervention program to help prepare them for college  These scholarships would be similar to the Gear Up  Trio  Hoop Dreams or High Hope programs  No young person should be denied the dream of a college education because of their economic background     I Have a Dream    scholarships would help make that dream a reality for underprivileged youth     Second  the government should help students pay for college by creating the    College Opportunity Tax Credit    program  Instead of raising taxes on college bound youth  as President Bush has  the program would provide a tax credit for the first  4000 paid in tuition for every year of college  Students who give back to their community would be rewarded under the    Service for College    program  which would pay for the cost of four years of a public college or university in exchange for two years of community service  Students would enrich themselves and their communities through public service while at the same time earning an education     Third  the government must also help ensure that students remain enrolled and graduate from college  The    State Tax Relief and Education Fund    would provide fiscal relief to cash strapped states to stop tuition increases and higher education budget cuts  Through this fund  universities would be able to operate without the threat of state budget cuts and therefore provide a higher level of service and academic quality to their students  Through this program  colleges would be able to provide more funds for counseling and support services to keep students in college      Fourth  it   s time to renew America   s sense of service and offer young people an unbeatable deal  It   s as simple as this  if you promise to serve for two years in one of America   s toughest and most important jobs  like day care providers or teachers in low income communities  the government will cover four years of tuition at a typical public university  It   s a win win deal for all parties in involved  Students get a free education     and we get well educated graduates willing to work in some of our most critical fields     These are all simple  common sense solutions we can implement today to make college a reality for all Americans  Annie knows the importance of a college education and is doing everything within her power to make it a reality for herself  It   s time we step up to help Annie  and students like her    In 1957  after the launch of Sputnik  Americans were concerned that our national scientific education standards couldn   t keep pace with the Soviet Union  In response  the government poured money into funding science and math education in order to close the    technology gap     Once again  we are at a crossroads  and the decisions we make now will determine whether America remains a global leader in commerce  science  technology and the arts  It   s time for us to take action and ensure that our youth can afford the education and skills they need to succeed in today   s world  The very future of America is at stake  since our ability to compete in the economy of tomorrow depends on our ability to secure skills and training today
