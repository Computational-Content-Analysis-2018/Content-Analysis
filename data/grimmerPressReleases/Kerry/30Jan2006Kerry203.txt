Alito Nomination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Below are Senator Kerry   s remarks as prepared for delivery on the floor of the Senate today on Judge Samuel Alito   s nomination to serve as a Justice on the United States Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Mr  President  On countless nominations Democrats have joined Republicans and Republicans have joined Democrats to send a judicial nomination to the floor with a powerful  bipartisan vote   Chief Justice Roberts came to the floor 13 5   Justice Breyer came to the floor unanimously   Justice Ginsburg came to the floor unanimously   Justice Breyer won on the floor 87 9   Justice Ginsburg 97 3  and Chief Justice Roberts 78 22         But  in this case  Judge Alito comes to the floor in a straight party line  particularly divided vote   In a divided country  at a time of heightened partisan tensions  at a time of ideology often trumping common sense or broad public interest  the President has chosen to send a Supreme Court nominee who comes directly out of a revolt by the ideological wing of his party in order to satisfy their demand for ideological orthodoxy         Some people obviously delight in that   We   ve read about that today in the New York Times   And that is their right   But most don   t   Most don   t think that is the way to pick a Supreme Court Justice  It doesn   t mean it   s good for the country   It doesn   t mean it fills our current needs  and it doesn   t mean it is even the right thing to do           As we approach this nominee  we can   t forget that he was not the President   s first choice   His first choice was Harriet Miers  and opposition to her nomination came not from Democrats but from the far right of the Republican Party   They challenged her ideological purity with such conviction that the President capitulated to their demands and gave them Judge Alito instead   a nominee who they received with gleeful excitement           Jerry Falwell    applaud ed     his appointment   Ed Whelan called it    a truly outstanding nomination      Rush Limbaugh called the nomination    fabulous      Ann Coulter and Pat Buchanan raved about how it would upset liberals   This right wing reaction can only mean one thing  they know what kinds of opinions Judge Alito will issue   opinions in line with their extreme ideology           All of this is to be contrasted with the standard set out by Justice Potter Stewart   He said    the mark of a good judge is a judge whose opinions you can read and       have no idea if the judge was a man or a woman  Republican or Democrat  a Christian or Jew       You just know that he or she was a good judge              What he is saying is not really limited to the status of religion  gender  or politics  or any other trait by which we categorize people   He is saying that a good judge through all their decisions shows no discernible pattern of identity that pigeonholes that judge except for the purity of their legal reasoning  their genuinely open minded approach to judging         But in Judge Alito we do see patterns   patterns which demonstrate a bias towards the powerful  patterns which demonstrate a lack of skepticism towards government overreaching  and patterns which demonstrate a hostility to the disadvantaged and the poor   This doesn   t mean that Judge Alito never rules in favor of an individual suing the government for an unlawful search or a minority suing a corporation for unlawful discrimination   But it does mean that in the overwhelming majority of cases he has not   And this raises the question of whether he approaches each case with an open mind or whether he comes with a bias that can only be overcome in the rarest of circumstances           So why should the debate on Judge Samuel Alito continue now  Well  to begin with  there hasn   t been that much debate on this nomination in the first place   a nomination of extraordinary consequence   in the first place   It came to the floor on Wednesday the 25th  and cloture was filed the very next day on Thursday   To this moment  not more than 25 Democratic Senators have had a chance to speak   At this time  the Senate has spent a total of 25 hours on a nomination that will last a lifetime          The direction our country will take for the next thirty years is being set now and this is the time for debate   This is the time when it counts   Not after the Supreme Court has granted the executive the right to use torture  or to eavesdrop without warrants   Not after a woman   s right to privacy has been taken away   Is history going to care what we say after the courthouse door is slammed in the faces of women  minorities  the elderly  the disabled  and the poor   No   Except to wonder why we didn   t do more when we knew what was coming         Obviously  I   ve heard some people try to argue that exercising our rights is    obstructionist      But did people suggest it was obstructionism when the extreme right wing of the Republican part scuttled the nomination of Harriet Miers   How many times have we heard our colleagues come to the floor and demand that judicial nominees get an up or down vote   She never got an up or down vote   She never even got a hearing   Yet  a minority in the Republican Party was able to stop a nominee that they considered unfit for the Supreme Court          It is hardly obstructionist to use  as the former chair of the Judiciary Committee Senator Hatch described it     one of the few tools that the minority has to protect itself and those the minority represents      That is exactly what we are doing here   That   s why we have the United States Senate and the rules we live by  We are protecting basic rights and freedoms that are important to every American  privacy  equality  and justice           It   s important to remember that the rights we are expressing concern about didn   t come easily   Access to the court house  civil rights  privacy rights  voting rights  anti discrimination laws   all of these were hard fought for   They came with bloodshed and loss of life   Their achievement required courage and determination   None of these basic rights were written into law without a fight  and still today it requires constant vigilance to make sure they are enforced and maintained   That commitment for vigilance is one of the characteristics that should leap out in a Supreme Court nominee             We should remember that even though the 13th  14th  and 15th Amendments outlawed slavery  provided for equal protection under the law  guaranteed citizenship  and protected the right to vote for African American Americans  the fact is the federal government took very little action to enforce them until the 1960   s   Few politicians were willing to take a stand   to fight for the rights of African Americans   Something besides grass roots pressure was ultimately needed to prompt the Congress into action   That something was the unanimous Supreme Court decision in Brown v  Board of Education         Imagine if the Court had not enforced the equality guaranteed by the 14th Amendment   Imagine if it still had the ideological outlook it had when Plessy as decided   Or when Dredd Scott was decided   Two of the most ideologically driven   and regrettable   decisions ever   Segregation would still be a fact of life   African American children would be forced to attend their own schools  would be receiving an inferior and inadequate education   And  there would have been no catalyst to start the civil rights movement           So a vote for a Supreme Court nominee is in fact a vote for those rights and freedoms we care about and fight for   That is exactly what this vote is           There is no question in anyone   s mind that Samuel Alito will have a profound impact on the Supreme Court   This is a pivotal moment in history for the Court   You only need to look at his past opinions to know that much         Let me share with you the story of David D  Chittister   On February 14  1997  David requested sick leave from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development  where he worked   He was granted leave  but approximately ten weeks later  his leave was revoked  and he was fired   David knew that the Family Medical Leave Act guaranteed him twelve weeks of sick leave  So  he sued the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development for firing him during that time           Put yourself in David   s shoes   Imagine that you become sick   You become so sick that you are hospitalized  completely unable to work   The only reason that you can afford your treatment is because you are still employed   And above all you believe that you are protected by the Family Medical Leave Act          Now imagine that Judge Alito is on the Supreme Court   He is one of the nine voices that gets to decide whether the Family Medical Leave Act is constitutional   And he votes the way he did on the Third Circuit  invalidating that part of the Family Medical Leave Act which guarantees an individual twelve weeks of sick leave and applies to you   You are out of luck as you face mounting medical bills without any source of income         This is not hypothetical  That is the decision he made  Health care is a very real problem for many more Americans than ever   Many of us have been pushing for a national approach to health care for years   Our citizens can   t get the sick leave they need to take care of themselves   They cannot get adequate health insurance   coverage isn   t what it should be   The Family Medical Leave Act was a step in the right direction to deal with family values and health needs   It made sure that people could take the time they needed when they became seriously ill without losing their income   It was enacted with overwhelming bi partisan support in a 71 27 vote   But if Judge Alito were on the Supreme Court and he follows his own precedent  it would no longer protect state employees         So I ask my colleagues who voted for the Family Medical Leave Act  didn   t we do exactly want we meant to do   Didn   t we need to protect all workers   So is it right  now  to put a person on the Supreme Court who will undo the good that we did with that legislation           Take another example   Many of us have talked on the floor about how Judge Alito routinely defers to excessive government power   And how he is willing to overlook clear Fourth Amendment violations in the process   This may seem abstract to a lot of people right now  but listen to the facts of this case         A family of farmers  the Mellotts  fell on hard times   They had to declare bankruptcy and were ordered to leave their farm   like a lot of farmers these days   They asked for permission to appeal and were denied   They asked that the judge be disqualified and were denied   They didn   t accept the eviction order and refused to leave their farm   So the marshals were sent to evict them         When Bonnie Mellott answered the front door  a deputy marshal entered  pointed his gun    right in her face     pushed her into a chair  and kept his gun aimed at her for the remainder of the eviction   Another deputy entered     pumped a round into the barrel    of his sawed off shotgun  pointed it at Wilkie Mellott  and told him    to sit still  not move and to keep his mouth shut      When he did this  the marshals knew Wilkie Mellott was recovering from heart surgery           But that wasn   t all   Another marshal ran into the kitchen where a guest was on the telephone with a local sheriff   He    pumped    his semi automatic gun  stuck it right in  her  face and     said     Who are you talking to  hang up the phone     When she continued talking  the marshal put his gun    to the back of her head    and repeated the order           I won   t go into further details  but you get the picture   Now obviously the Mellotts were in the wrong to stay in their farm   They were ordered by the court to leave  and they should have   We all understand that           But there is no fact in evidence suggesting that once the marshals got in the house there was resistance   no facts suggesting there was need for force or intimidation   Nothing justified running into a house  waiving sawed off shotguns and screaming at the occupants   These folks weren   t criminals   They weren   t armed   They weren   t resisting arrest   You know what  it   s tough enough to get kicked off your property  it is another thing to be treated like a felon  absent cause  with pumped shotguns shoved in your face  Most reasonable people would conclude that the government   s actions were excessive   But Judge Alito did not  and he wrote the majority opinion for two of the three judges hearing the case calling the law enforcement conduct reasonable   The dissenting judge disagreed   He said that once the marshals arrived and realized that the Mellotts were neither armed nor dangerous  the use of force was    clearly not objectively reasonable            Where do you come out on this   Which view do you want on our Supreme Court         Let me also share with another story   this one about Beryl Bray   Beryl was an African American female who worked her way up from a room attendant to a Housekeeping manager for Marriott Hotels in less than three years   When the position of Director of Services opened up  Beryl applied   A Caucasian woman got the job  and Beryl sued claiming discrimination           Now  as a Housekeeping manager  Beryl probably did not make a lot of money   She probably used a lot of her resources to bring her discrimination claim   She wanted her day in court   If Judge Alito had his way  she wouldn   t have gotten it   Critical facts were in dispute   Facts which  if resolved as Beryl claimed they should be  would establish a clear case of discrimination   As the lawyers here know  the factual disputes should have been resolved by a jury of her peers   Beryl was entitled to her day in court   Judge Alito  however  did not agree   He would have resolved the facts on his own in favor of Marriott hotels   He would have ended the case then and there          Or let   s talk about Harold Glass   Mr  Glass worked at Philadelphia Electric Company  o PECO as it is known  for 23 years before he retired   While working full time  Harold attended school to improve his career opportunities   Over the years  he earned two Associate Degrees  a Bachelor of Science in Degree in Industrial and Management Engineering and a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering           In addition to his full time work and continuing education  Harold was a long time activist on behalf of PECO employees   In 1968  he helped organize the Black Grievance Committee to respond to problems of racial fairness  including inadequate representation of minorities by PECO   s uncertified labor organization   He served as an officer   He represented employees in handling routine individual grievances before management and negotiated with management about employee concerns   In addition  he took the lead in organizing witnesses in three legal actions against PECO concerning racially discriminatory employment practices          Over the years  Harold applied for promotions to new positions  but each time he was rejected   In addition  he was not able to apply for positions he would have liked to have because they were never posted by the company   This despite the fact that  in 23 years of employment with PECO  Harold received only one performance evaluation which was less than fully satisfactory   when he was serving as a junior technical assistant   Harold claimed that racial harassment at that time from his co workers and a hostile work environment had affected his job   But the trial judge did not allow him to demonstrate these facts           On appeal  a divided three judge panel reversed the trial judge   s decision   Two of Judge Alito   s colleagues believed that Mr  Glass should have been allowed to present the evidence of racial discrimination to the jury   Judge Alito  however  disagreed   He thought that allowing Mr  Glass to tell his side of the story might cause    substantial unfair prejudice      He called the trial judge   s refusal to allow Mr  Glass   s evidence    harmless              Harmless   Was it harmless to Mr  Glass  What do you think   Do you think its harmless error to keep a discrimination plaintiff from showing evidence of discrimination   I think most reasonable people would disagree with Judge Alito           I believe that   s the problem here  Judge Alito has demonstrated a pattern of looking at discrimination claims with a high degree of skepticism   In the dozens of employment discrimination cases involving race that Judge Alito has participated in  he ruled in favor of African Americans on the merits in only two instances   He has never authored a majority opinion favoring African Americans in such cases    He has dissented from rulings in of his colleagues in favor of African American plaintiffs  and in doing so has required an unrealistic amount of evidence before he is willing to step in on behalf of wronged individuals   He is not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt   even to just let a jury decide their case           This is an unacceptable view of the way our country works   Americans know that what sets us apart from almost any other country is the right of any citizen no matter where they come from  what their lot in life is to have their day in court   That is what makes American special   This little guy can hold the big corporations accountable          Our nation is defined by the great struggle of individuals to earn and protect their rights   particularly the disadvantaged   We have worked hard to ensure that no one is denied their civil rights   Judge Alito   s track record casts serious doubt on his commitment to that struggle   The legislation we pass protecting individuals against discrimination requires the courts to fully enforce it   And we just don   t keep faith with ourselves if we empower individuals to sue large corporations who act unlawfully and then have the courts refuse to hold them accountable           Judge Alito   s hostility to civil rights claims is not my observation alone   It is an observation shared by many people who have reviewed his record   Let   s not forget that after reviewing more than 400 of Judge Alito   s opinions  law professors at Yale Law School   Judge Alito   s alma matter   concluded that         In the area of civil rights law  Judge Alito consistently has used procedural and evidentiary standards to rule against female  minority  age and disability claimants      Judge Alito seems relatively willing to defer to the claims of employers and the government  over those advancing civil rights claims            That   s the opinion of those who have studied his record   Similarly  Knight Ridder concluded that Judge Alito    has worked quietly but resolutely to weave a conservative legal agenda into the fabric of the nation   s laws    and that he    seldom sided with       an employee alleging discrimination or consumers suing big business              Judge Alito may believe that it is his duty to keep these types of cases away from the jury   He may  and in fact probably does  believe that he is doing the right thing   That is his right   But  it is my right to judge the facts of these cases and disagree   It is my right to say that the record of his reaction to the same facts should not be elevated to the Supreme Court           Mr  President  a fair amount has been said about Judge Alito   s endorsement of the unitary executive theory   This is a complicated and somewhat abstract theory of Constitutional interpretation  but if it is ever endorsed by a majority of the Court  it will have a significant practical impact on our every day lives         What it says is that the President alone is responsible for enforcing the laws   At its most simplistic  it seems somewhat reasonable  Congress makes the laws  the President enforces the laws  and the judiciary interprets the laws   The theory  in fact  dates back to the administration of Franklin Roosevelt  and it has been championed by liberal and conservative scholars and administrations as a way of asserting the President   s ability to retain control over independent agencies   But  use of the theory in recent times has been changing         During Judge Alito   s tenure  the Reagan Administration developed new uses for the theory   It was used to support claims of limitless presidential power in the area of foreign affairs   including the actions that became the Iran Contra affair   And  this view of presidential power has been carried on by the current Bush Administration  claiming in Presidential signing statements  that the President can ignore anti torture legislation overwhelmingly passed here in Congress   Not only is the substance of that message incredible  but the idea that the President can somehow alter Congressional intent   the meaning of legislation agreed upon by 100 Senators   with a single flick of a pen is absolutely ludicrous   It turns the meaning of legislative intent on its head            In the hearings  Judge Alito attempted to downplay the significance of this theory by saying it did not address the scope of the power of the executive branch  but rather  addressed the question of who controls the executive branch  Don   t be fooled by that explanation   The unitary executive theory has everything to do with the scope of executive power           In fact  even Stephen Calabresi  one of the fathers of the theory  has stated that     t he practical consequence of this theory is dramatic      Its just common sense that if the unitary executive theory means that the President can ignore laws that Congress passes  it necessarily expands the scope of Presidential power   and reduces the scope of Congress   s         Judge Alito had numerous opportunities in the hearings to define the limits of the unitary executive  but he refused to answer my colleagues    questions   He didn   t answer when Senator Leahy asked him whether it would be constitutional for the Congress to prohibit Americans from using torture   He didn   t answer when Senator Durbin asked whether he shared Justice Thomas   s view that a wartime President has inherent powers   beyond those explicitly given to Congress   He didn   t answer when Senator Feingold asked what  if any  limits there are on the President   s power           We all understand that under Article II  the President has primary responsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs   But  the idea that the President can simply disregard existing law or redefine statutory limits at will in the areas of foreign affairs  national security  and war is a startling one   And it is one that I cannot accept         We needed to know what limits Judge Alito would place on the executive branch   We needed him to go beyond simple recitations of Supreme Court case law   We needed to know what he actually thought           Sadly  however  Judge Alito did not give us those answers   In fact  he failed to give us answers on many questions of critical importance   He refused to answer questions from Senator Leahy  Senator Kennedy  Senator Feingold  and Senator Biden on the question of the power of the presidency   He refused to answer questions from Senator Schumer  Senator Durbin  and Senator Feinstein on whether Roe v  Wade was settled law   an answer that even Chief Justice Roberts was willing to give   He refused to answer Senator Leahy   s questions on court stripping  Senator Leahy   s and Senator Feinstein   s questions on Congressional power and the Commerce Clause  Senator Feingold   s questions on affirmative action and criminal law  Senator Schumer   s questions on immigration           These are all questions about issues that routinely come before the Court   Judge Alito had an obligation to answer them   He had an obligation to explain and clarify the positions he took in his speeches  judicial opinions  and Justice Department memoranda   But he did not           Why are we supposed to think that is ok   Since when is it acceptable to secure a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court by hiding behind a smokescreen of non answers         I understand that  for many  voting for cloture on a judicial nomination is a very difficult decision  particularly on this Supreme Court nominee   I also understand that  for some of you  a nomination must be an    extraordinary circumstance    in order to justify that vote   I believe this nomination is an extraordinary circumstance   What could possibly be more important than this         This is a lifetime appointment to a Court where nine individuals determine what our Constitution protects and what our laws mean   Once Judge Alito is confirmed  we can never take back this vote   Not after he prevents many Americans from having their discrimination cases heard by a jury   Not after he allows more government intrusions into our private lives   Not after he grants the President the power to ignore federal law under the guise of protecting our national security   Not after he shifts the ideological balance of the Court far to the right           As I have said before  Judge Alito   s nomination was a direct result of the right wing   s vehement attacks on Harriet Miers  an accomplished lawyer whose only failing was the absence of an ideologically bent record   The right wing didn   t wait for the next nominee   The right wing didn   t leave any of the tools in their arsenal unused   The right wing attacked with every option available to them to prevent Harriet Mier   s confirmation  secure in their conviction that it was the right thing for them to do           We believe no less   And we should do no less   We did allowed the confirmation of three of the most dangerous appellate court nominees   There was no talk of prolonged debate Chief Justice Roberts   Now we are presented with a nominee whose record raises serious doubt about serious questions that will have a profound impact on every day lives of Americans   What on earth are we waiting for          Many on my side oppose this nomination   They say they understand the threat he poses  but they argue that cloture is different   I don   t believe it is   It is the only way that those of us in the Minority have a voice in this debate   It is the only way we can fully complete our constitutional duty of advice and consent   It is the only way we can stop a confirmation that we feel certain will cause irreversible damage to our country           I will oppose cloture on the nomination of Judge Alito   And  I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me                                                                                       20510
