Act will provide health insurance to every child in America          65  of all uninsured children have at least one parent working full time over the course of the year   That simply shouldn   t be the case         Currently 11 million children in America are not getting the health care they need       1 out of every 4 children is not fully up to date on basic immunizations   Half of all uninsured children have not had a well child visit in the past year   1 out of every 3 children with chronic asthma do not get a prescription for medications they need   1 in 5 has trouble accessing needed care  and    1 in 3 went without health insurance for all or part of 2002 and 2003        The KidsFirst Act is a true federal state partnership where the best elements of shared responsibility contribute to an affordable  reliable comprehensive system of care for all children         The bill focuses on three main areas   how to get states to expand coverage  how to get parents to share in the responsibility of covering their children  and how to eliminate enrollment barriers that prevent eligible children from signing up for coverage        Why expand coverage through Medicaid and SCHIP      Medicaid and SCHIP provide a crucial safety net for 30 million children   While the number of children living in poverty increased by two million between 2000 and 2003  the number of uninsured children fell thanks to Medicaid and SCHIP enrollments       Medicaid and SCHIP have a track record of improving the health of children   Studies have found that publicly insured children are more likely to obtain medical care  preventive care and dental care than similar low income children who are privately insured   In addition  expanding SCHIP and Medicaid to more children is projected to reduce rates of avoidable hospitalizations by 22    Children enrolled in public insurance programs were also found to have a 68  improvement in measures of school performance       According to a recent survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health  80  of Americans say they favor expanding state programs like Medicaid as a way to increase the number of insured Americans      State Fiscal Relief and Coverage Expansions   At the center of this proposal is a new plan to offer states fiscal relief in exchange for expanding coverage to more children       States are experiencing record budget deficits and pressures to cut back on health care for children and the poor   KidsFirst offers states a different path   the federal government will provide significant fiscal relief to the states in exchange for their commitment to expand state health coverage to more children and to help aggressively find and enroll them into these programs       Under the Kerry plan  the federal government pays for all Medicaid outreach and coverage costs for children under age 21 with family incomes at or below poverty level   15 670 annual income for a family of three        In exchange  the state agrees to cover children under age 21 with incomes at or below 300  of poverty   47 010 annual income for a family of three  through SCHIP or Medicaid   This will cover more than 11 million children who are currently uninsured        It is in states    economic interest to participate   There are 20 million children enrolled in Medicaid today  for whom the states pay on average half the costs of care   Under KidsFirst  the states would pay nothing for those children below poverty  resulting in more than  10 billion in savings to states every year   In addition  the federal government will continue to pay the enhanced SCHIP matching rate  so it will still only cost states an average of 36 cents on the dollar to pay for the proposed coverage expansions         Costs   According to an analysis performed by Kenneth Thorpe  Ph D  at Emory University   s Rollins School of Public Health  the 5 year federal score for the bill is slightly over  100 billion with a 10 year score of  264 billion   These cost calculations do not include long term savings to the health care system from reduced reliance on uncompensated care for uninsured children      Encouraging Family Responsibility   This bill requires parents to insure all children under age 19 and requires proof of coverage to avoid losing their federal child tax credit   Any forfeited child tax credits would finance automatic enrollment into the SCHIP program   It also sets forth meaningful policy changes to help families achieve this coverage mandate by       Allowing higher income parents the right to buy into the SCHIP program for their children at cost    Allowing parents to use the SCHIP subsidy to purchase qualified employer sponsored coverage  and   Providing tax credits to higher income parents to make coverage affordable   Parents will not be required to spend more than 5  of their adjusted gross income on health care premiums for their children under age 19   1 in 5 has trouble accessing needed care  and    1 in 3 went without health insurance for all or part of 2002 and 2003    Eliminating Barriers and Expanding Access   In addition to expanding eligibility  there are programmatic barriers that must be removed in order for all children to have access to comprehensive  affordable health care         Under this bill  states are required to make enrollment simpler  automatic and continuous   Nearly 6 8 million children are eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP coverage but are currently uninsured    Studies indicate that as many as 67  of children who were eligible but not enrolled for SCHIP had applied for coverage but were denied due to procedural issues   The Kerry plan will change that         To save money during tight economic times  states have done everything from cutting outreach and enrollment funds to keep the rolls down  to actually freezing enrollment in SCHIP   They have implemented eligibility cut backs  required families to re enroll on a repeated basis  and instituted higher co payments and premiums as a deterrent to enrollment        Making Children   s Health Care a Priority    Senator Kerry has long been passionate about ensuring every child in America has access to health care  and providing health insurance for every child in America is his major domestic priority         Senator Kerry was there at the beginning of the fight to provide the largest investment in children   s health care since the creation of Medicaid   His 1996 bill  the    Healthy Children  Family Assistance Health Insurance Program     was the precursor to the successful SCHIP program  which became law in 1997 and provides funding to cover 5 million children         Now  he is tapping into his large national base of supporters to generate support for children   s health care   In fact  Senator Kerry chose his first e mail message to his on line list of nearly 3 million supporters to be about the KidsFirst Act and his plan to provide health care coverage to every child in America         Senator Kerry is making it clear that he is committed to fighting for this  and he will hold congressional Republicans accountable for inaction or delay   He will push for hearings on his bill in the Finance Committee   He will force a debate in the Senate at every major opportunity   And he will attach the KidsFirst Act to any moving target  giving the Republicans a simple choice     make progress on children   s health care  or show they have other priorities        Endorsements   KidsFirst has
