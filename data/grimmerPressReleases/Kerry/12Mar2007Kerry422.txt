John Kerry today sent a letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security  Michael Chertoff  demanding answers regarding the immigration raid in New Bedford that left more than 150 children stranded without their parents  He requested that a thorough investigation be launched into how the raid was prepared and executed  In addition  Kerry also raises concerns about how the target of an ICE criminal investigation could also be the recipient of lucrative DOD contracts  The text of the letter is as follows  March 10  2007 The Honorable Michael Chertoff Secretary of Homeland Security U S  Department of Homeland Security Washington  DC 20528 Secretary Chertoff  I write today in regard to the immigration situation in New Bedford  Massachusetts  As you are well aware  on Tuesday  March 6  2007  approximately 500 undocumented workers at Michael Bianco Inc   a New Bedford leathermaker  were detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE   Soon after their initial detention  150 of those undocumented workers were sent to San Antonio  Texas to be held  The rest were detained at Fort Devens in Massachusetts  More than 150 children were left stranded as a result of these detentions  creating what many have identified as a humanitarian crisis  During our phone conversation Thursday evening  you assured me that the situation in New Bedford was under control  When we discussed returning the detainees in Texas back to Massachusetts to ensure that all children could be easily reunited with their parents  you underscored your confidence that there were no parents actually being detained in Texas  Yet  the following day  the Associated Press reported that a mother was located in the Texas detention center after her 7 year old called the hotline set up by the Massachusetts Department of Social Services  DSS   It is shocking to me that the reunification of families is left to the ingenuity of a 7 year old  In fact  it leads me to believe that things on the ground in New Bedford are not as under control as you earlier claimed  As a result  I respectfully request that you provide me with the following information so that we can better understand how this disaster occurred and what steps ICE is taking to rectify it  How many children currently have at least one parent in a detention center as a result of this raid  How many children have two parents in a detention center as a result of this raid  How many detainees were initially released because they informed DSS or ICE that they were a single parent or sole care giver  How many additional detainees have been released since that time  How did DSS or ICE learn that those individuals needed to be released for humanitarian purposes  When did detainees first have access to DSS representatives  Did the detainees who were sent to Texas have access to DSS representatives before they left Massachusetts  Did the detainees have access immediately upon being removed from the premises and taken into custody  If not  why not  What preparation was done by ICE to ensure that children were not left stranded as a result of a raid where the targeted undocumented workers were two thirds women  What is ICE s policy with respect to removing undocumented aliens from a state for detention purposes  How does ICE decide where to send the aliens  Is any thought given to potential family disruptions when that decision is made  Was there any effort to detain the 150 removed immigrants closer to Massachusetts  What is ICE currently doing to insure that no more children will be left stranded as a result of this raid  What is ICE s policy with respect to humanitarian releases  Why is it limited to a sole caregiver or single parent  Why does ICE not make provisions for families with children to stay in tact until the conclusion of a deportation hearing  Although I look forward to hearing your answers on these questions  I am very concerned that there was a systematic failure in preparing for and executing the New Bedford immigration raid  It is for that reason I am copying DHS Inspector General Richard Skinner on this letter and asking for a thorough investigation into how the raid was prepared and how it was executed  In addition to my concerns about the innocent children swept up in the aftermath of this raid  I also have significant questions about how a target of an ICE criminal investigation could also be the recipient of lucrative DOD contracts  It is my understanding that ICE opened its investigation into Michael Bianco Inc  in May  2006  and that shortly thereafter it was determined that Michael Bianco Inc  was an egregious employer meaning that the company met one of the following criteria   1  exploitation of undocumented workers   2  knowingly hiring unauthorized workers as a business practice  or  3  having a significant unauthorized work force  Given that prosecuting egregious employers is a top priority of ICE  the investigation moved forward swiftly  I simply cannot understand  however  how the target of a criminal investigation could retain coveted contracts with the Department of Defense  I therefore would like answers to the following questions  When ICE initiated its investigation  did Michael Bianco Inc  have a DOD contract  If not  when did it get the contract  If it had a DOD contract  did ICE inform DOD of the criminal investigation  If not  why not  If it did not have a DOD contract  did ICE inform DOD of the criminal investigation when it learned there was the potential for a future contract  What about after it was awarded  What is ICE s policy with respect to notifying other federal agencies about ongoing investigations  Does ICE take into consideration the type of work that a company is doing for the DOD  or any other federal agency  when it determines who to investigate and how far to carry that investigation  I thank you in advance for your prompt response to my questions  I believe the situation in New Bedford has become a classic example of what not to do in an immigration raid and I hope that we can have your agency s full cooperation in rectifying this crisis  Sincerely  John Kerry                                                                         20510                                                                                                                                                                                          Contact           Sitemap
