John Kerry today said that he is co sponsoring new legislation aimed at preventing contracting waste  fraud and abuse by Pentagon contractors in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  Kerry said the bill would make a series of immediate fixes to the procurement process  including punishing war profiteers with stiffer penalties  requiring more disclosure of contracting abuses  forcing more competition by eliminating sole source contracts and restricting the ability of contractors to oversee one another  The legislation was written by Sen  Byron Dorgan  D ND   who has led a series of hearings on the issue         We owe every man and woman serving in our military nothing less than complete transparency when we spend money in places like Iraq and Afghanistan  Unfortunately  the war in Iraq and the actions of companies like Halliburton and Custer Battles have become symbols for questions about government waste and a near total lack of accountability  It s a disgrace that we have to answer to parents who ask how we can allow corporate cheaters to reap massive profits on the battlefield of Iraq when their sons and daughters are serving without proper equipment  This bill will help restore confidence in this process         A summary of the legislation is attached below       Honest Leadership and Accountability in Contracting Act   Section by Section Analysis      Punishes War Profiteers   Sec  101 establishes penalties of up to 20 years in prison and at least  1 million in fines for war profiteering  This provision is largely modeled on anti profiteering legislation by Senator Leahy   Note that the penalties would apply to fraud by contractors in any place where the United States engages in military action   regardless of whether the fraud is against the United States or  the entity having jurisdiction over the place where the military action takes place    So fraud against the Coalition Provisional Authority would have been covered by this provision          Cracks Down on Big Corporate Cheaters   Sec  102 restores a Clinton Administration rule on suspension and debarment  which prohibited awarding federal contracts to companies that exhibited a pattern of overcharging the government or failing to comply with the law  including tax  labor  environmental  antitrust  and consumer protection laws  The Bush Administration repealed this rule in March 2001  one of its first actions upon taking office          Requires Full Disclosure of Contract Abuses   Sec  103 provides for greater transparency in contracting   Specifically  this section would require agencies to provide to the chairman and ranking member of committees of jurisdiction a list of all agency audit reports that have found contractor misconduct   It would also require creation of a website listing  1  any instances where a major contractor has been fined or found guilty of misconduct  and  2  information on all sole source contracts in excess of  2 million          Forces Real Contract Competition   Secs  201 and 202 would prohibit the awarding of umbrella contracts over  100 million on a  sole source  basis  so that such contracts would be jointly awarded to at least two companies  which would then compete with each other  under the umbrella contract  for all purchase orders worth more than  1 million   The provision would preclude a multi billion dollar  sole source award like Halliburton s LOGCAP contract  forcing some real price competition   Agencies would have waiver authority in cases where only a sole source contract was feasible  but would have to justify a waiver in writing and notify Congress          Bans Corporate Cronyism in Contracting   Sec  211 requires that federal agencies conduct contract oversight  rather than paying contractors with conflicts of interest to oversee one another    On March 10  2004  the Pentagon awarded  129 million worth of oversight work to major Iraq contractors   essentially asking them to oversee each other   Some of the companies tasked with overseeing each other had huge conflicts of interest  like Parsons and Fluor  which had a  2 6 billion joint venture in Kazakhstan    A Dorgan Wyden amendment to the FY 2005 Defense Authorization bill prohibited the outsourcing of oversight  and was signed into law   but the Pentagon took the position that it had not outsourced oversight  but rather functions relating to oversight   Sec  211 restates the prohibition on outsourcing of oversight  and clarifies that specific activities relating to oversight  including  services that involve or relate to the evaluation of another contractor s performance   could not be outsourced to companies that have a conflict of interest          Eliminates Conflicts of Interest for Federal Contracting Employees   Sec  212 closes the perverse loophole that allows federal contracting officials to work as representatives for companies to whom they awarded contracts   Federal law currently prohibits federal contracting officials from being hired as employees  directors  or consultants of companies to whom they awarded contracts   but the law does not prohibit them from being hired as representatives   Sec  212 would make it clear that procurement officials could not be employed by contractors in any capacity  including as representatives  within two years of leaving their government positions          Ends Cronyism in Key Government Positions   Sec  301 stops unqualified political appointees like David Safavian and Michael Brown from holding key jobs relating to  1  federal contracting or  2  public safety   It specifies that political appointees for such positions must have relevant professional credentials  a record of accomplishment  and specific expertise in the field in question   Also  the nominee cannot have been a representative for any client having business before the agency in question in the previous two years   The provision explicitly lists certain jobs that this restriction would apply to  including the head of procurement at OMB and the director of FEMA  but would extend to all political appointments in the fields of federal contracting and public safety   This provision is modeled on the Waxman Anti Cronyism Legislation in the 109th Congress          Strengthens Whistleblower Protections   Among other provisions  Sec  302 makes it more difficult for federal agencies to retaliate against whistleblowers   Currently  only the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals is allowed to review whistleblower retaliation cases  Sec  302 would allow other federal courts to consider such cases   The bill would also create a mechanism to ensure that whistleblowers are able to come forward to Congress with classified information  in a way that protects both the whistleblower and the classified information                                                                                        20510                                                                                                                                                                                          Contact           Sitemap
