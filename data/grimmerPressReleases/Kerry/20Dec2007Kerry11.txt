Congresswoman Tsongas and I fight each year to secure federal funding for these initiatives that make a real local impact  In Massachusetts  we re enormously proud of our world class hospitals  research centers and universities  They lead the nation and the world in improving the lives of our citizens  said Senator Kennedy  These federal investments are vital to the people of the Merrimack

new investments in Democratic priorities like historic increases in spending for our veterans  more funding for medical research  expanding Pell Grants and other college assistance  and adding critical funding for home heating assistance for low income families and our seniors  I am also very pleased that two important economic development projects that were included at my request were retained in the final bill  These two projects and the funding for many other valuable projects secured by Senators Kennedy and Kerry as well as former Congressman Meehan  are representative of the great partnerships that can be made between the federal  state and local government  said Congresswoman Niki Tsongas  State Senator Steven Baddours district benefits from many of the projects  This bill delivers much needed funding to many deserving projects throughout our region  said State Senator Steven Baddour  From the I 93 Junction project  which represents thousands of new jobs  to
