parents  schools  communities and states the support they need to re fuel the amazing engine of education and keep our country great in the years ahead             America largely created the global economy  and we have to change the way we do things if we are going to maintain our position in it   And the only way we are going to do that and remain competitive in the world is by investing in our students and our teachers     said John Kerry        This bill will help America continue to lead the world in technology and innovation   said Senator Clinton    It lays the groundwork for a new generation of American prosperity and security   It invests in teachers  encourages states to raise academic standards  promotes math  science  and critical foreign language education  and helps make college a reality for more children        The New National Defense Education Act modernizes our education system and equips Americans with twenty first century knowledge and skills by

to support innovative strategies to meet emerging labor market needs         Below is Senator Kennedy   s floor statement on the NDEA   STATEMENT BY SENATOR KENNEDY ON THE NEW NATIONAL DEFENSE EDUCATION ACT      AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY       Mr  President  American families face great challenges in dealing with the rapidly changing global economy   The value of their wages is declining  the cost of living is going up  and many jobs are moving overseas   More and more Americans feel the American dream is slowly slipping out of reach        We can and must deal more effectively with this problem   We have a responsibility to make the investments that are necessary to our progress     a responsibility to our families  to our economy  to our nation  and even to our national security      We can guarantee America   s continuing prosperity in the future  but we must work for it   We must sacrifice for it   The rest of the world is playing for keeps   We cannot just tinker at the margins if we expect to continue to be a leader in this rapidly shrinking world        We must ensure that our citizens can achieve the American dream once again    To do so  our highest priority must be a world class education for every American   We must make the American employee and employer the best educated  best trained  and most capable in the world   We need to strengthen the capacities of every person in the nation      This isn   t just my opinion   In recent years  study after study has emphasized education as the solution to keeping America competitive in the years to come       Last year  the Council on Competitiveness urged a focus on lifelong skill development     through elementary  secondary and higher education  and through training and workforce support  as essential to keeping America on the cutting edge of innovation      A recent National Academy of Sciences report contains these recommendations   Two of the report   s four major recommendations state that education is the solution to meeting the global challenge        The National Association of Manufacturers has also issued a report urging a renewed focus on education and training to keep American businesses competitive      Other industrialized countries are embracing education as the key to competing in this new economy  but America is slipping behind   We rank 28th out of 40 nations in math education  We were third in the world in 1975 in the production of new scientists and engineers  but now we rank 15th    By 2008  six million U S  jobs will go unfilled because our workforce will not be qualified to fill them         These shortcomings threaten both our economic security and our national security           The last time America was shocked into realizing we were unacceptably behind in math and science was in 1957  when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik   To meet that crisis  Republican President Eisenhower worked closely with a Democratic Congress to pass the National Defense Education Act   The new law declared a national    education emergency     and we doubled the federal investment in education virtually overnight        Today I join with my colleagues  Senator Clinton and Senator Kerry  to introduce a new National Defense Education Act for our own day and generation       To respond to this major challenge  we must ensure our education standards are internationally competitive  so that our high school graduates can succeed in the new economy     We must make a commitment to all students     regardless of the studies they choose to pursue     that cost will not be a barrier to a college degree   We must strengthen math and science education in this country by making college free for s    s  tudents training to become math or science teachers in high need schools         Our New National Defense Education Act responds to each of these imperatives   It modernizes our education system and equips Americans with twenty first century knowledge and skills   It provides incentives and resources for schools to develop and implement more rigorous standards in math  science and reading       The legislation updates the nation   s report card     the National Assessment of Educational Progress     to ensure that it sets a national benchmark which is internationally competitive and is aligned with the demands of the 21st century global economy   It expands our ability to monitor science achievement   It requires the NAEP to measure student preparedness to enter college  the 21st century workforce  or the Armed Services   It also requires the Secretary of Education to examine the gaps in student performance on state level assessments and NAEP assessments  and to assist states in understanding those gaps   It provides critical resources to states to create PreK 16 Preparedness Councils to help them with their efforts to improve state standards and ensure that they are aligned with the expectations of colleges  employers  and the Armed Services   It also provides funding to states working in collaboration to establish common standards and assessments       The New NDEA also directs resources to high need schools  to enable them to invest in math  science  engineering and technology textbooks and laboratories  and give their students equal access to a curriculum that will provide the skills they need to be successful in the 21st century global economy        The legislation recognizes the critical role of the National Science Foundation in ensuring our children have access to cutting edge science and technology programs  by doubling the investment in elementary  secondary and postsecondary education programs at NSF   The New NDEA also helps open the doors of college to all by creating the    Contract for Educational Opportunity    grant program  or    CEO Grants      which guarantee students that if they work hard and are admitted to college  their financial need will be met through additional state and federal financial aid         The legislation also offers additional grants to make college tuition free for low  and middle income students studying science  technology  engineering or math  as well as critical need foreign languages       The bill provides larger grants to students studying to become teachers in these fields who agree to work in a high poverty school for at least 4 years   It also provides teachers with tax credits  increased loan forgiveness and additional incentives to continue to teach where they are needed the most   It provides grants to institutions of higher education to develop innovative programs for recruiting and training new teachers  and invests in teacher training programs to support their continuing education         The bill recognizes that it is increasingly important for students to be exposed to other languages and cultures   In recent years  foreign language needs have significantly increased throughout the public and private sector because of the wider range of security threats  the emergence of new nation states  and the globalization of the U S  economy  American businesses increasingly need employees experienced in foreign languages and international cultures to manage a culturally diverse workforce        The New NDEA responds to these needs by providing grants for elementary and secondary critical need language programs  summer institutes to improve teachers    knowledge and instruction of foreign languages and international content  and study abroad and foreign language study opportunities for high school students  and undergraduate and graduate students      The New NDEA also continues to invest in our current workforce   The bill builds on existing formula funds for job training with competitive grants to support innovative strategies to meet emerging labor market needs      From our earliest days as a nation  education has been the engine of the American dream  Our country is home to the greatest universities in the world  and our education system has produced the world   s leading teachers  scientists  writers  musicians  and inventors  We cannot let these achievements stall   Slogans are not enough   We have to put first things first  and give children  parents  schools  communities and states the support they need to re fuel the amazing engine of education and keep our country great in the years ahead         I urge my colleagues to join us in making this strong new commitment to securing our nation   s future by supporting the New National Defense Education Act                                                                                   20510                                                                                                                                                                                          Contact           Sitemap
