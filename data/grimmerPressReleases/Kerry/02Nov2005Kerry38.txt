of Rosa Parks   Detroit  Michigan   November 2  2005   As prepared for delivery          When I met Rosa Parks  I was overwhelmed by this graceful  small woman   s quiet strength and humility   her conviction in taking on the army of power that was deployed before her    her courage to dig in  knowing full well the power of the courthouse  the power of the sheriff   s badge  the power of the vigilante  the power of the establishment    knowing that on dark country roads or after a knock on the door in the middle of the night  people still disappeared and died almost anonymous deaths except for those who loved them   So many killed just trying to be citizens in the land of the free          Rosa Parks reminded many and taught even more how to talk truth to power  In an era when these words are thrown around too easily  she lived the words    courage    and    patriot      she loved the dream of our country more than herself and she was willing to risk it all to live the dream          In the struggle for civil rights  some were called to stand up to Bull Connor   s fire hoses and police dogs   some to stand up to Klan terrorism   and some to stand up to state sponsored acts of violence  But some were called simply to sit down   at lunch counters in Greensboro and Nashville and Atlanta   or on a bus in Montgomery          Rosa Parks was about progress  not memory  Yes  she sat down so we could stand up  but not so we could stand still          The bus still comes by again and again and each time we have to decide whether to go quietly to the back  or by simple acts of courage and conviction change the direction of our own country   s journey           If she did that  then how much greater is the responsibility of those of us with privilege and power who pay tribute to her today   The life of Rosa Parks demands deeds  not epitaphs   For the final words cannot be spoken or written while her cause is still unfinished   Nothing we say here can match what she did in that sacred moment on a municipal bus in Montgomery  Alabama   What matters now is what we do after the casket is gone  the candles are quenched  and the next bus comes by          For Rosa Parks and for America  it is our own time to answer    no    to those who would deny or degrade equality in the name of states    rights  or with the false claim that our history is color blind   When she sat down on that bus it was affirmative action  now we must stand up for affirmative action  for Rosa Parks and for our country          It is our time to demand that every vote be counted and no voters be discounted because of the color of their skin   for Rosa Parks and for our country          It is our time  now more than ever  to defend the right of women to live in a world where the mountaintops are no longer reserved for men  Our time to remember that after the Pope blessed her and placed rosary beads around her neck  Rosa Parks wrote to him in gratitude  She said    my lifetime mission has been simple  that all men and women are created equal under the eyes of our Lord             Nothing we can say will ever match what Rosa Parks did in that sacred moment on a bus in Montgomery   What matters now is what we do to continue her legacy   For Rosa Parks and for our country  it is our time to oppose prejudice  not appease it  to dispel fear  not exploit it  to lift up the many  not the few  and to uphold the true patriotism to do what   s right  not what justifies injustice or past wrongs     Kerry added      Sometimes the days seem heavy and the odds seem high  but that moment on a bus in Montgomery always comes   Someone gets on that bus  refuses to equivocate or yield and changes history   Now  that someone must be us  for Rosa Parks and for our country
