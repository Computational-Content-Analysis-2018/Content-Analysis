   Senators Edward M  Kennedy and John F  Kerry today announced substantial victories for Massachusetts in the  295 billion Senate transportation bill expected to pass Tuesday night   The bill will now go to a joint House and Senate Conference where Kennedy and Kerry will work with the Massachusetts Congressional delegation led by Congressman Mike Capuano to ensure the most robust final bill possible for the Commonwealth        The Senate bill has drawn several veto threats from President George Bush  who insists that its  295 billion price tag is too much     even when his own Department of Transportation estimates that each  1 billion of federal transportation investment supports 47 000 jobs   The Administration was handed a stinging rebuke last week when the Senate voted 92 7 to bring debate on the bill to a close and clear the path toward final passage     despite the veto threats           President Bush might not want to invest in jobs  but we   ll fight for them   This bill is a victory for Massachusetts    economy  its environment  and its commuters     Senator Kennedy said      With congestion at an all time high  these record funding levels are the shot in the arm we need to strengthen all parts of our state   Our Senate and House delegation will fight hard to preserve this victory in the final bill            With increasing traffic congestion and diminishing air quality  investing in transportation and transit is one of the smartest investments we can make   It s a sad statement that the administration would threaten to veto this bill  especially with all the good paying jobs it creates   We need to get it signed into law  and we will fight to keep the record funding for Massachusetts in the final bill   said Senator Kerry        Specifically  the Senate bill would guarantee that Massachusetts gets  3 694 billion for highway and roadway investments over six years     a  604 million increase of the funding provided under the previous transportation bill  the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century  TEA 21   which passed in 1998   Massachusetts secured  3 09 billion over six years under TEA 21        The Senate bill  named the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  and Efficient Transportation Equity Act  SAFTEA   would also provide a record  1 643 billion for Massachusetts mass transit investments over six years  an increase of  563 million over TEA 21   s mass transit funding for Massachusetts           From Boston to the Cape to the Berkshires  these critical funds will put more people to work  promote economic development  and help combat congestion     Senator Kennedy said         This bill will create jobs in every region in the state  reduce pollution  cut down on congestion and help improve the quality of life we value so much in Massachusetts   said Senator Kerry        Finally  the bill would raise the federal employer provided mass transit tax benefit from its current level of  105 per month to  155 per month immediately  and then raise it again to  200 in 2010     which would create parity with the current federal parking tax benefit of  200        This increase would enable employers who currently provide commuting benefits to their employees     including all forms of mass transit and vanpool arrangements    to increase the amounts they provide tax free to cover greater portion of employee commuting expenses   According to the most recent figures from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority  MBTA   companies purchased an average of 88 000 monthly passes for Massachusetts commuters in January  February  and March of this year        In addition  by increasing the value of the tax benefit  this provision will also help encourage more employers to start offering the benefit to workers who currently use T monthly passes  but who might not necessarily receive the benefit at the current time           The commuter tax benefit an effective way to reduce congestion and wear and tear on our roads  while encouraging environmentally sound mass transit ridership     Senator Kennedy said      This increase will mean significant new financial relief for many more Massachusetts commuters             The Senate has recognized the value of mass transit by increasing the tax benefit for the millions of Americans who use transit everyday   Not only does this help Massachusetts  but it will provide a greater incentive for commuters across the country to use transit   said Senator Kerry        Today  approximately 194 000 of the MBTA   s current 1 1 million daily bus  subway  and commuter rail riders    nearly 18     use monthly T passes   The highest priced monthly T packages often exceed  140 for commuter rail passengers from outlying cities    Some of those monthly fares are   Brockton  149  Fitchburg  198  Gloucester  191  Haverhill  191  Lawrence  181  Lowell  181  Middleboro Lakeville  198  and Worcester  198                   Employers seeking
