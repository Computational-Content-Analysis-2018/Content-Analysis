President Bush will discuss the situation in Iraq  It s long past time to get it right in Iraq  The Bush administration is courting disaster with its current course    a course with no realistic strategy for reducing the risks to our soldiers and increasing the odds for success       The reality is that the Bush administration s choices have made Iraq into what it wasn t before the war    a breeding ground for jihadists  Today there are 16 000 to 20 000 jihadists and the number is growing  The administration has put itself    and  tragically  our troops  who pay the price every day    in a box of its own making  Getting out of this box won t be easy  but we owe it to our soldiers to make our best effort        Our mission in Iraq is harder because the administration ignored the advice of others  went in largely alone  underestimated the likelihood and power of the insurgency  sent in too few troops to secure the country  destroyed the Iraqi army through de Baathification  failed to secure ammunition dumps  refused to recognize the urgency of training Iraqi security forces and did no postwar planning  A little humility would go a long way    coupled with a strategy to succeed       So what should the president say tonight  The first thing he should do is tell the truth to the American people  Happy talk about the insurgency being in   the last throes   leads to frustrated expectations at home  It also encourages reluctant  sidelined nations that know better to turn their backs on their common interest in keeping Iraq from becoming a failed state       The president must also announce immediately that the United States will not have a permanent military presence in Iraq  Erasing suspicions that the occupation is indefinite is critical to eroding support for the insurgency        He should also say that the United States will insist that the Iraqis establish a truly inclusive political process and meet the deadlines for finishing the Constitution and holding elections in December  We re doing our part  our huge military presence stands between the Iraqi people and chaos  and our special forces protect Iraqi leaders  The Iraqis must now do theirs       He also needs to put the training of Iraqi troops on a true six month wartime footing and ensure that the Iraqi government has the budget needed to deploy them  The administration and the Iraqi government must stop using the requirement that troops be trained in country as an excuse for refusing offers made by Egypt  Jordan  France and Germany to do more        The administration must immediately draw up a detailed plan with clear milestones and deadlines for the transfer of military and police responsibilities to Iraqis after the December elections  The plan should be shared with Congress  The guideposts should take into account political and security needs and objectives and be linked to specific tasks and accomplishments  If Iraqis adopt a constitution and hold elections as planned  support for the insurgency should fall and Iraqi security forces should be able to take on more responsibility  It will also set the stage for American forces to begin to come home       Iraq  of course  badly needs a unified national army  but until it has one    something that our generals now say could take two more years    it should make use of its tribal  religious and ethnic militias like the Kurdish pesh merga and the Shiite Badr Brigade to provide protection and help with reconstruction  Instead of single mindedly focusing on training a national army  the administration should prod the Iraqi government to fill the current security gap by integrating these militias into a National Guard type force that can provide security in their own areas        The administration must work with the Iraqi government to establish a multinational force to help protect its borders  Such a force  if sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council  could attract participation by Iraq s neighbors and countries like India       The deployment of capable security forces is critical  but it alone will not end the insurgency  as the administration would have us believe  Hamstrung by its earlier lack of planning and overly optimistic predictions for rebuilding Iraq  the administration has failed to devote equal attention to working with the Iraqi government on the economic and political fronts  Consequently  reconstruction is lagging even in the relatively secure Shiite south and Kurdish north  If Iraqis  particularly Sunnis who fear being disenfranchised  see electricity flowing  jobs being created  roads and sewers being rebuilt and a democratic government being formed  the allure of the insurgency will decrease       Iraq s Sunni neighbors  who complain they are left out  could do more to help  Even short term improvements  like providing electricity and supplying diesel fuel    an offer that the Saudis have made but have yet to fulfill    will go a long way  But we need to give these nations a strategic plan for regional security  acknowledging their fears of an Iran dominated crescent and their concerns about our fitful mediation between Israel and the Palestinians in return for their help in rebuilding Iraq  protecting its borders  and bringing its Sunnis into the political process        The next months are critical to Iraq s future and our security  If Mr  Bush fails to take these steps  we will stumble along  our troops at greater risk  casualties rising  costs rising  the patience of the American people wearing thin  and the specter of quagmire staring us in the face  Our troops deserve better  they deserve leadership equal to their sacrifice                                                                           20510
