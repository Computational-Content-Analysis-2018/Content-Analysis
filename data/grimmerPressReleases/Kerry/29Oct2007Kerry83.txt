It is truly and amazing feat the Boston Red Sox accomplished again this year  and I would like to express my gratitude  and that of the fans in Boston and across the country  for this extraordinary achievement  It wasnt an easy road to victory  but the Sox came back from a three game deficit against the Cleveland Indians to win the American League pennant  Then  it was on to the World Series  first in our beloved Fenway Park and then to the mile high Coors Field in Colorado  There  the Red Sox faithful watched as our team won another four straight games to sweep the Rockies and win the World Championship  From the management to the owners to the players  every member of the Red Sox deserves praise for their efforts  My father was three years old when the Red Sox won the World Series in 1918 and never saw the Sox win another one in his lifetime  For me  I thought the comeback against the Yankees and the sweep of the Cardinals in 2004 was as good as it could get  I never thought Id live long enough to see another world championship  said Senator John Kerry  I think we could all get used to this  From stellar performances by Beckett  Dice K  and Papelbon  to Jon Lesters gutsy comeback from cancer  to watching Jacoby Ellsburys fly around the basepaths  this was Boston baseball at its best  The good news is this nucleus of players will be around for a long  long time
