bipartisan bill to provide health insurance to children

                                                                                                                                                                            Four days from now  a wildly successful effort to provide health care to six million low income children will disappear     This summer  in a rare moment of bipartisanship  Democrats and Republicans in Congress came together to expand the State Childrens Insurance Program  known as S CHIP  to provide health care to millions more children  It was a simple test of priorities  and both sides agreed to put kids first    Unfortunately  President Bush has chosen a different course  He is putting ideology and political confrontation ahead of the health of our nations children  has unilaterally declared war on S CHIP  and is threatening to veto the bipartisan bill     If the President follows through on his threat  his stubbornness will carry a serious price for American families  Health insurance for millions of children is on the line  and we know what happens when children lack access to proper care  minor conditions become costly chronic diseases and preventable illnesses can even claim the greatest cost  the life of a child     That is why Congress rose above partisan divisions to pass a bill expanding coverage to 3 million additional children    2 million of them poor enough to be eligible for Medicaid  but still uninsured     President Bush is not even willing to spend enough to retain the children who are currently on the SCHIP rolls  Make no mistake  under the Presidents proposal  kids will be kicked off S CHIP  and they will go uninsured    Unfortunately  this Presidents war on S CHIP doesnt end with a low ball figure or a veto threat  During August recess  the Administration stealthily imposed draconian new restrictions that effectively kill states efforts to cover kids above 250  of povertyin direct defiance of the will of Congress     The new rules require children to stay uninsured for a full year before joining S CHIP and implausibly demand that states guarantee that families arent losing employer based coverage  It seems they would rather put thousands of children at risk than have a few receive benefits who might find coverage elsewhere     As states struggle to find their own solutions to todays health care crisis  it is the Presidentnot Congresswho is imposing federal controls on health care    Dont believe me that these new rules tie states hands  Just ask Republican Governors like Mitch Daniels of IndianaBushs staunchly conservative former budget chief  While the Administration insists that any child above 250  of poverty    50 000 for a family of fouris too rich for S CHIP  Daniels has raised his states coverage to 300   Like many of his Republican counterparts  Daniels understands that with the cost of private insurance for that same family approaching  12 000 per year  the real choice is this  S CHIP or no health care at all     That is why I joined with Senators Kennedy  Smith  Rockefeller  and Snowe to introduce a bill last week to block the Administrations new regulations  which we believe are both unethical and infeasible  A few years ago  this White House called Massachusetts state health plan a model for national reform  Now  by changing the rules in the middle of the game  the President has put this experiment at riskand our children will suffer for it    S CHIP has had an immeasurable impact on the lives of people like 9 year old Alexsiana Lewis of Springfield  MA  who was losing her vision from a rare eye disease  Alexsianas mother Dedra lost her health insurance benefits when she cut back her hours to care for her daughter  If I didnt have  S CHIP funded  Mass Health right now  my daughter would be blind  Dedra said  Were really at the mercy of the politicians    No childs health care should be held hostage by politicians in Washington  especially by a Presidents veto pen  Unfortunately  and stubbornly  this President has threatened to put S CHIP into the same category as stem cell research and a new policy in Iraq  Things the American people desperately want but this President wont allow    This boils down to a question of priorities  Americas families want a government that puts kids firstbut well settle for a President who doesnt insist on putting childrens health last
