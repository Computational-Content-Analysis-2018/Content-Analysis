Immigration Reform  Defends Immigrants Against Divisive Attacks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Kerry offers amendment to give Border Patrol agents  the tools they need to get the job done     Below are the remarks of Senator John Kerry during the Senate debate today on immigration reform  The remarks that follow are as prepared  Mr  President  this debate matters to our country  and there can be no doubt that America is watching  Weve witnessed a tremendous demonstration of public protest and civic participation in American cities across the country  In the Senate and in our communities we are once again wrestling with the important and complicated issue of immigration reform  an issue that goes to the heart of who we are as a people and what we are as a nation  An issue that has divided America repeatedly in our history  revealing humanity and courage side by side with isolationism and fear  We may be divided today as we figure our way forward  but we agree on our past and our heritage as a nation of immigrantsof people who have come to the United States in search of a better life  of freedom  of opportunity  and of having their voices heard  We also agree that our immigration system is broken  And we agree that more resources must be sent to the border in order to strengthen enforcement  add more border patrol agents  and invest in new technologies  But we are divided over whether simply strengthening enforcement at the border will solve this complicated issue or whether we must do more  Lets take a moment to understand the complexity and reality of the problem facing us today  This is a problem I have thought a lot about  I have spent time discussing it with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and other national leaders  There are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living and working in the United States today  The nations employers demand these workers to take low wage  low skilled jobs that they are unable to find domestic workers to fill  There are not enough visas for these workers to come legally and  with the lure of higher paying jobs than they could find in their home countries  workers come to fill them  The system that employers are supposed to use to verify the legal status of employees is weak and subject to exploitation by both workers using false documents and employers who seek only tacitly to comply with the law  Therefore  our challenge is to secure the border  regularize the flow of immigrants into and out of our country  deal with the 11 million undocumented workers currently living in the shadows  and create an effective employee verification system  Some have suggested that we can respond to this complicated challenge simply by tightening our borders and leave it at that  They believe that the approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living and working in our country will return to their home countries  And those who wont leave voluntarily should be rounded up and deported  Mr  President  how would we do that  How would we find 11 million people living in the shadows  And how would we compel them to leave  What would we say to their children  grandchildren  and the businesses and communities that depend on them  Conservative commentator George Will summed this reality up best in his column last week  He wrote Of the nation s illegal immigrants  estimated to be at least 11 million  a cohort larger than the combined populations of 12 states  60 percent have been here at least five years  Most have roots in their communities  Their children born here are U S  citizens  We are not going to take the draconian police measures necessary to deport 11 million people  They would fill 200 000 buses in a caravan stretching bumper to bumper from San Diego to Alaska  where  by the way  26 000 Latinos live  And there are no plausible incentives to get the 11 million to board the buses  Offering up border enforcement as a panacea may be a nice political talking point  But it is not a good strategy and it will not fix our broken immigration system  I am also troubled by the anti immigrant statements that have been made during this debate  statements that expose a limited understanding of the role immigrants and immigrant workers play in the fabric of our economy  society  and communities  and most troubling  statements intended to divide and distract   For example  arguing against the need for immigrant labor  Congressman Dana Rohrabacher said Let the prisoners pick the fruits  We can do it without bringing in millions of foreigners  According to Congressman Bob Beauprez  if we continue down this path that the Senate has established        we will have created the biggest magnet ever  It would be like a dinner bell  Come one  come all  Congressman Steve King said that anyone who supports a guest worker proposal should be branded with a scarlet letter A  for amnesty  Congressman Tom Tancredo wants to turn America into a gated community  warning people that among the people crossing our borders are people coming to kill me and you and your children  He laments the cult of multiculturalism and worries that America is becoming a Tower of Babel  These statements do not reflect the contributions that immigrants have made to our country over centuries  or the contributions they make today  Most of us in this country descend from immigrants  I am in fact married to an immigrant and I know how loyal people can become to the country that welcomes them and gives them the ability to fulfill the American dream  The vast majority of the American people understand the value immigrants provide to our country  They understand enforcement alone will not work  And theyve taken to the streets to make their voices heard  Half a million people demonstrated in Los Angeles to protest an enforcement only approach to immigration reform  far surpassing the number of people who protested the Vietnam War  More than 10 000 people participated in the Day without Latinos rally in Milwaukee  WI leaving their jobs and marching through downtown  Similar walk outs have occurred in other parts of the country  with both students and laborers protesting enforcement only immigration proposals like the House bill  Churches and humanitarian organizations have become actively involved in the fight for comprehensive immigration reform  In fact  just yesterday I spoke with Hispanic Evangelical leaders about their concerns regarding the immigration crisis in our country  Cardinal Roger M  Mahoney  the archbishop of Los Angeles  has spearheaded an effort by the Roman Catholic Church to defy the House bill that criminalizing immigrants and the organizations that help them  The people are making their voices heard  They understand what is at stake  They understand the role that immigrants play in this country  and they are fighting to ensure that we end up with a fair  humanitarian  realistic solution  While some are intent on pursuing an enforcement only strategy  others have embraced a comprehensive approach  I am very encouraged by the Judiciary Committees bipartisan bill  which is now a full substitute amendment to Senator Frists bill offered by Senator Specter  The Specter amendment includes the four cornerstones of effective immigration reform  1  strengthening our border enforcement   2  regulating visas to meet work flow needs   3  providing a path to legalization for undocumented workers living and working in the United States  and  4  helping employers enforce our immigration laws  Make no mistake about it  Mr  President  the Specter amendment is tough on enforcement and border security  I am concerned that because Senator Frists bill is described as enforcement only  some people make incorrectly assume that the Specter substitute fails to include strong enforcement provisions  That is simply not the case  The Specter substitute doubles the size of the Border Patrol by adding 12 000 new agents over the next five years  it doubles interior enforcement by adding 5 000 investigators over the next five years  it adds new technology at the border to create a virtual fence  expands the exit and entry system at all land and air ports  mandates a new land and water surveillance plan  and increases the criminal penalties for violating our immigration laws  The Specter substitute also addresses the reason undocumented workers come to this country  demand for their labor  Workers illegally cross the border because we do not have enough visas to meet our labor needs leally  They come because they know that they can get a job when they get here  One of the key elements to stopping the illegal flow of workers across the border is to increase the number of visas available for people to come and work in the country legally  The temporary worker program created by the Specter substitute will help to regularize the flow of immigrant workers into and out of this country  Recipients of a temporary worker visa must be sponsored by an employer who has unsuccessfully tried to fill the position with a U S  worker  I understand some people fear that allowing temporary workers into the United States will hurt U S  workers by depressing wages  The proposed temporary worker program  however  has labor protections and market wage requirements  the worker must receive at least the same wage as someone similarly situated or at the prevailing wage level for his jobwhichever is greater  The workers will receive a three year visa  renewable for three years and will have the ability to curb employer abuse by changing jobs  In addition  after working for four years  the employee could petition for a green card  Thus  the temporary worker program meets the labor needs of employers while remaining flexible enough to accommodate changes in the marketplace  Equally important is reducing the backlog of people waiting for visas  260 000 new family visas and 150 000 new employment visas will be added each year  30  of the employment visa pool will be reserved for essential workers  And  perhaps most importantly  those currently waiting for visas will be processed before any of the current undocumented workers  In other words  they will stay at the front of the line  The Judiciary Committee bill also provides a realistic and effective way to deal with the 11 million undocumented workers already here  Anyone who believes that it is feasible to return those workers to their native country has no real concept of what an incredible undertaking that would be  How would we find them  What incentive would they have to come out of the shadows  How would we get them back to their native countries  Some have called this path to legalization amnesty  but it is not an amnesty  there is no free ride  There are fines and punishments and requirements to abide by  Immigrants must overcome ten separate hurdles in order to qualify  First  they must show they are eligible for a temporary worker program  Second  they must remain continuously employed going forward  Third  they must pay approximately  2 000 in fines and fees  Fourth  they must pass a security background check  Fifth  they must pass a medical exam  Sixth  they must learn English  Seventh  they must learn U S  history and government  Eighth  they must pay all back taxes  Ninth  they must have been here before January  2004  And tenth  they will be placed at the back of line behind all applicants waiting for green cards  Those  Mr  President  are onerous burdens  We are not simply going to forgive and forget  Were going to make those that have come into this country without proper documentation earn their right to stay here  The final piece of the immigration reform puzzle is creating a workable employer verification system  We rely on employers to help enforce our immigration laws by refusing to hire undocumented workers  Currently  however  employers do not have a reliable system for checking the validity of social security numbers and other forms of documentation  The Specter substitute bill creates a system that will enable employers to quickly and accurately verify a potential employees legal status  The last immigration reform we passed in 1986 intended to address the root causes of illegal workers coming to the United States to find work  But it failed to draw all illegal workers out of the shadows  thereby creating the kernel of todays undocumented population  And the employer verification laws were difficult for employers to follow and the government to enforce  The Specter substitute amendment that the Judiciary Committee worked so hard to create and pass in a bipartisan fashion does not make the same mistake as the 1986 immigration overhaul  Mr  President  Id like to briefly mention another important aspect of this immigration reform bill  something that I have supported for quite some time  the DREAM Act  The DREAM Act will enable young people who have spent most of their lives in the United States  who believe in our country  and who have stayed out of trouble can have a chance at a higher education It gives incredibly bright and capable young people a real chance at success  and it gives our country well educated  hard working citizens  Including the DREAM Act in comprehensive immigration reform is makes sense  and I am glad that the Judiciary Committee  led by Senator Durbin  included it  I think there is some minor room for improvement to the Judiciary Committee bill  which is why I am offering an amendment to strengthen the Border Patrol  both by providing them with additional resources and by providing additional incentives for recruitment and retention  From 1995 to 2002  we experienced a growing trend of agent attrition within the Border Patrol  This was very troubling because not only did we have trouble meeting our security needs  but we also lost experienced border patrol agents  Although that trend has been slowly reversing itself in the past three years  we need to ensure that it is not a problem in the future  particularly as we take important steps to strengthen border enforcement  I am offering an amendment that will provide incentives for Border Patrol agents to stay in service  These incentives include increasing their maximum student loan repayments  authorizing recruitment and relocation bonuses  giving agents the same retirement benefits as law enforcement  and allowing them to get credit for private service  Border Patrol agents have difficult yet critical jobs and we need to do everything in our power to keep that security force strong  My amendment would also ensure that Border Patrol agents have the tools they need to get the job done  For example  it increases the number of helicopters and power boats available for border patrol  it makes sure that there is one vehicle for every three agents and ensures that each of those vehicles is equipped with a portable computer  it provides every agent with clear and encrypted 2 way radios  night vision equipment  GPS devices  high quality border armor  and reliable and effective weapons  And  it makes sure that each and every agent has the necessary uniform for the climate they work in  These may seem like small things  but they are absolutely necessary  Our Border Patrol agents  individuals who spend their days protecting our security  should have every benefit that technology has to offer  My amendment will help ensure that happens  I also intend to offer an amendment which will eliminate provisions that gives administration officials unreviewable authority to make immigration decisions with dramatic impacts on individuals lives As currently drafted  the Specter bill allows the Secretary of Homeland Security  the Attorney General  and consular officials to have the sole   and final   authority to make detention  deportation  admissibility and citizenship determinations that will affect asylum seekers  legal permanent residents  and those seeking to naturalize  This is an unprecedented concentration of power in the hands of unelected and unaccountable administration officials  And weve all seen how reliable and competent this particular Administrations official can be  We cannot allow the balance of power to be shifted in this way  We cannot reverse over 200 years of precedent and statutes that make the courts the ultimate arbiters of who can become a citizen  Many innocent individuals will be denied any opportunity to challenge a wrongful deportation or incarceration order  And a good number of them will not even be informed of the basis for their detention or deportation  let alone provided an opportunity to establish their innocence  This result is un American and unacceptable  I hope my colleagues join me in eliminating those provisions that deny due process to potential United States citizens from the Specter bill  Mr  President  I whole heartedly support the Judiciary Committee bill  the Specter substitute amendment  Right now  immigrants are pushed into a chaotic underground world  They come into our country to meet a growing labor need that would otherwise remain unfilled  We not only have to prevent this dark world from expanding  we also have to deal with it as it exists  The Judiciary Committees bill would tighten the borders to prevent a greater influx of undocumented workers  but it would also reward virtue in dealing with our undocumented population  Immigrants who worked hard  paid fines  paid their taxes  stayed out of trouble  and waited their turn would have a chance to become citizens  This isnt  as some of my colleagues claim  government rewarding illegality  it is government remaining true to the principles we were founded on  Passing the Judiciary Committee bill is the right thing to do  It is the fair thing to do  I hope that my colleagues support both it and my amendment aiding Border Patrol Agents  Thank you
