By John Kerry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Last Friday I visited Louisiana for the second time since Hurricane Katrina  I wanted to see the ongoing recovery effort up close       Sen  Mary Landrieu  who has worked so tirelessly to help rebuild the city she loves  took me around eastern New Orleans to hear from homeowners and small business people who persevered over the last eight and a half months       What I saw and heard left me stunned by how little is happening compared to how much more must be done       When I went to Louisiana in September  I saw a region damaged by a storm  but strong in spirit  Everyone I met was committed to rebuilding their lives and the city they love  On this trip I met people who were afraid  angry and disillusioned    and rightfully disappointed in Washington  s response       I left New Orleans convinced that the Gulf Coast doesn t have a morale problem  Washington has a leadership problem  The people of New Orleans can t rebuild their city s strength on a diet of empty promises       On Sept  15  President Bush spoke from Jackson Square and promised that we will  do what it takes   and  we will stay as long as it takes  to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives        The president seems to mean these words when he speaks them about Iraq  but they ring hollow here at home when he talks about New Orleans       Eight months later little has been provided in real response  Too much time has been wasted without real solutions for Katrina s survivors       There aren t trucks lined up to haul debris out of eastern New Orleans  The piles of debris in front of nearly every building are constant reminders of Washington  s failure  Local officials told me of their fears that mosquitoes and rodents will carry diseases as a result of the piles of garbage in the streets  In the richest country on the planet  Americans shouldn t worry that their children will be at risk for Third World health problems because Washington didn t meet its most basic obligations       The administration boasts about the  9 billion in disaster loans they have approved  But today only  1 billion of that money has actually made it into the hands of Gulf Coast residents to rebuild     a measly 11 percent  Half of those who applied for disaster loans were denied       We must do more  We could tap into the goodwill of Americans and create civilian assistance corps    one group of volunteers from every state could take responsibility for a block or a neighborhood  We need a disaster  ombudsman     a citizen general who can direct  organize  and structure a recovery effort  We ve already seen General Honore  a career solider in the Army  demonstrate how an organization with clear lines of command  organization and structure can bring order  hope and assistance       With Sen  Landrieu s leadership  progress is being made in the Congress  but Washington has miles to go to meet the Gulf Coast  s urgent needs  In September the Senate passed the approach Sens  Landrieu  Vitter and I offered to get small businesses back on their feet with bridge loans and grants for small businesses  Why is the Bush administration blocking this effort from becoming law       Businesses in the Gulf Coast are hanging on by a thread  They can t endure much more red tape and needless delay  They need action now    not after they close their doors and declare bankruptcy       Talk about Washington  s slow response that isn t enough  It s time to demand an increased sense of urgency to correct it  New Orleans   the Gulf Coast and our country need to know that when we said  never again   we meant it         John Kerry is a U S  senator from Massachusetts  This column is a condensed version of a speech he gave in the Senate Friday
