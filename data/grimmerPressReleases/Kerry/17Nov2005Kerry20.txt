adopted several amendments offered by Senator John Kerry  D Mass   to the Defense Authorization Bill  which passed Tuesday   In addition to Kerry legislation that will strengthen small businesses and protect our troops and military families  the Senate also approved a measure offered by Kerry that demands the Director of National Intelligence to report on the alleged CIA clandestine detention facilities        A summary of Kerry   s adopted amendments to the DoD Authorization bill is below       Kerry amendment adds  10 million to accelerate R of military technology   Increased funding of    Project Sheriff    will help keep troops safe on the ground      Kerry   s amendment will secure an additional  10 million in funding for    Project Sheriff      an innovative program aimed at adapting new technology for our troops in Iraq   These technologies will work to meet the current needs of warfighters in Iraq and enhance survivability and lethality  and give soldiers and Marines the ability to select an appropriate level of force against threats   Lessons learned from recent combat operations identify scenarios where combatants and non combatants frequently intermix      Project Sheriff    is an initiative of the Pentagon s Office of Force Transformation  The House of Representatives included an additional  10 million for Project Sheriff in its DOD authorization bill  Without the Kerry amendment  the Senate legislation would not have funded this important program            It is our responsibility to give our troops on the ground the very best technology  equipment and tools possible to keep them safe     Kerry said      Our forces must be prepared to fight in urban environments where our enemies can hide among building and civilians   Lethal attacks can come with no warning from an alley  a high rooftop  a darkened window or even a crowded street corner  New technology can help our troops protect themselves and civilians  and it is time we make this new technology a reality          Kerry amendment protects housing benefits for military families after death of loved one  Doubles length of time families can stay in military housing      Kerry   s amendment will allow surviving widows and children to reside in military housing    either on base housing or with their housing allowance    for a full year after death of loved one on active duty   This is a key component of Kerry s Military Family Bill of Rights         Until Kerry s efforts began to extend the time survivors can stay in military housing  families could only remain for six months after the loss of a service member    often meaning children would start a school year in one state and finish it in another   The Senate passed a similar Kerry amendment earlier this spring  but that provision would have expired at the end of this year because it was attached to an emergency spending measure   Kerry   s effort this week will make permanent this one year protection for military families permanent         The Military Officers Association of America  MOAA  and National Military Family Association  NMFA  have endorsed Kerry   s effort           Our troops who lose their lives fighting for us truly have made the greatest sacrifice for this nation     Kerry said      It is our utmost responsibility to keep our word to their families and help them during these times    extending the length of time survivors can stay in military housing is the very least we can do   This effort gives these families greater flexibility as they grapple with the bigger issues  and shows them their country cares          Kerry and Levin amendment will ensure  100 000 death gratuity for all active duty deaths      There has been bipartisan support for improving the military death gratuity  The FY2005 Supplemental appropriation bill raised the benefit to  100 000 but did not include all non combat deaths  Under current law  the government provides a  100 000 gratuity to the survivors of those killed in combat or in training accidents  but provides only  12 000 to those who might collapse during physical exercise or die in a car accident while traveling to or from work   The Kerry Levin amendment provides a uniform  100 000 gratuity to all who die in uniform       The amendment further makes the gratuity retroactive to October 7  2001       Kerry said     We can not put a price on human life  but we owe it to our troops and military families to ensure that the family of any soldier who dies serving our nation has the means provided to them to get their lives back on track          Kerry amendment demands accountability on secret prisons  Forces administration to allow Congressional oversight      In an overwhelming rebuke to the Bush administration   s attempt to hide alleged CIA secret prisons from Congress  the Senate voted 82 9 in favor of an amendment by John Kerry that will require the Director of National Intelligence to report on the reported clandestine detention facilities   The Kerry Amendment requires classified reports to Congress providing a full accounting on any clandestine prison or detention facility operated by the United States government  regardless of its location          I don   t have any doubt in the American public   s determination to win the War on Terror   But I do know that any administration that tries to keep Congress in the dark damages the cause for which we are all fighting   This is about common sense oversight and accountability   Kerry said        Kerry legislation will assist small businesses hurt by drought      Kerry  the lead Democrat on the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship  also announced the Senate approved his Small Business Drought Relief Act  which will ensure small businesses damaged by drought have access to low interest loans through the Small Business Administration  SBA    The legislation would provide emergency aid to non farm related small businesses suffering from severe drought conditions   It has received widespread bipartisan support among governors and small businesses          Small businesses devastated by droughts shouldn t have to struggle against an unresponsive SBA bureaucracy   Kerry said   The SBA has ignored the damage droughts do to fishing guides  marinas  bait and tackle shops  and all kinds of small businesses  My amendment cuts through the red tape to get these businesses the loans they should already have had access to long ago         Kerry legislation will allow small businesses to apply to multiple award contracts      Kerry   s effort will ensure that small businesses have access to more federal contracts  even if they are combined in multiple awards  by allowing the Small Business Reserve to apply to multiple award contracts  including federal supply schedules        Kerry said     This much needed protection creates opportunities for small businesses to participate in federal contracting through Multiple Award Contracts and Federal Supply Schedules   This is an arena where small businesses have previously been locked out          Kerry legislation will encourage high tech innovation R       Kerry was successful in including language that encourages the transfer of technologies from the research phase of the Small Business Innovation Research  SBIR  program to the commercialization phase  This will help small high tech firms bring new products and innovations to the marketplace  It also allows up to 1 percent of SBIR funds to be used for this effort       Kerry said     America   s competitive advantage in the global business arena is the ability to rapidly bring new technologies to market   This pilot program will help small high tech firms    the hot beds of innovation in our economy    get their new technologies to market faster   The sooner these products are available  the sooner we will all benefit from their discoveries           Kerry legislation encourages Cooperation on improved radio frequency identifier technology    Kerry   s effort will require that the Army to report on their efforts to include small businesses as they re organize the supply chain using radio frequency identifier technology    Kerry said     As the Army continues to reorganize their supply chain  it is essential that small businesses are not left behind   The impact of such a large scale reorganization should include a significant outreach effort to ensure that small businesses are able to sustain their valuable role as suppliers to the Department of Defense
