John Kerry  D Mass   sent a letter to President Bush urging him to assist in providing free credit monitoring services to the more than 26 million veterans affected by the recent theft of personal data   Kerry is asking that the government take responsibility for protecting these veterans against the possible risk of identity theft and fraud        Last week  John Kerry introduced the Veterans Identity Protection  VIP  Act which would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide one year of free credit monitoring to affected veterans and an additional free credit report for the following two years   Kerry has asked President Bush to direct the VA Secretary to start negotiations with credit monitoring services to reach a fair price for this service for our veterans  which will be paid for by the government      Below is a copy of the letter      June 1  2006     The Honorable George W  Bush    The President    The White House    1600 Pennsylvania Avenue    Washington  DC  20500     Dear Mr  President      I write today to ask you to come to the aid of America   s veterans   Last week we learned that the personal data   including names  dates of birth  and social security numbers   of more than 26 million veterans has been stolen      As a result  these veterans are now at risk for identity theft and consumer fraud  The theft of these records may compromise their credit reports  and lead to debt  and legal issues for years      In statements last week  Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson urged America   s veterans to monitor their credit reports for unusual activity   Mr  President  the burden of vigilance should not rest with the American veteran or with his or her family   It rests with the entity that put the data at risk of theft and misuse  the government of the United States      Last week I introduced S 2970  the Veterans Identity Protection  VIP  Act to ensure that the government takes responsibility for protecting the identities of those put at risk by the theft of veterans    personal data   This legislation would require the VA to provide one year of free credit monitoring to those affected by the data loss   After the first year  affected individuals would also be eligible for one additional free credit report each year for two years in addition to that report provided under the Fair Credit Reporting Act      The cost of this legislation is not insignificant and would require an additional supplemental appropriation for the already strapped VA budget   But I believe that the cost of this service could be drastically reduced if the VA Secretary entered into negotiations with credit monitoring services to reduce their fees  Already we have seen major credit monitoring services offer reduced fees to veterans in response to this theft      I invite you to take up this issue for America   s veterans   In the week that we mark Memorial Day and the countless acts of courage and sacrifice by veterans in our nation   s history  the very least we can do is come together as Americans to make sure we protect the identity security of those who have defended our national security   I urge you and your VA Secretary to initiate discussions with the credit monitoring services to achieve a fair fee for service in which the government assumes responsibility for this liability      Mr  President  don   t make this a problem for America   s veterans to solve   From World War to Cold War and the War on Terror they have solved so many of America   s biggest problems   Let   s take action now to solve this one for them      Sincerely      John F  Kerry     CC       Richard F  Smith                Chairman and CEO                Equifax                 Michael R  Stanfield                Chairman
