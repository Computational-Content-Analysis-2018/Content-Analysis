                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In the far northeast corner of Alaska lies one of America   s great natural treasures  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  Its 19 million acres comprise one of the last places on earth where an intact expanse of arctic and subarctic lands remain protected  It is considered the crown jewel of America   s National Wildlife Refuge System  And yet this truly undisturbed wilderness    a last vestige of the American frontier that helped shape and define our national identity    is today in grave danger of being destroyed by those seeking whatever oil might lie beneath its fragile tundra       The focus on drilling in the Arctic refuge has been a distraction from real energy solutions that would actually decrease our dependence on foreign sources  protect the environment  and help consumers  The U S  has approximately three percent of the world s oil reserve but consumes 25 percent of the world s oil  We cannot drill our way out of dependence on foreign oil   Instead  Senator Kerry believes we must put America on the path towards energy independence by increasing energy conservation and creating clean  renewable sources of energy that no terrorist can sabotage and no foreign government can seize        Drilling the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge      Nestled between the jagged peaks of the Brooks Range and the shores of the Arctic Ocean  the Coastal Plain    just 5 percent of Alaska   s North Slope    is the only fragment of America   s arctic coastline not already opened to oil exploration and drilling  The United States Geological Survey scientists estimate that there is very likely only enough oil under the Arctic Refuge to supply America   s needs for six months  And the oil companies themselves admit that the oil would not be available for at least ten years           Why is the Arctic Refuge Worth Saving       Such a broad spectrum of diverse habitats occurring within a single protected unit is unparalleled in North America  Blanketed with snow for much of the year  the Coastal Plain explodes with life during the brief spring and summer months  earning the nickname of  America   s Serengeti        The Porcupine River herd of 129 000 caribou gathers annually on the Coastal Plain to bear and nurse their young  Polar bears rely on the Coastal Plain of the Refuge as their most important on land denning habitat on American soil  Musk oxen  grizzly bears  wolves  wolverines  foxes  golden eagles  and snowy owls gather here to hunt and den    In the fall  the Coastal Plain of the Refuge supports up to 300 000 snow geese which detour to feed from their nesting grounds in Canada  Millions of other birds use the Arctic Refuge to nest and as a critical staging area before journeying through every state            An Ancient People Depend On This Land      The Arctic Refuge supports more than just wildlife  For a thousand generations  the Gwich   in people of Northeast Alaska and Northwest Canada have depended upon the Porcupine  River  caribou herd to sustain their culture  The herd is central to their way of life  providing food  clothing  and a critical link to their traditional ways  To the Gwich   in people  the Coastal Plain is sacred ground             A Brief Look At the History of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge      Created by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1960 and expanded when President Jimmy Carter signed the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act  ANILCA   America s Arctic Refuge has been one of the greatest conservation legacies of both Republican and Democratic administrations       The Arctic Refuge was established to conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their natural diversity  fulfill the international treaty obligations of the US with respect to fish and wildlife and their habitats  provide the opportunity for local residents to continue their subsistence way of life  and to protect water quality and quantity       The US Fish and Wildlife Service  which manages the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  today calls it  the only conservation system unit that protects  in an undisturbed condition  a complete spectrum of the arctic ecosystems in North America
