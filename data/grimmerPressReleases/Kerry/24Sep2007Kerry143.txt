and Edward Kennedy  Congressmen Barney Frank and James McGovern  along with Governor Deval Patrick today announced the passage of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Financing Act  offered by Senator Kerry during the Finance Committees consideration of the American Infrastructure Investment and Improvement Act  This amendment will provide federal tax credit bonds to make it easier for states to finance intercity passenger rail capital projects    The measure is designed to make bonds more accessible for states that are desperate to improve their rail corridors  Increased rail travel has a number of benefits  including big savings for states  as they provide a greener  more efficient way to travel  Last week  the Texas Transportation Institute published a study showing that highway congestion costs our economy  78 billion annually  and 2 9 billion gallons of wasted fuel    This will give Massachusetts access to much needed funding to strengthen and expand our railway infrastructure  Senator Kerry said  Investing in mass transportation eases congestion  saves gas  is better for the environment and improves productivity  As our state moves forward on expanding commuter rail service on the South Shore  this is a perfect time to make investments in Massachusetts rail system and provide more riders with faster  safer service    Senator Kennedy said  Safe and efficient rail service is vital to the Commonwealths economy and environment in the years ahead  These tax credit bonds will provide a convenient and efficient way for states to obtain the funds they need for such projects  and Im sure theyll be of significant benefit to the Commonwealth in upgrading our commuter rail system    Working to obtain the funding for commuter rail service to New Bedford and Fall River is a very high priority for all of us  and success will require a combination of efforts  Senator Kerrys amendment is one example of our commitment to expanded federal support for passenger rail improvements  said Congressman Frank    It is essential that the federal government do more to facilitate rail travel  Rep  McGovern said  I am particularly interested in increasing commuter rail service in Massachusetts  I applaud Sen  Kerry for his leadership on this issue in the Finance Committee    Expanded rail service is a vital component to strengthening the Commonwealths economy  to protecting our environment  and to improving the lives of our citizens  Governor Patrick said  Recognizing this  our administration has taken steps to bring rail service to the South Coast and to improve existing rail lines  I thank Senator Kerry  Senator Kennedy and our Congressional delegation for their commitment to improving rail service for all residents of Massachusetts    Specifically  the Kerry amendment will create federal tax credit qualified infrastructure bonds and provide authority to the states to issue such bonds for the purpose of financing passenger rail capital projects  Bonds could be issued by a state or a group of states and bondholders would be entitled to an annual credit towards their federal tax liability in lieu of interest payments from the bond issuer  The term of the bonds would not exceed 15 years and the bond issuer is solely responsible for full repayment of the principle associated with any bonds issued  States would be authorized to issue up to  900 million of qualified rail infrastructure bonds  per year  during calendar FY 2008 2010  Bond proceeds must be used for intercity rail capital and equipments acquisition projects contained within a state rail plan    The amendment is offset by the following  1  Modifications to tax rules for individuals who expatriate 2  Repeal suspension of interest for certain fines and penalties  3  Denial of deduction for certain fines  penalties and other amounts    The amendment will modify the American Infrastructure Investment and Improvement Act and is endorsed by the National Association of Railroad Passengers    The amendment was included in the American Infrastructure Investment and Improvement Act which was approved by the Senate Finance Committee and is endorsed by the National Association of Railroad Passengers    The amendment was based on a proposal supported by Sens  Trent Lott  R Miss    Frank Lautenberg of  D  N J   and Arlen Specter  R Pa
