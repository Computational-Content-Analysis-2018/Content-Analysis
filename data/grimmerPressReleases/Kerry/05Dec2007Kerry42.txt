Senators John Kerry  D Mass   and John Ensign  R Nev   led a bipartisan group of legislators today to introduce a bill that would expedite the adoption of electronic prescribing technology in every doctors office in America  Prescribing electronically instead of by hand has been proven to save lives and cut costs on a massive scale  As a result of prescription errors  American hospital patients are hit with 1 5 million injuries each year  according to the Institute of Medicine  Medication errors will kill at least 7 000 Americans in 2007  Of the more than three billion prescriptions written each year  doctors report nearly one billion require a follow up between providers and pharmacies for clarification  The health care system costs are in the billions  Kerrys bill would foster the adoption of e prescribing by providing permanent Medicare funding for payment bonuses to physicians who acquire e prescribing technology  In addition  for every Medicare prescription a doctor writes electronically  they will be paid an extra 1  bonus  Starting in 2011  Medicare physicians who are not electronically prescribing would face financial penalties  The bill is being sponsored by Senators Kerry and Ensign along with Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   and Mel Martinez  R FL  in the Senate  and Representatives Allyson Schwartz  D Penn   and Jon Porter  R Nev   in the House  E prescribing will save money  save time  save doctors from piles of paperwork  and most importantly  save lives  said Sen  Kerry  Deaths and injuries from hand written prescriptions could be nearly eliminated if e prescriptions were adopted on a wide scale  We need to seize this bi partisan opportunity and make this common sense reform a reality now  With this bill  we re helping to bring our healthcare system into the 21st Century in a way that will result in fewer mistakes and lower costs  said Sen  Ensign  Doctors and medical professionals should utilize the best of today s technology to improve patient safety and advance our quality of health care  E prescribing is an easy solution that will save lives  time and money  Study after study shows that e prescribing saves dollars and more importantly saves lives  said Sen  Stabenow  This legislation provides doctors with the tools they need to implement this readily available technology  Michigan businesses  doctors and pharmacies have been at the forefront of implementing e prescribing and I am proud that Michigan s success will serve as a model for national success  This will put us on the track to reducing medical errors  lowering health care costs  and improving the overall quality of patient care  said Sen  Martinez  E prescribing opens the door to other bold initiatives including more widespread use of electronic health records for every American  E prescribing is a common sense  much needed solution to help eliminate preventable prescription errors and make medicine in America the safest it can be  said Rep  Schwartz  Congress has a responsibility to be forward thinking  as well as practical  in how we encourage greater use of technology in healthcare and this bill is a key step forward in the right direction  E prescribing is a necessary and constructive step to move our health care system into the 21st Century  said Rep  Porter  With the adoption of e prescribing technology many lives will be saved  fewer errors will occur and the quality of patients care will drastically improve  Specifically  the bill would  1  Provide permanent Medicare funding for one time grants to physicians to help offset the start up costs to physicians of acquiring and implementing e prescribing technology  2  Provide permanent Medicare funding for payment bonuses to physicians for use of e prescribing  For every Medicare prescription that is written electronically  physicians will be paid an extra 1  bonus  3  Starting on Jan 1  2011  physicians will be required to write their Medicare outpatient prescriptions electronically  Physicians that continue to write prescriptions by hand will face a per claim financial penalty  4  The Secretary of HHS will be given authority to grant one  or two year hardship waivers for physicians who face particular difficulties in acquiring and implementing e prescribing  especially those from rural areas or very small  or solo  practices 5  GAO and CMS will be directed to report within two years on the status of e prescribing adoption within Medicar                                                                             20510
