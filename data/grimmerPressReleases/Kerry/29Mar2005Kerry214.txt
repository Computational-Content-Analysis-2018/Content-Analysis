                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The debate on the federal budget should remind all Americans that Washington is not working for them        If the president gets his way  Western Massachusetts residents should prepare themselves for cuts in everything from home heating assistance to vocational education to law enforcement        The votes were more than ticks in the won loss column  they were assaults on our nation s values  Honesty  opportunity and responsibility were all cut from this budget  These cuts should give us all cause for concern  because in the end  budgets are a statement of your priorities  They are your values backed up by dollars and cents        When considering the budget of the U S   honesty at minimum means actually counting every dollar we plan to spend  It sounds simple  it s what every American does  but this budget doesn t do it        Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will cost at least  400 billion over 10 years  That s not in the budget  The President s Social Security scheme will cost another  750 billion over 10 years  That s not in the budget  The budget ignores interest on the debt  which not even the most creative accountant would leave out        This budget is like an Enron budget    smoke the numbers  cook the books  hide the truth and hope no one finds out  When Enron went bust  stockholders were the losers  When this budget goes bust  the American taxpayer will be the loser  They ll lose because this budget does exactly what Enron did  makes irresponsible choices the administration does not want you to know about        The responsible choice would be to honor those who have worn our nation s uniform  but the administration made a different choice  They re raising veterans  health care fees by  250 a year while cutting taxes for millionaires  They welcome home our troops with  2 6 billion in unanticipated co payments and fees instead of cracking down on offshore tax shelters  The result of these irresponsible choices  in Massachusetts alone more than 22 000 veterans could be forced to leave the VA health care system  including 7 600 active patients  Some in Washington may be quick to embrace the symbols of patriotism with words  but too often deeds lag behind        Responsibility also means keeping our nation on sound financial footing for the long run  but the Congressional Budget Office estimates we ll be facing more than  5 trillion in new debt because of this president  These debts not only hurt your children in the future   they hurt you and every family today  Almost eight cents of every tax dollar goes just toward paying interest on the debt  By contrast  you only pay about two cents on the dollar for education  The sum of  160 billion goes to interest on the debt  not to giving health care to every child  fully funding No Child Left Behind  securing our energy independence or funding a military family s bill of rights  Eight cents on the dollar is a lot of money  and it s not buying you more security and it s not buying your kids a better education  On the other hand  bankers in Japan and Korea and Taiwan are benefiting  and you should be worried about it        The American people also deserve a budget that keeps faith with the promise of opportunity for all  special privileges for none  One of the dangers in tight fiscal times is you start hearing a lot of empty talk about tough choices that are really nothing more than excuses to destroy opportunity  We heard the excuses from the administration during the recession  we heard them during the war  and we ve heard plenty more excuses during this budget debate        The administration makes a number of  tough choices  in this budget under the guise of fiscal restraint  The budget gives a huge tax cut to people making more than  1 million a year  but cuts heating aid and vocational education in Massachusetts by more than  20 million  The budget wastes billions of dollars in corporate loopholes  while almost 28 000 students across the state could be kicked out of after school programs  The budget wastes billions more in offshore tax shelters  but cuts Even Start literacy programs in Springfield  Holyoke  Northampton  Greenfield  Pittsfield  Orange and across the commonwealth  The Safe and Drug Free School Program is completely eliminated        There is not a tough choice in the list above  and there can be no excuse  The people deserve better  and that starts by demanding our leadership do a better job budgeting our cherished values of honesty  responsibility  and opportunity
