24      On March 22 The Washington Post reported that the Bush Administration  in finalizing its recently released mercury rules  had failed to consider a report by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis that estimated much higher levels of benefits from controlling mercury emissions from power plants   The Harvard study estimated  5 billion per year in potential public health benefits 15 years from now by cutting mercury pollution from coal burning power plants in half  compared to EPA s estimate of up to only  50 million a year   EPA estimated the cost of the cleanup to utilities and their customers to be  750 million a year in 2020   On Thursday  a further news report by Inside EPA revealed that an EPA water office report had reached similar conclusions and had encouraged the Agency to consider the cardiovascular benefits  as well as the neurological benefits  of controlling mercury   U S  Senators Patrick Leahy  D Vt    James Jeffords  I Vt   and the Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee   Barbara Boxer  D Calif   and John Kerry  D Mass   Thursday asked Acting EPA Administrator Stephen L  Johnson for an explanation of the omissions  and they sharply criticized the Administration for disregarding these analyses before finalizing the rules   In their letter to Administrator Johnson  the senators also asked him to stay implementation of the rules until the Harvard study   s results now can be considered   The text of the senators    letter follows  below        March 24  2005        The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson      Acting Administrator      U S Environmental Protection Agency       1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W       Washington  D C  20460       Dear Administrator Johnson        It was both troubling and disheartening to learn from this week   s Washington Post article that the Environmental Protection Agency omitted consideration of a key piece of analysis  conducted by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis  from the mercury rules finalized last week   It appears that EPA excluded consideration of the Harvard study because these findings estimated far greater health benefits  including cardiovascular benefits  from regulating mercury emissions from power plants than the Administration asserted in one of the final rules   The Agency did so even though there was a study done by the EPA water office that found similar results and emphasized the economic benefits of reducing mercury s cardiovascular effects   We would like a full explanation of why this failure occurred  including whether you were aware of the Harvard study results and consented to disregarding its findings          We know that you  as a scientist and a career EPA employee  understand how important it is that the Agency   s rulemaking process be as transparent  credible and objective as possible   Unfortunately  the Agency   s dismissal of the Harvard study is yet another example of the irregular practices the Administration employed to manipulate these rules   From the beginning  the Administration has ignored scientific evidence  technological opportunities and economic analyses that clearly show much more effective and expeditious mercury controls are warranted and feasible   Criticisms by the Government Accountability Office and the EPA Inspector General remain unanswered   Commitments by your predecessors  both Administrators Whitman and Leavitt  to do a full analysis of mercury control options were not kept        Instead  it is obvious that the Administration sought above all to maintain its story line and to adhere to industry assertions that stronger controls could not be implemented because of cost concerns and questionable health benefits   The Harvard study and other recent reports fundamentally challenge these claims   The study was paid for by EPA and peer reviewed by EPA scientists   The report estimates health benefits of up to  4 9 billion if mercury emissions are reduced to only to 15 tons   This health benefits analysis  which is so central to the rulemaking  should have sounded alarm bells for you and others at the Agency before the mercury rules were finalized   The fact that it was not even considered by EPA raises still more questions about what other relevant information was disregarded by your Agency   It is only from the press     not from you or the Administration     that Congress and the American people learned that EPA disregarded this report         In a recent letter to you  we and 26 of our colleagues in the U S  Senate expressed our concern about EPA   s rulemaking process   This latest breach only underscores those concerns   We hope that you will recognize that the Administration   s mishandling of the mercury rules     including this serious omission     is risking the Agency   s credibility  and  most importantly  the performance of its mandate to protect public health and the environment   We urge you to ask the Inspector General to look into this and possible other irregularities that occurred in the final weeks of the rulemaking process   If you are to be confirmed as the next Administrator  the Senate needs to know that the scientific and procedural integrity of the rulemaking process at EPA will be restored under your tenure          In addition  because this report   s findings are so central to these rules  we urge you to personally stay the rules until the findings are considered   The Agency should also postpone implementation of the rule until it quantifies the benefits of mercury reductions with respect to cardiovascular impacts and marine fish consumption   With all of the questions that this omission raises  we think it is entirely appropriate to use your authority under the Clean Air Act to stay the rule until these benefits are considered        This breach and the concerns it raises are serious  and they deserve full and prompt answers   We ask that you respond by April 13         Sincerely
