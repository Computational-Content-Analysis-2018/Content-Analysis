introduced his Afghanistan Sense of the Senate Resolution today  heeding the calls of the commanders on the ground in Afghanistan who are urgently asking for more troops to fend off an impending Taliban offensive  The bill also seeks to prevent any troops stationed in Afghanistan from being siphoned from Taliban strongholds to support the White House escalation of the war in Iraq  Kerry argued that sending more troops into the middle of civil war in Iraq against the advice of our military commanders  and at the expense of a fortification in Afghanistan  would be a grave mistake  For too long  this White House has ignored the growing resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan  Kerry said  Our own generals tell us that the Taliban is freshly emboldened  the instability and corruption are still major problems  that opium production continues to increase  and that our forces on the ground in Afghanistan are stretched beyond all reasonable limits  Rather than looking at whether he can move troops from Afghanistan to bolster a misguided effort in Iraq  he should be surging troops and economic assistance into Afghanistan where the original 9 11 terrorists masterminded their attacks on U S  soil  In the resolution  Kerry notes that Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding in the mountains on the Afghanistan Pakistan border  and that only by partnering with the government in Afghanistan can the U S  make progress in the ongoing effort to eliminate the Taliban  Finally  the resolution says that the U S  should strengthen efforts to establish peace and stability in Afghanistan  The non binding resolution is intended to restore attention on Afghanistan  which Kerry believes has long been neglected by the President   Below is the text of Kerrys Afghanistan Sense of the Senate Resolution  Calling for the strengthening of the efforts of the United States to defeat the Taliban and terrorist networks in Afghanistan    Whereas  global terrorist networks  including the al Qaeda organization that attacked the United States on September 11  2001  continue to threaten the security of the United States and are recruiting new members and developing the capability and plans to attack the United States and its allies throughout the world  Whereas  a democratic  stable  and prosperous Afghanistan is a vital security interest of the United States  Whereas  stability in Afghanistan is being threatened by antigovernment and Taliban forces that seek to disrupt political and economic developments throughout the country  Whereas Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri  the leaders of al Qaeda  are still at large and are reportedly hiding somewhere in the Afghanistan Pakistan border region  Whereas  in September 2006  Afghan President Hamid Karzai said that The same enemies that blew up themselves in   the twin towers in America are still around  Whereas  according to U S  military intelligence officials  Taliban attacks on U S   allied and Afghan forces increased from 1 558 in 2005 to 4 542 in 2006  suicide bomb attacks in Afghanistan increased from 27 in 2005 to 139 in 2006  roadside bomb attacks more than doubled from 783 in 2005 to 1 677 in 2006  and cross border attacks from Pakistan into Afghanistan have increased by 300  since September of 2006  Whereas  on September 2  2006  the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported that in 2006 opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan increased 59  over 2005 levels and reached a record high  Whereas  the Administrations current request for United States economic assistance to Afghanistan for FY 2007 is approximately 33  of the amount appropriated for FY 2006  Whereas  only 50  of the money pledged by the international community for Afghanistan between 2002 and 2005 has actually been delivered  Whereas  on September 12  2006  the United States Secretary of State said an Afghanistan that does not complete its democratic evolution and become a stable  terror fighting state is going to come back to haunt usIt will come back to haunt our successors and their successorsIf we should have learned anything  it is if you allow that kind of vacuum  if you allow a failed state in that strategic location  you re going to pay for it  Whereas  the bipartisan Iraq Study Group Report concluded that  If the Taliban were to control more of Afghanistan  it could provide al Qaeda with the political space to conduct terrorist operations  This development would destabilize the region and have national security implications for the United States and other countries around the world  Whereas  the Iraq Study Group Report recommended that the President provide additional political  economic  and military support for Afghanistan  including resources that might become available as combat forces are redeployed from Iraq  Whereas  the Iraq Study Group specifically recommended that the United States meet the request of General James Jones  then United States NATO commander  for more troops to combat the resurgence of al Qaeda and Taliban forces in Afghanistan  Whereas  on October 8  2006  General David Richards  NATO s top commander in Afghanistan  warned that a majority of Afghans would likely switch their allegiance to resurgent Taliban militants if their lives show no visible improvements in the next six months  Whereas  on January 6  2007  Army Brigadier General Anthony J  Tata stated that the shortage of troops in Afghanistan could create a strategic high risk  a strategic threat to the United States and an operational threat to the elected Afghan government of Hamid Karzai  Whereas  on January 15  2007  United States Secretary of Defense Robert M  Gates stated that there were indications that the Taliban were planning a large spring offensive against U S  troops and NATO forces  Whereas  on January 16  2007  Lieutenant General Karl Eikenberry  the senior American commander in Afghanistan  asked to extend the deployment of an American battalion in Afghanistan that was scheduled to be redeployed to Iraq  Whereas  on January 17  2007  General Richards stated that unmet pledges of troops and equipment from NATO countries have left him 10 to 15 percent short of the forces he requires  saying  Clearly  there is a need to fulfill those commitments  Whereas  on January 17  2007  Secretary of Defense Robert M  Gates stated that United States military commanders in Afghanistan have requested additional United States troops for Afghanistan  and stated that he was sympathetic to this request  Whereas  the United States currently has approximately 21 000 troops in Afghanistan  approximately 1 7 of the number of United States troops currently deployed to Iraq  Whereas  the President of the United States has announced plans to send approximately 21 500 additional United States troops to Iraq  Whereas if the United States does not strengthen efforts to defeat the Taliban and to create long term stability in Afghanistan  Afghanistan will become what it was before the September 11  2001  terrorist attacks  a haven for those who seek to harm the United States  and a source of instability that threatens the security of the United States  Now  therefore  be it Resolved  that it is the sense of the Senate that  1  The United States must strengthen its commitment to establishing long term stability and peace in Afghanistan   2  The President should not reduce the total number of United States troops serving in Afghanistan in order to increase the total number of United States troops serving in Iraq   3  The United States  in partnership with the International Security Assistance Force and the Government of Afghanistan  should immediately increase its efforts to eradicate the Taliban  terrorist organizations and criminal networks currently operating in Afghanistan  including by increasing United States military personnel as requested by United States military commanders in Afghanistan   4  The United States  in support of the Government of Afghanistan  should significantly increase the amount of economic assistance available for reconstruction  social and economic development  counter narcotics efforts  and democracy promotion activities in Afghanistan   5  The United States should work aggressively to encourage members of the international community to deliver on the financial pledges they have made to support development and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan                                                                                20510
