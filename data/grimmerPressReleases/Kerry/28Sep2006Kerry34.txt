from the Senate floor today in opposition to the Senate    compromise    on torture     Mr  KERRY   Mr  President   The last week before we leave for a long recess is always extraordinarily busy   particularly when an election is only 42 days away   Sadly  it   s too often part of how business is done in this institution            Today  the leadership of the Senate has decided that legislation that will directly impact America   s moral authority in the world merits only a few hours of debate   I am talking about moral authority that is essential to waging and winning a war on terror  and that is critical to the safety of American troops who may be captured          If  in a few hours  we squander that moral authority  blur lines that have for decades been absolute  then no speech  no rhetoric  no promise can restore it           Four years ago  we were at a similar situation  An Iraq War Resolution was rushed through the Senate because of election year politics     a political calendar  not a statesman   s calendar  Four years later the price we are paying is clear for saying to a President and an administration that we would trust them  Four years later  there is enough blame to go around and each of us must assume our share of the responsibility            But today we face a different choice     it is to prevent an irreversible mistake  not to correct one  It is to stand up and be counted so that election year politics do not further compromise our moral authority and the safety of our troops            Every Senator must ask him or herself  does the bill before us treat Americas    moral authority as a national asset that does not limit our power but magnifies our influence  Does it make clear that the United States government recognizes beyond any doubt that the protections of the Geneva Convention have to be applied to prisoners in order to comply with the law  restore our moral authority  and best protect American troops   Does it make clear that the United States does not engage in torture    period           Mr  President  a veteran of the Iraq War whom I know  Paul Rieckhoff  wrote something the other day that every Senator ought to think about as they wrestle with this bill           He wrote that he was taught at Fort Benning  Georgia about the importance of the Geneva Conventions  He didn   t know what it meant until he arrived in Baghdad  Paul wrote         America   s moral integrity was the single most important weapon my platoon had on the streets of Iraq  It saved innumerable lives  encouraged cooperation with our allies and deterred Iraqis from joining the growing insurgency  But those days are over  America   s moral standing has eroded  thanks to its flawed rationale for war and scandals like Abu Ghraib  Guant  namo and Haditha  The last thing we can afford now is to leave Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions open to reinterpretation  as President Bush proposed to do and can still do under the compromise bill that emerged last week             We each need to ask ourselves  in the rush to find a    compromise    we can all embrace  are we strengthening Americas    moral authority or eroding it  Are we on the sides of the thousands of Paul Rieckhoffs in uniform today  or are we making their mission harder and even worse  putting them in greater danger if they are captured          Paul writes eloquently         If America continues to erode the meaning of the Geneva Conventions  we will cede the ground upon which to prosecute dictators and warlords  We will also become unable to protect our troops if they are perceived as being no more bound by the rule of law than dictators and warlords themselves  The question facing America is not whether to continue fighting our enemies in Iraq and beyond but how to do it best  My soldiers and I learned the hard way that policy at the point of a gun cannot  by itself  create democracy  The success of America   s fight against terrorism depends more on the strength of its moral integrity than on troop numbers in Iraq or the flexibility of interrogation options             Mr  President  I wish I could say this compromise serves Americas    moral mission and protects our troops  But it doesn   t  No eloquence we can bring to this debate can change what this bill fails to do           We have been told in press reports that it is a great compromise between the White House and my good friends  Senator McCain  Senator Warner  and Senator Graham  We have been told that it protects the    integrity and letter and sprit of the Geneva Conventions               I wish that what we are being told is true   It is not  Nothing in the language of the bill supports these claims   Let me be clear about something   something that it seems few people are willing to say   This bill permits torture   This bill gives the President the discretion to interpret the meaning and application of the Geneva Conventions   This bill gives an administration that lobbied for torture exactly what it wanted          We are supposed to believe that there is an effective check on this expanse of presidential power with the requirement that the President   s interpretations be published in the Federal Register            We shouldn   t kid ourselves  Let   s assume the President publishes his interpretation of permissible acts under the Geneva Convention   The interpretation  like the language in this bill  is vague and inconclusive   A concerned Senator or Congresswoman calls for oversight   Unless he or she is in the majority at the time  there won   t be a hearing   Let   s assume they are in the majority and get a hearing   Do we really think a bill will get through both houses of Congress   A bill that directly contradicts a Presidential interpretation of a matter of nation security   My guess is that it won   t happen  but maybe it will   Assume it does   The bill has no effect until the President actually signs it   So  unless the President chooses to reverse himself  all the power remains in the President   s hands  And all the while  Americas    moral authority is in tatters  American troops are in greater jeopardy  And the war on terror is setback          Could the President   s power grab be controlled by the courts   After all  it was the Supreme Court   s decision in Hamdan that invalidated the President   s last attempt to consolidate power and establish his own military tribunal system   The problem now is that the bill strips the courts the power to hear such a case when says    no person may invoke the Geneva Conventions       in any habeas or civil action               What are we left with   Unfettered presidential power to interpret what   other than the statutorily proscribed    grave violations      violates the Geneva Conventions   No wonder the President was so confident that his CIA program could continue as is   He gets to keep setting the rules     rules his Administration has spent years now trying to blur          Presidential discretion is not the only problem   The definitions of what constitute    grave breaches    of Article 3 are murky   Even worse  they are not consistent with either the Detainee Treatment Act or the recently revised Army Field Manuel   These documents prohibit    cruel  inhuman  or degrading treatment     defined as    the cruel  unusual  and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth  Eight  and Fourteenth Amendments      The definition is supported by an extensive body of case law evaluating what treatment is required by our constitutional standards of    dignity  civilization  humanity  decency  and fundamental fairness      And  I think quite tellingly  it is substantially similar the definition that my good friend  Senator McCain  chose to include in his bill   And there is simply no reason why the standard adopted by the Army Field Manual and the Detainee Treatment Act  which this Congress has already approved  should not apply for all interrogations in all circumstances            In the bill before us  however  there is no reference to any constitutional standards   The prohibition of degrading conduct has been dropped   And  there are caveats allowing pain and suffering    incidental to lawful sanctions      Nowhere does it tell us what    lawful sanctions    are            So  what are we voting for with this bill   We   re voting to give the President the power to interpret the Geneva Conventions   We   re voting to allow pain and suffering incident to some un defined lawful sanctions   The only guarantee we have that these provisions really will prohibit torture is the word of the President            The word of the President  I wish I could say the words of the President were enough on an issue as fundamental as torture  Fifty years ago  President Kennedy sent his Secretary of State abroad on a crisis mission     to prove to our allies that Soviet missiles were being held in Cuba  The Secretary of State brought photos of the missiles  As he prepared to take them from his briefcase  our ally  a foreign head of state said  simply     put them away  The word of the President of the United States is good enough for me             We each wish we lived in times like those   Perilous times  but times when Americas    moral authority  our credibility  were unquestioned   Unchallenged           But the word of the President today is questioned   This Administration said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq  that Saddam Hussein had ties to Al Qaeda  that they would exhaust diplomacy before we went to war  that the insurgency was in its last throes   None of these statements were true  and now we find our troops in the crossfire of civil war in Iraq with no end in sight   They keep saying the war in Iraq is making us safer  but our own intelligence agencies say it   s actually fanning the flames of jihad  creating a whole new generation of terrorists and putting our country at greater risk of terrorist attack  It is no wonder then that we are hesitant to blindly accept the word of the President on this question today           The President said he agreed with Senator McCain   s anti torture provisions in the Detainee Treatment Act  Yet  he issued a signing statement reserving the right to ignore them   He says flatly that    The United States does not torture        and then tries to bully Congress into allowing him to do exactly that   And even here  he has promised to submit his interpretations of the Geneva Convention to the Federal Register    yet his Press Secretary announced that the Administration may not need to comply with that requirement            We have seen the consequences of simply accepting the word of this Administration   No  the Senate can not just accept the word of this Administration that they will not engage in torture given the way in which everything they   ve already done and said on this most basic question has already put our troops at greater risk and undermined the very moral authority needed to win the war on terror  When the President says the United States doesn   t torture  there has to be no doubt about it   And when his words are unclear  Congress must step in to hold him to hold him accountable           Mr  President  the Administration will use fear to try and bludgeon anyone who disagrees with them           Just as they pretended Iraq is the central front in the war on terror even as their intelligence agencies told them their policy made terrorism worse  they will pretend America needs to squander its moral authority to win the war on terror          They are wrong  Profoundly wrong  The President   s experts have told him that not only does torture put our troops at risk and undermine our moral authority but torture does not work   As Lieutenant General John Kimmons  the Army   s deputy chief of staff for intelligence  put it        No good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices   I think history tells us that   I think the empirical evidence of the last five years  hard years  tell us that   Any piece of intelligence which is obtained under duress  through the use of abusive techniques  would be of questionable credibility   And additionally  it would do more harm than good when it inevitably became known that abusive practices were used   We can   t afford to go there             Neither justice nor good intelligence comes at the hands of torture   In fact  both depend on the rule of law   It would be wrong     tragically wrong     to authorize the President to require our sons and daughters to use torture for something that won   t even work     Another significant problem with this bill is the unconstitutional elimination of the writ of habeas corpus   No less a conservative than Ken Starr got it right     Congress should act cautiously to strike a balance between the need to detain enemy combatants during the present conflict and the need to honor the historic privilege of the writ of habeas corpus      Ken Starr says    Congress should act cautiously      How cautiously are we acting when we eliminate any right to challenge an enemy combatant   s indefinite detention   When we eliminate habeas corpus rights for aliens detained inside or outside the United States so long as the government believes they are enemy combatants   When we not only do this for future cases but apply it to hundreds of cases currently making their way through our court system            The Constitution is very specific when it comes to Habeas Corpus   It says     t he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended  unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it      We are not in a case of rebellion   Nor are we being invaded   Thus  we really don   t have the constitutional power to suspend the Great Writ   And  even if we did  the Constitution allows only for the writ to be suspended   It does not allow the Writ to be permanently taken away   Yet  this is exactly what the bill does   It takes the writ away   forever   from anyone the Administration determines is an    enemy combatant      Even if they are lawfully on US soil and otherwise entitled to full Constitutional protections and even if they have absolutely no other recourse              Think of what this means  This bill is giving the administration the power to pick up any non U S  citizen inside or outside of the United States  determine in their sole and unreviewable discretion that he is an unlawful combatant  and hold him in jail   be it Guantanamo Bay or a secret CIA prison   indefinitely   Once the Combatant Status Review Tribunal determines that person is an enemy combatant  that is the end of the story   even if the determination is based on evidence that even a military commission would not be allowed to consider because it is so unreliable   That person would never get the chance to challenge his detention  to prove that he is not  in fact  an enemy combatant          We are not talking about whether detainees can file a habeas suit because they don   t have access to the internet or cable television   We   re talking about something much more fundamental  whether people can be locked up forever without even getting the chance to prove that the government was wrong in detaining them   Allow this to become the policy of the United States and just imagine the difficulty our law enforcement and our government will have arranging the release of an American citizen the next time our citizens are detained in other countries          Mr  President  we all want to stop terrorist attacks   We all want to effectively gather as much intelligence as humanly possible   We all want to bring those who do attack us to justice   But  we weaken     not strengthen     our ability to do that when we undermine  our own Constitution  when we throw away our system of checks and balances  when we hold detainees indefinitely without trial by destroying the Writ of Habeas Corpus  and when we permit torture   We endanger our moral authority at our great peril  I oppose this legislation because it will make us less safe and less secure   I urge my colleagues to do the same           Thank you
