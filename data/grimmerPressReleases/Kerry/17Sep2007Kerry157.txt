in President s opposition to funding for low  and moderate  income communities

and Edward Kennedy expressed disappointment with proposed Bush Administration cuts to the Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  program  which assists cities and towns across Massachusetts with vital infrastructure funding  President Bush wants to slash CDBG funds by  735 million  The Senate already voted on the bill that includes CDBG funds  Bush has threatened to veto the measure because of his opposition to the increased funds for CDBG    I am tired of President Bush short changing Massachusetts cities and towns by opposing increases in CDBG funding  Mayors across Massachusetts depend on this funding to provide critically needed services that increase the quality of life of people who depend on it  To deliver anything less than the amount included in the Senate passed bill is breaking faith with cities and towns that are already strapped  said Senator Kerry  I strongly urge the President to reconsider his position     CDBG is a critical part of the Federal governments efforts to help more cities  urban areas  and states meet the needs of low  and moderate income communities  CDBG   an important tool for helping local governments tackle serious challenges facing their communities   funds a wide range of activities  including homeownership assistance  housing rehabilitation  public improvements  public services  and economic development projects     The CDBG program is a lifeline to our cities as they work to create new job opportunities  improve housing  and strengthen our quality of life  Senator Kennedy said  We should be expanding CDBG funding opportunities  and the Administrations hostility to the program must end     Boston Mayor Thomas Menino echoed the Senators concerns     It would be a travesty and incredibly shortsighted of President Bush to veto the first increase in CDBG funding in many years  Despite strong bi partisan support for the program  the Bush administration has tried every year to cut or even eliminate the program  In Boston  for example  our annual CDBG allocation has been cut by 20  since 2001  from  25 6 million in FY01 to just  20 4 million in FY07  CDBG is the most important Federal resource available to cities to address important issues such as affordable housing  first time homeownership  foreclosures  jobs and job training opportunities for youth  and services for our seniors and returning veterans  said Menino     The text of the letter is as follows     The President   The White House   Washington  D C  20001      Dear Mr  President     We are writing to express our strong disappointment with your opposition to appropriate funding for the Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  program in the Office of Management and Budgets Statement of Administration Policy on the Senate FY 2008 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies Appropriations bill     As you will recall  earlier this year your FY 2008 budget proposal cut funding for the Community Development Block Grants  CDBG  Program by  735 million  or 20 percent  from the  3 710 billion enacted in FY 2007  The Senate bill includes  4 06 billion for CDBG    less than the  4 18 billion passed by the House of Representatives earlier this year  However  neither the Senate nor House bills provide the  4 41 billion appropriated for CDBG back in FY 2001     CDBG is a critical part of the Federal governments efforts to help more than 1 100 entitlement cities  urban counties  and States meet the needs of low  and moderate income communities  CDBG   an important tool for helping local governments tackle serious challenges facing their communities   funds a wide range of activities  including homeownership assistance  housing rehabilitation  public improvements  public services  and economic development projects  According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development  over 95 percent of CDBG funding appropriated in FY 2006 went to activities principally benefiting low  and moderate income families  Finally  CDBG has helped create and retain 55 957 jobs in FY 2006 and provided vital public services to over 11 million persons     CDBG funds assist local communities by awarding grants to carry out community development activities  Such activities include mitigation assistance to help eliminate the default currently facing too many working families  The CDBG program has made a difference in the lives of millions of people and their communities across Massachusetts and indeed the Nation  For these reasons  we are extremely disappointed in your decision to oppose an appropriate level of funding for CDBG in FY 2008  We ask that you immediately reconsider your position     Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request     Sincerely     John F  Kerry    Edward M  Kennedy                                                                         20510
