Kerry and Edward Kennedy today  along with Congressmen James McGovern urged Elaine Chao  Secretary of Labor to investigate whether Quaker Fabric violated the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act  WARN  by not providing at least 60 days notice to its employees  Earlier this month  the Fall River manufacturing plant abruptly closed its doors prior to notifying its 900 employees        Kerry  Kennedy and McGovern have also urged the Department of Labor to provide federal assistance to the employees affected by the layoffs        Kerry today also announced he would co sponsor the FOREWARN Act of 2007  which requires a 90 day notification of plant closings  The legislation also allows employees to seek double back pay and authorizes the Department of Labor to bring suits against businesses that violate the WARN Act       I am deeply concerned about Quaker Fabrics decision not to give its 900 employees any advance notice before closing its plant  Im also disturbed by Quakers decision to terminate health benefits and severance packages  Had the company given some advance notice its workers would have at least been able to start looking for other jobs  Instead  they are out in the cold  said Senator Kerry  I strongly urge Secretary Chao to take a good  hard look at the way this closing was handled  Its imperative that we collect all the facts to determine whether Quaker violated the WARN Act so that its workers can decide whether to seek compensation       Layoffs of this scale can be devastating for workers families and for communities like Fall River  The effects are even harsher when companies fail to provide the notice required by the law  I urge the Department of Labor to do everything it can to assist these workers     including getting all the facts and finding out if Quaker did not fulfill its obligations  said Senator Kennedy       When I visited with Quaker Fabric workers this morning  I made it clear that I would do everything possible to ensure adequate federal help  Rep  McGovern said  I hope the Labor Department will look closely at this situation          The text of the letter is as follows           July 23  2007      The Honorable Elaine Chao   Secretary   Department of Labor   200 Constitution Avenue NW   Washington  DC 20210      Dear Secretary Chao       We are writing to request your assistance in determining whether Quaker Fabrics of Fall River  Massachusetts  violated federal law when it abruptly closed its manufacturing plant without having previously notified its 900 employees       As you know  the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act  WARN  requires businesses that employ 100 or more workers to provide at least 60 days advance notice prior to closing a plant  Quaker did not provide its workers any advance notice of the decision to close its plant  Two days after its workers were notified  Quaker released a WARN Act notice claiming a faltering business exemption which would absolve it of the advance notification requirement       We understand that the WARN Act exemption for faltering businesses is applicable so as long as a business believes in good faith that providing advance notice of a plant closing would compromise its ability to secure capital  However  the dearth of information available regarding Quakers decision to close its plant makes it is impossible to know whether its exemption claim is legitimate  It is imperative that its workers gain access to this information so that they can decide whether to seek back pay and benefits which is their right under the law  This is especially important given that Quaker has terminated worker health benefits and severance packages         As you can imagine  Quakers employees were stunned at the news of the plant closing and angry that they were not given any time to find another job  We owe it to them not only to provide financial and occupational training assistance during their transition but to hold their employer accountable they did not follow the law  We therefore urge you to take all appropriate steps to provide assistance to the affected workers  including helping them understand their rights under the WARN Act and the strict limitations imposed on employers attempting to claim an exemption under the Act  Furthermore  we request your assistance in gathering evidence and facts relating to the Quaker plant closing which would allow the affected employees to determine whether the WARN Act was violated        We thank you for your attention to this matter       Sincerely
