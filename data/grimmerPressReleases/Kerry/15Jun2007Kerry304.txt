Senator John Kerry  D Mass   and Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus  D Mont   led a bi partisan group of 43 senators in requesting an additional  430 million above President Bushs request for the Social Security Administration budget for FY08        The request is aimed at eliminating huge backlogs of disabled and elderly Americans who are currently waiting for benefits by allowing the SSA to hire more administrative staff to process claims  Last year  Congress restored  200 million in emergency funding to tackle this growing problem       Working Americans pay into Social Security their whole lives  and we owe them access to these benefits in a timely and efficient way  Senator Kerry said  This money will ensure that the SSA has the staff and resources it needs to fight growing backlogs  This is about keeping our promise to Americans who depend on Social Security benefits to survive and putting forth a smart budget to achieve that goal       Below is a copy of the letter sent to Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Harkin and Ranking Member Arlen Specter       Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter        We respectfully request that you include the FY 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  Education  and Related Agencies appropriations bill an additional  430 million above the President s request for the Social Security Administration s  SSA s  administrative expenses  per the recommendation set forth in the FY 2008 Budget Resolution Conference Report on S  Con  Res  21        Increased funding will enable the SSA to reduce the long delays applicants must endure before they receive their Social Security disability benefits  Currently  many applicants to the Social Security Disability Insurance  SSDI  program and the disability portion of the Supplemental Security Income  SSI  program face significant delays before receiving benefits  Indeed  waiting times can exceed three years in some cases  Such delays create serious or desperate financial situations for the applicants and their families  According to the SSA  about half of these waiting times result from the Agency s huge backlogs of initial claims and hearings before administrative law judges        As you know  these waiting times are a chief concern for many of our constituents and are a constant source of casework in Senate offices  By the end of FY 2007  the backlog of initial claims is projected to reach 577 000  and the number of cases pending for appeals hearings are expected to be 752 000  This backlog has increased  and will continue to increase  because the SSA has not had the funding it needs to hire sufficient staff to process cases and appeals        In recent years  Congress has increased the SSA s responsibilities  Today  the SSA is required to evaluate Medicare beneficiaries  incomes in order to determine whether their Part B premiums must be increased pursuant to current law  The SSA is also responsible for implementing a low income subsidy program to help individuals with limited incomes and assets obtain Medicare Part D coverage  Furthermore  the    implementation of the Intelligence Reform legislation has increased the SSA s workload        Given these concerns  we request that you include  430 million above the President s request for the SSA s administrative expenses  This money will enable the SSA to eliminate its backlogs for initial claims and appeals hearings in five years or less  Thank you in advance for consideration of this important issue       Sincerely       John F  Kerry  Olympia Snowe  Max
