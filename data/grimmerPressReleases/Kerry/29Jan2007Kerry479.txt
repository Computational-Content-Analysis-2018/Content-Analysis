Committee Testimony

appreciate your efforts as Chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee to highlight the most critical and far reaching challenge facing our nation  global climate change  For far too long  in the Senate and elsewhere  this issue has been neglected or pushed aside as unsolvable  incomprehensible  or simply someone else s problem   But the stakes could not be higher  and the reality could hardly be more stark         The issue of global warming has finally reached critical mass in America s public discussion   Suddenly  on a variety of fronts  it s moving toward its rightful place  front and center in the dialogue about our environment  our security and our economy   And your Committee  Senator Boxer   the hearings you re holding today and the progress they mark in our national debate   is right at the heart of that long overdue and very welcome change         I am also excited about the other opportunities we have in the Democratic controlled Senate  I look forward to working with Chairman Inouye to highlight important climate related issues in the Commerce Committee  And I also plan to hold hearings in the Small Business Committee to help raise awareness of the important role small business can plan in reducing greenhouse gas emissions         All of these efforts are critically important  Especially with things changing so rapidly   not only with the science but in the political landscape as well  Task number one has got to be ensuring access to the most accurate and up to date information        From the State of the Union to states across this country  from the Academy Awards to the National Academy of Sciences  people are finally waking up to see that we re in the middle of a crisis  and we have ten years to put our country on a different path before its too late        It was 1987   1987     when we first started talking about climate change  The Commerce Committee  under Senator Al Gore of Tennessee  held the first congressional hearings that year   And I ve been working on this issue ever since  In June 1992 I was part of a Senate delegation to the Earth Summit in Rio where I met with leaders from across the globe and discussed various ways to tackle this problem         At the time  there was a ray of international hope as well as a promise   The hope stemmed from a sense of relief that we had recognized the problem of climate change in time  and the promise was that as members of the global community we would commit ourselves to efforts to address it   The hope was translated into the Framework Convention on Climate Change  a treaty we adopted after the summit outlining how participating countries could stabilize greenhouse gas   The Senate approved it unanimously  and we all thought we were on the way to an unprecedented bipartisan implementation of visionary  responsible policy   That was fifteen years ago       Unfortunately  from a policy perspective little progress has been made  Instead we entered a period of procrastination and evasion  And more recently  under President Bush  of stonewalling unilateralism  of energy policy made by secret CEO task forces and trumped up industry funded  studies  that challenge the ever growing scientific consensus that the threat is real          Recently  however  the American people have begun demanding better  and politicians are actually listening   States are taking action    California passed a landmark bill that establishes a first in the world comprehensive program of regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of greenhouse gases    And my home state of Massachusetts   under the leadership of Deval Patrick   has rejoined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative  now an eight state effort to reduce global warming pollution from power plants  Across the nation  376 mayors from 50 states have signed onto the US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement  an initiative to advance the goals of the Kyoto Protocol  And even President Bush finally saw fit to mention  the serious challenge of global climate change  in his State of the Union address        What s driving this sea change  Madame Chair  On nearly a weekly basis  we see mounting scientific evidence highlighting the need to act   Next week  in fact  we will read a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change   written by more than 600 scientists  reviewed by another 600 experts  and edited by officials from 154 governments   An attempt to reflect the scientific consensus  it s already been called  the smoking gun  of global warming by those who have studied it       Here are the basic facts  At both poles and nearly all points in between  the temperature of the Earth s surface is heating up  and at a frightening and potentially catastrophic rate  According to the landmark 2001 IPCC report  global temperatures have increased an average of 1 4 degrees Fahrenheit during the twenty first century  The Earth is very probably hotter today than at any time in at least the past thousand years  The years 2005  1998  2003  2002  2004  and 2006 were respectively the six warmest years on record  and all but one of the twenty hottest years on record have occurred since 1980        Science tells us that this heating is the result of human activity  Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution  human activities have caused an increase in several greenhouse gases  most notably carbon dioxide  a trend most scientists believe is causing manmade  or anthropogenic  greenhouse warming   Over the past two centuries  the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased about 30 percent  from a pre industrial level of about 270 parts per million to a current level of 370 parts per million   Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are already higher today than at any time in the past 150 000 years   And if the consumption of fossil fuels such as coal and oil continues into the next century at projected rates  the carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere would reach the 600 700 parts per million range by 2100         Other greenhouse gas emissions have been rising as well  But  comparatively  carbon dioxide is our biggest problem because there is more of it  In addition  most of the carbon dioxide we release today will still linger in the atmosphere up to a century from now        But as much as science tells us about the current state of the planet  science also helps us identify the key elements of climate protection legislation  In order to minimize large scale adverse impacts to humans and the environment  we must adopt a long term objective of CO2 concentration of about 450 parts per million        I was encouraged to hear last week that CEOs of 10 major American corporations urged Congress to cap greenhouse gas emissions in line with this goal   Among them were the CEOs of Alcoa  BP America  Dupont  and General Electric  Faced with a leadership void from the federal government  they sent the President a clear message     We can and must take prompt action to establish a coordinated  economy wide market driven approach to climate protection           These CEO s have it figured out    It s time now for Congress to figure it  We cannot spend another year debating whether or not climate change is real  2007 must be the year when finally hash out a solution  And I look forward to working with my colleagues to make that happen                                                                            20510
