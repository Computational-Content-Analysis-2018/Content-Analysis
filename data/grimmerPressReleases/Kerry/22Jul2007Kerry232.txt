Kerry and Edward Kennedy  along with Congressman Richard Neal today urged the Small Business Administration to move quickly in issuing a disaster declaration for those affected by the eight alarm fire that ravaged an Uxbridge Mill complex that house 65 Massachusetts businesses  A disaster declaration would automatically allow business owners to apply for low interest disaster loans  Kerry  the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship  is also working to pass legislation that will improve the disaster loan program by getting aid to devastated businesses and homeowners more quickly      The destruction caused by this fire is absolutely devastating  and because of the heroic work of firefighters from dozens of local communities  we can thank God that no one was seriously physically injured  said Senator John Kerry  who visited the site yesterday and spent time talking with firefighters  Massachusetts has rebuilt after disasters in the past  and we will do so again  But we must not let red tape and delay stand in the way of getting assistance into the hands of businesses that need to rebuild immediately  I want everyone who was affected to know that they are not alone  My colleagues and I will do everything within our power to help them rebuild their businesses and get back on their feet       The fire at Uxbridge Mill is devastating to the local community and to all of Massachusetts  I strongly urge the Small Business Administration to provide much needed relief to enable businesses to rebuild and reopen their doors  said Senator Kennedy       The fire in Uxbridge on Saturday that destroyed the Bernat Mill was a sad and unfortunate tragedy  I will work closely with local  state and federal officials to make sure that the town and the displaced businesses receive the appropriate aid and assistance  said Congressman Richard E  Neal       Chairman Kerrys Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act would establish a Private Disaster Loan program that allows banks to make loans directly to victims with an 85 percent government guarantee  create a new expedited disaster assistance business loan program to provide short term relief to businesses while they await other federal assistance or insurance payments  create a new presidential declaration of Catastrophic National Disaster  which will allow the SBA to issue nationwide economic injury disaster loans to small businesses affected by a large scale disaster  provide key tools for processing disaster loan applications more quickly  such as working with qualified private contractors to process the loans and requiring the SBA to report to Congress on how the application process can be improved  and increase the maximum size of a disaster loan from  1 5 million to  2 million and allow non profit groups to be eligible for disaster loans        The text of the letter is as follows       July 23  2007  The Honorable Steven Preston  Administrator  U S  Small Business Administration  409 Third Street  S W   Washington  D C  20416      Dear Administrator Preston        Early Saturday morning  an eight alarm fire engulfed the Bernat Mill Complex in the town of Uxbridge  Massachusetts  Preliminary damage reports indicate that 135 homes and small businesses were damaged or destroyed before firefighters from 45 communities were able to control the blaze         This terrible tragedy has upended an entire community  Built in 1820  the Bernat Mill has served the town of Uxbridge for nearly two centuries as a dependable source of economic stability  During World War II  the Mill was used to make fabric for army uniforms  Until Saturdays fire  the Mill housed the dreams and aspirations of some of Massachusetts most creative entrepreneurs  Now  these small business owners find their world turned upside down  and every step needs to be taken to ensure that they receive the help they need to get back on their feet        We are appreciative of the efforts made by Governor Patrick to certify this tragedy as a physical disaster for the purposes of authorizing federally administered low interest disaster loans to the victims of the fire  We encourage you to do everything in your power to provide low interest loans through SBAs disaster assistance program  and to do so as quickly as possible  The victims of the Bernat Mill Complex fire deserve nothing less than a swift and effective response from the federal agency responsible for providing disaster assistance to small business owners  We pledge you our support in doing whatever it will take to ensure that the businesses destroyed Saturday morning are given every opportunity to rebuild and thrive        Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter  Should you have any questions  please do not hesitate to contact us or a member of our staffs  We look forward to working with you and with your staff to ensure a speedy recovery for the business owners impacted by Saturdays tragedy      Sincerely      John F  Kerry  Edward M  Kennedy  Richard Neal
