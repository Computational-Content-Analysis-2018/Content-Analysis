John Kerry welcomed the signing  into law of a broad package of Senate reform legislation  rules that alter  everything from lobbyist conduct to employment rules for Senate  spouses  Kerry authored one of the key provisions  called The  Congressional Pension Accountability Act  or The Duke Cunningham Act  The  provision cancels taxpayer funded pension benefits to Members of Congress who  are convicted of serious ethics offenses   crimes such as bribery or conspiracy   It was written to target former Congressman Duke Cunningham  whose convictions  forced him to resign from Congress  but will still receive a pension from  taxpayers   The American people voted for accountability last  November  and this Congress has delivered  said Kerry  This bill will help  hold all Members of Congress to a higher ethical standard  and rightly punish  those who see the honor of holding public office as an opportunity to abuse the  public trust   The full summary of the bills  provisions are as follows   Honest Leadership and Open Government  Act   New transparency for lobbyist  bundling and political campaign fund activity  as well as other financial  contributions      Greater

corporate  flights      Strong revolving doors  restrictions by increasing the cooling off period  for Senators from one to two years before they can lobby Congress  prohibits  senior Senate staff from lobbying contacts with the entire Senate for one year   instead of just their former employing office       Requires lobbyists for the first time to  file reports electronically in a public  searchable database  and increases  civil and criminal penalties for knowingly violating lobbying disclosure rules     Kerrys Duke Cunningham  Act  The Kerry Amendment was unanimously  passed in the Senate and House in January  Under the  final ethics bill  the following offenses would cause a Member of Congress to  forfeit the Congressional pension    Bribery of public  officials and witnesses  Section 201 of Title 18      Conspiracy to  commit offense or to defraud the United States  Section 371 of Title  18     Officers and  employees acting as agents of foreign principals  Section 219 of

under the statues of the United  States or the District of Columbia in falsely denying the  commission of bribery or conspiracy  and    Subornation of  perjury committed in connection with the false denial or false testimony of  another individual    The  Namesake  Facing the largest Congressional bribery  scandal since the 1980s  former Congressman Randy Duke Cunningham resigned  from the House of Representatives after pleading guilty in federal court to  receiving  2 4 million in bribes from military contractors and evading more than   1 million in taxes  In a plea agreement  Cunningham admitted to a pattern of  bribery lasting close to five years  with federal contractors giving him Persian  rugs  a Rolls Royce  antique furniture  travel and hotel expenses  use of a  yacht and a lavish graduation party for his daughter  Unless the law is  changed  legislators who breach the public trust in the future  like Cunningham   will be allowed to continue receiving Congressional pensions of approximately   40 000 per year     Although the bill is inspired by the crimes  of former Congressman Duke Cunningham  the law would not be retroactive in  scope  and therefore would not affect Cunningham directly  A retroactive law of  that nature would be unconstitutional  Kerry and Salazar originally introduced  this legislation on February 9  2006
