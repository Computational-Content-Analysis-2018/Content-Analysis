Kennedy  Coastal New England Senators Demanding Fishing State of Emergency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          BOSTON   The Senate today unanimously passed a Resolution  offered by Senator John Kerry  urging the Secretary of Commerce to reconsider a previous decision and declare a commercial fishery failure for groundfish fishermen in Massachusetts  Maine  New Hampshire and Rhode Island   This action will help provide immediate disaster assistance to the region   Senator John Kerry was joined by Senator Edward Kennedy  Jack Reed  D R I    Sheldon Whitehouse  D R I    Olympia Snowe  R Maine   Susan Collins  R Maine   Judd Gregg  R N H    and John Sununu  R N H   in offering this resolution           This Resolution sends a clear and compelling message that we expect Secretary Gutierrez to reconsider the decision to deny federal assistance to Massachusetts fishermen facing severe economic hardships   New England s fishermen and their families desperately need immediate federal help   Talk to any of them and they will tell you this situation is a disaster   said Senator Kerry        Massachusetts fishermen are suffering immensely because of drastic reductions in their fishing days at sea   said Senator Kennedy   It s disgraceful that our fishermen have already had to survive these severe reductions for over a year  It s long past time for the Commerce Department to act  We urge the Secretary to issue a disaster declaration immediately         The fishing industry is vital to Rhode Island s economy  and I am pleased that the Senate has passed this important resolution   At a time when it is costing our fishermen more to fuel up their boats and regulations are limiting their catches  we need to provide our fisherman with some measure of relief   said Senator Jack Reed  D RI     The Bush Administration should reverse course and provide federal assistance to Rhode Island fishermen         I ve talked with Rhode Island fishermen working hard to sustain their livelihoods and provide for their families   said Senator Whitehouse  D R I    a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee    In August  Senator Reed and I joined Rhode Island s congressional delegation to ask Secretary Gutierrez to take action to help our fishermen recover from this severe economic hardship   I strongly urge him to reconsider his decision to deny them this critical aid         As then Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries  I pushed to include these disaster relief provisions in the most recent Magnuson Stevens Act specifically to aid the hard working men and women in the collapsing New England groundfishery   said Senator Olympia Snowe  now Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Oceans  Atmosphere  Fisheries  and Coast Guard    The Secretary s decision not to declare this fishery a failure runs counter to the intent of Congress and the spirit in which we drafted and enacted the new law         This resolution sends a clear message that the Senate recognizes how critical the groundfishing industry is to the economy in Maine and throughout New England  This industry has been hard hit and needs some relief  I urge the Department of Commerce to take a second look at the grave situation this industry is experiencing   said Senator Susan Collins  R Maine        Senator Judd Gregg  R N H   stated   New Hampshire s fishing industry has long been an important part of our Seacoast and State s economy   Although ending overfishing and rebuilding stocks are important goals  our fisherman have been confronted with increasingly tougher regulations and restrictions that have created serious economic harm   Today s action by the Senate recognizes the difficult situation our fishermen face  and calls on the Administration to take steps to assist them        Senator John Sununu  R N H   stated   New England communities are taking the necessary steps to rebuild our fishery  however  Secretary Gutierrez needs to reverse course and use the authority provided under existing law in the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act  Provisions within the law have been exercised numerous times and were further modified with the New England groundfishing industry in mind in order to save small boat fishermen from elimination
