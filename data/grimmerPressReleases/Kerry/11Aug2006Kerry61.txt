forever   Every solider knows this  Some are luckier than others  Not stronger  or better  or tougher     just luckier  You find yourself saying     There but for the Grace of God go I      You feel that way particularly for your brothers in arms whose readjustment to life back home is more challenging     the ones who struggle with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder         In every war America has fought  veterans have returned home changed by the experience of combat   That is not a myth  It   s not a hoax  And it   s unacceptable to dismiss the struggles of our warriors  In World War I  some were said to suffer from what was then    shell shock     In World War II  we called it    combat fatigue    before Vietnam gave us a clinical term  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  or PTSD  War affects everyone differently  and it   s something all of us     as Americans  as citizens protected by the greatest volunteer military in history     have a responsibility to address         New England Cable News produced an honest  telling documentary that I had the honor of screening      Hidden Wounds    tells the story of three men and their battles with PTSD  one of them Jeff Lucey  a Marine Reservist from Belchertown  Mass         When Jeff was leaving Iraq  his instinct was to report his traumatic memories of things he had seen in the war   But someone told him it might delay his return home  so he kept quiet   But the safety  security  and joy of homecoming eluded Jeff   Haunted by the war and what he had seen  he began to drink heavily  He was plagued by recurring nightmares  and began talking about suicide   On June 15  Jeff   s mom called the VA pleading for help   They scheduled Jeff for an appointment on July 13   On June 22     one week after his mother   s frantic call for help     Jeff took his own life   Two days later  his family received a letter confirming his appointment for July         The Pentagon believes that as many as 100 000 new combat veterans across the country will need some level of mental health care  The New England Journal of Medicine has reported that 1 in 6 soldiers returning from Iraq show symptoms of major depression  anxiety  or post traumatic stress disorder   VA officials told the House Veterans  Affairs Committee that they expect to see some 2 900 additional returning veterans with PTSD in fiscal year 2006   The data shows that the VA has already seen 10 000 additional veterans with PTSD and will likely see another 5 000 new patients by the end of the fiscal year       Not only are the numbers of newly affected vets staggering  but the same old stigmas still exist that prevent them from receiving the care they need  Fewer than 40  of those with a problem have sought help   Military officials and mental health providers predict that up to 30  of returning soldiers will require psychiatric services associated with their experience in war   These are levels not seen since the Vietnam War       But even as the number of veterans in need of care for PTSD rises  the VA has scaled back on the intensity of outpatient care it provides to veterans with PTSD   Our VA medical facilities are not ready for the increased demand for the treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder   In fact only 86 of the 163 VA Medical Centers have PTSD treatment centers   And the Vet Centers exclusively for counseling veterans   established in 1979 by Vietnam vet and former Senator Max Cleland     have not had their budgets increased above inflation in a decade       If America truly supports our troops  we owe them more than a polite thanks and best wishes   We owe them action         The wounds of war are not always visible  and we cannot not sit back and wait for people to ask for help   We have to be proactive   And we have to be smart         Soldiers and Marines returning from war want to go home   They don   t want to do anything that could jeopardize their homecoming         The New Hampshire National Guard has pioneered a way to address this illness before it   s too late   Upon returning from combat duty  veterans are required to participate in a confidential one on one counseling sessions with a VA Vet Center Readjustment Counselor  60  of whom are veterans themselves   It has been enormously successful   Similar programs now exist in Massachusetts  Vermont  Maine and Rhode Island         Together with the Vet Centers  General Oliver Mason and General Kenneth Clark  the commanders of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire National Guards  have made a difference with their head on approach   They have saved families  marriages  and lives   Thank God for men like them       Now we need to take these New England ideas to the rest of America  Earlier this year  I sought an additional  80 million in the supplemental spending bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  to expand the successful New Hampshire program at Vet Centers across the country   The provision passed the Senate as part of a larger amendment to provide  430 million for veterans    healthcare  but was eliminated in the Republican controlled conference        It   s part of a pattern in Washington     provide lip service about supporting the troops but not the lifesaving body armor they need  talk a good game about veterans but cut funding for their healthcare   It   s wrong  and it   s time for it to end   And this November  members of Congress will be held accountable for their real records   That   s why I   m standing with veterans running for critical House and Senate seats  They will help re focus the debate in Washington on where it belongs     our troops        We know that many soldiers just need to check in with another combat veteran once in a while  or maybe be part of a combat support group   If we can just get them help early  we can prevent years of difficulties and struggles and confusion   And they won   t have to go through what Jeff Lucey went through  That   s the least we can do for those who wear the uniform of our country                                                                                    20510
