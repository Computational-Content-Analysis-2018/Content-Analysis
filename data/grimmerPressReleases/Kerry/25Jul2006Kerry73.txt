Yawning Tax Gap

sent a letter to the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service  Mark Everson  to request the reasoning behind Everson   s decision to dramatically reduce the number of tax auditors assigned to audit gift and estate tax returns   He also shared concerns about cutting the auditors of wealthy taxpayers at a time when the tax gap has grown to  350 billion a year    In the past  Kerry contacted Everson about the disproportionate diligence committed to auditing families who deduct the earned income tax credit  This deduction usually involves the finances of low income families  whose tax omissions make up only a small fraction of the overall gap  In 2004  the IRS conducted 48 percent of its audits on EITC taxpayers  who make up only 17 percent of all tax payers     Kerry said     We need to right the imbalance of these audits  focusing on the fraudsters who do the most damage and only pry the tax gap wider  We should assign auditors to focus on the areas that will yield the greatest returns  not those that are just considered the lowest hanging fruit  I look forward to hearing back from the IRS on its plan to close the gap  and on how these cuts relate to that plan       Kerry asked Everson whether the decision to cut down the number of auditors will impact the tax gap  citing the fact that although the number of people paying the estate tax is set to be reduced  large estates are still required to pay the tax until 2009           Below is a copy of the letter     The Honorable Mark Everson  Commissioner Internal Revenue Service 1111 Constitution Avenue  NW Washington  DC  20224       Dear Commissioner Everson     With a tax gap of approximately  350 billion a year  I am concerned about a recent decision to eliminate nearly half of the attorneys that audit estate and gift tax returns   The tax gap for the estate tax is a relatively small portion of the overall tax gap  but it is still approximately  8 billion a year   It is my understanding that estate tax lawyers have been very successful in their efforts in auditing estate and gift tax returns   I am worried that if the number of auditors is reduced  the tax gap for the estate tax will substantially increase     In the past  I have contacted you with concerns about earned income tax credit  EITC  taxpayers being audited and I appreciate the thoroughness of your response   However  I still have concerns about the questionable refund program   In particular  I am troubled that EITC taxpayers are frequently audited and these audits often involve the Criminal Investigation division of the Internal Revenue Service  IRS    I share your concerns about taxpayer fraud and agree with you that the EITC error rate should be reduced   However  I am concerned that the focus of auditors is often low income families rather than the upper income taxpayers who are more likely to participate in tax avoidance transactions     The EITC represents a small portion of the tax gap   In 2004  the IRS conducted 48 percent of its audits on EITC taxpayers who constitute 17 percent of all taxpayers  This number does not include EITC refund freezes   I believe that the auditing of tax returns should be balanced and focus on the areas that would yield the greatest returns such as illegal tax shelters and abusive off shore accounts     I would like to know the reasoning behind the decision to reduce the number of attorneys auditing estate tax returns and if you believe this decision will impact the tax gap   I realize that the number of taxpayers paying the estate tax is being reduced  but large estates are still required to pay an estate tax through 2009   In addition  I would like to know if these attorneys will be reassigned and whether or not the IRS is assigning auditors in a manner that is consistent with reducing the tax gap   It is my understanding that the Treasury and the IRS are working on a plan to reduce the tax gap  and I believe that any decisions on reassigning auditors should be consistent with an overall plan to reduce the tax gap     Thank you in advance for consideration of this important matter     Sincerely     John F  Kerry
