and four other senators today asked the Bush Administration to create a bipartisan Afghanistan Study Group to review strategy and develop recommendations for bringing stability to the country  The letter cited growing chaos  and noted that failing to deal with military  political  diplomatic and economic problems in Afghanistan will continue to empower Al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban insurgents  The letter was co signed by Sens  Joe Biden  D Del    Barbara Boxer  D Calif    Chris Dodd  D Conn   and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY     The request to create an Afghanistan Study Group comes on the heels of a UN study released yesterday indicating that opium production in Afghanistan has reached record levels  despite ongoing U S  counternarcotics efforts  Afghanistans opium is used to fuel terrorism and insurgency    Afghanistan must not become the forgotten war  said Kerry  Our intelligence agencies recently estimated that Al Qaeda is regenerating its ability to attack the U S  homeland from the Afghanistan Pakistan border  The Administration would have a much better chance of improving the situation in Afghanistan if they created an experienced  bipartisan Afghanistan Study Group to come up with comprehensive answers  just as the Iraq Study Group did     Wed have a much better chance of improving the situation in Afghanistan if the administration were willing to make this the top priority it should be  Kerry said today    Afghanistan is winnable  but were not winning because this Administration took its eye off the ball and diverted our energy and resources to Iraq  The time is now for a high level  bi partisan  independent assessment of what it will take to get us back on track in Afghanistan and to rid its people of the Taliban  al Qaeda and narco traffickers once and for all  said Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joe Biden     The situation in Afghanistan is critical  and I  along with several of my Senate colleagues  have written to Lt  General Douglas Lute expressing our concerns  said Dodd  I believe the creation of a bipartisan Afghanistan Study Group is essential to receiving an honest and thorough assessment of the challenges we continue to face  The stability of Afghanistan is critical to our national security and it is my hope that Lt  General Lute will quickly establish an Afghanistan Study Group    We cannot afford to fail in Afghanistan  where the planning for the September 11 attacks originated  said Clinton  A bipartisan Afghanistan Study Group would provide useful analysis and recommendations for how to address the complex challenges that we face in Afghanistan     Boxer said  For too long  the Bush Administration has treated Afghanistan like an afterthought while focusing almost exclusively on Iraq  a country that had nothing to do with the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11  2001  As a result  Afghanistan remains plagued by violence  lawlessness  and rampant drug trafficking  It is my hope that the establishment of an Afghanistan Study Group will help turn the situation around    The letter is attached below    August 24  2007   Lt  General Douglas E  Lute  Assistant to the President and   Deputy National Security Advisor for  Iraq and Afghanistan  The White House   1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20500      Dear General Lute    We write to express our serious concern about the dire situation in Afghanistan  Given the importance of succeeding and the complexity of the challenges we face there  we recommend the creation of a bipartisan Afghanistan Study Group to provide a comprehensive assessment and offer recommendations on the way forward     Bringing lasting stability to Afghanistan is vital to U S  national security interests  The country served as a sanctuary for the terrorists that struck us on September 11  2001  and the recently released National Intelligence Estimate makes clear that an emboldened Al Qaeda has regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack capability along the Afghanistan Pakistan border  As former NATO Supreme Commander Gen  James L  Jones put it  If we dont succeed in Afghanistan  youre sending a very clear message to the terrorist organizations that the U S   the U N   and the 37 countries with troops on the ground can be defeated    While some progress has been made  recent reports show that conditions remain grave and it is clear that we have reached a critical stage in the mission  The resurgent Taliban has taken advantage of a safe haven in Pakistan to launch more attacks in Afghanistan  contributing to a steady rise in the level of violence  As President Karzai stated on August 5  2007  The security situation in Afghanistan over the past two years has definitely deteriorated  Yet NATOs International Security Assistance Force  ISAF  is still not at full strength  significant restrictions remain on many of its troops  and there is serious concern that some NATO countries may actually begin withdrawing troops  Further  poppy production  which provides significant funds for the insurgency  increased 49  in 2006 and is equivalent to nearly half of Afghanistans GDP     Addressing Afghanistans myriad and interrelated military  political  diplomatic and economic problems poses a significant challenge  The issues that must be addressed include enhancing reconstruction efforts  implementing civil reforms essential to establishing the rule of law  training Afghan security forces more effectively  reducing corruption  coordinating dozens of international and non governmental organizations  ensuring full integration of U S  and ISAF military and intelligence operations  fostering greater cooperation with Pakistan and other countries in the region  guaranteeing that adequate resources and personnel are available  and creating a sustainable counter narcotics strategy     We believe that our prospects for success would be greatly enhanced by convening a bipartisan group of senior officials with relevant experience  along the lines of the Baker Hamilton Commission for Iraq  to conduct an objective and comprehensive assessment of our overall strategy and make recommendations for the future  In fact  the Defense Committee of the British House of Commons has already completed a similar effort  and its report included several recommendations that warrant serious consideration     We hope you will agree that the timely formation of this Afghanistan Study Group is an important step towards reinvigorating Americas commitment to a stable  secure Afghanistan  We are also prepared to pursue any legislative efforts that will be helpful in moving this process forward     Thank you in advance for your consideration of this urgent request  We look forward to receiving a response at your earliest convenience       Sincerely       John F  Kerry  United States Senator Joseph R  Biden  Jr    United States Senator United
