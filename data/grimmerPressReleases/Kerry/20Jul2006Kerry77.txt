Good First Step  America Must Do More to Erase Barriers to Voting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Senator John Kerry spoke during the Senate debate today on his support for reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act   Below are his remarks as prepared for delivery          Kerry is also an original co sponsor of the Count Every Vote Act     a comprehensive bill to make all the changes so desperately needed to address barriers to voting     whether it   s intimidation  disinformation or a lack of voting machines   This legislation is the gold standard for electoral reform   It would require clear nationwide standards for provisional ballots  same day voter registration  a paper trail for voting machines and a ratio of voting machines per number of voters      Mr  President  all over the world  the United States has always stood out as the great exporter of democratic values     in the Philippines where we stood up against the undemocratic regime of Marcos and stood for free elections  in South Africa  where we fought for years to break the back of apartheid and empower all citizens to vote  most recently in Afghanistan and Iraq where we rejoiced as many voted for the first time in their lives  and in the Ukraine where the world turned to the United States to monitor elections and ensure that the right to vote was protected          Yet our attempts to spread freedom around the world can only be successful if our democracy works here at home        We are having this debate today because the bedrock right to vote wasn   t just given to everyone  it was earned in blood  in sweat     and it was won by courageous citizens who risked their lives to register voters  who marched  who faced Bull Connor   s police dogs  who faced the threat of lynchings and some who even died fighting to open up the polls and make the right to vote real for every American         We are having this debate today because their work isn   t done  and too many Americans still face too many obstacles when they try to exercise their vote   Every eligible voter must be able cast his or her ballot without fear  without intimidation  and with the knowledge that their voice will be heard   These are the foundations of our democracy and freedom        By reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act  we are taking an important step forward towards fulfilling the promise of    one person  one vote             For many  this struggle is personal  Some of my colleagues in both the House and the Senate have been on the frontlines of the civil rights movement and worked to pass the original Voting Rights Act in 1965   Without the selfless and courageous efforts of people we all admire like our friend Congressman John Lewis      whose image is seared into our minds  who remembers what it was like to march across a bridge and help move a nation to a better place     who knows what it meant to put his life on the line to march for voting rights     without him and those who marched with him our country would never have had the strength or the courage to enact this landmark legislation   Without the leadership of legislators like my good friend the senior Senator from Massachusetts  Ted Kennedy  the United States Congress would never have enacted this landmark legislation          Despite the great strides since the Voting Rights Act was originally enacted  we have a lot of work to do   Thankfully  this is an issue on which Democrats and Republicans agree   I was pleased last week that each attempt to weaken the Voting Rights Act in the House of Representations was defeated   We need to reauthorize each of the three expiring provisions  Section Five   s pre clearance provisions  bi lingual assistance requirements  and authorization for poll watching          Where would the citizens of Georgia be   particularly low income and minority citizens   if they were required to produce a government issued identification or pay  20 every 5 years in order to vote   That is what would have happened without Section Five of the Voting Rights Act   Georgia would have successfully imposed what the judge in the case called    a Jim Crow era poll tax      Does anyone really want to flirt with the idea of returning to the time when states charged people to exercise their right to vote   That is not the America that I know   It s not the America that you know   And it is certainly not the America that we aspire to be       This morning President Bush addressed the 97th Annual Convention of the NAACP after a five year absence   I am pleased that President Bush has ended his boycott of the NAACP and announced his intention to sign the Voting Rights Act into law   This is an important first step  but it will not fix all the problems or remove all the barriers that prevent people from voting today   It   s not enough just to show up at the NAACP or reauthorize the Voting Rights Act   We have to fully fund the Help America Vote Act  which the President   s budget consistently undercuts   We have to pass the Count Every Vote Act and ensure that voters have a verifiable paper trail   We need to make it easier for Americans to register to vote and cast provisional ballots   As my friend Senator Obama warned the NAACP convention yesterday  it is not enough to talk the talk     you have to walk the walk          President Bush has committed to signing the Voting Rights Act   I hope this is just the first step   I hope he continues to work with Congress to ensure that every vote cast in America is counted  that every precinct in America has a fair distribution of voting machines  that voter suppression and intimidation are un American and must be ceased  and that any voter can register to vote and vote on the same day         I support this reauthorization  and I urge my colleagues to do the same
