His Opposition to Judge Alito   s Nomination to the Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Below are Senator John Kerry   s full  prepared remarks on the floor of the Senate today on the upcoming vote on Judge Samuel Alito to serve a Justice on the United States Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Mr  President   Today  we face perhaps one of the most important choices we will make as Senators   A choice that will affect the direction of our country for the next several decades   President Bush has nominated Judge Samuel Alito to replace Justice Sandra Day O   Connor on the United States Supreme Court   He has nominated a man who consistently defers to the government action regardless of how egregious it may be  a man who erects rather than breaks down barriers in the area of civil rights  a man who  to this day  has never retreated from his declaration that the Constitution does not protect a woman   s right to privacy  a man who has demonstrated a persistent insensitivity to the history of racial discrimination in this country and  was even  at the government   s request  willing to ignore overwhelming evidence that African Americans were intentionally stricken from an all white jury in a black defendant   s capital case              And who will this nominee replace   He has been nominated to fill the seat of the Court   s swing vote   a woman who has upheld affirmative action programs  a woman who upheld the right to choose  a woman who upheld state employees    rights to the protections of the Family Medical Leave Act  a woman who recognizes that a declaration of war is not a    blank check    for the President   s actions   A woman who decides each case narrowly on the facts presented  keenly aware of the greater impact her decisions have          We are being asked to confirm a nominee who will shift the ideological balance of the Court dramatically to the right   We are being asked to confirm a nominee whose views will undermine the balance of power that I believe keeps our country strong   For these and other compelling reasons  I oppose this nomination           In the past  I  like many of my colleagues  have voted for federal court nominees despite the fact that I disagreed with them ideologically   In fact  I voted for Justice Scalia because  despite our ideological differences  in the confirmation process he promised an open mindedness that we have not witnessed   So the words of the confirmation hearings do not erase ideology   And that ideology cannot be overlooked because a Justice   s decisions can   and will   have a profound impact on the rights we otherwise take for granted           Something more is needed   A Supreme Court Justice needs to understand and respect our constitutional rights and liberties   He or she needs to recognize the importance of precedent and the limited situations in which overruling it is acceptable   He or she needs to appreciate the significant struggles that our nation has endured   in the context of racial  sexual  and disability discrimination   and be aware of the road still to be traveled            In short  Mr  President  ideology does matter   The Supreme Court   s ideologically driven decisions have been the most regrettable in our nation   s history   decisions like Korematsu  Dredd Scott  and Plessy v  Ferguson           In fact  ideology matters more in this nomination than perhaps it would in any others   We are replacing Justice Sandra Day O   Connor  President Reagan   s nominee to the United States Supreme Court  and its current center   She is the fulcrum upon which most constitutional rights and liberties are balanced   And  as we contemplate ripping that fulcrum out from underneath the Court  we have to understand what the impact of that action will be           Given how high the stakes are  our decision cannot be based on whether Judge Alito is a smart man  whether he is a nice man  whether he is an accomplished man  or even whether he is well respected in legal circles   He is all these things   But  what we must consider is the impact a Justice Alito will have on the Court and whether that is good for our country  our Constitution  and the American people   I firmly believe the answer is no            President Bush had the opportunity to nominate someone who would unite the country in a time of extreme divisiveness   He chose not to do this  and that is his right   But that he didn   t and how this nomination happened tells us a great deal about this presidency and how politics is driving this process          Under fire from his conservative base for nominating Harriet Miers   a woman whose judicial philosophy they mercilessly attacked   President Bush broke to extreme right wing demands   This was a coup   Miers was removed and Alito was installed   The President did not consult with members of the Senate  as is required by the Constitution   He gave no thought to what the American people really wanted   or needed           Instead  he made this nomination about his political base   He made it about an ideological shift in the Court   He made it about unassailable conservative credentials and an unimpeachable conservative judicial philosophy             If you need proof  just look at the response of Ann Coulter   Ms  Coulter is as inflammatory and as conservative as anyone in the country   She makes her living through character assassination   She denounced the nomination of John Roberts   She attacked the nomination of Harriet Miers  calling her completely unqualified and lamenting that President Bush had    thrown away a Supreme Court seat      Yet she celebrated the nomination of Samuel Alito  stating that Bush gave Democrats    a right hook    with this    stunningly qualified    nominee   This from a woman who said that Republicans need to nominate a person who    wake s  up every morning       chortling about how much his latest opinion will tick off the left               Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork had a similar reaction   He denounced Miers    nomination as    taking the heart out of a rising generation    of conservative constitutional scholars and    widen ing  the fissures within the conservative movement      Yet he praised Alito   s nomination as    substantially narrowing    that rift   In fact he called the nomination something to    rejoice    because  if Alito were confirmed  it would only take    one more justice of the Roberts Scalia Thomas Alito stripe to return the Court to    so called    jurisprudential respectability             And let   s not forget conservative stalwart Pat Buchanan  who denounced the Miers nomination as revealing the President   s lack of desire    to engage the Senate in fierce combat to carry out his now suspect commitment to remake the Court in the image of Scalia and Thomas      Apparently Buchanan believes that the Alito nomination demonstrates the President   s change of heart   He heralded the nomination as one that would unite and rally the base           They say you can tell a lot by a person   s friends   These three individuals are consistently on the furthest edge of the ideological spectrum   Their positions rarely advance the interests of average Americans            Perhaps it should come as no surprise that conservatives have jumped to support Judge Alito   After reviewing more than 400 of Judge Alito   s opinions  law professors at Yale Law School concluded that          In the area of civil rights law  Judge Alito consistently has used procedural and evidentiary standards to rule against female  minority  age and disability claimants      Judge Alito seems relatively willing to defer to the claims of employers and the government  over those advancing civil rights claims             Similarly  a Knight Ridder review of Judge Alito   s opinions concluded that Judge Alito    has worked quietly but resolutely to weave a conservative legal agenda into the fabric of the nation   s laws    and that he    seldom sided with a criminal defendant  a foreign national facing deportation  an employee alleging discrimination or consumers suing big business             After reviewing 221 of Judge Alito   s opinions in divided cases  the Washington Post concluded that Judge Alito is    clearly tough minded       having very little sympathy for those asserting rights against the government               The pattern here is clear   and it   s unacceptable   We cannot put someone on the Court who makes access to justice harder and more illusive   We cannot put someone on the Court who will fail to serve as an effective check on excessive executive power           Mr  President  if this pattern is not enough to show how truly dangerous Judge Alito is  then take a look at some of his opinions          In Sheridan v  E I  Dupont De Nemours and Co   Judge Alito wrote a lone dissent   opposed by all of the other judges on his court   eight of whom were Republicans    which would have made it more difficult for victims of discrimination to sue their employers   Applying a similarly high standard of proof   one the majority believed would eviscerate the protections of Title VII   Judge Alito dissented from a decision to allow a racial discrimination claim to go to trial in Bray v  Marriott Hotels             What is the practical impact of these decisions   They keep victims of discrimination from having their day in court           It is not as if Judge Alito   s insensitivity toward victims of discrimination are evidenced only in his judicial opinions   In 1985 job application to President Reagan   s Justice Department  Alito wrote that his interest in Constitutional law was driven  in part  by a disagreement with Warren Court decisions on reapportionment   decisions which established the principle of    one person  one vote      And he said that he was    particularly proud    of his work to end affirmative action programs            Judge Alito   s hostility to individual rights is not limited to civil rights   He consistently excuses government intrusions into personal privacy   regardless of how egregious or excessive they are   In Doe v  Groody  for example  he dissented from an opinion written by then Judge Michael Chertoff because he believed that the strip search of a 10 year old was    reasonable      He also thought the government should not be held accountable for shooting an un armed boy trying to escape with a stolen purse  nor for forcibly evicting farmers from their land in a civil bankruptcy proceeding without any show of resistance            This pattern of deference to government power is reinforced by a speech he gave as a sitting judge to the Federalist Society just five years ago          In his speech  Judge Alito    preach ed  the gospel    of the Reagan Administration   s Justice Department  the theory of a unitary executive   Though in the hearings  Judge Alito attempted to downplay the significance of this theory by saying it did not address the scope of the power of the executive branch but rather addressed the question of who controls the executive branch  don   t be fooled   The unitary executive theory has everything to do with the scope of executive power            In fact  even Stephen Calabresi  one of the fathers of the theory  has stated that     t he practical consequence of this theory is dramatic  it renders unconstitutional independent agencies and counsels      This means that Congress would lose the power to protect public safety by creating agencies like the Consumer Product Safety Commission   which ensures the safety of products on the marketplace   and the Securities and Exchange Commission   which protects Americans from corporations like Enron   and the President would gain it          Carried to its logical end  the theory goes much further than invalidating independent agencies   The Bush Administration has used it to justify both its illegal domestic spying program and its ability to torture detainees   The Administration seems to view this theory as a blank check for executive overreaching          Judge Alito   s endorsement of the unitary executive theory is not my only cause for concern   In 1986  while working in the Justice Department  Judge Alito endorsed the idea that presidential    signing statements    could be used to influence judicial interpretation of legislation   His premise was that the President   s understanding of legislation was as important as Congress    in determining legislative intent   startling when you consider that Congress is the legislative branch          President Bush has taken the practice of issuing signing statements to a new level   Most recently  he used a signing statement to reserve the right to ignore the ban on torture that the Congress overwhelmingly passed   He also used signing statement to attempt to apply the law restricting habeas corpus review of enemy combatants retroactively   despite our understanding in Congress that it would not affect cases pending before the Supreme Court at the time of passage            The implications of President Bush   s signing statements are astounding  his Administration is reserving the right to ignore those laws it does not like   Only one thing can hold the President accountable  the Supreme Court   I am not convinced that will happen if Judge Alito is confirmed          Reigning in excessive government power matters more today than ever before as we work to find the balance between protecting our rights and our safety   As Justice O   Connor said  the war on terror is not a blank slate for government action   We can   and must   fight it in a manner consistent with the Constitution            Last  but certainly not least  I have grave concerns about Judge Alito   s ability and willingness to protect a woman   s right to choose   In his 1985 job application  Judge Alito wrote that he was    particularly proud    of his work arguing before the Supreme Court that    the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion      That same year  he wrote a memo outlining a strategy for chipping away at Roe v  Wade  an approach he believed would be more successful than asking for outright reversal          In his hearings  Judge Alito said that these statements were accurate reflections of his views in 1985  but what is more disturbing is what he refused to say   He refused to say that his views had changed   He refused to say that he accepted Roe v  Wade as settled law   In other words  he refused to give any assurances that his concept of the Constitution   s protected liberty is consistent with that of mainstream America           Now  I realize that Judge Alito has promised that he will keep an    open mind    when approaching the cases that come before him   I  however  am not reassured   We have heard these kinds of empty platitudes before   Justice Thomas repeatedly told the Judiciary Committee that he would keep an open mind on the issue of abortion  but as we all know  once safely on the Supreme Court  Justice Thomas voted to overturn Roe v  Wade just months later  writing a dissent in Casey that likened abortion to polygamy  sodomy  incest and suicide   Given Justice Thomas   s success  you can almost image Karl Rove whispering to Judge Alito     Just say you have an open mind   Works every time             We simply cannot rely on promises that nominees make to the Judiciary Committee   particularly when the nominee   s entire professional history suggests something different and particularly when past promises that the nominee has made have been essentially meaningless        In his 1990 Judiciary Committee hearings  Judge Alito promised that he would recuse himself in any cases involving the Vanguard companies given his ownership of Vanguard mutual funds   In his Supreme Court hearings  Judge Alito admitted that he could not remember ever putting Vanguard on his permanent recusal list   We know for a fact that it did not appear on his 1993  94  95 or 96 lists   How do we know that he kept his word to the Judiciary Committee   We don   t   How can we trust he will keep his word now   We can   t           Mr  President  I am deeply concerned about the future of the Supreme Court   I am deeply concerned about maintaining the integrity of our Constitutional rights and liberties   I fear that the disadvantaged in our society will be locked out of our system of justice   I fear that the President   s powers will grow beyond what the Framers intended them to be   And  I fear that Congress   s hands will be tied and we will be unable to do the work of the American people           I cannot and I will not vote to confirm a nominee who will dramatically shift the Court   s ideological balance to the right   Judge Alito had the burden of proving   not just to me but to the American people   that he would not be that kind of justice   He failed to carry that burden   I believe that a Court with Judge Alito sitting on it will be a Court that moves our country backwards   I cannot support his nomination  and I hope that none of my colleagues will either                                                                                       20510
