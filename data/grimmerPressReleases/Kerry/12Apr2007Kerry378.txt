John Kerry  D Mass   today delivered remarks on the floor of the Senate on the war in Iraq  Today  as respected Generals refused the position of War Czar  as bombings in Baghdad killed at least twelve people and injured dozens more  and the day after the Pentagon announced extended tours of duty for our already overstretched military  Kerry spoke on the urgent need for President Bush to listen to his own Generals about the deteriorating situation on Iraq  Below are Kerry s remarks as prepared for delivery  Mr  President  I would like to speak today about the situation in Iraq   the devastating attack in Baghdad  the lack of any real political progress as a result of the President s escalation  the incredible toll it is taking on our armed forces  and what this Administration could learn if they really listened to our generals  We are now more than four years into the war in Iraq  and tragically it is only now that the Administration has finally realized that there is an urgent need for one individual with the authority to coordinate our overall military and civilian efforts in Iraq   at a time when apparently no one wants the job  It says a lot that when the President finally decides to appoint a War Czar to get everyone on the same page  the situation in Iraq is so bad  and the Administration s stubborn unwillingness to change course is so persistent  they can t find anyone to take the job  So far  the Administration has approached three retired four star generals about the position    Marine General John J  Jack Sheehan  Army General Jack Keane  and retired Air Force General Joseph W  Ralston  All three declined  These were not opponents of the Administration  in fact  they all had established ties to this Administration  Yet none of them would not take the job  Why not  Why would our top military commanders decline such a high level position  General Sheehan  a 35 year Marine who once served as the top NATO commander  summed it up pretty well when he said  The very fundamental issue is  they don t know where the hell they re going  It s long past time for a President who insists that he listens to his generals   and not politicians   to finally heed his own advice  and to end a disgraceful record of ignoring the very military the Administration professes to believe in  This isn t new  Again and again this Administration has turned its back on the best advice of the uniformed military   and each time they ve done so at our peril  Start with General Shinseki  who we all now agree that he was right that we needed a lot more troops to secure Iraq after the invasion  As the former top operating officer at the Pentagon  a Marine Lieutenant General  put it  the commitment of our forces to this fight was done with a casualness and swagger that are the special province of those who have never had to execute these missions  or bury the results  Instead of listening to General Shinseki  the Administration decided to retire him  Last year  retired high ranking military leaders    many of whom played key combat or planning roles in Afghanistan and Iraq    came forward publicly to call for the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld  And across the administration  the warnings of those wore the uniform of their country all their lives    and who  retired or not  did not resign their citizenship in order to serve their country    were dismissed as acts of disloyalty  or as threats to civilian control of the armed forces  In the end  it took an election to replace Secretary Rumsfeld   not the advice of the men and women who had seen him nearly break the military they d served for decades  That was this Administration s choice  It didn t stop there  Just ask General Casey or General Abizaid  who warned that more US troops would not solve Iraq s security problem   and could actually slow the process of getting Iraqi security forces to assume more responsibility    and the Joint Chiefs of Staff  who unanimously opposed this escalation  What happened to them  General Abizaid was replaced  General Casey was re assigned  The Joint Chiefs were over ruled  And yesterday  we learned that the Pentagon is going to stretch our overextended military even further by extending combat tours and reducing time between rotations to provide the additional troops necessary for the President s misguided escalation  What do our military leaders have to say about that  Robert Scales  a retired Army two star general  said that to sustain this deployment while giving soldiers the training and rest they need would require twice as many Army and Marine Corps brigades as we have   and then he warned that the Army is about to be broken  Barry McCaffrey  a retired Army four star general who recently returned from another fact finding trip to Iraq  tells us that combat equipment for both the active and reserve components is shot  His conclusion was simple  There is no argument of whether the US Army is rapidly unraveling  At a time when mistake after mistake is being compounded by the very civilian leadership that ignored expert military advice in the invasion and occupation of Iraq  those who understand the price for each mistake is being paid by our troops  our country  and Iraq itself must be heard  And the message from the generals who were offered the War Czar position has been crystal clear  if they really thought the Administration had a strategy that could succeed in Iraq  why did they turn down the job  Mr  President  there s a very good reason for their skepticism  this Administration simply refuses to accept the fact that we need to change course in Iraq  We keep hearing that the escalation is showing progress  but while the level of Iraqi civilian casualties may have gone down in Baghdad  it has gone up in other parts of the country   and the overall casualty rate has basically remained the same  And just today  we learned of a devastating suicide bombing in the Iraqi parliament  which is in the heart of the heavily fortified Green Zone  Ten people died   including two Iraqi lawmakers    along with any sense of personal security in what is supposed to be the safest part of Baghdad  This is the progress we ve been hearing about  And tell me  how are more American troops going to stop a single fanatic with explosives strapped to his chest  One thing we do know is that American troops are paying the ultimate price for this escalation  in the first seven weeks  the number of U S  troops who died in Baghdad doubled  On Monday alone we learned of two more soldiers from Massachusetts who died in Iraq    Captain Anthony Palermo  age 26  of Brockton  Massachusetts  and Sergeant Adam P  Kennedy  25  of Norfolk  Massachusetts  The Administration says these men and women are giving their lives because the purpose of this escalation is to allow the Iraqis space to make the political deals that we all agree are the only hope for ending the civil war  But if the violence is going down in Baghdad  where is the political progress  We keep hearing that the Iraqis are getting closer to a deal on sharing oil revenues  but every time  hopes for a final deal turn out to be an illusion  The de ba athification law that is a key part of the national reconciliation process was recently denounced by Ayatollah Sistani and is nowhere near completion  The Iraqis are still at square one when it comes to amending the Constitution and disarming the militias  And still  the President refuses to impose any meaningful consequences on the Iraqis for failure to meet these benchmarks  Mr  President  since we all understand that there is no military solution in Iraq  let s start measuring the progress on the ground in Iraq by what really counts  whether the Iraqis are making the political deals that are necessary to keep their country together  And right now  we have not seen any of the political progress that would give us cause for optimism  That s only going to change when the Administration accepts the simple reality that this Congress has acknowledged  Iraqi politicians have repeatedly shown they only respond to deadlines   a deadline to transfer authority  deadlines to hold two elections and a referendum  and a deadline to form a government  Americans should not be dying to buy time for Iraqi politicians hoping to cut a better deal  We should be working to bring about the compromise that is ultimately the only solution to what is happening today in Iraq  Without a real deadline to force the Iraqis to make a deal  there s no telling how long it will take   but we do know that American soldiers and Iraqi civilians will continue to die while their politicians wrangle over the details  And that is simply unacceptable  The same holds true for the diplomacy that is key to any successful our strategy  Last month  Iraq s neighbors and key players from the international community finally got together at a conference in Baghdad  But nothing tangible came out of it  and there s no sense of urgency about the upcoming meeting in Egypt  That s why a deadline is so essential  to focus all the parties on the critical need to help Iraqis reach the political solution that is the only solution  Mr  President  we owe it to our troops and to our country to have an honest debate and to try to work together to find the way forward in Iraq  But just yesterday  Senator McCain gave a particularly divisive speech in which he said that Democrats were cheering for defeat and surrender in Iraq  Senator McCain knows better  He knows full well that no one wants to see Iraq fall apart  He knows that we all agree on the need to preserve our vital national security interests in the region  and that none of us downplay the risk of a region wide conflict or an al Qaeda safe haven  We disagree on the strategy  but we all agree on the stakes  To suggest otherwise does a disservice to our people and our principles  Yet still  the Vice President hides behind the rhetoric that dares to claim those who offer a new way forward are undermining our troops  Undermining our troops  Let s have that debate   let s have that debate with a Vice President who helped send them into combat without adequate protection so they can be killed and maimed in humvees that    four years into this war    still do not have the armor they need  Let s have that debate with an Administration that sent them back into battle in Iraq with serious injuries and other medical problems    including some who doctors have said are too injured to wear their body armor  Undermine the troops  How about failing to provide them with proper medical care when they come home with broken bodies and minds    forcing them to live in run down facilities    leaving them to fend for themselves as they deal with mountains of red tape  Undermine the troops  How about extending tours in Iraq so that military families will wait 15 months to see their loved ones instead of 12 months   and reducing time off between rotations so they have even less time when they get home  Mr  President  this Congress has finally done what this Administration has stubbornly refused to do   to recognize that the best way to support the troops is to change a failed course and implement a strategy that can work for America and for Iraq  And make no mistake  if the President vetoes the supplemental spending bill  he is the one who is denying our troops the funds they need  We should honor lives lost not with words but with lives saved  That starts by putting aside the hollow rhetoric and straw men that have undermined a real debate for far too long   and supporting an exit strategy that preserves our core interests in Iraq  in the region  and throughout the world  That  Mr  President  is how we support the troops   and bring our heroes home                                                                              20510
