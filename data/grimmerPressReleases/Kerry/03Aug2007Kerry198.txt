Kerry said today that legislation passed by the Congress last night  which he helped draft during a Senate and House conference  will spur innovation and greatly enhance Americas global competitiveness  The bill authorizes a total of  22 billion over the next three years for the National Science Foundation and increases funding for several science and technology agencies such as the National Institute of Science and Technology  It expands grants and educational opportunities for students and teachers of math  science and engineering  from grade school to graduate school  The additional funds and new programs will provide additional opportunities for universities in Massachusetts  many of which already sit on the cutting edge of innovation and progress  This legislation will help spark innovation in an economy that relies of innovation  Kerry said today  The best thing about this bill is that it will foster creativity among our researchers  scientists and teachers  This sort of support is sorely needed because American kids are falling behind when it comes to math and science education  One study ranked U S  high school seniors below their counterparts in 17 other countries in math and science literacy  This is not only selling our kids short  its selling the future of our economy short  We know that only by encouraging that type of innovative thinking can we continue to compete on the global stage  Below is a summary of the legislation  SUMMARY OF THE AMERICA COMPETES ACT The America COMPETES Act is a bipartisan legislative response to recommendations contained in the National Academies Rising Above the Gathering Storm report and the Council on Competitiveness Innovate America report  The bill is similar to the National Competitiveness Investment Act that Senators Frist  Reid  Stevens  Inouye  Domenici  Bingaman  Enzi  Kennedy  Ensign  Lieberman  Alexander  Mikulski  Hutchison  and others introduced in September 2006  Several sections of the bill are derived from proposals contained in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2006  S 2802   approved without opposition by the Senate Commerce Committee  and the Protecting Americas Competitive Edge Through Energy Act of 2006  S 2197  approved without opposition by the Senate Energy Committee last year  Accordingly  the America COMPETES Act focuses on three primary areas of importance to maintaining and improving United States innovation in the 21st Century   1  increasing research investment   2  strengthening educational opportunities in science  technology  engineering  and mathematics from elementary through graduate school  and  3  developing an innovation infrastructure  More specifically  the America COMPETES Act would  Increase Research Investment by   Doubling funding for the National Science Foundation  NSF  from approximately  5 6 billion in Fiscal Year 2006 to  11 2 billion in Fiscal Year 2011   Setting the Department of Energys Office of Science on track to double in funding over ten years  increasing from  3 6 billion in Fiscal Year 2006 to over  5 2 billion in Fiscal Year 2011   Establishing the Innovation Acceleration Research Program to direct federal agencies funding research in science and technology to set as a goal dedicating approximately 8  of their Research and Development  RD  budgets toward high risk frontier research   Authorizing the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  from approximately  703 million in Fiscal Year 2008 to approximately  937 million in Fiscal Year 2011 and requiring NIST to set aside no less than 8 percent of its annual funding for high risk  high reward innovation acceleration research   Directing NASA to increase funding for basic research and fully participate in interagency activities to foster competitiveness and innovation  using the full extent of existing budget authority   Coordinating ocean and atmospheric research and education at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other agencies to promote U S  leadership in these important fields  Strengthen Educational Opportunities in Science  Technology  Engineering  Mathematics  and Critical Foreign Languages by   Authorizing competitive grants to States to promote better alignment of elementary and secondary education with the knowledge and skills needed for success in postsecondary education  the 21st century workforce  and the Armed Forces  and grants to support the establishment or improvement of statewide P 16 education longitudinal data systems   Strengthening the skills of thousands of math and science teachers by establishing training and education programs at summer institutes hosted at the National Laboratories and by increasing support for the Teacher Institutes for the 21st Century program at NSF   Expanding the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at NSF to recruit and train individuals to become math and science teachers in high  need local educational agencies   Assisting States in establishing or expanding statewide specialty schools in math and science that students from across the state would be eligible to attend and providing expert assistance in teaching from National Laboratories staff at those schools   Facilitating the expansion of Advanced Placement  AP  and International Baccalaureate  IB  programs by increasing the number of teachers prepared to teach AP IB and pre AP IB math  science  and foreign language courses in high need schools  thereby increasing the number of courses available and students who take and pass AP and IB exams   Developing and implementing programs for bachelors degrees in math  science  engineering  and critical foreign languages with concurrent teaching credentials and part time masters in education programs for math  science  and critical foreign language teachers to enhance both content knowledge and teaching skills   Creating partnerships between National Laboratories and local high need high schools to establish centers of excellence in math and science education   Expanding existing NSF graduate research fellowship and traineeship programs  requiring NSF to work with institutions of higher education to facilitate the development of professional science masters degree programs  and expanding NSFs science  mathematics  engineering and technology talent program   Providing Math Now grants to improve math instruction in the elementary and middle grades and provide targeted help to struggling students so that all students can master grade level mathematics standards   Expanding programs to increase the number of students from elementary school through postsecondary education who study critical foreign languages and become proficient  Develop an Innovation Infrastructure by   Establishing a Presidents Council on Innovation and Competitiveness to develop a comprehensive agenda to promote innovation and competitiveness in the public and private sectors   Requiring the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study to identify forms of risk that create barriers to innovation
