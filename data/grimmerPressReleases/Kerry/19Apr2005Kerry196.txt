Toxic Mercury Pollution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  D C    Senator John Kerry made the following statement today at the Democratic Policy Hearing on mercury pollution   The Senate Democratic Policy Committee held the hearing on mercury in response to repeated denials of Republican led committees to hold hearings on the matter                                                                                                                        I want to thank the members of the panel for joining us today to wrestle with an issue that   s not just an environmental issue  but which is as real and present a health care crisis as you   ll find in numerous communities across our country          When fathers across America take their kids fishing but can   t risk cooking the catch for dinner because of the risk of mercury contamination  that   s a health care issue  When expectant mothers can   t trust the tuna fish sandwich they are eating because it might some day lead to seizures in their child  we have a public health problem on our hands  When teachers are seeing increases in learning disabilities around mercury hotspots  we have an education and a public health issue staring us in the face   And what   s most troubling is that Washington   s not being honest about it       In this city  it   s almost become standard fare for honesty to be sacrificed for political expediency   We saw it when the President   s budget left out literally trillions in spending   We saw it when a Medicare actuary was forced to fudge the numbers and lie to Congress to keep his job   We saw the falsified numbers in Iraq on everything from the cost of the war to the number of trained Iraqi troops   We saw the fake newscasts produced by the Bush Administration and funded with your tax dollars            But now  with our children   s health on the line  we are reading headlines like    New EPA Mercury Rule Omits Conflicting Data      That   s the nice way of saying that the agency in charge of environmental protection buried a study that proves proposed mercury regulations don t do enough to keep our children safe from the risk of cerebral palsy  seizures or learning disabilities   Consider some of the facts on mercury           The U S  EPA identified Mercury as the toxic of greatest concern among all other air toxics released by power plants            A January 2003 report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that one in six women of childbearing age have mercury in their blood above the level that would pose a risk to a developing fetus           In adults  mercury exposure can cause irreversible damage to the brain and cardiovascular system           At least 44 states have issued warnings urging residents to avoid or limit their consumption of mercury laden fish caught in local waters  and the federal government has recommended that children and women of childbearing age eat no more than two meals of low mercury fish per week and avoid eating certain fish altogether         The dangers of mercury exposure are undeniable   Every year more than 600 000 babies are born with dangerously high levels of mercury in their blood   We live with this every day in New England  The Merrimack River Valley in Massachusetts and New Hampshire  and the Penobscot River area in Maine have been classified as    bio hotspots    due to dangerously high levels of mercury       Still  year after year strong mercury rules fail in Washington under pressure from corporate interests   Why   Not because the risks of mercury poisoning aren   t real   No  lobbyists for the big industries just say they can   t afford to make changes           But the study commissioned by the Administration actually made it clear we can   t afford not to   The report estimates health benefits of nearly  5 billion from reducing mercury emissions to a safe level of 15 tons   This health benefits analysis  the key to sound rulemaking  should have sounded alarm bells at the EPA and throughout the Bush White House   The need for change was clear   But the fact that the report was not even considered only raises more questions about what other information has been disregarded by this Administration          The mercury issue  like so many others  shows not only a dangerous lack of candor and honesty by our government  but that in making public policy to protect the health of our kids  Washington has lost its sense of right and wrong   It   s wrong to keep information from the people   It   s wrong to make decisions while ignoring important data   It   s wrong to give industry a free pass when our children will pay the price       The Harvard report was not a rogue study   It was commissioned by the EPA and financed by your tax dollars   This Administration just didn   t like the results  so they hid it away   Taxpayers    dollars were well spent  because the study helps confirm that mercury pollution can and must be controlled better to protect the health of our children   At a minimum we should demand that the Harvard data be given a fair hearing           It   s time for the EPA to come clean  halt implementation of inadequate mercury rules and rewrite them based on this groundbreaking research that should have been taken into account all along   That s the least Washington can do to protect the health of our children
