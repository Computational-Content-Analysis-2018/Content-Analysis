brave men and women an honest debate

Kerry spoke from the Senate floor today on the need for a debate on the way forward in Iraq and a  yes or no  vote on whether Congress opposes President Bush s troop escalation      Below are his remarks  as prepared for delivery    Mr  President  this new Congress comes here with a mandate  as well as a moral obligation  not just to find a new way forward in Iraq but to find the right way forward  The mistakes of the past do not change the fact that Congress bears some responsibility for getting us into this war and must take responsibility for getting us out          That starts with a real bipartisan dialogue about where we go from here  The American people have spoken clearly  they want a real change of direction in Iraq   not more of the same failed strategy that has gotten us into the mess we are in today   And now we here in the Senate need to speak up as well   to let our voices be heard and our votes be counted         Our troops have done their duty   now we have a moral and constitutional obligation to do ours  We owe the brave men and women who put their lives on the line every day an honest debate  We owe them a vote on the President s senseless decision to escalate the war in Iraq by sending over 20 000 more of them into the middle of a raging civil war  And most importantly  we owe them a policy that is worthy of their sacrifice  Anything less would be a complete abdication of our most basic responsibilities as Senators        It is incredible to me that some here would seek to obstruct debate over the most fundamental issue facing our country today  I know many on the other side of the aisle oppose this escalation   they say so every day  And the Majority Leader has given every opportunity for those who support the escalation to vote in favor of it   And yet many on the other side of the aisle voted against holding a real debate    and having a real vote   on Iraq  History will judge that decision  but there is still time for the Senate to get this right   There is still time for this body to serve as the voice of reason and good judgment  of cooperation and common sense  that this country so desperately needs right now        But since the end of last month when we started debating this escalation  over 60 American troops have died in Iraq   The American people aren t interested in hearing Senators bicker while their sons and daughters are being killed in Iraq  Not while young men and women are  suffering permanent disabilities   Not while more families are having their futures taken away         They have every right to expect the people they elected to stand up and vote on a policy that has so deeply divided our country   No more delays  no more hiding behind procedural votes  The current resolution is very simple  and it s crystal clear  it says that we support the troops  and oppose an escalation of the war that will put more of them into harm s way without a clear strategy to succeed   So it presents a very simple question  do you support the President s escalation or not   The members of the House of Representatives have been able to answer that simple question   to stand up and be counted on the most important issue facing our country today    and there s absolutely no reason we cannot as well        That starts by putting aside the hollow rhetoric and straw men that have stymied real debate for far too long  We all agree on the incredible bravery of the men and women of our Armed Forces  and none of us wants to see Iraq fall apart  We all agree on the need to preserve our vital national security interests in the region  and none of us downplay the risk of a region wide conflict or an al Qaeda safe haven  We may disagree on the strategy  but we all agree on the stakes        Pretending that this resolution is a vote of  no confidence  in our troops   as some have argued    really poisons this essential debate  Let s be clear  it s a vote of  no confidence  in what we consider to be a disastrous decision by this President  a vote of  no confidence  in continuing a policy that has not worked in the past and we believe will not work now  Not a vote of  no confidence  in our military or in our troops   To suggest otherwise is just a transparent effort to distort the debate        And some of my colleagues have opposed having this crucial vote because they insist on advancing the fallacy that if Congress uses its Constitutional power to cut off funds    as a means of forcing the Administration to face facts and get our policy right Iraq    it is somehow undermining the safety of troops in the field  That s absurd         In fact  the opposite is true   The best way we fight for the safety of our troops is to get them out of the middle of a raging civil war  U S  soldiers   no matter how brave  no matter how well trained  no matter how effective   cannot end if the policymakers and the diplomats don t start doing the jobs they should have done long ago        Our troops and our country deserve better   The best way to support the troops is to oppose a course that squanders their lives  dishonors their sacrifice  and does a disservice to our people and our principles        The simple fact is that sending in over 20 000 additional troops isn t the answer   in fact  it s a tragic mistake  It won t end the violence  it won t provide security  it won t deter terrorists  who have a completely different agenda  it won t rein in the militias  and it won t turn back the clock and avoid the civil war that is already underway       It will simply postpone the political solution that is the only solution in Iraq  while further damaging our prestige and credibility in the region  And most importantly  it will expose our troops to unnecessary death and injury        Our generals understand this  General Abizaid told a Senate Committee that more US troops not only will not solve Iraq s security problem  they could actually slow the process of getting Iraqi security forces to assume more responsibility  The Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously opposed this escalation  and even Prime Minister Maliki was at best lukewarm on the idea        I strongly believe it is not enough for Congress simply to go on record opposing the President s reckless plan  Congress has an obligation to provide a responsible exit strategy that preserves our interests in the region  retains our ability to protect the security of the United States  and honors the sacrifice our troops have made         Eight months ago in the Senate  thirteen of us stood up against appeals to politics and pride and demanded a date to bring our troops home  to make Iraqis stand up for Iraq and fight a more effective war on terror  But while we lost that roll call  I still believe it was the right policy to put in place  to demand accountability  and to leverage action        Now  I am more convinced than ever that a combination of serious  sustained diplomacy and the enforcement of benchmarks for progress by the Iraqi government  leveraged by a one year deadline for redeployment of U S  troops  is the best way to achieve our goal of stability in Iraq and security in the region        That is why I will again introduce legislation that offers a comprehensive strategy for achieving a political solution and bringing our troops home within one year  We have to find a way to end this misguided war  and I believe this legislation is the best and most responsible way forward        Let me emphasize that this strategy does not mean abandoning Iraq in one year  in fact  it gives the President the discretion to leave the minimum number of United States troops necessary to complete the training of Iraqi security forces  go after terrorists  and protect United States facilities and personnel        Mr  President  this one year deadline is not arbitrary  It s consistent with the Iraq Study Group s goal of withdrawing US combat forces from Iraq by the first quarter of 2008   it s consistent with the timeframe for transferring control to the Iraqis set forth by General Casey  and the schedule agreed upon by the Iraqi government itself   Even the President has said that  under his new strategy  responsibility for security would be transferred to Iraqis before the end of this year  It s the opposite of arbitrary  The President has said it  our generals have said it  the Iraq Study Group has said it        Some say those of us who oppose the President s failed policy in Iraq do not offer an alternative   nothing could be further from the truth  This legislation offers a comprehensive military and diplomatic strategy that incorporates key recommendations of the Iraq Study Group   including many that some of us here have long been advocating    to provide us with the best chance to succeed  holding a summit with all of Iraq s neighbors  including Iran and Syria   creating an international contact group    enforcing a series of benchmarks for meeting key political objectives    shifting the military mission to training Iraqi security forces and conducting targeted counter terrorism operations    and maintaining an over the horizon presence to protect our interests throughout the region         Mr  President  it is time for Iraqis to assume responsibility for their country  We need a timetable which forces Iraqi politicians to confront reality and start making the hard compromises they ve resisted thus far  Instead  they are using America s presence as a security blanket  Americans should not be dying to buy time for Iraqi politicians hoping to cut a better deal   We should be working to bring about the compromise that is ultimately the only solution to what is happening today in Iraq  And Iraqi politicians have repeatedly shown they only respond to deadlines   a deadline to transfer authority  deadlines to hold two elections and a referendum  and a deadline to form a government        Without hard deadlines  our best hopes for progress in Iraq have been repeatedly dashed  When Prime Minister Maliki took power in May  General Casey and Ambassador Khalilzad said the new government had six months to make the political compromises necessary to win public confidence and unify the country  They were right  but with no real deadline to force the new government s hand  that period passed without meaningful action    and we are now seeing the disastrous results        In fact  for four years now  we have been hearing from this Administration that progress is right around the corner  We ve been hearing the Iraqis are near a deal on oil revenues  that they are making progress towards reconciliation   but we still haven t seen any results        That s why we must give teeth to the benchmarks agreed upon by the Iraqi government for national reconciliation  security and governance  Meeting these benchmarks is crucial  but without any enforcement mechanism  they are little more than a wish list  That s why this legislation supports the Iraq Study Group proposal to make US political  military  or economic assistance conditional on Iraqis  meeting these benchmarks         A deadline is also essential to getting Iraq s neighbors to face up to the realities of the security needs of the region  None of them want to see Iraq fall apart   That should be the basis for cooperation in stabilizing Iraq  and yet a sense of urgency has been lacking   This deadline will make clear the stakes and hopefully focus their minds on helping the Iraqis reach a political solution        We cannot turn back the clock and reverse the decisions that brought us to this pass in Iraq and the Middle East  We cannot achieve the kind of clear and simple victory the Administration promised the American people again and again even as Iraq went up in flames  But we can avoid an outright defeat  We can avoid creating the chaos we all say we want to avoid  We can avoid a victory for our adversaries by taking a clear eyed approach to identifying specifically what we can and cannot accomplish in Iraq        With a new Congress comes a new responsibility  to get this policy right  That starts with preventing the President from going forward with this senseless escalation  And it has to end with an exit strategy that preserves our core interests in Iraq  in the region  and throughout the world   Only then will we have honored the sacrifices of our troops and the wishes of those who sent us here   Only then will we have done our duty
