Oct 13  2006     By John Kerry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy when our small businesses are succeeding  it s a good indication that our economy is strong  Which is why we have reason to be excited about this year s news that Hispanic businesses are starting up at a rate three times the national average       Today  there are about 1 6 million Hispanic owned businesses nationwide creating jobs  contributing over  200 billion to the economy  That is something to celebrate  and it is due to the hard work  energy and excitement of Hispanic entrepreneurs seeking to live the American dream       Pablo Ferez is one of those Hispanic businessmen  having grown his Chula Vista  California based operation from a 380 square foot space to a 7 000 square foot warehouse where he packs his branded candies and nuts   Candy El Pecas   Ferez received technical assistance and financial counseling in addition to an SBA Community Express loan  from CDC Small Business Finance and his local bank  This enabled him to buy additional machines to weigh  package and label his product   CDC was very responsive   he said  He is just a few states shy of nationwide distribution of his products  and he is already looking for a new facility to  accommodate anticipated growth       But for every success story  there are countless Hispanic entrepreneurs who have not received the tools needed to achieve that dream  That s where Washington and the Federal government can help  In order to improve our communities and expand business opportunities  the government needs to invest in key programs that can jump start entrepreneurship  As Cesar Chavez aptly put it   you are never strong enough that you don t need help        Small business owners face tough choices every day   from how many employees to hire and whether they can afford health care  to grappling with the tough decision to raise prices because of the high cost of gasoline       Washington also has choices  We have a deficit that is growing by the minute  We have a war in Iraq  And we have an entire region in the Gulf Coast still awaiting government action after Hurricane Katrina  As these choices are made  Washington cannot foiget its responsibility to help minority small business owners succeed       That s why I proposed creating an Office of Minority Small Business Development within the Small Business Administration to give minority entrepreneurs an advocate in Washington  a proposal that was supported by my Senate colleagues on a bipartisan basis  From helping them to secure loans  to navigating the complex contracting arena  to gaining technical assistance and other training  we can and must do more to help foster business growth in all sectors of our society  This office would accomplish these goals and more       We should also be encouraging entrepreneurial values in our children  That s why one of my top priorities this year is to enact my Minority Entrepreneurship and Innovation Pilot Program  Through a competitive grant program at Hispanic Serving Institutions  Historically Black Colleges and Universities  and Tribal Colleges  schools will develop a campus wide entrepreneurial curriculum and establish a Small Business Development Center to forge relationships between local business owners and students  Together we can target students in highly skilled fields and steer them towards starting a business as a viable career option       The welfare and well being of this nation depends largely on its people  and America has the best and the brightest  The debate over our immigration policy continues  but one aspect of that debate is clear  We can and must strike a balance between enforcing our borders and keeping the entrepreneurial spirit and the American dream alive for Hispanics nationwide  Workers who have paid taxes  sent their kids to school and are upstanding residents of their communities deserve a way to earn legalized status in this country       It is an American responsibility to invest in entrepreneurship  expand opportunities for minorities and enact a common sense immigration policy  Doing so will help small businesses succeed and will keep our economy strong        Author Affiliation       John Kerry  D Mass   is the top Democratic Senator on the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship
