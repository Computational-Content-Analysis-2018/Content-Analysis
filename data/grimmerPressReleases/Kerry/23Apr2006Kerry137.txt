OPINION  Pg  B3 LENGTH  674 words    RUNNING for President as the Democratic Party s nominee in 2004 was one of the proudest experiences of my life  But I fear that what my party is considering doing to the process by which we pick a nominee is harming our party by diminishing New Hampshire s unique first in the nation role       I support Iowa and New Hampshire s first in the nation status in our Presidential nominating process  The special role that Iowa and New Hampshire play in Presidential politics has strengthened our democracy by insuring that citizens at the grassroots engage directly with candidates for the Presidency  We should preserve the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary in their traditional forms       The process in New Hampshire is good for American politics  In New Hampshire  citizens open up their homes  their businesses and even their firehouses to gather friends and neighbors and grill the candidates on issues from health care to war and peace  I don t believe I would have been half as prepared to stand on a stage and debate a sitting President had I not first gone through the crucible that is the New Hampshire primary       The process tests you  It makes you better  Candidates become better listeners because they interact with voters in small venues and intimate settings across the state  They learn firsthand about the individual hopes and challenges of thousands of people whom they meet  When the process is over  they have become better qualified to serve the public  Likewise  voters get to know who they are voting for  what kind of person the candidate is  and what he or she really stands for       New Hampshire s reputation for grassroots politics runs deep  Democrats  Independents  and Republicans alike cast votes with extraordinary care  spending hours pouring over candidates  records and traveling across the state in all kinds of weather to see candidates in action  They don t have to rely on the opinions of pundits or the ability of a candidate to spend money on expensive TV ads  Voters have an opportunity to meet  debate  challenge and inform candidates for the highest office in the land  and they take full advantage of it  It does not make sense that the national Democratic Party would want to change this system of active citizen involvement       One thing I have learned from running and being lucky enough to receive my party s nomination is how critically important it is to be able to talk to people one on one and hear their real life stories  Instead of jetting in for big  made for TV events on the airport tarmac or running multi million dollar media campaigns full of sound bites and special effects  candidates who compete in New Hampshire are directly confronted with the people s concerns and questions face to face with nowhere to hide  There is no question in my mind that spending time in New Hampshire made me a better candidate and helped me to shape policies that would help people I met along the campaign trail       Recently when I was in New Hampshire I was asked to comment on what the national party was doing  Let me reaffirm my answer  I strongly support Iowa and New Hampshire s first in the nation status  Period  I have consistently supported Iowa s and New Hampshire s first in the nation status for as long as I have been involved in national politics  That s why I am not in favor of the Democratic National Committee s current plan to place a caucus event between Iowa and New Hampshire  nor am I in favor of placing a primary election during the seven days that immediately follow the New Hampshire primary  I think my party is making a mistake in trying to  fix  something that is not broken       Gov  John Lynch  state Democratic Party Chair Kathy Sullivan and leading New Hampshire Democrats are working incredibly hard to educate party leaders and party members about the critical need to preserve New Hampshire s primary  They make a strong and compelling case    one that national Democrats should heed    John Kerry  the Democratic nominee for President in 2004  is the junior senator from Massachusetts
