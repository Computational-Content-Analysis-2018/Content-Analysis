John Kerry  D Mass   and Hillary Clinton  D N Y   joined with House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel  D Ill  5th District   and House Democratic military veterans Tim Walz  D Minn  1st District  and Patrick Murphy  D Penn  8th District  today to call upon the White House to increase the pay raise for wartime troops to 3 5 percent  The group also asked Bush not to cut a proposed benefit for grieving spouses  which would provide  40 a month to help these military families cover expenses when a loved one is killed in action   Last week  the White House specifically resisted those two provisions in the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Bill         We are here today to ask the President whether he will put his money where his mouth is  about whether America owes our troops and their families a special debt of honor and gratitude during war time   said Senator Kerry    It s unacceptable that this White House continues to choose more tax breaks for the richest Americans and less pay and fewer benefits for our military families   At a time when Army deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan have been extended from 12 months to 15 months  and our troops serve so bravely in Iraq  they are owed pay equal to their sacrifice   and then some   We need to do something to reduce the gap between military and civilian pay  and we need to do it today          If you serve your country your country should serve you   said Senator Clinton   That is the promise our country must keep to the men and women who enlist  who fight  and who return home often bearing the visible and invisible scars of sacrifice  This new Congress will stand with our troops and stand against efforts to block a modest pay raise for our men and women in uniform           This Administration should be embarrassed   said Congressman Emanuel   One in five military families are in desperate enough straits that they have to depend upon food stamps and other assistance to make ends meet and put food on the table  But even after asking our troops to risk their lives thousands of miles from home  all this President wants to give our troops is not some real assistance    but just a handshake and a slap on the back   Our troops deserve better  It s time for our resources to match our rhetoric          At a time when our troops are stretched thin  this pay raise will make a difference in their lives and the lives of their families   said Congressman Patrick Murphy    In 2003  when I was in Baghdad  in the 138 degree heat  the Bush administration wanted to cut our combat pay   That was wrong then and it is wrong now for President Bush to threaten a reckless veto against our soldiers who are putting their lives on the line to protect our families          Instead of calling for shared sacrifice after September 11th  President Bush asked Americans to go shopping   Congressman Walz said    By opposing the military pay increase proposed by Democrats  President Bush sends a clear signal to the troops that the only sacrifice he s willing to ask for is one shared by our military men and women and their families   As a retired senior noncommissioned officer I am astonished at the President s disregard for our soldiers and their families         The Office of Management and Budget said that the House bill s moves to increase military pay by  5 percent  from 3 0 to 3 5 percent  and give a  40 monthly benefit for surviving spouses and military families were  unnecessary   On the same day  the White House expressed opposition to the FY 2008 Budget Resolution Conference Report because it failed to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans        Last year s pay increase for members of the uniformed services was just 2 2 percent  the lowest since 1994  Congress previously made a commitment to keep pay raises for the military ahead of private sector pay raises        Kerry is the author of the Military Family Bill of Rights  A provision from the bill increased the amount received by the beneficiary from  250 000 to  400 000 in the Servicemember s Group Life Insurance policy  Other provisions in the bill extended the amount of time they can remain in military housing to one full year  along with increasing TRICARE benefits and promoting better care for those suffering from PTSD and other mental illness
