                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                For those who have lived the devastation of Hurricane Katrina every day for the last year  this is more than a date on a calendar     more than a    one year anniversary     It   s a hole they   re still trying to dig themselves out of     and sadly they   re doing it with too little help from the federal government     This anniversary is more than a time to remember the victims  the lives lost  the communities destroyed  We   ve had a year to review what went wrong     and there was a lot  But now is not the time for more study or more empty promises  Now is the time for action      A year after losing almost everything during the hurricane  Katrina victims are twice victimized by government inaction  One year later  housing needs of evacuees have not been met  One year later  the infrastructure of New Orleans is still in disarray and trash litters the streets  One year later  the fight against poverty seems to have been forgotten in Washington where at one time politicians were proclaiming a new commitment to end the    separate and unequal    conditions behind the    curtain    which Katrina pulled back  One year later  the clean up is far     too far    from complete  And one year later  small business owners and homeowners still don   t have the aid they   ve been promised for rebuilding their stores  their houses  their economy     The people of the Gulf Coast are proud and resilient     but still they suffer  We knew one year ago that government   s response to Katrina failed them  We know today that one year later too little has changed     Just a few months ago I visited New Orleans for the third time since Hurricane Katrina  What I saw and heard left me stunned by how little is happening compared to how much more must be done  It   s impossible to convey the sheer destruction in New Orleans until you walk the streets  see the flood damage  and talk with business owners who are still struggling  A year later  we still have miles to go rebuilding this region      Enormous work remains to get New Orleans back in business and creating jobs  Small businesses are at the heart of the Gulf Coast   s economy are crucial to the rebuilding effort  so they must remain our focus as we continue to try to jump start the regional economy      The Administration boasts about the  10 billion in disaster loans they have approved  But today only  2 billion of that money has actually made it into the hands of Gulf Coast residents to rebuild    a mere 23 percent  Half of those who applied for disaster loans were denied  Where are they to turn     In September the Senate passed the bipartisan legislation Louisiana Senators Mary Landrieu  David Vitter and I offered to get small businesses immediately back on their feet with bridge loans and other assistance for small businesses   Yet at every turn the Bush administration has blocked this effort and other bipartisan solutions from becoming law     My colleagues and I in Washington have been fighting since day one for assistance to spur the Gulf Coast   s economy and get help to those in need  We   ve drafted plans to get loan money into the hands of businesses and residents quickly  to expand access to federal contracts for local and small businesses  to increase trade opportunities  and to hold the Administration accountable  It   s a start  but it   s still not law yet       Businesses in the Gulf Coast are hanging on by a thread  They can   t endure much more red tape and needless delay   They need action now     not after they close their doors and declare bankruptcy     Talk about Washington   s slow response isn   t enough  We need deadlines and real solutions   We   ve got the money and the brains in this country to get the Gulf Coast back on its feet  and it   s inexcusable that the job   s not done  New Orleans  the Gulf Coast and our country need to know that when we said    never again     we meant it  One year has passed and we have much more to do to ensure those words don   t continue to ring hollow                                                                          20510
