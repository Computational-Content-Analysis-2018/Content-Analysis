 Senators Edward M  Kennedy and John F  Kerry sent a letter to Michael W  Wynne  the Secretary of the Air Force  regarding the privatized housing projects at four bases including Hanscom Air Force Base  All four projects have been under work stoppages for months  are years behind schedule  and are tens of millions of dollars over budget  Local subcontractors involved are concerned about being adequately compensated for work they have performed and expenses they have incurred     Senator Kennedy said  Our men and women serving in the Air Force deserve the best in terms of housing  and the Secretary of the Air Force needs to act quickly to fix this problem  The Hanscom community is rightly proud of its role in our national defense and its unacceptable that so many of these homes have been left partially constructed and exposed to the elements  The community deserves a prompt resolution that includes fair compensation to all the unpaid subcontractors for the work theyve performed and the expenses theyve incurred     Senator Kerry said  We have a duty to support our troops and their families in every way both on the battlefield and back at home  The Air Force needs to immediately address this housing crisis and implement solutions without delay  Our heroes and their loved ones deserve better     December 12  2007     The Honorable Michael W  Wynne    Secretary of the Air Force   1670 Air Force Pentagon   Washington  D C  20330 1670    Dear Secretary Wynne     The privatized housing initiatives at Moody  Little Rock  Hanscom  and Patrick Air Force Bases are dramatic exceptions to the generally successful privatized housing initiative of the Department of Defense  We are alarmed and extremely disappointed at the level of failure at these four projects  all of which have been under work stoppages for months  are years behind schedule  and are tens of millions of dollars over budget     The failure of these projects has traumatized the local communities and resulted  in some cases  in lost homes and businesses by persons unable to re coup their expenses  The failure of these projects also continues to jeopardize the Air Forces strong relationship with four very supportive local communities  and these situations  if not corrected  will have ramifications far beyond the local businesses that have been directly affected     Despite the numerous non government parties involved in these four projects  the housing privatization process has  from its inception  been overseen and managed by the military services  In these cases  the Air Force has determined which projects to pursue  what legal and financial mechanisms to use  which consultants to employ  which project owners and developers to select  and is responsible for implementing a centralized oversight program  The Air Force therefore bears a major responsibility for the failure of these projects  and we look to the Air Force to develop and implement a plan to salvage the housing programs at these four installations and ensure proper oversight is conducted in the future     After considerable study of the housing privatization programs across the Department of Defense  we have come to the following conclusions     1  Either the Air Force did not have adequate mechanisms in place to monitor and ensure adequate performance by the parties to these transactions  or the mechanisms the Air Force relied upon were unsuccessful  or both     2  In theory  project owners and developers for the projects were accountable to bond holders  trustee representatives  and third party consultants  but in practice  they were accountable to no one     3  The sole Air Force representative on site was not a Government employee but a contractor hired by the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment who had no authority and who was not responsible to anyone at the local military installation     4  The Air Force had no direct control of any financial payments to the developer  and any indirect control or leverage the Air Force may have had was either not exercised or ineffective     5  The amount of payment and performance bonds for all of these projects was substantially less than is standard in private sector construction and was not sufficient for subcontractors to recoup their expenses in the event of default     The communities affected by these projects are rightly proud of their role in defending our nation  and they deserve a transparent and reasonable resolution to these issues in a timely manner  We expect the Air Force to do everything it can to protect the members of the affected communities as it resolves these matters satisfactorily     We believe the Department should be more vigorous in vetting project bidders  developers  and lenders before selecting awardees and approving transactions  The Department should communicate more effectively with bondholders to ensure that they act more rapidly when project performance is inadequate  and should do a better job of establishing price reasonableness in reviewing guaranteed maximum price proposals  Projects should also be bonded at a higher level to protect the rights of subcontractors and ensure they can re coup expenses in the event of project default  Finally  developers or project owners that create LLCs to execute specific projects should receive unsatisfactory performance ratings if the LLC itself fails to perform according to standards  In summary  the Air Force should establish and adhere to a robust  effective oversight plan to successfully manage and maintain project performance and schedule     The problems at Moody  Little Rock  Hanscom  and Patrick Air Force Bases are significant and lead us to believe that legislation may be necessary to modify current military housing privatization authorities  The Departments housing privatization initiative must be made more effective in preventing these situations from happening again  We welcome the Air Force s decision to appoint an Inspector General to thoroughly investigate these housing privatization projects from the bidding process to the current stop work order and look forward to reading this report     In the meantime  we would appreciate you providing specific proposals for quickly restoring these projects to health  as well as proposed changes to oversight and management processes  by January 31  2008     Your prompt consideration of this matter is appreciated     Sincerely      Saxby Chambliss Mark Pryor  Edward M  Kennedy  John F  Kerry
