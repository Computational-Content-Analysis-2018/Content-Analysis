Commerce Secretary  Carlos Gutierrez today  Senator John Kerry urged the Commerce Department to reconsider its denial of Massachusetts Governor Deval Patricks request for financial assistance to help the states groundfishermen survive the current fishing disaster    The recent denial by the Commerce Department is another slap in the face to thousands fishermen across Massachusetts  Groundfishermen across the state are facing severe economic hardships  and the Administration refuses to believe it  and refuses to help  Talk to any fishermen here and they will tell you the current crisis is a disaster  I hope the President and the Commerce Department wake up  see that the livelihood of thousands of Massachusetts fishermen is at stake  and do something to help ease their pain  said Senator Kerry    The text of the letter is as follows  November 1  2007 The Honorable Carlos Gutierrez  Secretary  U S  Department of Commerce  Washington  DC 20230   Dear Secretary Gutierrez   We are writing to request that you reconsider the denial of the fishery disaster declaration request by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  The issue is extremely serious for the groundfish industry in our state  which has suffered immensely because of the reduced days at sea that have been imposed in recent years in response to the slow rebuilding of some fish stocks    The Massachusetts groundfish fleet is in crisis today  Thirteen years ago  when the Department of Commerce declared a fishery resource disaster  the weight of groundfish landed was more than twice as great as it is today  For cod  haddock  and yellowtail flounder  landings were nine percent lower in 2005 than the level which triggered the 1994 disaster declaration    In his letter to Governor Patrick explaining the decision to deny the states disaster declaration request  Dr  Hogarth wrote  Our latest research shows encouraging increases in most of the groundfish stocks including cod  haddock  and Georges Bank yellowtail  These stocks may be rebuilding  but they are off limits to most fishermen because they have not been found to have reached a sustainable yield level  As a practical matter  these stocks are no more available to fishermen in todays fishery than they were in 1994  so it is  at a minimum  inconsistent to cite successful rebuilding as a reason for the decision to deny the disaster declaration    Groundfish species have not recovered sufficiently to avert this crisis  Instead of recovering from the disaster in 1994  the industry has continued to falter  because of the combined effect of slow recruitment of some species and continued restrictions on fishing  According to the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries  species such as Cape Cod and Gulf of Maine yellowtail are in worse condition now than in the mid 1990s and Gulf of Maine cod are only somewhat better off  As a result  even though other species are more successfully rebuilding  the multi species nature of the groundfish fishery means that overall restrictions on fishing remain extremely strict    Massachusetts groundfish vessels have lost 18 percent in revenue since the implementation last year of Framework 42 to the Northeast Multi species Fishery  Many vessels had already been forced out of the fishery in recent years when their days at sea were cut from 88 to 53  and even fewer will survive the shock of having just 24 days at sea under Framework 42  Many of the remaining fishermen wont have the resources to modify their gear types to harvest stronger stocks    A revenue loss of this size constitutes a real emergency in the fisherys shoreside services as well  These services  such as boat repair and fish processing  are essential to the fishery  but they must have customers to survive  Unless federal assistance is available to keep the groundfish sector from collapsing  we risk losing forever our working waterfronts  which have been an important part of the Massachusetts coastal economy for centuries    NOAA should recognize this crisis for what it is   a continuation of the 1994 disaster that has been sped up by the implementation of Framework 42  Unless the agency declares a fishery resource disaster  our fishing industry may not have adequate resources to harvest stocks when they are more fully rebuilt    We recognize that the agency is operating without clear objective criteria to grade a disaster when it is occurring  but we strongly believe that the current crisis in the Massachusetts groundfish sector qualifies as a disaster  and we urge you to reconsider the denial of the disaster declaration    With respect and appreciation  and we thank you for considering our request   Senator John Kerry  Senator Edward Kennedy  Congressman Barney Frank
