Example of Misplaced Priorities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC     Today  leading pro trade Senate Democrats joined together in opposition to the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the Bush administration   s failed trade policies   Assistant Democratic Leader Dick Durbin  Senator Debbie Stabenow  Senator Chuck Schumer and Senator John Kerry declared CAFTA a flawed agreement that symbolizes the Bush White House   s pattern of misplaced priorities and failure to develop an effective strategy to make trade keep America competitive           I have voted for free trade and I believe in free trade     provided it is fair trade that expands our economy and creates American jobs   But our President has put forward a trade strategy that offers only small short term benefits  but in the long run hurts American manufacturers and farmers     said Senator Durbin      The Bush Administration refuses to stand up and enforce our existing trade laws when confronted with unfair trade practices against the United States   That needs to change  and we cannot continue to approve trade agreements that do not serve our long term national interests  CAFTA is a flawed agreement that does not address basic labor standards which is why I will vote against that measure today  CAFTA is the wrong agreement at the wrong time           The Bush administration has failed to address the growing trade deficit  now on pace to exceed  700 billion in 2005   This record trade deficit has made America more reliant on foreign borrowing     weakening the American economy   At the same time  American workers continue to face the outsourcing of jobs overseas and the negative impact of China   s unfair trading practices with no action from this administration           CAFTA will ship jobs overseas and provide few export markets for American companies     said Senator Stabenow     Rather than entering into another free trade agreement with countries that don   t share our wage structure  labor standards  or environmental standards  we need start enforcing the agreements already in place           The Senators criticized the administration for putting forward a flawed trade agreement that takes a step backwards from current U S  trade rules   By failing to require that trade partners meet basic internationally accepted standards  the president missed the opportunity to create an agreement that would benefit workers here and abroad   Without the needed investments for workers overseas and training assistance for workers here at home  CAFTA represents a misguided approach on trade            I have been a long time supporter of free trade  but I believe it must be accompanied by strong enforcement mechanisms to ensure our trade agreements are followed  as well as a fair and open process for raising concerns and resolving violations   Despite strong bipartisan support for an amendment improving labor enforcement provisions  there is nothing in the final CAFTA language that addresses any labor enforcement concerns   In fact  while the committee favored extending Trade Adjustment Assistance to service workers in markup  the final agreement doesn   t extend TAA for service workers   We want to promote free trade AND fair trade    Without adding provisions for fair trade  the administration faces a rising tide of opposition to trade agreements     said Senator Schumer         It s no mystery why so many long time leaders on trade oppose CAFTA  Rather than build on the success of the Jordan Free Trade Agreement which advanced labor and environmental standards  CAFTA breaks a ten year consensus on trade policy   Unlike previous Republican and Democratic administrations  the Bush administration negotiates trade deals that take us backward and refuses to enforce the trade agreements we already have     said Senator Kerry     Under CAFTA  workers don t even have the same standing to end child labor that corporations have to end copyright theft  That s an unfair double standard that punishes American workers   Our trade agreements can and must do a better job empowering American workers to win in a globalized world  and helping to lift up people and economies across the globe to aid in stability and security  By that measure  this Administration s trade policy is a total failure  and it s up to us to set the right standard for free trade
