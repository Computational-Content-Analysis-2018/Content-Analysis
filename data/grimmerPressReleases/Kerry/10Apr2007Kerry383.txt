Senator John Kerry and Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich debated the issues of global climate change and the environment  The debate was a part of the New York University s John Brademas Center exploratory series  Legislating for the Future   and took place this morning on Capitol Hill        Below is Senator Kerry s opening statement as prepared for delivery        I truly appreciate Newt Gingrich s willingness to debate climate change with me today          It s refreshing to hear a conservative politician take climate change seriously as a national challenge   It s helpful that he knows a lot about science  especially biology  and doesn t simply rely on slurs against the good faith of those who disagree with him   And as always  Mr  Gingrich shows an inspiring confidence in the power of American ingenuity in making the problem of climate change an opportunity for U S  businesses  scientists and engineers        But ultimately  when you boil off the realism and optimism of his language  he s marching in lock step with the climate change deniers  the pessimists and the polluters in arguing that real national action to address climate change is either unnecessary or impossible   If he were in charge of the Bush administration s energy and environmental work  you d hear a different kind of rhetoric all right  but it s not clear to me any of the policies would change   His stubborn conviction that government s only role on this topic is to study it to death  to get out of the way of industry  to set voluntary goals for greenhouse gas emissions  and perhaps to throw some taxpayers  dollars at companies that do the right thing  shows that even the smartest conservatives have a long way to go in coming to grips with one of the most urgent challenges facing this country in the current century  and perhaps in our entire history        Let me first address Mr  Gingrich s suggestion that the science of climate change is so unsettled that we need more studies before acting   Now I m all for an accelerated effort to invest in scientific research to measure climate change and its causes  and to carefully assess our progress and the world s towards a solution   But we re now clearly past the point where we need to document the reality of climate change  its potentially catastrophic effects on human life  the ways in which we are contributing to it  and the steps needed to reverse the trends before it is too late          The gold standard for research on this subject is provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  a collaboration of more than 2 000 scientists from 130 countries   Looking for  research  outside the consensus findings of the IPCC is like looking for a lake in the Sahara Desert  it s a waste of time   The IPCC is releasing its fourth major report later this month  but it s already released its major findings and recommendations  and they are conclusive          Global warming is real and ever accelerating  these scientists say   There s now a 90 percent probability that heat trapping pollution  largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels  has been the main factor in causing global warming since 1950  these scientists say   And if we don t reduce  much less increase  this fossil fuel consumption  then the earth will warm by 4 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit during this century  with the best estimate being about 7 degrees Fahrenheit   A change of this magnitude would likely produce climate consequences on a scale that brings to mind the calamities predicted in the Book of Revelation  including massive increases in sea levels  a radical escalation of droughts and floods  an explosion of climate related diseases  and conditions in which many areas of the world that are heavily populated and often desperately poor will become uninhabitable          Worse yet  these scientists say  global warming will release additional greenhouse gases  especially methane  currently locked up in frozen ground  compounding the greenhouse effect even more   And you no longer have to simply imagine the impact of global warming  since it s already becoming apparent in the rapid melting of Arctic ice  the uptick in violent storms  and significant changes in overall temperatures          Now it s true the IPCC  using its most conservative assessments  concedes there s a 10  possibility that manmade greenhouse gas emissions are not the major cause of global warming  but I d ask you this  if you bought a plane ticket today knowing you had a 10  probability of reaching your destination safely  would you get on that plane   You d have to be much more of an optimist than even Newt Gingrich to accept that gamble  and when it comes to climate change  we are gambling with everything on earth we care about  including our prosperity  our security  our health  our values and even our freedom         So sure  let s accelerate the scientific study of climate change and its causes and solutions  but not at the expense of immediate action to prevent its worst consequences         And that brings me to the next problem I have with Mr  Gingrich s presentation  the belief that we can somehow address climate change through deregulation  voluntary action  and what I guess you might call rhetorical enchantment          There s no question that dumb government policies  illustrated by the Bush administration s frantic efforts to increase oil and gas development  can make environmental problems worse   But if voluntary action were sufficient to address environmental challenges  we would have never needed to enact the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act  and I don t think Mr  Gingrich would argue for that proposition         The fundamental reality is that climate change  like other environmental problems  reflects a market failure  for the simple reason that the costs associated with fossil fuel consumption are not reflected in the price of the energy products and technologies that create these costs   That s why government action is necessary   And that s not just my opinion   It s the opinion of growing numbers of corporate executives  as reflected in the recent Call to Action by the U S  Climate Change Partnership  representing among others such corporate giants as Alcoa  BP America  Caterpillar  Duke Energy  DuPont  FPL Group  General Electric  Lehman Brothers  PG  and PNM Resources   They understand that only a strong public commitment to mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions  which the Bush administration continues to fight  tooth and nail  can make markets work efficiently to create the new  clean energy technologies Newt Gingrich speaks about so inspiringly  and to make energy conservation pay for all of us         And that brings me to the final point I want to make about Mr  Gingrich s presentation  his suggestion that we cannot afford to take quick national action on climate change          If the IPCC s reports represent the gold standard of scientific research on climate change  the gold standard for research on the costs and benefits of action and inaction on climate change is provided by the Stern Review  named for former chief economist of the World Bank  Nicholas Stern  and released in October of last year   According to this report  if we act now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  the total costs of avoiding catastrophic climate change can be limited to about 1  of global gross domestic product each year   That sounds like a lot  but the Stern Review also concludes that if we don t act  the costs won t simply go away   they will rise to at least 5  of global GDP within 20 years  and could go as high as 20  of GDP later   It s hard to even imagine the impact that would have on our quality of life  totally aside from the effects of climate change itself          Moreover  the sooner we undertake these costs  the greater our opportunity to minimize them  and to unleash the potentially vast benefits of placing America in a leadership position in the international clean energy markets that will soon represent the fastest growing economic sector of the 21st century          I remember when Newt Gingrich worked with many of us on a bipartisan basis to address the acid rain crisis  back in the late 1980s  helping to enact a  cap and trade  system for sulfur dioxide much like the one so many of us now propose for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases   Because we acted then  we achieved our goals far faster than we expected  and at roughly one fourth of the estimated costs   You can t fully assess the savings achievable by harnessing the innovative genius of the American system until you try          And here s the thing we absolutely must remember in discussing the costs and benefits of immediate action on climate change  the benefits will go far beyond an abatement of climate change  or even the vast profits our businesses can secure in clean energy markets   Because our dependence of fossil fuels is so damaging in so many ways  the benefits of reducing that dependence will include the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans who won t die from preventable cancers or respiratory ailments  they will include a vast enhancement of our ability to keep our rivers and lakes clean  our air breathable  our habitats intact  our wild spaces pristine  and our land uncontaminated and hospitable to life          We won t achieve those benefits unless we act now  in Washington   We won t get to that exciting future of hydrogen cars and alternative energy sources and conservation technologies that Newt Gingrich talks about by commissioning new studies or sitting on our hands while we wait for the invisible hand of the marketplace to take care of it all   And you can t fight carbon caps and better auto efficiency standards or international climate change diplomacy and mocking or demonizing visionaries like Al Gore and still claim to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem   And you can t defend the status quo  as represented by the Bush Administration s endless stalling and excuse making on climate change  and at the same time ask for the right to shape the future                                                                                         20510
