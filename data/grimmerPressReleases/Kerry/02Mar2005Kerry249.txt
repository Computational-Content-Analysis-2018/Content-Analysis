Leaders and Members of Congress  Rev  Jackson  members of the Robinson family  ladies and gentlemen     Jackie Robinson was a giant  and this is a proud moment when we honor and remember a life of remarkable contribution and accomplishment        I want to thank Congressman Neal for his leadership and partnership in the effort to make this day possible       It   s been an honor to work with Jackie   s wife  Rachel  and their children   Sharon and David       And President Bush  thank you for joining us on this historic day        We know Jackie Robinson was a great athlete  His talents earned him a scholarship to UCLA where he lettered in football  basketball  baseball  and track   He was so gifted that people still wonder today whether baseball was even his best sport        But that   s not why we   re here  While Jackie Robinson never set out to be a civil rights leader    never sought attention or fame   the civil rights movement found him  It   s hard for some people to imagine a day in America when there was no such thing as being    just an African American ballplayer     But we can never forget what it meant to live under Jim Crow   Jackie Robinson knew it   he lived it        The grandson of slaves  the son of sharecroppers    he answered his country   s call to service and joined the Army in 1942  In the segregated army of those dark days when white and black men could bleed a battlefield red for their country but they couldn   t use the same water fountain  Jackie Robinson stood up for freedom    July 1944   ten years before the Montgomery Bus Boycott   ten years before Rosa Parks inspired a nation   years before President Truman desegregated the military   active duty Lt  Robinson was ordered to sit in the back of a bus traveling through Texas  He refused and was court martialed  Jackie Robinson fought the charge and was fully exonerated  He cleared his good name   and won his first battle to clear our racial conscience    Lt  Robinson knew the full meaning of patriotism  the real challenge of the words    my country  right or wrong     He lived the lesson   if your country   s right  keep it right  if your country   s wrong  make it right  That was Jackie Robinson   s kind of patriotism    standing up against power and fighting   with courage  with grace  with dignity   for justice  Just beginning  as Dr  King said of him  to challenge    the dark skies of intolerance and frustration    He loved the game of baseball   and played it with skill and speed and a quiet excellence that was a gift from God  One year with the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro League  one year with the minor league Montreal Royals  a try out with the Red Sox that reminded us all how far we had yet to come  And then  finally  Brooklyn  1947   the first African American to play in Major League Baseball  Very few people today know what those early days were really like  He risked his life  he risked his family  Branch Rickey wondered how he endured the    racial epithets and flying cleats  hate letters and death threats  pitchers throwing at his head and legs   catchers spitting on his shoes     His double play partner Pee Wee Reese summed it up     he had to block out everything but this ball coming in at 100 miles per hour  To do what he did has to be the most tremendous thing I   ve ever seen in sports        More than that    before the civil rights marches in the South  before some of our major universities admitted African Americans  before Brown v  Board of Education   to do what he did was one of the most courageous things we   d seen in our country    Rookie of the year  a most valuable player award  six pennants  a World Series   these accomplishments on the baseball diamond earned Jackie Robinson a place in Cooperstown    But we honor him today for the courage   the character   the conviction of a lifetime that lead him to put himself on the line for freedom  We honor him because the land of the free became a little freer thanks to this brave man    We honor his passion to make America a better place for all of us  and we remember that work didn   t end when Jackie Robinson broke the color line    His words challenge us today  Jackie said    A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives   Well  he had an impact   and we need to remember those words next time someone says we can t make a difference    We got a Civil Rights Act because people were willing to march    Women achieved the right to vote not because it was just given to them  but because they fought for it and demanded it    History chose a 26 year old minister to lead us from bus boycotts to the march on Washington and to the mountaintop to begin to change the hearts of a divided nation  And that journey is still unfinished    Half a century later  in a very different but equally fateful time  honoring Jackie Robinson reminds us of the road traveled and the road still to be traveled  He reminds us that there   s still work for all to do  and no room on the sidelines  The Congressional Gold Medal honors Jackie Robinson for living up to his own standard   and setting the standard for us today    Thank you                                                                           20510
