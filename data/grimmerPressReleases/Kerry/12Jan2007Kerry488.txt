Congressional Pension Accountability Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mr  President  I call up Senate amendment 1 and ask for its immediate consideration  Mr  President  my amendment  which is cosponsored by Senators Salazar  Bill Nelson  and Pryor  is based on a bill that Senator Salazar and I introduced that would go a long way toward re building the trust of the American people  We do that by preventing members of Congress who steal or cheat from cashing in at the expense of taxpayers by receiving a life long pension that taxpayers are not paying for the pensions of Congressmen like Duke Cunninghamcongressmen who have been convicted of serious ethical violations  Specifically  our amendment strips away the federal pensions of Members of Congress who are convicted of white collar crimes such as bribery and fraud  Last year  former Representative Randy Duke Cunningham received the longest prison sentence ever imposed on a former member of Congress  His crime  He collected approximately  2 4 million in homes  yachts  antique furnishings and other bribesincluding a Rolls Roycefrom defense contractors  This disgraceful conductwhich is beyond my comprehensionhas earned him eight years and four months in a federal prison and has required him to pay the government  1 8 million in penalties and  1 85 million in ill gotten gains  But  you know what  Under today s rules the American taxpayer will continue to pay his federal pensiona pension worth approximately  40 000 per year  Right now  only a conviction for a crime against the United States  such as treason or espionage  would cost a Member of Congress their pension  Surely we can set the moral bar higher than that  Mr  President  most Americans don t get a  40 000 per year pension  Those who abuse the public trust shouldn t be allowed to exploit the federal retirement system at taxpayer expense  That is simply unacceptable  It has got to change  The American people can t afford to spend millions on pensions for politicians who stole from them  But more importantly  Congress can t afford to squander the public s trust  I would like to take a moment to read from the Sentencing Memorandum for Duke Cunningham filed by the Justice Department last month  The naked avarice that animated Cunningham s corruption is starkly framed in one of Cunningham s Congressional note cards  Under the very seal of the United States Congress  Cunningham placed this nation s governance up for sale to a defense contractor    detailing the amount of bribes necessary to obtain varying levels of defense appropriations  In this so called bribe menu  the left column represented the millions in government contracts that could be ordered from Cunningham  The right column was the amount of the bribes that the Congressman was demanding in exchange for those contracts  For example   16 million in government defense contracts could beand werebought for the price of a  140 000 boat title  the BT on this chart  The next four rows indicate that an additional million dollars in funding was for sale in exchange for every additional  50 000 that the defense contractor was willing to pay Cunningham  Once the defense contractor had paid Cunningham  340 000 in bribes  the rates dropped  and  as the final five rows reflect  Cunningham would charge only  25 000 for each additional million dollars that was awarded in additional government contracts  Sadly  Duke Cunningham was not alone  Last November  Representative Bob Ney resigned from the House of Representatives after pleading guilty to conspiracy and making false statements  In a plea agreement  former Representative Ney acknowledged taking trips  tickets  meals and campaign donations from Mr  Abramoff in return for taking official actions on behalf of Abramoff clients  In March 2002  Representative Ney inserted an amendment in the Help America Vote Act to lift an existing federal ban against commercial gaming by a Texas Native American Tribal client of Abramoff  In return  Representative Ney received all expense paid and reduced price trips to Scotland to play golf  a trip to New Orleans to gamble and a vacation in Lake George  NY all courtesy of Mr  Abramoff  Another former Congressman  Jim Traficant  currently enjoys a lavish taxpayer funded lifetime pension worth an estimated  1 2 million despite being thrown out of Congress and sent to jail  Cunningham  Ney  and Traficant are just three of at least 20 former lawmakers convicted of serious crimes still receiving a taxpayer funded pensionsome as high as  125 000 per year  As elected representatives  I believe we must hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards  The principal is a simple one  Public servants who abuse the public trust and are convicted of ethics crimes should not collect taxpayer financed pensions  Taxpayers should not have their hard earned money used to fund the retirement of convicted criminals  My amendment would simply deny federal pensions to Members of Congress  like Duke Cunningham and Bob Ney  who are convictedas soon as is legally possible   of white collar crimes such as  bribery of public officials and witnesses  conspiracy to defraud the United States  perjury in falsely denying the commission of bribery or conspiracy  and subornation of perjury committed in connection with the false denial or false testimony of another individual  It is my understanding that there is some concern about how this legislation may affect innocent spouses and children of Members of Congress who lose their pensions as a result of this legislation  Even after this legislation is enacted  the Member will still receive a refund of all contributions into the either the Federal Employees Retirement System  FERS  or the Civil Service Retirement System  CSRS  and will retain all benefits from the Thrift Savings Plan  TSP   Also  the payment of spousal benefits is permitted in forfeiture cases when the Attorney General determines that the spouse cooperated with federal authorities in the conduct of a criminal investigation  and subsequent prosecution of the Member of Congress  The Congressional Pension Accountability Act is supported by the National Taxpayers Union and a similar provision is supported by Taxpayers for Common Sense  the Family Research Council and Citizens Against Government Waste  Ultimately this is less about money than it is about trust  As Congress debates ethics reform  those of us who went to the voters and promised to clean up Washington must also take another small but essential step toward regaining the public s trust  End pensions for Congressmen convicted of white collar crimes involving the abuse of their office  Now is clearly the time to act  States such as Illinois already have laws like this one on their books  and have used them to good effect against corrupt politicians  This is not partisan politicsit is simply a matter of good government  Together we can significantly improve our government by changing the way business is done and ensuring that it once again responds to the needs of our people  not special interests  The American people should no longer be forced to send pension checks to criminals  This amendment is a step in the right direction  I urge your support                                                                          20510
