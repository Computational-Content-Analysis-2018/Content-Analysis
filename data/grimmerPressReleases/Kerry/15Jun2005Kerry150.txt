fighting to protect Medicaid benefits for the neediest citizens today at a Senate Finance Committee hearing in the face of Republican cuts        Senator Kerry said     Medicaid is the crown jewel of the safety net   It is the nation   s largest health care program   providing health and long term care services to 53 million low income pregnant women  children  individuals with disabilities  and seniors   Medicaid serves those for whom  if the program did not exist  they would not receive care anywhere else          Senator Kerry went on to say     Under the Bush economy  this program has grown more vital than ever   Medicaid costs and enrollment figures have grown because the economy   s recession has created such a demand for its services   People who once had jobs with health coverage are either losing their jobs or losing their health benefits and Medicaid is the backstop to ensure that those in greatest need are not simply added to our uninsured rolls   a figure that already stands at 45 million Americans and is a mark of shame on this great nation   Health care should be a right  not a privilege           Below is the text of Senator Kerry   s statement       Thank you  Chairman Grassley  for calling this important hearing and for allowing a balanced panel of witnesses to come before us today   I am anxious to dialogue with these experts on ways for us to strengthen the Medicaid program       Medicaid is the crown jewel of the safety net   It is the nation   s largest health care program   providing health and long term care services to 53 million low income pregnant women  children  individuals with disabilities  and seniors   Medicaid serves those for whom  if the program did not exist  they would not receive care anywhere else   It is called a safety net because it serves the poor and vulnerable and we have a special obligation to strengthen and protect it       Under the Bush economy  this program has grown more vital than ever   Medicaid costs and enrollment figures have grown because the economy   s recession has created such a demand for its services   People who once had jobs with health coverage are either losing their jobs or losing their health benefits and Medicaid is the backstop to ensure that those in greatest need are not simply added to our uninsured rolls   a figure that already stands at 45 million Americans and is a mark of shame on this great nation   Health care should be a right  not a privilege       It is inconceivable to me that the United States Congress continues to exercise budget restraint not by saying no to large tax cuts for the wealthy  but by going after programs like Medicaid to find budget savings   Trimming the fat from government programs is one thing   but for a program already as lean as Medicaid  this results in scraping at the bones   Real lives are harmed by the decisions we make         We can sit here and have an intellectual discussion about how changing or    reforming    the program can produce this or that amount of savings  but when it comes down to it  the question we really must ask is who we are hurting by our decisions   because every dollar taken out of this program  whether it be  10 billion or even a million  results in fewer services for someone in need         I was reminded in church by this Sunday   s readings the reasons why we have an obligation to the vulnerable in society   In the 10th chapter of Matthew   s gospel we are told     Without cost you have received  without cost you are to give      My priest cautioned us that our talents  our wealth  our achievements are nothing we have earned   they are all from God   s graces   and we should therefore freely give of those graces to others   But when it comes to programs like Medicaid  we are very stingy givers         I think we are missing the mark in our discussions today   While I do not disagree that some of the suggested reforms should be considered and perhaps even implemented to improve the workings of the program  the idea of making changes just to hit budget savings targets is all wrong       I believe we should instead be having a discussion about the need to right size the federal state partnership under Medicaid   The federal government should give more and expect more         We could cover every one of the nation   s 11 million uninsured children AND give states needed fiscal relief if we got creative with our policies         I have proposed legislation called     KidsFirst     which would federalize all Medicaid costs for beneficiaries under age 21 that are below poverty   In exchange  states agree to expand their health programs for children in higher income families and reduce the barriers to enrollment that keep so many of our eligible children unenrolled         The result   Universal coverage for children and additional resources for states to address other health care needs   This compact would provide states with an estimated  6 billion annually more than what they are required to spend in their expansion programs         More than 700 000 Americans have signed a citizens    petition in support of the KidsFirst bill  another 20 000 phoned in and recorded their personal stories on why this legislation is so crucial  and it has gained the endorsement of leading health and children   s organizations that represent more than 20 million Americans nationwide       If we cannot find the common ground for bipartisan agreement to cover all of our children with good health care  we are really failing as a nation       I look forward to the day when we return to making decisions in this Capital that reflect forward thinking  progressive policies that improve the lives of millions of Americans         Thank you again  Chairman Grassley  for gathering us here today for this discussion and I welcome the opportunity to continue this dialogue after our witnesses give their testimony
