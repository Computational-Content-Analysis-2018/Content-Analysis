and Edward Kennedy today  along with 36 of their colleagues  urged the Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Subcommittee to provide an additional  1 billion in emergency Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  funding in fiscal year 2008 to provide for a total of  3 412 billion  No one should have to worry about how to put food on their table or have to choose about going without medical care just so they can heat their homes  This funding would go a long way in helping to prevent that very likely scenario  Thousands of people here in Massachusetts desperately need our help  I strongly urge my colleagues to make sure millions throughout Massachusetts and the rest of the nation arent left in the cold  said Senator Kerry  Winter has already started for countless families in Massachusetts  New England  and across the country who can t afford the skyrocketing cost of heating their homes  LIHEAP was formed for just such emergencies  and Congress should act now to make sure that adequate federal funds are available to meet the urgent need  said Senator Kennedy    The text of the letter is as follows   The Honorable Tom Harkin  Chairman   The Honorable Arlen Specter  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services    and Education  and Related Agencies  Committee on Appropriations  Washington  DC 20510   Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter    We are writing to request that you include an additional  1 billion in emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in fiscal year 2008 to provide for a total of  3 412 billion  We recognize the difficult budget constraints that the Subcommittee faces and appreciate your support for additional funding for the LIHEAP program in FY2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  and Related Appropriations Conference Report that was vetoed     With the price of oil hovering near  100 per barrel  and the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimating that households can expect to pay between 10 to 26 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2007 2008 winter  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden of families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens and ensure their health and safety this winter    Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population  During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305  Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise  As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the programs purchasing power  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding  The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million  For these reasons  we believe an additional  1 billion in emergency funding is warranted    LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Childrens Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children  In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills  For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances    Moreover  the program helps low income homeowners weatherize their homes to save energy and lower their energy burden  Weatherization  on average  reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by  200 to  250 per year    Thank you for your consideration  We look forward to working with you to increase funding for the LIHEAP program to ensure that low income seniors  individuals with disabilities  and families have the resources that they need to stay warm this winter    Sincerely    John Kerry  Edward Kennedy  Jack Reed  Susan Collins  Max Baucus  Hillary Rodham Clinton  Olympia Snowe  Bernard Sanders
