       Releases                                                                                                                                           04 06 2006 John Kerry Speaks on His Iraq Strategy   Two Deadlines and an Exit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Introduces Senate Resolution on Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                In a speech on the Senate floor today  John Kerry lays out two important deadlines for Iraq     if Iraqi leaders can t form a unity government by May 15  American troops must leave rather than be stuck in the crossfire of an escalating civil war  if they do form a government  we need to empower the new Iraqi leaders by agreeing on a schedule to withdraw American combat forces by the end of 2006          The resolution Kerry introduced in the Senate today is attached          Below are Kerry   s remarks as prepared          Thirty nine years ago this week  Dr  Martin Luther King gave a speech at the Riverside Church in New York about the war in Vietnam  He began with these words     I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice     His message was clear  despite the difficulty of opposing the government   s policy during time of war     We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision  but we must speak             I am here today to speak about Iraq   There should be humility enough to go around for a Congress that shares responsibility for this war   I believe that the time has come again when  as Dr  King said     We must move past indecision to action            When you stand in the    V    at the Vietnam Wall  you can   t help but see that half the names were added after American leaders knew our strategy would not work   It was immoral then and it would be immoral now to engage in the same delusion          Yes we would prefer to see democracy in Iraq     indeed in the whole Middle East   The simple reality is     Iraqis must want it and embrace it   If the Iraqi leadership isn   t ready to make the changes and compromises that democracy requires  our soldiers  no matter how valiant  can   t give it birth from a humvee or a helicopter        The fact is that our soldiers have done an incredible job of giving the Iraqis the opportunity to create a democratic future for their country  Our soldiers have done their job  It   s time for the newly elected Iraqi leaders to do their job  And it   s past time for America   s political leaders to do theirs          President Bush says we cannot lose our nerve in Iraq  But it takes more nerve to respond to mistakes than to stubbornly continue down the wrong path  Last week  Secretary Rice acknowledged thousands of mistakes in Iraq  Nobody has been held accountable for these errors  but our troops have paid the price  Yet the President continues to insist on a vague and counter productive strategy that will keep U S  forces in Iraq indefinitely         I accept my share of responsibility for the war in Iraq  As I said in 2004  knowing what we know now  I would not have gone to war   My frustration is that many of us have offered alternatives and suggestions to correct our course in Iraq  Time after time  the Administration has ignored them         The Administration is fond of saying we shouldn   t look back  that recrimination only helps our enemies  that we have to deal with the situation on the ground now       Frankly  I think that accountability and learning from past mistakes is the only way to improve both policies and institutions  But  let me for the moment  go along with this idea     let me focus on the here and now  Let us face that reality honestly and act accordingly       One has to live in fantasy world to believe that we are on the brink of domestic peace and pluralistic democracy in Iraq  One has to be blind to the facts to argue that the prospects for success are so great that they outweigh the terrible costs of the present approach  And  finally  one has to be incapable of admitting error to not face up to the need to change course now     Yes now Mr  President     this year      Our soldiers on the ground have learned many terrible lessons in Iraq  Now  it is time we learned those lessons in Washington        It is clear that the Administration   s litany of mistakes has reduced what we can reasonably expect to accomplish   And still  I will not sit by and watch while American soldiers give their lives for a policy that isn   t working           So let me say it plainly   withdrawing U S  troops from Iraq is necessary to give democracy a chance to succeed and is vital to America   s national security interests          Five months ago  I said at Georgetown University that we were entering a make or break six month period in Iraq  I said the President must change course and hold Iraqis accountable  or Congress should insist on a change in policy  And I set a goal of withdrawing most American combat forces by the end of this year         The situation on the ground has changed for the worse since then  In fact  we are now in the third war in Iraq in as many years   The first was against Saddam Hussein and his alleged weapons of mass destruction   The second was against jihadists terrorists who the Administration said it was better    to fight over there than here      Now we find our troops in the middle of a low grade civil war that could explode at any time         But while events in Iraq have changed for the worse  the President has not changed course for the better  It is time for Congress to act   We have a constitutional responsibility and a moral responsibility not to sit on the sidelines while young Americans are in harm   s way          That is why today  I am introducing a resolution that will hold the Iraqis accountable and make the goal of withdrawing most American forces a reality  I believe most of our forces should be out by the end of the year         This war  in the words of our generals  cannot be won militarily   It must be won politically   General Casey has said that our large military presence    feeds the notion of occupation    and    extends the amount of time that it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self reliant      As Zbigniew Brzezinski recently put it     The U S  umbrella  which is in effect designed to stifle these wars but is so poor that it perpetuates them  in a sense keeps these wars alive   and  is  probably unintentionally actually intensifying them     Richard Nixon   s Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird  breaking a 30 year silence  summed it up simply    Our presence is what feeds the insurgency    The bottom line is that as long as American forces remain in large numbers  enforcing the status quo  Americans will be killed and maimed in the crossfire of vicious conflict they are powerless to end        We pay for the President   s reluctance to face reality in American dollars  and too many American families pay in the loss of a loved one   s life   We can no longer tolerate the political games currently being played by Iraqi politicians in war torn Baghdad  No American soldier should be sacrificed for the unwillingness of Iraqi politicians to compromise and form a unity government         Given the recent increase in deadly sectarian strife  Iraq urgently needs a strong unity government to prevent a full fledged civil war from breaking out and Iraq from becoming a failed state   Thus far  Iraqis have only responded to deadlines  It took a deadline to transfer authority to a provisional government  a deadline for a first election  a referendum  and a recent election  It is time for another deadline to get our troops out and get Iraq up on its own two feet         Iraqi politicians should be told in unmistakable language    you have until May 15th to put together an effective unity government or we will immediately withdraw our military     After the last elections  the momentum was lost by squabbling interim leaders   That has gone on for too long again   If Iraqis aren   t willing to build a unity government in the five months after the past election  they won   t be willing to build it at all  The civil war will only get worse  and nothing American soldiers do will change that  We will have no choice but to leave        To ratchet up the pressure  we should immediately accelerate redeployment of American forces to rear guard  garrisoned status for security back up  training and emergency response   Special operations against Al Qaeda in Iraq should be initiated on hard intelligence leads only        If the Iraqi leaders finally do their job  we must agree upon a schedule for leaving  withdrawing American combat forces by the end of this year   The only troops that remain should be those critical to finishing the job of standing up Iraqi security forces   Such an agreement will empower and legitimize the new leadership with the Iraqi people  expedite the process of getting Iraqis to assume a larger role in running their country  and undermine support for the insurgency among the 80  of Iraqis who want U S  troops to leave  In short  it will give the new Iraqi government the best chance to succeed in holding the country together while democratic institutions can evolve         This deadline makes sense given the responsibilities Iraqis should have assumed by then  Formation of this unity government would constitute a major milestone in the transfer of political responsibility to the Iraqis  Even the President has said that responsibility for security in the majority of the country should be able to be transferred to Iraqis by this time  and the U S  troops critical to finishing this process will remain  By the end of the year  our troops will have done as much as they can to give Iraqis a chance to build a democracy           Key to this transition is a long overdue engagement in serious and sustained diplomacy  Starting with the lead up to the war  our diplomatic efforts in Iraq have ranged from the indifferent to the indefensible  History shows that effective diplomacy requires persistent  hands on engagement from the highest levels of America   s leadership  Top officials in the first Bush Administration worked directly and tirelessly to bring together a real coalition before the first Gulf war  And President Clinton himself took responsibility at Camp David for bringing the Israelis and Palestinians together and leading a comprehensive effort to resolve the conflict in the Middle East         This type of major diplomatic initiative has proven successful  In 1995  there was a brutal civil war in Bosnia involving Serbs  Croats and Muslims  Faced with a seemingly intractable stalemate in the midst of horrific ethnic cleansing  the Clinton Administration took action  Led by Richard Holbrooke  they brought leaders of the Bosnian parties together in Dayton  Ohio with representatives from the European Union  Russia and Britain to hammer out a peace agreement  NATO and the United Nations were given a prominent role in implementing what became known as the Dayton Accords          In contrast  this President Bush has done little more than deliver political speeches as his cronies in the White House blame the news media for the mess his Administration has created in Iraq  Secretary of State Rice   s brief surprise visit to Iraq pales in comparison to the real shuttle diplomacy practiced by predecessors like James Baker and Henry Kissinger  Given what is at stake  it is past time to engage in diplomacy that matches the effort of our soldiers on the ground         We must immediately bring the leaders of the Iraqi factions together at a Dayton like summit that includes our allies  Iraq   s neighbors  members of the Arab League and the U N  The fact is that a true national compact is needed to bring about a political solution to the insurgency and end the sectarian violence  In addition to forming a unity government  the Iraqis    must reach a comprehensive agreement that includes security guarantees  disbanding the militias  amendments to the Constitution  And all of the parties much reach agreement on a process for reviving reconstruction efforts and securing Iraq   s borders         At this Summit  Shiite religious leaders must agree to rein in their militias and commit to disbanding them  They must also work with Iraqi political leaders to ensure that the leadership of the Interior Ministry  and the police force under its control  is non sectarian           Shiite and Kurdish leaders must make the concessions necessary to address Sunni concerns about federalism and equitable distribution of oil revenues   And Sunnis must accept the reality that they will no longer dominate Iraq   Until sufficient compromise is hammered out  a Sunni base can not be created that isolates the hard core Baathists and jihadists and defuses the insurgency         We must work with Iraqis at this Summit to convince Iraq   s neighbors that they can no longer stand on the sidelines while Iraq teeters on the edge of a civil war that could bring chaos to the entire region   Where they can help the process of forming a government  they need to step up          The Administration must also work with Iraqi leaders in seeking a multinational force to help protect Iraq   s borders until a capable national army is formed    Such a force  if sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council  could attract participation by Iraq s neighbors and countries like India  and would be a critical step in stemming the tide of insurgents and money into Iraq        To be credible with the Iraqi people  the new government must deliver goods and services at all levels  Electricity production is currently at 4 000 megawatts  compared to 4 500 megawatts before the war  Crude oil production has declined from a pre war level of 2 5 million barrels per day to 1 9 million barrels per day  That must change  Countries that have promised money for reconstruction  particularly of Sunni areas  must finally pay up          We can also do our part on the ground   Our own early reconstruction efforts were poorly planned and grossly mismanaged  But as I saw on a recent trip to Iraq  the efforts of our civilian military provisional reconstruction teams  which have the skills and capacity to strengthen governance and institution building around the country  are starting to take hold   We need to stand up more of these teams as fast as possible         We must also continue to turn the job of policing the streets and providing security over to Iraqi forces  This means giving our generals the tools they need to finish training an Iraqi police force that is trusted and respected on the street by the end of the year  It also means finishing the training of Iraqi security forces with U S  troops acting only on the basis of hard intelligence to combat terrorist threats         The withdrawal of our troops from Iraq is necessary not only to give democracy in Iraq the best chance to succeed  it is also vital to our national security interests  We will never be as safe as we should be if Iraq continues to distract us from the most important war we must win     the war on Osama bin Laden  Al Qaeda  and the terrorists that are resurfacing even in Afghanistan        The way to defeat Al Qaeda is not by serving as their best recruitment tool in Iraq   Even Brent Scowcroft  George H W  Bush   s national security advisor  has joined the many experts who agree that the war in Iraq actually feeds terrorism and increases the potential for terrorist attacks against the United States   The results speak for themselves  the number of significant terrorist attacks around the world increased from 175 in 2003 to 651 in 2004  and continued to increase in 2005         The president keeps talking about Al Qaeda   s intent to take over Iraq  I do not believe that a few thousand     at most     foreign jihadists are a genuine threat to forcibly take over a country of 25 million people  And while mistake after mistake by the Administration has actually turned Iraq into the breeding ground for al Qaeda that it was not before the war  large numbers of U S  troops are not the key to crushing these terrorists         In fact  Iraqis have begun to make clear their unwillingness to tolerate foreign jihadists   As the political process moves forward  they have increasingly turned on the brutal foreign killers who are trying to foment a civil war among Iraqis  This process will only be complete when Iraqis have taken full responsibility for their future  and resistance to a perceived occupation no longer provides them any common cause with the jihadists         As General Anthony Zinni said on Sunday  building up intelligence gathering capability from Iraqis is essential to defeating the insurgency      We   re not fighting the Waffen S S  here    he said     They can be policed up if the people turn against them  We haven   t won the hearts and minds yet            After the bulk of U S  forces have been withdrawn  we should keep a rapid reaction force over the horizon in Kuwait to act against any terrorist enclaves  And our air power will always ensure our ability to bring overwhelming force to bear   The bottom line is that working together with the Iraqis  from inside and outside Iraq  we can prosecute the war against Al Qaeda in Iraq more effectively than we are today         Withdrawing U S  troops will also enable us to more effectively combat terrorist threats around the world  But winning the war on terror requires more than killing terrorists  The cooperation critical to lasting victory will be enhanced when Abu Ghraib  Guantanamo  civil chaos and mistake after mistake in Iraq no longer deplete America   s moral authority         This is also key to allowing us to repair the damage that flag officers fear has been done to our armed forces   We know that it will take billions to reset the equipment that has been lost  damaged or worn out from three years of combat   In the National Guard alone  units across the country have only 34  of their authorized equipment   including just 14  of the chemical decontamination equipment they need   That   s a chilling prospect if they are ever asked to respond to a terrorist incident involving weapons of mass destruction       The fact is that the Army is stretched too thin  Soldiers and brigades are being deployed more frequently and longer than the Army believes is best in order to continue to attract the best recruits  and recruitment is suffering for it   The Army fell 6 700 recruits short of their needs in 2005   the largest shortfall since 1979   Recruitment is suffering today  Not only are American troops not getting leadership equal to their sacrifice  our generals aren   t getting enough troops to accomplish their mission of keeping the country safe       Withdrawing from Iraq will also enable us to strengthen our efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction   Iran  the world   s leading state sponsor of terrorism  is delighted with our presence in Iraq because it advances their goals  keeping us otherwise occupied  Their president is so emboldened that he   s openly called for the destruction of Israel while defying the international community   s demands to stop developing its nuclear weapons capability  And North Korea has felt at liberty to ignore the six party talks while it continues to stockpile more nuclear weapons material   Any effort to be stronger in dealing with the nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea is incomplete without an exit from Iraq        It will also enable us to more effectively promote democracy in places like Russia  which is more than content to see us bogged down in Iraq while President Putin steadily rolls back democratic reforms          China benefits from us throwing hundreds of billions of dollars into Iraq   Our long term security requires putting the necessary resources into building an economy and a workforce that can compete and win in the age of globalization  And we cannot do as much as we need to while the war in Iraq is draining our treasury        Finally  we have not provided anywhere near the resources necessary to keep our homeland safe   Katrina showed us in the most graphic way possible that five years after 9 11  we are woefully unprepared to handle a natural disaster we know is coming a week in advance  let alone a catastrophic terrorist attack  Removing the financial strain of Iraq will free up funds for our homeland defense        So  the time has come for the Administration to acknowledge the realities in Iraq and the requirements of America   s national security   Stop telling us that terrible things will happen if we get tough with the Iraqis when terrible things happen every day because we haven   t gotten tough enough  If we don   t change course and hold the Iraqis accountable now  it   s only going to get worse          Ignoring all warnings and history itself  in a flourish of ideological excess  the Administration has managed to make the ancient cradle of civilization look a lot like Vietnam  But there is a path forward if we start making the right decisions         As Dr  King said so many years ago     The choice is ours  and though we might prefer it otherwise  we must choose in this crucial moment of human history     Now is the moment of choice for Iraq  for America  and for this Congress
