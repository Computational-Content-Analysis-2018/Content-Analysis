Kerry sent a letter to National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell and cable executives from Time Warner and Comcast today  regarding their reluctance to come to Washington and reach an agreement that would broaden access to the December 29th Patriots Giants game  The two parties are currently engaged in corporate cable negotiations that  if left unsettled  will block millions of fans across the country from being able to view the game without paying extra for a premium tier package on the NFL Network  Kerry urged both parties to come to an agreement in a swift manner  and told them that his offer to host a meeting in Washington still stands     It will be a dark day for professional sports if the powers that be fail to make this game available to football fans across the country  let alone the local fan base which extends beyond the teams home cities  said Kerry  The Patriots have the potential to make history later this month  but today only 40 percent of homes will be able to watch it happen  Today  money threatens to keep fans in the dark  and thats a damn shame for a league that built an empire and a fan base on free access to games     Recently  Kerry wrote to cable and the NFL and asked that the two sides come to an agreement quickly to ensure that fans across the country are able to tune in to this potentially historic football game  The Patriots are on track to finish the season as the first team to go undefeated since the Miami Dolphins accomplished the feat in 1972     Kerry has strongly advocated for sports fans in the past  most recently when he held a hearing on a similar deal between Major League Baseball and major cable corporations earlier this year  The companies eventually reached a deal that accommodated fans     Below is the text of Kerrys letters     December 18  2007   Roger Goodell   Commissioner   National Football League   280 Park Avenue   New York  NY 10017    Dear Commissioner Goodell     Thank you for your prompt response to my letter dated December 12th  Unfortunately  the NFL  Time Warner  and Comcast all expressed little interest in convening a meeting to discuss the December 29th game between the New York Giants and the still perfect New England Patriots and how that game might be broadcast to the maximum number of fans across the country  As I stated in my initial letter  I have no intention of interfering in longstanding negotiations between commercial interests  The NFLs offer to negotiate immediately anytime  anywhere for a long term solution to this stalemate is appreciated  however  I believe such a negotiation should occur beyond the halls of Congress  I remain unconvinced that either side is willing to negotiate with the sense of urgency that is necessary to ensure broad access to this game    Despite your reluctance to meet regarding these unique circumstances  the proposals put forward by Time Warner and Comcast provide encouragement that a deal can be brokered  ensuring access from fans across the country to this potentially historic game  My offer to host a meeting between all parties still stands  I sincerely hope that the NFL realizes the value in providing the broadest possible access to a game of this magnitude  and that proprietary interests can be set aside for one day in the interest of football fans everywhere     Sincerely    John F  Kerry    December
