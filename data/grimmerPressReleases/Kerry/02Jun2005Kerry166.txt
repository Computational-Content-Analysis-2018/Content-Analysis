Belmont Springs  property in Pepperell  Massachusetts  With the help of Senator Kerry  Senator Kennedy  Congressman Olver and countless state and local leaders  the Town acquired the land from TPL on Friday  May 27 and will be the permanent owner        The Pepperell Springs project was the state   s top priority for USDA Forest Legacy Program funding in 2004  and received a grant of  1 383 million to help the Town acquire the land   Key to the grant was the leadership of U S  Senators Edward Kennedy and John Kerry and U S  Congressman John Olver  who secured Congressional approval for the award   Pepperell Springs is considered a significant forested tract for its watershed  wildlife habitat  recreational  and cultural values         Protecting Pepperell Springs means protecting our drinking water  protecting wildlife and protecting a beautiful piece of our history for future generations to enjoy   said Senator Kerry    After a long fight by a lot of people  the protection of Pepperell Springs is now a reality  for the people of Pepperell and all of Massachusetts          A coalition of organizations including TPL  the Nashoba Conservation Trust  the Nashua River Watershed Association  and the Nissitissit River Land Trust  along with the Town of Pepperell  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  the U S  Forest Service  and countless individuals has been working for more than 3 years to acquire and protect this land          Places like Belmont Springs provide a whole range of goods and services that future generations will need     said Chief Dale Bosworth      People come to places like this to enjoy its quiet beauty   for its clean air and water   for its unbroken forests   for the opportunity to see bobcats  to hear rare migratory songbirds  or maybe to catch a native brook trout   I am deeply grateful to all of our partners for protecting this special place for generations to come         In addition to the federal funding  the Town of Pepperell provided  1 5 million for the purchase  an appropriation unanimously approved at Town Meeting in September 2004   500 000 of that sum has been reimbursed through the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Self Help Grant Program   The remaining  317 000 was raised from individuals and foundations       Massachusetts Environmental Secretary Ellen Roy Herzfelder said     The Pepperell Springs property is home to important wildlife habitat and key water supplies and it provides numerous recreation opportunities  The protection of this space is made possible by a group of partners who care deeply about this land   s environmental significance and it represents smart growth that respects the proper balance between conservation and sound development   We are proud to be a part of such a great partnership          As a key linkage in a 3 000 acre protected corridor that has been the focus of regional conservation efforts for many years  the Pepperell Springs property was Pepperell   s highest protection priority   The property had been under threat of being developed with as many as 60 residential homes       Pepperell Town Manager Bob Hanson said     Today is the culmination of a vast amount of work by people at all levels of federal and state government  as well as the entire spectrum of town officials and citizens   A lot of hard work by good people has produced a result which will be a monument to the clear thinking and concern for posterity in the town of Pepperell   Many thanks to the Trust for Public Land for being instrumental in helping the town achieve this result             To be part of the effort to preserve the unique and beautiful 265 acre Pepperell Springs property has been a truly rewarding experience     said Paula Terrasi  Vice President of the Nashoba Conservation Trust      We are proud of this accomplishment but could not have done it without all of the organizations within the coalition and the support from federal  state  regional  and local sources   Our efforts will protect this pristine forested area and allow all who visit to enjoy the sights  sounds  and smells of this wonderful place forever           All 265 acres of the property are now owned by the Town of Pepperell   255 of these acres are subject to a Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game held Conservation Restriction which prevents future development and ensures public access   The remaining 10 acres include an existing water bottling plant  which will be used by the Town of Pepperell for municipal purposes  subject to a Conservation Restriction held by the Nashoba Conservation Trust       Whitney Hatch  Regional Director for TPL  said     Pepperell Springs has been one of our signature projects in the past year  measured against all our work in New England and even nationally   It   s been rewarding not only because of the magnificent resources this land has to offer  but because of the tremendous outpouring of support from the Town and all our local partners   We thank the federal delegation  the Commonwealth  and all those generous individuals who worked with us to make this day possible          The Forest Legacy Program  FLP

Massachusetts has used Forest Legacy funding to leverage state  local and private funding to preserve threatened scenic landscapes  working forests  outdoor recreation opportunities and critical
