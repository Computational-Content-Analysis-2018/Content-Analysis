                                                                                                                                                                 As we marked the fifth anniversary of the worst attack on American soil  there was enormous discussion of the lessons of 9 11  But after the bagpipes stopped  and news coverage turned to other issues  perhaps the first lesson of that day seemed quickly forgotten  We cannot allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist stronghold and a staging ground for attacks on America       If Washington seems to have forgotten Afghanistan  it is clear the Taliban and al Qaeda have not  Less than five years after American troops masterfully toppled the Taliban  the disastrous diversion in Iraq has allowed these radicals the chance to rise again  Time is running out to reverse an unfolding disaster in the war we were right to fight after 9 11       Funded largely by a flourishing opium trade  a resurgent Taliban effectively controls entire swathes of southern Afghanistan  Roadside bomb attacks have more than doubled this year  and suicide attacks have more than tripled  Britain s commander in Afghanistan recently said that  the intensity and ferocity of the fighting is far greater than in Iraq on a daily basis        Al Qaeda is again taking advantage  The recent plot to blow up U S  bound jets was reportedly masterminded by an al Qaeda affiliate operating from Afghanistan  The same killers who attacked us on 9 11 are still plotting against America    and they re still holed up in Afghanistan  President Karzai put it simply   The same enemies that blew up themselves in       the twin towers in America are still around   And while President Bush frequently quotes Ayman al Zawahiri  he hasn t mentioned that on the fifth anniversary of 9 11 al Qaeda s No  2 described the situation in Afghanistan as  very good        When did denying al Qaeda a safe haven in Afghanistan cease to be an urgent American priority  Somehow  we ended up with seven times more troops in Iraq    which even the administration now admits had nothing to do with 9 11    than in Afghanistan  where the killers still roam free  Even as the president claimed we are on the offensive against terrorists  Gen  James Jones  the U S  commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan  made an urgent plea for more troops to fight the Taliban  President Karzai has also appealed for more troops and support  and on my trip to Afghanistan this year  he stressed to me the importance of a robust American troop presence  And on Sept  11 this year  U S  Col  Michael Harrison noted  more troops would be welcome  in the hunt for bin Laden and his henchmen       Quite simply  we must change course    starting with the immediate deployment of at least 5 000 additional U S  troops  That includes more special forces to defeat the Taliban  more civil affairs troops to bolster the promising Provisional Reconstruction Teams  more infantry to prevent Taliban infiltration from Pakistan  and more clandestine intelligence units to hunt al Qaeda on both sides of the border  That also means more predator drones to provide real time intelligence  more helicopters and transport aircraft to allow rapid deployment  and more heavy combat equipment to overpower enemy forces   We must also redouble our reconstruction efforts  The Taliban s resurgence comes as no surprise when 40  of the population is unemployed and 90  lack regular electricity  As Lt  Gen  Karl Eikenberry recently said   wherever the road ends  that s where the Taliban starts   That s why our generals are asking for more reconstruction funds to win over the local population  Yet this administration has appropriated nearly four times more in reconstruction funds for Iraq than Afghanistan    and actually cut Afghan aid by 30  this year  We need to substantially increase development aid and take advantage of the improved security provided by additional troops to ensure that reconstruction efforts reach the remote villages where the Taliban finds support  We must ensure that the elected government in Kabul  helped by the U S     not the Taliban  helped by al Qaeda    rebuilds Afghanistan       This is especially important to counter the opium trade  which increased 50  last year and now funds insurgents  warlords and terrorists world wide  We must provide alternative livelihoods for opium farmers and spur the judicial reforms necessary to prevent drug lords from acting with impunity  We cannot    and should not    do this alone  Asked which of the 26 countries in the alliance were dragging their feet in Afghanistan  Gen  Jones replied   All of them   Where allies have pledged troops and assistance  they must follow through  But we must lead by example  That s how you win hearts and minds  and show the world the true face of America    and that s how you win the war on terror       Finally  we must use economic leverage to ensure the Taliban no longer finds sanctuary and recruits in Pakistan  Last year we gave Pakistan only  300 million in economic support  about what we spend in a day in Iraq  We need to give more  in development funds earmarked for specific projects that help undermine radicals  and demand more in return from the Musharraf government  We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past  The U S  must not cut and run from the real front line in the war on terror  We must recommit to victory in Afghanistan      Mr  Kerry  a senator from Massachusetts  was the 2004 Democratic nominee for president
