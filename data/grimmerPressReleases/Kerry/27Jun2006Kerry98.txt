       Releases                                                                                                                                           06 27 2006 Kerry Delivers Remarks on Flag Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The United States Senate faces a test     a test of our priorities  and a test of our commitment to the integrity of the Constitution itself   Outside of the Senate  I don   t think any of us have any illusions that some see this debate as little more than a way to change the political climate     and changes to the Constitution itself are little more than an afterthoughts  That they have such a grip on the agenda of the United States Senate tells you not just how much politics has changed  but how much this Institution has changed  Ten years ago they   d be driven from this place by Greatest Generation heroes like Sen  John Chafee and Sen  John Glenn  men of different parties with a shared commitment to protecting that sacred document Sen  Byrd carries with him everywhere  the United States Constitution          But in even having this debate  there   s no doubt that those bent on dividing the country with flag burning amendments to the Constitution have gone back to their chosen playbook  At a time when real leaders should be uniting the country around our biggest challenges  in a summer when American soldiers are in harm   s way in Iraq and Afghanistan  while their families at home struggle with record gas prices  health care costs soaring  jobs being shipped overseas  and veterans still go without the health care they were promised  it is nothing but a starkly political and cynical maneuver to spend the peoples    time defending against the phony threat of flag burning  It is an insult to Americans that this debate is front and center when so many real day to day  immediate threats to life in America are swept under the carpet         But we are here  We are having this fight  and for legitimate reasons  reasons of conscience  reasons of the heart  this debate is never an easy one in the Senate  or for our country    Like the debate over war itself  it can pit father against son  brother against brother  veteran against veteran          But what we veterans have in common  no matter how some try to divide us against each other for political purposes  is far bigger    We took an oath  December  1965  My friends and I decided together to join the service     different branches  a common sense that we as Americans had an obligation to serve    I   ll never forget being sworn in     raising my hand and taking an oath to defend and preserve the Constitution of the United States    Each of us still feels bound by that oath we swore         I took another oath twenty years later when I came to the Senate  The obligation was the same  That is why I feel so strongly that this institution     the United States Senate  which the framers of our Constitution intended never to give into the passions of the moment but to abide by larger principles     must not make the mistake of shredding the Constitution on the altar of political expediency or public passion   It would be a grave mistake  a shame on the Senate  if  we broke our oaths today  We need to listen to the voices of patriotism which urge us to do our real duty  Our former colleague  one of the best and bravest men I know  John Glenn  reminds us what is at stake  Sen  Glenn put it best when he said    those 10 amendments we call the Bill of Rights have never been changed or altered by one iota  not by one word  not a single time in all of American history  There was not a single change during any of our foreign wars  and not during recessions or depressions or panics  Not a single change when we were going through times of great emotion and anger like the Vietnam era  when flag after flag was burned or desecrated  There is only one way to weaken our nation  The way to weaken our nation would be to erode the freedom that we all share            Gary May  who lost both his legs above the knee after a landmine explosion in Vietnam  a veteran awarded the Bronze Star with combat    V   and the Purple Heart  spoke for all of us when he said that  as offensive and painful as flag burning is to me  I still believe that those dissenting voices need to be heard   The freedom of expression  even when it hurts  is the truest test of our dedication to the belief that we have that right            Mr  President  this isn   t a test of who loves the flag  But is a test of who has the courage to protect the Constitution         We Americans rightfully love the Stars and Stripes for all it symbolizes  for all the history  the glory  the promise  and the possibilities that are carried within its four corners          I feel the long honor roll of battles won and lost when I see Old Glory marched in for the presentation of colors  I feel unbridled pride watching her ripple in the breeze when we join together to sing the national anthem    I will never forget seeing our flag draped over my father   s casket and remembering that long ago he too served his country when freedom was threatened  This past Saturday  I felt the cloak of patriotism draped over the coffin of another young man to whom we bid farewell     a soldier  a patriot lost on freedom   s new frontier in Afghanistan          Our flag is a stunning symbol of all that has made us who we are          In the end  it is a symbol  It is not who we are  Who we are is embodied in the rights and obligations in the Constitution itself  A desecrated flag is replaceable  Desecrated rights are lost forever          What makes the United States different and  in many ways  stronger than any other nation is our aspiration for tolerance and diversity  Thanks to our Constitution  we are the leading proponent on the face of this planet for the greatest experiment in freedom that is set forth in words and in practice          At the close of our national anthem  we sing    land of the free and home of the brave    Were this amendment to pass  make no mistake about it  we would certainly be a little less free and a lot less brave         Ivan Warner  an American soldier imprisoned by the North Vietnamese from 1967 to 1973    wrote that     I remember one interrogation where I was shown a photograph of some Americans protesting the war by burning a flag    There   the officer said   People in your country protest against your cause  That proves you are wrong      No   I said   That proves that I am right  In my country we are not afraid of freedom  even if it means that people disagree with us   The officer was on his feet in an instant  his face purple with rage  He smashed his fist onto the table and screamed at me to shut up  While he was ranting I was astonished to see pain  compounded by fear  in his eyes  I have never forgotten that look  nor have I forgotten the satisfaction I felt at using his tool  the picture of the burning flag  against him     We don t need to amend the Constitution in order to punish those who burn our flag  They burn the flag because they hate America and they are afraid of freedom  What better way to hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom  Spread freedom     Don t be afraid of freedom      Mr  President  in the final analysis  there are eight powerful reasons for anyone  but I think particularly for a veteran  to vote against this constitutional retreat  They are  Iran  Libya  North Korea  China  Cuba  Syria  and Sudan  These are some of the forty nations of the world that have laws banning flag desecration  They used to be joined by Iraq under Saddam Hussein  the South Africa of apartheid  and Nazi Germany         I ask my fellow Senators  Is that what we want to do with the freedom of the United States of America  Is this in keeping with all that our great Stars and Stripes stand for  Is this for what soldiers fought and died  so we could join this list of discredited  dictatorial regimes          Does the United States of America  in response to an occasional act of defiance  ignorance  stupidity  and insolence  want to tremble and  for the first time in an extraordinary 225 years of challenges  alter the Constitution to diminish someone s right to be stupid          Our flag is stronger than any of those individual acts will ever be  quite simply because our country is bigger and stronger than any of those acts  and our country is bigger and stronger because of our Constitution and particularly the Bill of Rights          This vote is not a test of patriotism because patriotism is  after all  love of country and loyal support of one s country  Our country is defined by the rights we protect  and my oath as a Senator is to defend the Constitution which defines those rights  And history will judge us     100 Senators     by how we keep our oath  to preserve and protect the Constitution  That is how I will vote  and that is how I think my colleagues should vote
