mandate a rubberstamp for George Washington  and the Constitution doesn   t mandate a rubberstamp for George Bush

remarks of Senator John Kerry on the Senate floor this afternoon     Senator John Kerry  Time for Profiles in Courage  May 19  2005                                                                               Remarks As Prepared for Delivery  Senate Floor  on gaining total control notwithstanding the rules   And members of Republican leadership who know what   s at stake work with the Administration to spread mistruths   But none of leadership   s arguments stand up to Constitutional scrutiny   None of them   None of these hollow  tortured  poll tested statements like    up or down votes    or    unprecedented    are valid   They sound good  but they   re not true  and we all know it   Yet Senators continue to fall in line  turning this into a debate about twisted terminology  not the Constitution  history and rights of Senators       And I think there would be more outrage if the value of truth had not been so diminished by this Administration   We have a budget that comes trillions short of counting every dollar we plan to spend   We had a Medicare actuary forced to fudge the numbers and lie to Congress to keep his job   We had falsified numbers in Iraq on everything from the cost of the war to the number of trained Iraqi troops to a    slam dunk    case for weapons of mass destruction   We have an Administration that continues to want to fund fake newscasts to mislead people all across America       The Administration   s willingness to consistently abandon the truth has done great damage   Americans are less willing to listen     less likely to trust or take anything that is said in Washington seriously   They know  as many of us have said  that we ought to be wrestling with a crisis in healthcare and nuclear proliferation in North Korea   The people know what   s wrong with our politics  and sadly here in the Senate the leadership isn   t listening       So now we find ourselves in a struggle between a great political tradition in the United States that seeks common ground so we can do the common good     and a new ethic that  on any given issue  will use any means to justify the end of absolute victory over whatever and whoever stands in the way        The new view says if you don   t like the facts  just change them  if you can   t win playing by the rules  just rewrite them   The new view says if you can   t win a debate on the strength of your argument  demonize your opponents   The new view says it   s okay to ignore the overwhelming public interest as long as you can get away with it         And this time the Republican leadership has gone farthest of all to get away with it  hoping to convince Americans that by breaking the Senate rules they are acting to defend the Constitution  honor the words of our Founding Fathers  and avert a judicial crisis         But we all know this debate is fueled by ideology  not by defense of democratic principle or some shortage of judges on the bench   The facts have been repeated clearly again and again  and are repeatedly brushed aside and ignored   But with over 95  of the judges already approved  we all know this is nothing more than a power grab by an Administration bent on controlling every aspect of our government  even if that means weakening it       The Bush Administration and their allies in Congress hope to get away with it by playing with words to sell the public on a scheme the public would never buy if we had an honest debate   Words with great meaning     Constitution     Founding Fathers     votes     history     precedent     are being twisted and robbed of their meaning   The Administration underestimates the American people on this  Americans value the Constitution  They understand its intent   They understand that the strength of our democracy is best judged by the enduring strength of the minority       When people heard the term    nuclear option    they rightfully recoiled   They were confident that dismantling the filibuster and silencing the minority would have as catastrophic an effect on their democracy as a nuclear blast would on our security   But the majority   s reaction was not to play by the rules  but rather to change slogans   So in an act of transparent hypocrisy  the majority changed the slogan to    constitutional option    and embarked on a series of hollow arguments based on mythical constitutional provisions     confident in their belief that if you speak an untruth enough eventually you   ll confuse enough people   Well  you can change the slogan  but you can   t change the fact that diminishing the rights of the minority diminishes the spirit of our Constitution     The Bush Republican leadership arguments are false   I have heard it argued that our Constitution mandates specific voting protocol for all judges   They   ve used their new catch phrase    up or down votes    hundreds of times in recent days   Those words don   t appear once in our Constitution  No one should be fooled   It doesn   t mean constitutional   It doesn   t mean democratic and it doesn   t mean fair   It   s code for dissent proof  minority proof and filibuster proof   And there is nothing in our Constitution or our history to suggest that the nominee of any president is so special as to be excused from the scrutiny of the minority     or granted immunity from the tools of democracy that protect that minority       My colleagues are well aware that the power of advice and consent is granted to the Senate  and that the Constitution says nothing about how the Senate shall provide that advise and consent   They know the Senate is free to make its own rules  as the Constitution clearly states   They know the Senate   s role in the nominating process was designed to be active and decisive       Benjamin Franklin was so concerned about ceding excessive power to the executive that he advocated that nominations originate in the Senate   He was not alone   At our Constitutional Convention the process for appointments was one of the last and most difficult accords reached by our Founding Fathers         And it did not take long before the new Congress exercised its Constitutional powers   In 1795  Senators who were friends and colleagues of the founders themselves  and who surely knew their intent  defeated George Washington   s nomination of John Rutledge to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court         In 1968  Republican Senator Robert Griffin captured the spirit of this event when he said     That action in 1795 said to the President then in office and to future Presidents     Don   t expect the Senate to be a rubberstamp   We have an independent and coequal responsibility in the appointing process  and we intend to exercise that responsibility  as those who drafted the Constitution so clearly intended             The Constitution didn   t mandate a rubberstamp for George Washington  and the Constitution doesn   t mandate a rubberstamp for George Bush   In 1795  the rejection of Washington   s nominee was heralded as the Constitution working  not failing   There is no doubt that an active  coequal partnership was intended       This resounding rejection of George Washington  our revolutionary leader  helped seal the death of monarchy in this country   The genius of empowering the Senate and the minority was that  by limiting the executive  the Senate legitimized the executive      So when I hear my colleagues arguing that the Constitution mandates that the will of the majority always trump the minority  I don   t hear the wisdom of our Founding Fathers     I hear the same blind activism that characterizes the judges they intend to force on the federal bench   The actions of some Senators come closer to rewriting the Constitution than defending it       Another argument we have heard is that the filibuster itself is unconstitutional   That argument is also deeply flawed   The Constitution  in Article I  Section V  grants each house the power to    determine the Rules of its proceedings      The framers deferred rule making responsibility to us       Over the past 200 hundred years  our predecessors in the Senate have taken the role of consent very seriously  and created time tested rules to assure the rights of the minority and balance the power of government         With a    hold    a single Senator can delay a presidential nominee   A single committee chairman can block a nomination by simply refusing to hold hearings   Until recently the Blue Slip process allowed Senators to reject nominees from their home state   And the right to extended debate  or the filibuster  is granted to any group of more than two fifths of the Senate     making it more inclusive than any of these other accepted and oft used practices       These rules were not created by the Democratic Party when George Bush was elected   The filibuster was used as early as 1790 when Senators from Virginia and South Carolina filibustered against a bill to locate the first Congress in Philadelphia  That was a filibuster of one  because in 1790 unanimous consent was needed to end debate   Think about that   Those legislators  who were friends and even founders themselves  permitted a filibuster of one   Knowing that  today   s activist arguments buckle under the weight of history       The unfortunate truth is that some Senators have fashioned themselves activist legal scholars  using a false reading of the Constitution to paint their opponents as obstructionists while pursuing their political agenda at the expense of our democracy   I think some of my colleagues forget the Senate was designed specifically to be a moderating check on the President  not a rubberstamp for executive will       My colleagues also forget  as they demonize the filibuster  that it has been a force for good   But farmers don   t forget   Farmers don   t forget when Senators from rural states used the filibuster to force Congress to respond to a crisis that left thousands of farmers on the brink of bankruptcy in 1985   The big oil companies don   t forget   The big oil companies don   t forget when Senators used the filibuster to defeat massive tax giveaways they lobbied for in 1981   And I don   t forget when 10 years ago I came to the floor and filibustered to prevent a bill that would have gutted public health  safety  consumer and environmental protections   That bill never passed  and we know the country is better for it       Some Senators come to the floor with a practical argument about our courts   They claim that because we have not rubberstamped each and every one of George Bush   s nominees  the nation faces a crisis because of a shortage of judges on the bench    They ignore that over 95  of the president   s nominees have already been confirmed   They ignore the fact that our courts have the lowest vacancy rate in decades       What is threatened is a delicately balanced system that for 214 years successfully prevented the Executive from usurping power granted in good faith by the American people   And that threat manifests itself in a    nuclear option    that threatens the character of this Senate   The integrity of this Senate is threatened when the majority attempts to change the rules by breaking the rules   The balance of power is threatened when the power of advice and consent is gutted   Our democracy is threatened when we set the dangerous precedent that minority rights can be silenced whenever they inconvenience the majority   And I believe that our courts and the justice they are meant to deliver are threatened by some of the judges President Bush has nominated       But some of my colleagues have argued that Democrats filibuster these judges because we simply dislike them  or disagree on ideology or policy   That   s couldn   t be farther from the truth   We have confirmed countless judges who we disagree with  but respect as responsible  impartial arbiters of the law   It is these activist judges who we seek to keep off the federal bench   It is these judges who want to rewrite our laws from the bench that we believe are unqualified for lifetime appointments   And we stand against them in defense of  not as a threat to  the Constitution       We have also been accused of unprecedented acts with respect to these nominations   Surely my colleagues have not forgotten that 69 of President Clinton   s judges were buried in Committee   Was it fair   Maybe not   Did you hear the minority hiding behind mythical constitutional values in a short sighted attempt to break the rules   Of course not         The Majority Leader himself has voted to filibuster a nominee  yet now he tells us he is moved by deeply held Constitutional principles       President Johnson   s nominee to Chief Justice of the Supreme Court  Abe Fortas  was defeated in a filibuster   Tennessee Republican Howard Baker articulated the minority   s position  saying     The majority is not always right all of the time   And it is clear and predictable that the people of America  in their compassionate wisdom  require the protection of the rights of the minority as well as the implementation of the will of the majority          Throughout our history Presidents and majorities have always had to govern a nation where minority rights were protected   Until this day Presidents and majorities have respected that tradition   They were humbled and inspired by lessons from history that some of my colleagues seem to have forgotten       In 1937  President Roosevelt attempted a court packing scheme to assert his influence on the courts   His own party said no   Thomas Jefferson once attempted to impeach a Supreme Court Justice who disagreed with his political agenda   His own party said no       When my colleagues complain of lack of precedent  remember these precedents   They were fair   They were just   They affirmed the rights of the minority   And they did it all in respect of the Constitution and in defense of the judiciary   Our predecessors stood up to their own party leaders because they valued the real strength of this democracy more than the short term success of their partisan agenda  The question is     will we live up to that test       Recent predecessors of Senate Republicans have repeatedly urged respect for this legacy   Former Republican Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker said destroying the right to filibuster    would topple one of the pillars of American Democracy  the protection of minority rights from majority rule      Former Republican Senator Charles Mathias said     The Senate is not a parliamentary speedway   Nor should it be     Former Republican Senator Bill Armstrong said     Having served in the majority and in the minority  I know it   s worthwhile to have the minority empowered   As a conservative  I think there is a value to having a constraint on the majority          My colleagues should defend their judges  but defend them without tearing down our Constitution and our Founding Fathers  or destroying the rules and character of the United States Senate   Defend your judges without ceding dangerous and corruptive levels of power to this Administration   Defend your judges without erasing 214 years of wisdom and sacrifice that raised this nation from tyranny and spread freedom across the globe       Our Founding Fathers would shudder to see how easily forces outside the mainstream now seem to effortlessly push some Senate leaders toward conduct the American people don t want from their elected leaders   Abusing power   Inserting the government into our private lives   Injecting religion into debates about public policy   Jumping through hoops to ingratiate themselves to their party   s base  while step by step  day by day  real problems that keep American families up at night fall by the wayside here in Washington       Congress  Washington  and our democracy itself are being tested  We each have to ask ourselves  will we let this continue  To those in this chamber who have reservations about the choices their leadership has made  and who worry about the possible repercussions on our Constitution and democracy  look at history and find the courage to do what   s right   History has always remembered those who are courageous  and will remember the courageous few who lived up to their responsibility and spoke truth to power when the Senate was tested     so that power did not go unchecked       The Senate and the country need Senators of courage who are prepared to make their mark on history by standing with past profiles in courage  and defending not party  not partisanship  but defending principle and democracy itself                                                                                        20510
