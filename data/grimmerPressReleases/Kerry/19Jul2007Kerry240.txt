John Kerry said today that he is co sponsoring legislation intended to help prevent children from drowning in swimming pools  one of the leading causes of death for young children in this country  Kerry is pleased to join a bipartisan group of Senators  led by Senator Mark Pryor  on a bill that will require new pools to be built safer  encourage states to enact tougher pool safety laws  create new safety standards and require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish a national education program on pool and spa safety   Its my hope that this legislation can have an immediate impact on summer pool safety  Kerry said  Even one drowning is too many and if we can reduce the number of drowning deaths with this common sense legislation than our efforts will be worth it  Every year we read about children who are killed when they are swimming  or accidentally fall into a pool  and somehow get trapped by a pool or spa drain  Placing safer covers over those drains is a simple and easy way to help save lives   Accidental drowning is the second leading cause of accident related death for children under the age of 14  For children ages one to four  drowning is the number one cause of accidental death in the United States  According to a 2002 Safe Kids Worldwide survey  838 children ages 14 and under died in accidental drowning incidents  with children under four years of age making up 62 percent of the total   There are 4 7 million in ground pools in the United States  along with 3 6 million above ground pools and 5 4 million portable hot tubs in use   As introduced  S  1771 would  Require new pools and spas to be equipped with anti entrapment drain covers that meet the performance requirements of the current national voluntary standard    Provide incentives in the form of grants to states that enact state pool safety laws that meet certain criteria    Establish recommended state pool and spa safety law standards  and   Require the CPSC to establish a national education program on pool and spa safety     Federal Requirements for Pool and Spa Drain Covers  The bill would require that all new pools with main drains be fitted with drain covers that meet the current voluntary industry standards issued by the ASME and ANSI  This requirement would take effect one year after the date of enactment   State Grant Program for Enacting Pool and Spa Safety Law  The bill would establish a state swimming pool safety grant program to provide incentives for states to adopt pool and spa safety laws  The bill would authorize  2 million per year for fiscal year  FY  2009 and FY 2010 for grants to eligible states  To be eligible  a state must enact and enforce a law that applies universally to all pools in the state and meets the minimum recommended standards issued by the CPSC discussed below  The amount of a grant to any particular state would be determined by the CPSC  and disbursements would be based on population  enforcement needs  and maximum benefit per grant  States must use at least half of awarded grants to hire and train enforcement personnel and the remainder for education programs and administrative costs   Minimum State Pool and Spa Safety Law Eligibility Requirements  For the purposes of the CPSC determining grant eligibility under the Act  a state would be required to mandate by statute that any pool be enclosed by fencing or another barrier and be equipped with at least one anti entrapment device  Pools and spas built one year after enactment must have more than one drain  have one or more unblockable drains  or have no main drain  Every pool and spa that has a main drain  other than an unblockable drain  must be equipped with a drain cover that complies with Section 4 of the Act  The CPSC would be required to consider additional barriers  pool covers  self closing gates  and audible door alarms to prevent unsupervised access to pools  The CPSC also would be required to include in minimum state law standards at least one of six listed anti entrapment devices   National Education Program for Pool and Spa Safety  The bill would require the CPSC to establish and carry out a national education program to educate the public  pool manufacturers  pool retailers  pool servicing companies  and pool owners on the dangers of accidental drowning and entrapment  The bill would authorize  5 million for each of FY 2008 through FY 2012 for this education campaign                                                                           20510
