Edward M  Kennedy and John F  Kerry  along with thirty of their Senate colleagues from both parties  today called on President Bush release  20 million in contingency Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  funds and to fully support at least  2 411 billion for the program  the amount which Congress recently approved and the President vetoed     Senator Kennedy said  Families in the Commonwealth are being squeezed to the brink with the rising cost of gas  mortgages  medical care and education  Its unconscionable that the Bush Administration turns its back on families struggling to heat their homes  I urge the President to reverse course and fully fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  so that this emergency relief will be there for so many who need it this winter  Its almost December and the clock is ticking while the Bush Administration sleeps  Thousands of people in Massachusetts  urgently need help with the soaring home heating costs that will hurt our states low income families  said Senator Kerry  This Administration needs to make the emergency funds available to help families who need it most  No one should have to worry about how to put food on their table or go without medical care just so they can heat their homes  Without action now  that could be a very real tragic choice for many senior citizens  I strongly urge the Administration to take the initiative now to make sure working people and senior citizens throughout Massachusetts arent left in the cold     November 20  2007    The President  The White House  Washington  D C  20500    Dear Mr  President      We are writing to request that you release the remaining  20 million in contingency LIHEAP funds and to urge you to support at least  2 411 billion for the LIHEAP program in FY2008  With the price of oil approaching  100 per barrel  and the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimating that households can expect to pay between 10 to 22 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2006 2007 winter  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden of families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens and ensure their health and safety this winter      Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population  During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305  Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise  Home heating prices are projected by the EIA to reach almost  1 000 this year for the typical family  an increase of almost 80 percent higher than the average cost of home heating during the winter of 2001 02  As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the programs purchasing power  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding  The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million      LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Childrens Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children  In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills  For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances       We request that your Administration release funding from the LIHEAP contingency fund to help low income seniors and families with their home energy expenses and we urge you to support at least  2 411 billion for the program in FY2008      Sincerely     Edward M  Kennedy  John F  Kerry  Susan Collins   Jack Reed  Christopher J  Dodd  Debbie Stabenow  Joseph R  Biden  Barack
