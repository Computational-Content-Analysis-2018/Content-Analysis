 looks ahead to next international agreement  new Administration    WASHINGTON DC Sen  John Kerry  who represented the United States Senate last week at the international climate negotiations in Bali  delivered a speech  The Road from Bali on the future of climate policy  at the Center for American Progress Action Fund   Please find his remarks  as prepared  below    Melody  thanks for that kind introduction  John  thank you for all that youre doing here at the Center to grow and support a vision of progressive politics in this country     A week ago  I came back from the post Kyoto climate change negotiations in Bali  where 187 nations gathered to hammer out a new mandate  Thanks to key votes back in the Senate  I had the pleasure of spending about 40 hours in the air for a day and a half in Bali  I knew it would be brief  but I thought it was imperative that the Congressional view be represented and essential we deliver a simple message  in person     That message  there is real movement on this issue in America  and we are ready to lead again  The United States of America is not going to continue to be the skunk at the party  Obviously  the Administration did its best to hold onto its reputation  but in the end grassroots energy triumphed  within the obvious limitsand Ill talk about that in a minute    In Bali  I spoke with delegates from seven delegations  including the EU  China  Japan  Australia  and small island states  and spoke at our environmental communitys gathering  and everywhere I went  I said the same thing  Over 500 mayors across our country have pledged to meet or beat Kyoto commitments in their cities  Five Midwestern states recently joined 10 Northeastern and six western states in launching a regional emissions trading program to cap their output of greenhouse gases  Thats over half our economy  The world needs to know  this White House doesnt represent the American people today  and it cannot represent Americas policy beyond January 2009     But today  the executive branch does lead these negotiations  which explains why the final product was much less than it could have been  As Im sure youve heard  the US delegation was the lone  consistent voice against including any concrete goals for reducing emissions in the final document  If you read Tom Friedman today  youll see that our delegation in Bali included smart people who understand at the technical level what needs to be donebut the policymakers are holding them back  They repeatedly tried to eliminate any references to the recommendations of the Nobel prize winning IPCC  Ultimately  the consensus of the entire scientific community was reduced to an obscure  highly technical footnote  which tells you all you need to know about the Administrations attitude     For those of you who follow the details  weve been here before  We dont need to dwell on the disgraceful denial and delay  Now that the President admits that climate change is real  our policy has moved from the audacity of nope toand I apologize in advance to Dr  King for this  the fierce urgency of not now     This will be the verdict of history  But on the plus side  thats exactly what it is  history  The reality is  the Bush White House is increasingly irrelevant to any future agreement  Some may still hold out hope for this Administration to have a deathbed conversion in its final months just like their mysterious recent conversion from deficits dont matter high rollers to born again deficit hawks in November 2006  Personally  Im not counting on it  Absent that conversion  the real work falls to younon governmental organizationsto the Congress  and to the next President    So  did Bali deliver as strong a mandate as we would like  Does it elicit the commitments we hoped it would  Is it as clear a document as we would like  The answer is sadly  no     But still  despite this Administrations reluctant participation  the Bali roadmap does mark real progress toward a post Kyoto vision  It lays out a process for future negotiations  recognizes the importance of the four building blocks to fighting climate changemitigation  adaptation  financing  and technologyand most importantly shows us a path to reach a final agreement in Copenhagen in 2009  Its up to us to make that path productive     This is the first time we have a truly global road map with a role for developed and developing countries alike  The most important question that will determine the future of climate change is how we give life to the words shared but differentiated responsibility  The dynamics of Kyoto have changed  In Kyoto people stiff armed that discussion  Now it can no longer be shunted aside  In fact  one of the most important talks I had was with the Chinese delegation  whom I also met with in Kyoto and in Brazil  Each time  they refused to engage  This time was different and  I believe  a cause for optimism     What we achieved in Bali was a roadmap that doesnt foreclose our optionsit directs the global community to start its work  and preserves the space for the United States to engage when were ready to  That was far from inevitable  and frankly may be the best roadmap we could hope for under George W  Bush    What I found in Bali was a world ready to act full of willing partners when the United States finally decides to lead  To a person  almost everyone told me the same thing  ultimately we cant do this without the US  but we wont wait to get started until America comes on board    And yes  the world is running out of patience  At one point  as the US was insisting on provisions that wouldve killed the deal  a delegate from Papua New Guinea stood up and told the United States of America that if we werent willing to lead  we should at least get out of the way  This was a widely prevalent viewreally damaging to our international standing  An entire roomful of high level ministersotherwise very polite peopleactually booed the top US official for almost a full minute    The rest of the world is ready to get moving  I met with Peter Garrett  Australias new environment minister  He was representing Prime Minister Rudd the first national leader to win an election because his opponent ignored climate change  This was an earthquake in Australian politics  and frankly we have to make sure it isnt the last of its kind  Because let me assure you there is no better way than that to get the attention of politicians everywhere than to defeat recalcitrant politicians somewhere  Australia used to be a major holdoutnow America is alone among developed nations in refusing to seriously address climate change    As the Chinese made clear to me  when America is ready to take action  China will join us  Theres a destructive caricature out there today that China wont give an inch  Difficult negotiations surely lie ahead  but China grasps the urgency  83  of the Chinese people support action on climate change  and theyre already taking major steps forward  including a 20  cut in energy intensity by 2010  If you wonder whether were being too hard on Detroit by raising our fuel efficiency standards  remember that Chinas fleet wide efficiency will hit 36 7 miles per gallon next year  Our bill hits 35 mpg in 2020    Despite the Bush Administrations intransigence  were witnessing the growth of a global consensus on the nature of the threat and the need for global action  which begs the question  how do we build on that momentum  Where does the roadmap lead America post Bali  The next President will have to sign a treaty  which remains essential to our long term efforts  and we need to get there by 2009  as we committed to do in Bali  That means we cant afford to let the dust settle on a new Presidency  All of uspoliticians  labor unions  activists  think tank fellows  need to make this a voting issue to be ratified by the public on November 4  2008  and those of you in the policy world need to help us lay the groundwork for a program to be implemented on day one     In the meantime  the world isnt waiting on George Bush and neither should we  The Council on Foreign Relations recently described US climate policy as fragmentingwith mayors  governors  Senators and CEOs each operating in their own sphere  But really it is reaching a level of ferment where I suspect a future President will be surprised by the accumulated momentum just waiting for a President to tap into it    So admittedly were in a unique spot  The world has decided that  with or without us  theyre moving forward  In terms of an international treaty  were basically treading water until we have a new President  In the meantime  Democrats and an increasing number of Republicans are fighting to see what we can get done before then     In Congress  two decades after Al Gore and a few of us held our first Commerce hearings on climate change in 1987  we passed a strong energy bill that includes the first significant increase in fuel economy standards since the Carter Administration  We just passed three bills out of the Commerce Committee that would strengthen our governments climate science research program  dedicate serious resources to studying and understanding the acidification of our oceans  and prepare communities at high risk to adapt to the impacts of climate change  The Environment and Public Works Committee also passed a major piece legislation to cap carbon emissions  which Senator Reid has committed to bringing to the floor in early 2008  We have a long way to go  but these have been important and historic steps    But wed be fooling ourselves if we thought this was enoughor that we can do this without taking part in a global effort  We have to work to ensure that clean  green energy is accessible and affordable everywhere  Because when the rubber hits the road  regardless of their promises  3 billion people in developing countries wont sacrifice their economic future for the sake of a treaty  It would be wrong to ask them to  when close to half the worlds population lives on less than  2 a day  Thats why we need a massive new Manhattan project for alternative energy  because thats where the change will really come from     No area of research is more compelling than clean coal technology  CAP has been a strong advocate of clean coal policy  Coal is cheap  dirty  and abundant not only here at home  but also in countries like China  Coal accounts for 80  of Chinas emissions today and theyre building the equivalent of one new dirty coal fired power plant per week     We should be putting billions of dollars into developing real clean coal on an industrial scale  Scientists today are working capture and sequestration technology that can collect all the carbon emissions from a coal plant and gasify and bury them safely underground  Ted Stevens has joined me in sponsoring a bill for 3 5 commercial demonstration projects in sequestration and 3 5 more in capture  We should run  not walk  to do thisand we should ensure that as we develop clean coal technology  we also put it affordably into the hands of the people we hope will use it     Also  there is a great deal we can do right now to put a green thumb on the scale of the economic decision making of billions of people  We should be reducing tariffs on green producers  as were working to do today with the EU  We should be rewarding countries that meet emissions goals and helping US companies sell green products overseas     We also need to make sure we keep winning the argument domestically and building consensus  I was impressed by the article John Podesta and Peter Ogden published in the January 2008 issue of The Washington Quarterly  drilling down on the national security implications of climate change  Going forward  this has to become an essential part of our foreign policy and also of our progressive message    As we gather momentum  we can expect increasingly loud and desperate objections from the naysayers  With the IPCC report  they lost the war over the science  now theyre arguing that its simply too expensive to fix  But the question is not whether or not we pay for climate change  if there was a cost free way forward  of course wed take it  No  the real question is whether we pay it now in a way that helps us break our addiction to oil  or later on a massive  unpredictable scale in the currency of environmental devastation and human suffering     The IPCC says that stringent efforts would cost 0 12  of average annual economic growth until 2050  Nicholas Stern  former chief economist at the World Bank  says that an investment of 1  of GDP can stave off a 5 20  loss of GDP  as much as  9 trillion per year  Now others  like Bill Nordhaus at Yale or Robert Samuelson in The Washington Post  might take issue with his methodsbut the larger point is there  Warren Buffet famously says that when he sees a good investment  he doesnt need to reach for his calculatorand I believe thats the case with green economics today     Historically weve overestimated the costs of reducing emissions of air pollutantsas we did when we regulated sulfur dioxide  But it comes down to a variation on Pascals wager  If were wrong  we still have global development  clean air  a stronger economy here at home  healthier citizens  and no more addiction to the foreign oil that funds despots and terrorists  If theyre wrong  we face catastrophe     We also need to drive home the reality that we risk losing our competitive advantage if we ignore the opportunities offered by clean energy technologies  Other countries are building infrastructure today that could become an enduring competitive advantage for decades to come  China is on track to invest  10 billion in renewable energy this year  second only to Germany    This is a test of our leadership in the century ahead  Americans want this country to be what Lincoln called the last best hope of earthnot a White House to be the last place on earth to get serious about climate change  We dont have all the answers yet  but we do have momentum  we have science  and we have an emerging consensus worldwide  We should all be glad that time is not on this Presidents sidebut time isnt on our side either  We cant wait for a new President  we cant wait for new technology  and we cant wait for a treaty  we have to start now    In Bali I saw a world community waiting for America to lead on a threat that waits for no one  Today we are the missing ingredient  so lets get to work  Thank you
