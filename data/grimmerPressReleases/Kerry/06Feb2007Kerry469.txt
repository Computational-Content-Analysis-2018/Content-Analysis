Washington

 Now Congress Needs To Do Its Job                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  D C    Senator John Kerry today slammed his colleagues and the Administration from the floor of the United States Senate for their inaction and unwillingness to allow a floor vote on the troop surge resolution         As prepared for delivery   Mr  President  this new Congress comes here with a mandate  as well as a moral obligation  to find not just a new way forward in Iraq but the right way forward  That is what we owe the families  that is what we owe our fighting forces    The mistakes of the past do not change the fact that Congress bears some responsibility for getting us into this war and must take responsibility for getting us out    That responsibility begins with having a real bipartisan dialogue about where we go from here  The American people have spoken clearly  they want a real change of direction in Iraq   not more of the same failed strategy that has gotten us into the mess we are in today     Mr  President  our troops on the ground in Iraq have done their duty   we have a moral and constitutional obligation to do ours  We owe the brave men and women who put their lives on the line every day an honest debate on the way forward in Iraq  We owe them a vote on the President s senseless decision to escalate the war in Iraq by sending over 20 000 more of them into the middle of a raging civil war  And most importantly  we owe them a policy that is worthy of their sacrifice  Anything less would be a complete abdication of our most basic responsibilities as Senators    It is incredible to me that some here would seek to obstruct debate over the most fundamental issue facing our country today  I know many on the other side of the aisle oppose this escalation   they say it every day  And the Majority Leader has given every opportunity for those who support the escalation to vote in favor of it   Yet still  many on the other side of the aisle voted against holding a real debate    and having a real vote   on Iraq  Why  Politics  plain and simple  It s obvious the White House does not want a clear expression of disapproval for the President s escalation  and they are doing whatever they can to avoid it    But while some here are playing political games  American kids are being killed in Iraq    at least 3 084 so far   And just today  we learned the names four more who recently died  Sergeant Corey Aultz  Sergeant Milton Gist  Sergeant Major Michael Mettille  and Specialist Eric Sieger   and we know several others have been killed since then  How many more American are going die while we argue over process     Mr  President  the American people aren t interested in hearing Senators bicker while their sons and daughters are being killed in Iraq  They know that every day more brave Americans are giving their lives  more young men and women are suffering permanent disabilities  more families are having their futures taken away     They have every right to expect this body to have a real debate and a vote on a policy that has so deeply divided our country   and we need to give it to them now  It is time to stop this travesty  It s time for the Senate to show the leadership the people expect from us  No more delays  no more hiding behind procedural votes  It s a simple question  do you support the escalation of the war or not  The time has come for Senators to make their case then stand up and be counted     And it s time to set aside the hollow rhetoric and straw men that have stymied real debate for so long  We all agree on the incredible bravery of the men and women of our Armed Forces who put their lives on the line every single day in Iraq  We all want to see a stable Iraq  We all agree on the need to preserve our vital national security interests in the region  and we all agree on the importance of preventing the violence in Iraq from spreading into a broader regional conflict  We all understand the need to prevent Iraq from becoming a safe haven for al Qaeda and like minded terrorists        Trying to pretend that this resolution is a vote of  no confidence  in our troops   as some have argued    is outrageous  Let s be clear  it s a vote of  no confidence  in another disastrous decision by this President  a vote of  no confidence  in the continuation of a failed policy that has not worked in the past and will not work now  To suggest otherwise is nothing more than a cynical effort to distort the debate  Our troops and our country deserve better   The best way to support the troops is to oppose a course that squanders their lives  dishonors their sacrifice  and disserves our people and our principles    The simple fact is that sending in over 20 000 additional troops isn t the answer   in fact  it s a tragic mistake  It won t end the violence  it won t provide security  it won t turn back the clock and avoid the civil war that is in fact already underway  it won t deter terrorists who have a completely different agenda  it won t rein in the militias who are viewed as the protectors of the general population    It will simply postpone the political solution that is the only solution in Iraq  while further damaging our prestige and credibility in the region  And most importantly  it will also expose our troops to unnecessary death and injury    Our generals understand this  General Abizaid said clearly in his testimony before the Armed Services Committee that more U S  troops will not solve the security problem  In fact  he said they would only slow the process of getting Iraqi security forces to take more responsibility  The Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously opposed this escalation  In fact  according to recent news reports  the Pentagon warned that any short term mission may only set up the United States for bigger problems when it ends    Already  we are seeing the concerns our military commanders voiced about the troop surge manifest themselves   Since the President announced his decision to escalate the war  we have already seen a major surge   a surge in violence against civilians in Iraq   This weekend we saw the biggest single suicide attack since the war began  with over 130 civilians killed and over 300 wounded  In fact  some 1000 Iraqis have died in the past week alone  One Shiite politician put it simply   A long time has passed since the plan was announced  but so far security has only deteriorated       I will support the resolution offered by Senators Warner  Levin and Biden because I believe it is important for the Senate to send a strong bipartisan message to the President and the country that we do not support this senseless escalation  This is important enough that I will vote for this Resolution even though I do not agree with everything in it     In particular  I strongly disagree with Section 4  which states that the reduction of funds for troops  would undermine their safety or harm their effectiveness in pursuing their assigned missions    The notion that if Congress uses its Constitutional power to cut off funds as a means of forcing the Administration to face facts and get our policy right Iraq it is somehow undermining the safety of troops in the field is absurd    In fact  the opposite is true   The best way we fight for the safety of our troops is to get them out of harm s way  out of the middle of a raging civil war that U S  soldiers   no matter how brave  no matter how well trained  no matter how effective   cannot end if the policymakers and the diplomats don t start doing the jobs they should have done long ago    I strongly believe it is not enough for Congress simply to go on record opposing the President s reckless plan  That s why I support the legislation introduced by my friend and colleague  Senator Kennedy  that requires a new congressional authorization before any federal funds can be spent on this senseless escalation  I hope we ll have an opportunity to vote on the legislation in the near future     Stopping this escalation  even  is not enough  I believe Congress has an obligation to provide a responsible exit strategy that preserves our interests in the region  preserves our ability to continue to protect the security of the United States  and honors the sacrifice our troops have made  I believe those are tests we need to pass    Eight months ago in the Senate  thirteen of us stood up against appeals to politics and pride and demanded a date to bring our troops home  to make Iraqis stand up for Iraq and fight a more effective war on terror  But while we lost that roll call  I still believe it was the right policy to put in place  to demand accountability  and to leverage action    Now  I am more convinced than ever that a combination of serious  sustained diplomacy and the enforcement of benchmarks for progress by the Iraqi government  leveraged by a one year deadline for redeployment of U S  troops  is the best way to achieve our goal of stability in Iraq and security in the region        Let me emphasize that this strategy does not mean abandoning Iraq in one year  in fact  it provides the President the discretion to leave the minimum number of United States troops necessary to complete the training of Iraqi security forces  go after terrorists  and protect United States facilities and personnel    That is why I will again introduce legislation that offers a comprehensive strategy for achieving a political solution and bringing our troops home within one year  We have to find a way to end this misguided war and bring our troops home  and I believe this legislation  while protecting all the interests I described  can do that    Some say that opponents of the President s failed policy in Iraq do not offer an alternative   nothing can be further from the truth  Sending more troops into Iraq is not a strategy   it is simply more of the same tactic that has already failed   This legislation offers a comprehensive military and diplomatic strategy that incorporates many of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group to provide us with the best chance to succeed     including launching a major diplomatic initiative   including holding a summit with all of Iraq s neighbors   including Iran and Syria   and creating an international contact group  enforcing a series of benchmarks for meeting key political objectives  shifting the military mission to training Iraqi security forces and conducting targeted counter terrorism operations  and maintaining an over the horizon presence to protect our interests throughout the region    The one year deadline is not arbitrary  In fact  the Iraq Study Group report effectively sets a goal of withdrawing U S  combat forces from Iraq by the first quarter of 2008  or within approximately 1 year  This date was based on the timeframe for transferring responsibility to Iraqi security forces set forth by General Casey and on the schedule agreed upon with the Iraqi Government itself for achieving key political security objectives  The President even said that under that new strategy  responsibility for security would be transferred to Iraqis before the end of this year  That is how unarbitrary it is  The President has said it  our generals have said it  the Iraq Study Group has said it    It is time for Iraqis to assume responsibility for their country  and that is not just a statement  We need a timetable which forces Iraqi politicians to confront reality and start making the hard compromises necessary to find the political solution  Americans should not be dying because Iraqi politicians refuse to compromise and come together  They are using the security blanket of American presence in order to avoid making those compromises  and we need to get about the business of leveraging the compromise that is the only solution to what is happening in Iraq    My recent trip to Iraq and the Middle East strongly reinforced my view that setting this deadline is the key to making Iraqis stand up for Iraq  We must give the Iraqis more control over their own destiny  as they have repeatedly requested    and make them accountable for making the hard political compromises necessary to achieve a lasting political solution   That means recognizing that Iraqi politicians have repeatedly shown they only respond to deadlines   a deadline to transfer authority  deadlines to hold two elections and a referendum  and a deadline to form a government    Conversely  without hard deadlines hopes for progress in Iraq have been frustrated  When Prime Minister Maliki took power in May  General Casey and Ambassador Khalilzad said the new government had six months to make the political compromises necessary to win public confidence and unify the country  They were right  yet with no real deadline to force the new government s hand  that period passed without meaningful action    and we are now seeing the disastrous results    Mr  President  it has been nearly 4 years since the invasion of Iraq  For four years  we have been hearing from this Administration that progress is right around the corner  We ve been hearing the Iraqis are near a deal on oil revenues  that they are making progress towards reconciliation   but we still haven t seen any results    To ensure that history does not repeat itself  we must also enforce the interim benchmarks agreed upon by the Iraqi government for meeting key objectives on national reconciliation  security and governance  Meeting these benchmarks is key to forcing the Iraqis to reach a sustainable political agreement    but without any enforcement mechanism  they are little more than a wish list  That s why  as the Iraq Study Group report suggests  this legislation calls on the President to condition United States political  military  or economic assistance on meeting these benchmarks     I also believe a deadline is essential to getting Iraq s neighbors to face up to the realities of the security needs of the region  They all share our interest trying to bring stability to Iraq  and they must play a more active and constructive role in helping the parties reach a political solution and aiding in the reconstruction effort  This deadline will help create the sense of urgency that is necessary to bring about real results    We cannot turn back the clock and reverse the decisions that brought us to this pass in Iraq and the Middle East  We cannot achieve the kind of clear and simple victory the Administration promised the American people so often even as the conditions in Iraq grew worse and worse  But we can avoid an outright defeat  We can avoid creating the chaos we say we want to avoid  We can avoid a victory for our adversaries by identifying specifically what we can and cannot accomplish in Iraq    With a new Congress comes a new responsibility  to get this policy right  That starts with preventing the President from going forward with this senseless escalation  And it has to end with finding an exit strategy that preserves our core interests in Iraq  in the region  and throughout the world    I look forward to having a real debate  I hope we can find that way                                                                             20510
