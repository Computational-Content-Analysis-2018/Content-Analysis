Increase Critical Funding for America   s Veteran Support Centers

the Senate passed Senator John Kerry   s amendment  which provides  18 million in critical funding to the nation   s Veteran   s Administration  VA  Centers  Veteran Centers provide readjustment counseling and outreach services to any veteran who has served in a combat zone   Kerry   s additional funding will cut waiting lists and ensure that facilities are not forced to limit services as they respond to an increased workload caused by soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan        Approximately one third of the veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan seek help for mental health concerns from the VA   According to published reports  the number of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who have sought help for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  services and readjustment concerns has doubled over the past year   This increased caseload has forced many centers to limit services or establish waiting lists for needed services   The National Military Family Association and the Vietnam Veterans of America support the amendment  which is included in the Senate FY 2007 Military Construction  Veterans Affairs  and Related Agencies Appropriations bill  and is co sponsored by Senators Kennedy  Mass    Akaka  Hawaii   Boxer  Calif   and Jeffords  Vt        Please read Senator Kerry   s floor statement  below      Mr  KERRY   Mr  President  it is our obligation to do everything possible to ensure that veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan can make the transition home successfully                        Welcome home    must be more than something we say to our veterans  It must be measured in actions taken not just words spoken      Today  I am offering an amendment to increase funding for the VA Vet Centers to provide critically needed services to our returning veterans              The VA Vet Centers provide readjustment counseling and outreach services to all veterans who served in any combat zone   Our veterans earned these benefits through their service to country  and we must fulfill the nation   s commitment to them by providing the highest quality services possible   Unfortunately  a recent report reveals that VA Vet Centers need additional funding in order to provide the trained professionals necessary to offer quality mental health services             The Vet Center program was established to assist Vietnam era veterans who were experiencing readjustment problems   In 1991  Congress extended the eligibility to veterans who served during other periods of armed hostilities after the Vietnam era   The goal of the Centers is to provide a broad range of counseling  outreach and referral services to help veterans successfully readjust to civilian life   Services include individual counseling  group counseling  marital and family counseling  bereavement counseling  medical referrals  assistance in applying for VA benefits  and employment counseling             A recent report by the House Veterans Affairs Committee Democratic staff found that in nine months  between October 2005 and June 2006  the number of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who turned to Vet Centers for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  services doubled   The increased demand for services is beginning to affect access to quality care   In fact  one in four Vet Centers surveyed has been forced to limit services or establish waiting lists for critically needed services   After serving this nation and fighting for our country  our veterans should not have to fight for critical adjustment services             In November of 2004  VA Secretary Nicholson approved a mental health strategic plan  acknowledging gaps in mental health services due to the surge in demand from veterans of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan   Congress provided approximately  100 million to fund the VA Mental Health Strategic plan   However  a recent GAO report shows that the VA has diverted or failed to utilize money that was intended for staffing at Vet Centers and has not provided a full accounting of what has happened to the funding       The GAO is expected to issue a full report on these funding gaps later this year  but the preliminary results indicate a possible misuse of mental health dollars             One third of the veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan come to the VA with mental health concerns   We have seen the cases of PTSD rise sharply along with the need for readjustment care when veterans return home   It is imperative that our Vet Centers have enough trained professionals to offer quality mental health services   There are 207 Vet Centers across the country   They are currently unable to deal with the increasing demand for mental health services   Each of these centers needs additional funding to hire sufficient staff to deal with the recent influx of patients           John Rowan  National President of Vietnam Veterans of America  recently said     The resources are not there in the VA Vet Centers      Mr  Rowan went on to say that     Not only is the mental health and well being of veterans being placed at risk  the Vet Centers themselves are at risk   Because of significantly increased work loads  some centers have introduced waiting lists   Accommodating the ever increasing demand for readjustment counseling is taking a heavy toll on already overworked staff      We need to do more to help our veterans              My amendment would provide  18 million to hire additional mental health staff at VA Vet Centers   This amount was recommended by the Vietnam Veterans of America to allow the VA to hire the appropriate staff needed to deal with the influx of veterans who need help   The Vietnam Veterans of America and the National Military Family Association support my amendment             Our soldiers have sacrificed greatly for their country  and we owe them the best care when they return   Many wounds of war are not visible  which makes it that much more important that Vet Centers have all the resources they need to serve those veterans who are suffering in any way    I ask all my colleagues to support this amendment to provide appropriate funding to staff our Vet Centers      Thank you                                                                                  20510
