remarks today at Brown University  Senator John Kerry  D MA  will address not just the government s response to the Katrina disaster  but fundamental questions of truth  competence  and accountability in government today  and a long overdue debate over governing philosophy    the choice between a philosophy of  every man for himself  rather than shared sacrifice for the common good       Senator Kerry s remarks as prepared for delivery follow    Remarks of Senator John Kerry    As prepared for delivery    Brown University   September 19  2005       Thank you for what the Brown community has done to help and comfort the many victims of Hurricane Katrina   This horrifying disaster has shown Americans at their best    and their government at its worst           And that s what I ve come to talk with you about today  The incompetence of Katrina s response is not reserved to a hurricane   There s an enormous gap between Americans  daily expectations and government s daily performance   And the gap is growing between the enduring strength of the American people    their values  their spirit  their imagination  their ingenuity  and their willingness to serve and sacrifice    and the shocking weakness of the American government in contending with our country s urgent challenges  On the Gulf Coast during the last two weeks  the depth and breadth of that gap has been exposed for all to see and we have to address it now before it   s obscured again by hurricane force spin and deception           Katrina stripped away any image of competence and exposed to all the true heart and nature of this administration  The truth is that for four and a half years  real life choices have been replaced by ideological agenda  substance replaced by spin  governance second place always to politics  Yes  they can run a good campaign    I can attest to that    but America needs more than a campaign  If 12 year old Boy Scouts can be prepared  Americans have a right to expect the same from their 59 year old President of the United States           Katrina reminds us that too often the political contests of our time have been described like football games with color commentary  one team of consultants against another  red states against blue states  Democratic money against Republican money  a contest of height versus hair   sometimes   But the truth is democracy is not a game  we are living precious time each day in a different America than the one we can inhabit if we make different choices           Today  more than ever  when the path taken last year and four years earlier takes us into a wilderness of missed opportunities    we need to keep defining the critical choices over and over  offering a direction not taken but still open in the future           I know the President went on national television last week and accepted responsibility for Washington s poor response to Katrina   That s admirable  And it s a first   As they say  the first step towards recovery is to get out of denial   But don t hold your breath hoping acceptance of responsibility will become a habit for this administration   On the other hand  if they are up to another  accountability moment  they ought to start by admitting one or two of the countless mistakes in conceiving   selling   planning and executing their war of choice in Iraq           I obviously don t expect that to happen  And indeed  there s every reason to believe the President finally acted on Katrina and admitted a mistake only because he was held accountable by the press  cornered by events  and compelled by the outrage of the American people  who with their own eyes could see a failure of leadership and its consequences           Natural and human calamity stripped away the spin machine  creating a rare accountability moment  not just for the Bush administration  but for all of us to take stock of the direction of our country and do what we can to reverse it   That s our job    to turn this moment from a frenzied expression of guilt into a national reversal of direction    Some try to minimize the moment by labeling it a  blame game     but as I   ve said   this is no game and what is at stake is much larger than the incompetent and negligent response to Katrina           This is about the broader pattern of incompetence and negligence that Katrina exposed  and beyond that  a truly systemic effort to distort and disable the people s government  and devote it instead to the interests of the privileged and the powerful  It is about the betrayal of trust and abuse of power   And in all the often horrible and sometimes ennobling sights and sounds we ve all witnessed over the last two weeks  there s another sound just under the surface  the steady clucking of Administration chickens coming home to roost       We wouldn t be hearing that sound if the people in Washington running our government had cared to listen in the past        They didn t listen to the Army Corps of Engineers when they insisted the levees be reinforced        They didn t listen to the countless experts who warned this exact disaster scenario would happen        They didn t listen to years of urgent pleading by Louisianans about the consequences of wetlands erosion in the region  which exposed New Orleans and surrounding parishes to ever greater wind damage and flooding in a hurricane            They didn t listen when a disaster simulation just last year showed that hundreds of thousands of people would be trapped and have no way to evacuate New Orleans           They didn t listen to those of us who have long argued that our insane dependence on oil as our principle energy source  and our refusal to invest in more efficient engines  left us one big supply disruption away from skyrocketing gas prices that would ravage family pocketbooks  stall our economy  bankrupt airlines  and leave us even more dependent on foreign countries with deep pockets of petroleum           They didn t listen when Katrina approached the Gulf and every newspaper in America warned this could be  The Big One  that Louisianans had long dreaded   They didn t even abandon their vacations           For an Administration that wants to teach intelligent design in our schools  maybe they should start by getting a little intelligent design at FEMA       And the rush now to camouflage their misjudgments and inaction with money doesn   t mean they are suddenly listening   It s still politics as usual    The plan they   re designing for the Gulf Coast turns the region into a vast laboratory for right wing ideological experiments   They   re already talking about private school vouchers  abandonment of environmental regulations  abolition of wage standards  subsidies for big industries   and believe it or not yet another big round of tax cuts for the wealthiest among us           The administration is recycling all their failed policies and shipping them to Louisiana  After four years of ideological excess  these Washington Republicans have a bad hangover    and they can t think of anything to offer the Gulf Coast but the hair of the dog that bit them           And amazingly    or perhaps not given who we   re dealing with    this massive reconstruction project will be overseen not by a team of experienced city planners or developers  but according to the New York Times  by the Chief of Politics in the White House and Republican Party  none other than Karl Rove    barring of course that he is indicted for  outing  an undercover CIA intelligence officer            Katrina is a symbol of all this administration does and doesn t do   Michael Brown    or Brownie as the President so famously thanked him for doing a heck of a job   Brownie is to Katrina what Paul Bremer is to peace in Iraq  what George Tenet is to slam dunk intelligence  what Paul Wolfowitz is to parades paved with flowers in Baghdad  what Dick Cheney is to visionary energy policy  what Donald Rumsfeld is to basic war planning  what Tom Delay is to ethics  and what George Bush is to    Mission Accomplished    and    Wanted Dead or Alive      The bottom line is simple   The  we ll do whatever it takes  administration doesn t have what it takes to get the job done       This is the Katrina administration        It has consistently squandered time  tax dollars  political capital  and even risked American lives on sideshow adventures  A war of choice in Iraq against someone who had nothing to do with 9 11  a full scale presidential assault on Social Security when everyone knows the real crisis is in health care   Medicare and Medicaid   And that s before you even get to willful denial on global warming  avoidance on competitiveness  complicity in the loss and refusal of health care to millions       Americans can and will help compensate for government s incompetence with millions of acts of individual enterprise and charity  as Katrina has shown   But that   s not enough   We must ask tough questions  Will this generosity and compassion last in the absence of strong leadership   Will this Administration only ask for sacrifice in this time of crisis   Has dishonesty in politics degraded our national character to the point that we feel our dues have been paid as citizens with a one time donation to the Red Cross       Today  let   s you and I acknowledge what   s really going on in this country  The truth is that this week  as a result of Katrina  many children languishing in shelters are getting vaccinations for the first time   Thousands of adults are seeing a doctor after going without a check up for years   Illnesses lingering long before Katrina will be treated by a healthcare system that just weeks ago was indifferent  and will soon be indifferent again       For the rest of the year this nation silently tolerates the injustice of 11 million children and over 30 million adults in desperate need of healthcare   We tolerate a chasm of race and class some would rather pretend does not exist  And ironically  right in the middle of this crisis the Administration quietly admitted that since they took office  six million of our fellow citizens have fallen into poverty   That   s over five times the evacuated population of New Orleans   Their plight is no less tragic   no less worthy of our compassion and attention   We must demand something simple and humane  healthcare for all those in need   in all years at all times         This is the real test of Katrina   Will we be satisfied to only do the immediate  care for the victims and rebuild the city   Or will we be inspired to tackle the incompetence that left us so unprepared  and the societal injustice that left so many of the least fortunate waiting and praying on those rooftops       That   s the unmet challenge we have to face together   Katrina is the background of a new picture we must paint of America   For five years our nation s leaders have painted a picture of America where ignoring the poor has no consequences  no nations are catching up to us  and no pensions are destroyed   Every criticism is rendered unpatriotic   And if you say    War on Terror    enough times  Katrina never happens       Well  Katrina did happen  and it washed away that coat of paint and revealed the true canvas of America with all its imperfections  Now  we must stop this Administration from again whitewashing the true state of our challenges   We have to paint our own picture   an honest picture with all the optimism we deserve   one that gives people a vision where no one is excluded or ignored   Where leaders are honest about the challenges we face as a nation  and never reserve compassion only for disasters           Rarely has there been a moment more urgent for Americans to step up and define ourselves again  On the line is a fundamental choice   A choice between a view that says    you   re on your own        go it alone     or    every man for himself     Or a different view   a different philosophy   a different conviction of governance   a belief that says our great American challenge is one of shared endeavor and shared sacrifice       Over the next weeks I will address these choices in detail   choices about national security  the war in Iraq  making our nation more competitive and committing to energy independence   But it boils down to this  I still believe America   s destiny is to become a living testament to what free human beings can accomplish by acting in unity  That   s easy to dismiss by those who seem to have forgotten we can do more together than just waging war        But for those who still believe in the great tradition of Americans doing great things together  it   s time we started acting like it  We can never compete with the go it alone crowd in appeals to selfishness   We can   t afford to be pale imitations of the other side in playing the    what   s in it for me    game   One thing we know  the last thing America needs is a second Republican Party       Instead  it   s time we put our appeals where our hearts are   asking the American people to make our country as strong  prosperous  and big hearted as we know we can be   every day  It   s time we framed every question   every issue    not in terms of what   s in it for    me     but what   s in it for all of us         And when you ask that simple question   what   s in it for all of us    the direction not taken in America could not be more clear or compelling       Instead of allowing a few oil companies to drill their way to windfall profits  it means an America that understands we can   t drill our way to energy independence  we have to invent our way there together       Instead of making a mockery of the words No Child Left Behind when China and India are graduating tens of thousands more engineers and PhDs than we are  it means an America where college education is affordable and accessible for every child willing to work for it       Instead of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans  it means an America that makes smart investments in your future like funding the science and research and development that will assure American technological leadership       Instead of allowing lobbyists to rewrite our environmental laws to take us backwards  it means an America where lakes and rivers and streams are clean enough that when a family takes the kids fishing  it   s actually safe to eat the fish they catch       Instead of letting a few ideologues get in the way of progress that can make us a stronger and healthier society  it means an America where the biology students here today will do the groundbreaking stem cell research tomorrow       And instead of stubbornly disregarding intelligence  using force prematurely and shoving our allies aside  it means an America that restores its leadership in the world   An America that meets its responsibility of creating a world where the plagues of our time and future times   from terror to disease to poverty to weapons of mass destruction to the unknown   are overcome by allies united in common cause  and proud to follow American leadership       That is the direction not taken but still open to us in the future if we answer that simple question      what   s in it for all of us      It comes down to the fact that the job of government is to prepare for your future   not ignore it   It should prepare to solve problems   not create them         This Administration and the Republicans who control Congress give in to special interests and rob future generations   Real leadership stands up to special interests and sets the course for future generations   And unless we change course now  my generation risks failing its obligation of assuring you inherit a safer  stronger America   To turn this around  the greatest challenges must be the starting point   I hope Katrina gives us the courage to face them and the sense of urgency to beat them       That   s why the next few months are such a critical time   You   ll read about the Katrina investigations and fact finding missions   You   ll get constant updates on the progress rebuilding New Orleans and new funding for FEMA   Washington becomes a very efficient town once voters start paying attention       But we can   t let political maneuvering around the current crisis distract people from the gathering  hidden crises that present the greatest threats to our nation   s competitiveness and character   The effort to rebuild New Orleans cannot obscure the need to also rebuild our country       So realistically  I   m sure you   re wondering  How do I change all this   What can I do   The answer is simple  you have to make your issues the voting issues of this nation   You   re not the first generation to face this challenge       I remember when you couldn   t even mention environmental issues without a snicker   But then in the 70   s people got tired of seeing the Cuyahoga River catch on fire from all the chemicals   So one day millions of Americans marched   Politicians had no choice but to take notice   Twelve Congressman were dubbed the Dirty Dozen  and soon after seven were kicked out of office   The floodgates were opened   We got the Clean Air Act  The Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water   We created the EPA   The quality of life improved because concerned citizens made their issues matter in elections       You have the chance to do that now   Moments like Katrina are difficult   but they help you define your service to your fellow citizens   I   ll never forget as a teenager standing in a field in October of 1957 watching the first man made spacecraft streak across the night sky    The conquest  of course  was Soviet   and while not everyone got to see the unmanned craft pass overhead at 18 000 miles per hour that night   before long every American knew the name Sputnik   We knew we had been caught unprepared       In the uncertain years thereafter  President Kennedy challenged Americans to act on that instinct   He said   This is a great country  but I think it could be a greater country   the question we have to decide as Americans   he said  is  are we doing enough today        Today  every American knows the name Katrina    and once again we know our government was undeniably unprepared  even as Americans have shown their willingness to sacrifice to make up for it         But in these uncertain weeks of Katrina s aftermath  we must ask ourselves not just whether a great country can be made greater    the sacrifice and generosity of Americans these last weeks answered that question with a resounding yes        No  our challenge is greater   It   s to speak out so loudly that Washington has no choice but to make choices worthy of this great country   choices worthy of the sacrifice of our neighbors in the Gulf Coast and our troops all around the world       What s in it for all of us  Nothing less than the character of our country   and your future                                                                                      20510
