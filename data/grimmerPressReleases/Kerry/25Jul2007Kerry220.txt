John Kerry said today that Pakistans strategy for dealing with al Qaeda is not working and questioned whether the seemingly blind loyalty the Administration is showing to President Musharraf is sensible policy  Kerry also pressed the White House on whether President Bush is contemplating military force against Al Qaeda in the tribal regions of Northwestern Pakistan  where Osama bin Laden is suspected of hiding out  A top aid to Bush recently said that all options are on the table when it comes to dealing with Pakistan  Kerry  a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  chaired todays hearing      Below is Sen  Kerrys opening statement  as prepared       Ambassador Burns  thank you coming before the Committee today  As we all know  Ambassador Burns has had a long and distinguished career as a Foreign Service Officer  serving as U S  Permanent Representative to NATO  Ambassador to Greece  and State Department spokesman  as well as on the National Security Council staff  He is currently the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs  making him the third ranking official at the State Department  with oversight responsibility for U S  policy throughout the world        He is also from Massachusetts  a graduate of Boston College  and a life long Red Sox fan    so we know he understands how to persevere through great adversity        Ambassador Burns  this is clearly a pivotal moment in Pakistan  Our intelligence agencies have just issued a dire warning about the threat posed by Al Qaeda in the tribal areas  the Taliban is using Pakistani territory as a base for attacks in Afghanistan  there has been major increase in extremist violence following the attack on the Red Mosque  and the political turmoil surrounding the ouster and reinstatement of Chief Justice Chaudhry has put President Musharraf in a precarious position with new elections scheduled for the fall  We very much look forward to hearing your views on these issues and the Administrations strategy for Pakistan going forward        We all recognize that Pakistan is a key ally in the region  and our relationship is one of the most important  and complex  relationships we have anywhere in the world  We need to make clear to Pakistan  both the government and the people  that we are committed to sustaining and building on this relationship over the long term in a manner that serves both of our countries interests        We also appreciate the significant contributions and sacrifices the Pakistanis have made in the fight against Al Qaeda  At the same time  it is clear that our current strategy in Pakistan has not been working as well as it can  and must    when it comes to our core objectives of fighting terrorism and promoting democracy  We understand that it is a delicate balance between moving Pakistan in a more positive direction and not causing a major rupture in the relationship  I hope we will come away from todays hearing with a better understanding of the Administrations plans  and how we can all work to build an effective long term strategy        Clearly  the most pressing and direct national security concern we face in Pakistan is the resurgence of Al Qaeda in the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan  We were all deeply troubled by the recent National Intelligence Estimate entitled The Terrorist Threat to the U S  Homeland which made clear that while we have been distracted and bogged down in Iraq  Al Qaeda has grown stronger than at any time since 9 11  The NIE brought home in the starkest possible terms that Al Qaeda has regenerated key elements of its homeland attack capability  including  a safe haven in the Pakistan Federally Administered Tribal Areas  FATA   operational lieutenants  and its top leadership  Osama Bin Laden and top Al Qaeda leaders are likely still hiding out somewhere in the region  and none of us here need to be reminded of the nightmare scenario of Pakistans nuclear arsenal falling into the wrong hands        We also know that the Taliban is using the tribal areas as a base for launching attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan  and our generals tell us that Taliban leaders have maintained a headquarters in Quetta  It is clear that we cannot succeed in the vital mission of stabilizing Afghanistan if the enemies of the coalition and the Karzai government enjoy a safe haven right across the border        General Eikenberry  the former commanding general in Afghanistan  summed it up simply  Al Qaeda and Taliban leadership presence inside Pakistanmust be satisfactorily addressed if we are to prevail in Afghanistan and if we are to defeat the global threat posed by international terrorism  In other words  the central front in the fight against terrorism is right where it has always been  along the Afghanistan Pakistan border  We simply cannot allow history to repeat itself  and many of us are concerned that we do not have an effective strategy to counter this threat        Our intelligence community has linked the resurgence of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in this area directly to an agreement that President Musharraf struck with tribal leaders in Waziristan  I traveled to Pakistan around that time  and even then many of us had real concerns about the deal  The Administration has now finally acknowledged that it has not worked for Pakistan  and it has not worked for the United States  After the attack on the Red Mosque  even Taliban declared the deal was dead    and we have seen increased presence of Pakistani troops in the area since then        Yet still  we hear that President Musharraf is actually trying to revive that agreement  Going back to a failed strategy is not the answer  The Administration has also made it clear that they have not ruled out U S  military options in the area  We must be prepared to use force if necessary to protect our interests  but sending U S  ground troops into Pakistani territory raises many difficult issues for us and for Pakistan  We also have a five year   750 million dollar plan for winning over the local population in this area  but real concerns have been raised about whether that money can actually be put to good use  We will be very interested to hear your views on the Administrations strategy for dealing with this very real threat in both the short and long term        We must also consider the role of U S  aid in advancing our interests  Since 9 11  we have given Pakistan roughly  10 billion dollars in aid    and likely billions more in covert assistance  Roughly 75  of this aid has gone to reimbursement of counter terrorism expenses and other security assistance  We clearly have a right to expect more in return for the massive amount of aid we are providing for the fight against terrorism        At the same time  less than 10  of our aid goes to development and humanitarian assistance  and we must give strong consideration to whether targeting more aid to projects that help the Pakistani people directly would be more effective  One area we should pay particular attention to is funding for education  which the 9 11 Commission emphasized was key to promoting moderation  this is especially important given that more than half of Pakistans population is under 15 years of age        We have also reached a critical period for the future of democracy in Pakistan  It is clear that reinforcing our strong commitment to democracy  human rights  and respect for the rule of law is in the best interests of Pakistan and the United States        President Musharrafs term is set to expire this fall  and under Pakistani law the National and Provincial Assemblies must conduct new presidential elections by October  with new legislative elections to follow  The Pakistani Supreme Court may have to rule on whether President Musharraf can stay on in his role as chief of the military  and whether he can legally be re elected by a lame duck Parliament  Now that Chief Justice Chaudhry has been reinstated to the Court  there appears to be a strong possibility that it will rule against President Musharraf on these questions  We need to be prepared for this eventuality  and the possibility that President Musharraf may leave or be forced out of office  In fact  although he may be hedging on this now  President Musharraf has said in the past that he will relinquish his military role  and Khurshid Kasuri  the Foreign Minister of Pakistan  said during his recent visit that President Musharraf was still planning to do so  We must make it clear that we expect President Musharraf to live up to his promise        It is also critically important that the upcoming elections are free and fair  and we should work to ensure they are conducted transparently and legitimately  This will send a very important message of support to the people of Pakistan  who are increasingly insistent on restoring true democratic rule  and will help to undermine extremists  We must also continue to raise our strong concerns over unexplained disappearance of some 400 people  the arrest of hundreds of political activists from opposition parties  and the recent crackdown on the media        Finally  we must also consider Pakistans relationship with India  especially when it comes to Kashmir  the security of Pakistans nuclear arsenal  and the current status of our efforts to ensure that the proliferation disaster we experienced with the A Q  Khan network is never repeated        Thank you again for being here today
