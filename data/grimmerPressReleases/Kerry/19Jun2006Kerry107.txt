S  national security and increasing the Iraqis    ability to establish stability throughout their country        Below is a joint statement from John Kerry and Russ Feingold           For three years  Congress has played political games while the war in Iraq has gone on unchecked and unending   With the administration   s failure to offer a coherent or effective strategy in Iraq  it is long past time for Congress to offer a plan to redeploy our troops so we can give Iraq its best chance at stability  and refocus on al Qaeda and the terrorist networks that threaten the security of all Americans          We must redeploy to succeed     and we will put this national security imperative to a test in the United States Senate this week  We need a deadline for the redeployment of U S  forces in Iraq   A deadline gives Iraqis the best chance for stability and self government  and most importantly  it allows us to begin refocusing on the true threats that face our country           Our amendment recognizes the need to keep an over the horizon military presence in the Middle East to fight al Qaeda and its affiliates and protect regional security interests   Only troops essential to finishing the job of training Iraqi forces  conducting targeted counter terrorist operations and protecting U S  facilities and personnel should remain inside Iraq   The president also must move immediately to work with the Iraqis to convene a summit of Iraq   s neighbors and the international community to forge a lasting political settlement to give all Iraqis a stake in the new Iraq           A strong national security policy begins with recognizing that our massive presence in Iraq weakens our security and gives Iraqi politicians a crutch to avoid creating stability in their country   As long as 130 000 U S  troops remain in Iraq indefinitely  that country will remain what a series of mistakes have made it    a crucible for the recruitment and development of terrorists determined to fight Americans and an obstacle to an Iraqi government capable of governing and securing its country   Our troops have done their job in Iraq   It is time to redeploy     to help increase stability in Iraq  and more importantly  to strengthen the national security of the United States           The goal of the Kerry Feingold plan is to undermine the insurgency by simultaneously pursing a political settlement and the redeployment of American forces   Their plan calls requires      The redeployment of U S  combat troops out of Iraq by July 1  2007         Only U S  troops essential to completing the mission of standing up Iraqi security forces  conducting targeted counter terrorist operations and protecting U S  personnel and facilities would remain   President Bush has repeatedly said that when Iraqis stand up  we will stand down   However  that has not been happening   So far  the Iraqis have trained 265 600 security forces     just 7 000 shy of the Bush administration   s stated goal of 272 566  Yet just a few weeks ago  the Pentagon announced that they are sending 3 500 additional U S  troops from Kuwait to Iraq         The United States to maintain an over the horizon military presence to prosecute the war on terror and protect regional security interests        The President to work with the new Iraqi government to convene a summit that includes those leaders  the leaders of the governments of each country bordering Iraq  representatives of the Arab League  the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  representatives of the European Union  and leaders of the governments of each permanent member of the United Nations Security Council  to reach a comprehensive political agreement for Iraq that addresses fundamental issues
