                                                                                                                                                                        After Senator Kerry offered a new direction on Iraq that keeps faith with American troops and gives the Iraqis their best chance at democracy  Senator Wayne Allard  R Colo   launched an attack on Senator Kerry and defended the Bush Administration s aimless course in Iraq       Sen  Kerry returned to the floor to defend himself and his Iraq plan  The Kerry plan sets two important deadlines for the Iraqis to form a unity government and redeploy American combat forces      Below is Sen  Kerry   s response to the Allard attacks      Mr  President  a little while ago I was fought here  I was at a hearing of the finance committee  I am informed that the Senator from Colorado  Senator Allard  came to the floor to attack my position on Iraq  which is fine by me  but also I think somewhat questionably with respect to the rules and the etiquette of the Senate to attack me personally for my motives with respect to the position I have taken  And the Senator from Colorado suggested that    quote     we re seeing an individual who is being spun in the political winds       Well  let me make it clear to the Senator from Colorado and anybody who wants to debate Iraq  when it comes to issues of war and peace and of young Americans dying  nobody spins me period  And I   m not going to listen to the Senator from Colorado or anyone else questions my motives when young Americans are dying on a daily basis or losing their limbs because Iraqi politicians won t form a government from an election that they held in December  That is just inexcusable  let me ask the Senator from Colorado  it is okay by him that young Americans are dying right now while politicians in Baghdad are frittering away the time and the opportunity that our soldiers fought to give them  Does he think that s a plan that s working   Does he think that s serving the needs of the American military  A year and a half ago  two years ago I suggested  as did many other people  that it would be inappropriate to set a timetable for American troops to withdraw because we hadn t had election and because most people assumed what we were fighting then was al Qaeda and foreign terrorists  The fact is since then we ve trained forces  we ve trained police  We listen to this administration consistently come and tell us how great the training is  how many people are up and trained  how much they ve been able to make progress  how 70  of the country is indeed peaceful  Well  if that s true  then there shouldn t be a great threat to reducing American forces on a schedule that is also tied to our ability to resolve the other issues with respect to Iraq  I d ask the Senator from Colorado  let s have a real debate about this issue  Does he ignore what our own generals tell us      He says the president has a plan  Our generals tell us  General Casey  that the large presence of American forces  in fact  is adding to the occupation  the sense of occupation  and it delays the Iraqis standing up on their own  I m listening to General Casey  not to the Senator from Colorado  If General Casey tells me that the Iraqis would stand up faster if there were less Americans there  I believe him  Our troops have done the job  Don t come to the floor of the United States Senate and try to suggest to me that somehow when we come up with a plan to protect our troops and to make America stronger that we re somehow making their life more miserable  Ask the troops   70  of the troops who were pulled    polled in Iraq said that they thought within the next year we ought to be able to withdraw  Those are our troops talking to us  The notion that we re going to try to make this into one of those political squabbles lets have a real debate about the policy in Iraq  Anybody who wants to come to the floor and pretend it s working today is living in a fantasy land  and anybody who wants to suggest that our soldiers ought to be dying so a bunch of folks over there can squabble over issues that we haven t even brought to the diplomatic table adequately has a false sense of protecting the troops means and of what their interests really are       The fact is that they only respond to deadlines  Talk to people who have been in the region  It took a deadline to get them to have a transfer of the provisional government  It took a deadline to be able to get the elections in place  It took a deadline to be able to get the constitution in place  It took a deadline to be able to have the election that we held in December  And the fact is it ought to take a deadline now to tell them  don t put our kids  lives at stake and waste billions of dollars of American taxpayers  Get your government together  You owe that much to the American people  You owe that much to yourselves  You owe that much to the Iraqis  You owe that much to the world  which is waiting for leadership  for some kind of adult behavior         I don t think the American people believe what the Senator from Colorado said     that they believe there is a good plan in place  Everything we ve been told about Iraq has turned out to be false  from almost day one  This is the third war we re fighting in Iraq in as many years  The first war  I might remind Americans  was the war to get Saddam Hussein and the weapons of mass destruction  Then when there weren t any weapons of mass destruction  it became regime change  If the president of the United States had come to the United States congress and said  I want authorization to go to Iraq for regime change  he wouldn t have received it  And then after it was regime change  it transformed into  oh  we got to fight them over here rather than fight them over there  fight them over there rather than here in the united states of America  Well  that sounded good for awhile  Because people  all of us want the fight al Qaeda and want to fight terrorists  Lo and behold we found there really were only  according to most of the estimates  700 to 1 000 or so hard core jihadists from other countries over there  And the insurgency grew day by day to be an insurgency that is now a low grade civil war  Prime Minister Allawi called it a civil war  Does the Senator from Colorado believe he knows better than Prime Minister Allawi what to call it        The fact is it s now a civil war  and our troops can t resolve a civil war  No matter how valiant  and they have been  and no matter how courageous  and they have been  and no matter how skilled and they have been  This is the best military I   ve ever seen  These are the best young men and women I   ve ever met  and it s been my privilege to go to Iraq and meet them  And they are making progress in certain areas  but their progress is set back by the unwillingness of Iraqis to pick up the baton of democracy  You have to compromise  And the whole reason they think they can sit there and not compromise is because the president s policy is just stay the course  stay the course  stay the course  We have an occasional visit by the secretary state or somebody to suggest they ought to do more  Ambassador Khalilzad is    ambassador call Khalilzad is a terrific person  skilled  He s doing a terrific job  but he can t do this alone  So I believe we ought to have a real debate about policy  a policy where they told us it would cost  20 billion to  30 billion  Remember that  colleagues         Remember Mr  Wolfowitz in front of the committees telling us  oh  the Iraqi oil s going to pay for the war  Remember them telling us that the soldiers were going to be received like conquering heroes with flowers all across Iraq   And then when looting broke out  remember Mr  Rumsfeld standing and saying that Washington is safer than Baghdad and looting happens  Remember how they didn t even guard the ammo dumps and our kids started to get blown up with the ammo they could have guarded      No planning was put in place  Anybody who wants to read about Iraq  go read the book  Cobra II   and you can read an astounding story of negligence and malfeasance  misfeasance with respect to this war  companies over billing us  Halliburton  by billions of dollars  You want to run down the list of things that are egregious with respect to this war   I tell you one thing I know well  and I   ll remind the Senator from Colorado  half the names on the wall of that Vietnam Memorial  half the names on that wall became names of the dead after our leaders knew our policy wouldn t work  Well  our policy isn t working today  and I   m not going to be a United States Senator who adds to the next wall wherever it may be put that honors those who served in Iraq so that once again people point to a bunch of names that are added after we knew something was wrong  We have a bigger responsibility than that   Absence of legitimate diplomacy in this is absolutely astounding to me  You know  when you look at what former Secretary Henry Kissinger did night after night  day after day  back and forth in an airplane  struggling to be able to get people to come to agreement around the table  You look at what former Secretary Jim Baker did  traveling all over the world  working with countries  pulling people together around the idea  I don t even see deputy assistant secretaries  other people out there at a level working other countries to try to a resolution for this  and there are Sunni neighbors all around who could all play a more significant role  The Arab league could play a more significant role  The United Nations could play a more significant role  What are we doing  Just drifting day after day after day  We want to go back and talk about the armor that our troops didn t have  We want to talk about the humvees that weren t armored  How many kids have lost their arms or legs because of the lack of adequacy of the equipment that they were given  How many parents had to go out and buy armor for their kids  Because it wasn t provided for       I have never in my life seen a war managed like this one where there has been zero accountability at the highest levels of civilian leadership and people have been able to make mistake after mistake after mistake  and people want to come to the floor and defend it as somehow justifiable  We have a plan and we re on course  We re not on course  We re on the wrong course  And the plan needs to be changed  Somebody ought to tell the Iraqi leadership that American citizens are not going to put their money and the treasure of their young into a kind of  you know  non effort to compromise and show statesmanship and leadership that puts a government together  We put that government together  and then we talk about how we re going to move forward  Right now this is adrift  It s a policy without leadership  And the American people understand that  What we need now is civilian will and high pressure that is equal to the sacrifice of our soldiers      I yield the floor
