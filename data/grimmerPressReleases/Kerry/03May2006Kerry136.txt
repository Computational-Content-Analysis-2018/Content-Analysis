America

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                American families put kids first every day   They work hard to give their children opportunities they never had   It   s called the American Dream   But in Washington  D C  today  our government is making that dream almost unattainable as 11 million children in America go without health insurance       Two years ago  during the presidential campaign of 2004  I had the privilege of crisscrossing this nation and meeting great families every day   Their stories of struggle and sacrifice so inspired me that on the first day of Congressional session in January 2005  I introduced my Kids First plan to provide health insurance for ever child in America       Since that time  more than 800 000 people have signed up to be citizen co sponsors and nearly twenty five national health care  children   s and labor organizations     representing more than twenty million Americans     have joined as endorsers and promoters of Kids First   In one week alone  more than twenty thousand people picked up the phone and called my offices to share their personal plea on why we desperately need this plan         It   s no wonder people are so upset about Washington   s indifference   One third of kids with asthma nationwide suffer without the medication they need   In the wealthiest nation on the face of the Earth  that is nothing short of a disgrace         Insuring every child won   t require big tax hikes or new bureaucracy   We can provide health insurance coverage for every kid in America if we simply roll back the president   s tax cut for individuals making over  300 000 a year        Another way to look at it is that we could insure every child in America for the next ten years for half of what it has cost us to occupy Iraq over the last three years           The benefits of providing health care for our children would be numerous   We could reduce avoidable hospitalizations by 22 percent   Children enrolled in public insurance programs rate 68 percent better in measures of school performance than those without coverage   And the long term cost savings in health care  education  job training and reduced stress on our families are incalculable         While Washington dithers  states are starting to tackle this issue on their own  Thankfully  we have a good start on solving this crisis in my home state of Massachusetts where Democrats and Republicans have worked together to provide comprehensive health reform   Many states  however  simply don   t have the money to help their citizens       The government can   t raise people   s kids  nor should it   But we must share a collective national responsibility for children   s health care by building a strong partnership with the states  which run the state health care systems  and with parents  who are responsible for raising healthy kids        Instead of dumping the problem on cash strapped states  my proposal offers states a new bargain  the national government will give states immediate financial relief in exchange for a commitment not only to cover all kids  but make sure they get the coverage for which they re eligible  This will cut the red tape that results in the huge gap between the kids who are eligible and those who actually get covered   Under my plan  states will save over  6 billion per year       Parents deserve a new bargain  too   We should help them buy employer sponsored coverage where available  And we will allow parents who don t normally qualify for public programs to buy coverage for their children at cost   Parents    side of the bargain is to take advantage of these opportunities to get their kids covered or forfeit the child tax credit on their federal tax returns        We spent much of 2005 building our coalition of support   Now is the time to put our citizen soldiers into action   We will push for accountability on Kids First in this election year     a vote on the Senate floor that will separate those who talk about family values and those who really value families       When it comes to getting kids health care coverage  it s a promise we can afford to keep     and one we cannot afford to break  Every child deserves a healthy start in life
