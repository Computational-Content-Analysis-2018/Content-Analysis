      WASHINGTON    Senator John F  Kerry yesterday used the  80 billion emergency spending bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to press a plan left over from his presidential campaign that would ensure that all military families are eligible for increased survivor benefits and can remain in military housing for up to a year after a loved one is killed in the line of duty       The Massachusetts Democrat is pushing some of the initiatives from his failed bid for the White House       As the Democratic nominee he called for a Military Family Bill of Rights and other proposals to provide servicemen and women with financial  health  and other benefits he said they are being denied         This is the beginning of a larger effort to do right by our military families   Kerry told the Globe in an interview  adding that he plans to offer a full package of new benefits for troops and their families in a separate bill later this year       Kerry s amendments were part of a wider effort by Democrats    frustrated by their limited ability to affect the direction of the Bush administration s policies in Iraq and the war on terrorism    to use the emergency spending bill as a vehicle for change       A variety of Democratic amendments will be offered  including establishing a commission to investigate corruption in Iraq reconstruction contracts and barring the United States from transferring terror suspects to nations that engage in torture       The Democratic House leader  Representative Nancy Pelosi of California  yesterday unveiled the   GI Bill of Rights for the 21st century   pledging to enact legislation that would take better care of troops and veterans  The initiative would also increase death benefits for military families  while providing better healthcare for soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and providing bonuses to troops         Every American is indebted to our troops for their bravery  their patriotism  and the sacrifice they are willing to make for our country   said Pelosi  flanked by fellow Democrats and former Democratic presidential candidate General Wesley K  Clark       Kerry s proposed changes to the war spending bill   which he says have the support of senior military officers and some Republicans    would provide increased death benefits to the families of all troops killed while on active duty  not just those who lose their lives in a designated combat zone         We do right by our fallen police officers and firefighters  whose families receive  275 000  and it s time we did the same for our soldiers   Kerry told his colleagues    No one can ever put a price on a lost loved one  but we should do everything we can to help families put their lives back together         Last year Kerry  a decorated Vietnam veteran  first proposed increasing death payments from the current  12 420 to  500 000 through insurance benefits and a   death gratuity   President Bush has embraced the proposal  but would restrict the  100 000 death gratuity to those who die in a designated combat zone  Kerry s amendment would provide the increased death gratuity for any service member who loses his or her life       The second amendment he proposed yesterday would extend from 180 days to one year the length of time that families could remain in military housing after a loved one is killed       Kerry s Military Family Bill of Rights  estimated to cost between  6 5 billion and  8 billion  would also allow Americans to donate to military charities on their federal income tax  allow penalty free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts for expenses associated with deployments  and expand mental health programs at military hospitals       Bryan Bender can be reached at
