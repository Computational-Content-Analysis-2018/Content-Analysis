Soldiers  Vehicles is a  Disgrace     WASHINGTON D C   Sen  John Kerry today called upon the Bush Administration to make immediate improvements to the equipment and supplies issued to US troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  Citing a series of reports showing that many troops stationed in Iraq are exposed to higher risks because of the lack of equipment   including such critical items like body armor   Kerry asked the Pentagon to take immediate steps to protect our men and women serving abroad        Kerry s statement  as prepared  is included below        Four years ago  we sent our young men and women to Iraq for a war that many of us now believe was a grave and tragic mistake   But day after day  and month after month  this Administration has repeatedly exacerbated that mistake by leaving our soldiers in the field without the equipment and protection they need   knowing full well what the lethal consequences would be          There will be disagreement on the next difficult steps to take in Iraq   We can disagree on troop numbers  on timetables  on the shape of a future political settlement for Iraq   These are honest differences of opinion          But there should be no disagreement that we must give our troops everything they need to be as safe as they possibly can   There should be no disagreement that when we ask young men and women to leave their families to fight deadly foreign enemies halfway across the world  when we ask them to put their lives on the line   the very least we owe them is the equipment they need to protect themselves          One soldier who dies from a roadside bomb because he doesn t have enough armor is one too many          And when it comes to body armor and armored vehicles  our troops are not getting what they need   According to The Washington Post this week  our soldiers are short more than 4 000 of the latest Humvee Armor Kit  the FRAG Kit 5   Fewer than half of the Army s 14 500 up armored Humvees in Iraq and Afghanistan have the latest equipment   As Lt  Gen  Stephen Speakes  the Army s deputy chief of staff for force development  said    We don t have the kits  and we don t have the trucks           And it s not just armored vehicles that would keep our troops safer   they need better body armor too   People are actually holding bake sales to raise money to send body armor and helmets to the troops   Over a year ago  the Pentagon issued a report that many of the deaths in Iraq caused by upper body injuries could be prevented if all body armor issued to our troops included side armor plates    Some of my colleagues raised this issue with Secretary Rumsfeld  and he assured them that the Pentagon would begin procurement and delivery of an additional 230 000 sets of side armor plates        But just last month  another Pentagon report found continued shortages in force protection equipment for our soldiers   a shortage of body armor  a shortage of up armored vehicles  a shortage of communications equipment  and a shortage of electronic countermeasure devices   We ve also heard firsthand from troops that many are still being issued body armor without the side armor plates          How could anyone send our soldiers on the most dangerous patrols in the roughest neighborhoods of Baghdad without the best possible protection   In the last four years  over 1 100 Americans have died from roadside bombs   And thousands of our best troops have suffered debilitating injuries or had their lives permanently altered by these terrible weapons    Knowing full well that we don t have enough armor for the troops already in the field  how can we possibly send more than 20 000 additional American soldiers to do a job that Iraqis ought be doing for themselves           By themselves  these shortages are troubling  but the President s plan to send over 20 000 more troops makes them even more calamitous   And now we hear that the troops pouring into Iraq won t have enough up armored Humvees and other armored vehicles until July   How can we send over 20 000 soldiers in now when the armor their lives depend on won t arrive until July    How can we justify this policy to the mother of a soldier killed in a Humvee without proper armor   How can we explain it to a wounded soldier at Walter Reed whose injury could have been prevented with the right equipment          Eighteen months into the war  Donald Rumsfeld told a roomful of troops in Kuwait   As you know  you go to war with the Army you have             You go to war with the army you have     In addition to being a smug and cavalier thing to say  it was ridiculous then  and it s even more ridiculous now   You may go into war with the army that you have  but then you adapt to your enemy s tactics  you exploit their weaknesses  and you work to minimize your own   We ended World War II  in less time than the current Iraq war   with a weapon that didn t even exist when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor            We ve known for years that the technologies our enemies use to kill our troops were outpacing the equipment we use to protect them    And the gap between their offensive weapons and our defensive armor is only growing  thanks in part to a major increase in an especially lethal kind of roadside bomb  the Explosively Formed Penetrator or EFP     This is a diabolical contraption that has been described as  a spear that rips right through the vehicle    It can shoot a metal projectile through the side of even an up armored Humvee and turn pieces of the vehicle itself into shrapnel that kills or maims the soldiers inside          And 90  of American fatalities from these terrible weapons have come in Baghdad   Baghdad    where against the warnings of former secretary of state Colin Powell  Gen  John Abizaid and the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff last year   the President is sending five brigades to referee a Sunni Shia civil war   And we re sending them without the protection they need to survive EFP attacks        Unfortunately  even with the latest armor kit  soldiers will still die from these roadside bombs   But the new armor does reinforce the doors  it does slow down the projectile  and it  will keep our soldiers safer and save many lives   Just listen to General James T Conway  commandant of the Marine Corps   When he talked about the armor kit  here s what he said   They are expensive  but they are going to save lives           The technology already exists to keep our troops safer   so why  four years later  don t our they have it     Partly  it s due to gross incompetence at the highest levels of the Bush administration    But mostly  the fact is that this Administration never mobilized the country for the war in Iraq     Since we invaded  the need for a fleet of vehicles that can keep our troops safe has been unmistakable   And yet we ve kept relying on a single provider of up armored Humvees   That s right  one provider   And given the chronic shortfalls we ve seen  that was clearly insufficient          But even after all we ve heard  over several years  about our soldiers lacking equipment and armor  this Administration still doesn t seem to get it   The President s defense budget request for next year doesn t include funds for enough armored vehicles  and so the Marine Corps had to ask Congress for an additional  2 8 billion to buy more Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles    Going back to 2002  the Bush administration terminated funding for one alternative vehicle more suited to the battlefield in Iraq because of what they called different  budget priorities         While this is an urgent short term concern  we also need to think long term about what our soldiers will need for 21st century warfare   Enemies are taking note of our strengths and weaknesses   Unfortunately  this will not be the last war in which our troops are targeted in the vehicles they ride   Since Somalia in 1993  we ve known that Humvees   with their thin skins and square bottomed chassis    are ill suited for counterinsurgency and for the modern battlefield   So we need to bridge this short term gap  but we also need to invest in the armored vehicles that will keep our soldiers safe in the future   This is serious business and we had better get to it   We can t afford to remain vulnerable        No Commander in Chief  no Congress should knowingly put the lives of soldiers at risk unnecessarily    And yet  as we escalate this war  we do so with neither a plan for success nor protection for our troops         And it s long past time we have an honest conversation about what protecting our troops really means   Some of my Republican colleagues blocked a Senate vote on the President s escalation plan because they wanted an Amendment saying that if Congress were to use the power of the purse to force this Administration to change its failed policy in Iraq  it would somehow be putting our troops at risk         Aren t we putting our troops at risk when we send over 20 000 more Americans into the crossfire of a civil war without life saving equipment    You want to talk about protecting the troops   Give them the armor they need and then get them out of there  That s how you protect the troops         We need to give our soldiers extra body armor and the latest up armored Humvees they need to do their job as safely as they can   But ultimately we need to fix this failed policy and provide a responsible strategy for ending the war   That is why I will again introduce a resolution to the Senate that offers us the best chance to salvage some measure of success in Iraq   The troops ought to be protected for as long as they police Iraqi streets  but they shouldn t be policing those streets in the first place   We can and must bring our combat troops home within a year         We need to create a whole new dynamic on the ground by setting a one year deadline for redeployment of our troops   leaving only those necessary to finish training Iraqi security forces  conduct counterterrorism operations  and protect our facilities and personnel         Iraqis need to take responsibility for Iraq   We need to recognize that Iraqis have shown over and over again that they only respond to deadlines  a deadline to transfer authority  deadlines to hold two elections and a referendum  and a deadline to form a government  Without hard deadlines  our best hopes for progress in Iraq have been dashed by squabbling politicians unwilling to take responsibility for their country s future         Deadlines are also necessary to instill a sense of urgency in Iraq s neighbors and the international community   Setting a deadline drives home a basic but essential point  None of Iraq s neighbors want chaos on their borders   None of them want to see Iraq fall apart   But the status quo works well for a country like Iran   they are delighted to see us bogged down while they expand their influence in Iraq    By setting a deadline  we can help change their strategic calculus so that their interest in preventing chaos in Iraq is stronger than their desire to see us bogged down there   Setting a deadline also signals to Iraq s Sunni neighbors that the time has finally come to pressure Sunnis inside Iraq to make the hard compromises necessary to bring about a lasting political solution       But none of that will be accomplished by sending in over 20 000 more troops   None of that will be accomplished with a mere shift in tactics   We need a whole new strategy   Here s the surge we ought to be talking about  We should be making an aggressive push to bring together the various factions inside and outside Iraq to begin taking ownership of the future of the country and the region   With a one year deadline I believe we could really make things happen diplomatically         The mistakes we have already made cannot be undone    but that does not mean we re doomed to repeat them   The soldiers in the field already bear the burden of this Administration s decision to invade Iraq and lack of a postwar plan   Many of them paid for it with their lives   They bear this burden with incredible courage  resilience  and guts         They go out and do their job  even as their mission amidst another country s civil war becomes less and less clear every day   They shouldn t have to bear that burden without the best protection we can offer   It s time to get this right  once and for all  and not send any more Americans into harm s way without a strategy to guide them and without the equipment they need to protect them                                                                                      20510
