and Representative Henry Waxman  D Calif   today asked the GAO to investigate the extent to which White House officials and political appointees at federal agencies have manipulated the science on global warming    Below is the text of their letter                                                                                                                               June 9  2005    Mr  David M  Walker Comptroller General of the United States Government Accountability Office 441 G Street  NW Washington  DC 20548   Dear Mr  Walker     Yesterday  the New York Times reported that a top White House official  former oil industry lobbyist Phillip A  Cooney  has reviewed and altered government scientific reports on global warming   According to the Times  Mr  Cooney has    repeatedly edited government climate reports in ways that play down links between  greenhouse  emissions and global warming  according to internal documents           In addition to altering documents  political appointees dictated government climate research priorities  according to a government whistle blower  Rick Piltz  former Senior Associate with the U S  Climate Change Science Policy Office and former Associate Director of the U S  Global Change Research Program   Mr  Piltz resigned in protest in March 2005    He states     The White House so successfully politicized the science program that it was impossible for me to carry out my duties with integrity          We are writing to request that the Government Accountability Office investigate these serious allegations     The Times article reported on numerous documents where Mr  Cooney   s edits changed scientific conclusions made by government and academic researchers   For example  the U S  Climate Change Science Program regularly compiles and transmits to Congress a report on the program   s research activities entitled    Our Changing Planet      In an October 2002 draft of this report  Mr  Cooney deleted as    speculative    a summary of findings by government climate researchers that climate change had been projected to reduce mountain glaciers  and snowpack   Similarly  Mr  Cooney systematically changed language to introduce uncertainty in affirmative statements  e g   changing    is    to    may     and to amplify references to uncertainty made by scientists  e g   adding    extremely    to a statement indicating that an attribution is difficult    According to the New York Times  Mr  Cooney is a lawyer with a bachelor   s degree in economics who has no scientific training     Unfortunately  the incidents reported by the Times are simply the latest in a pattern of interference with climate science by the Bush Administration   This pattern is evident across government agencies   For example  early in the Administration  ExxonMobil successfully lobbied the White House to oppose the re appointment of a leading U S  climatologist to chair the preeminent international global warming study panel    The State Department complied  giving no scientific rationale for its opposition to Dr  Robert Watson   Lacking the support of his own country in an election to an international body  Dr  Watson was not re appointed       Dr  James E  Hansen  a world renowned climatology expert at NASA   s Goddard Institute for Space Studies  was told by NASA Administrator Sean O   Keefe not to talk about    dangerous anthropogenic interference    with the climate    Dr  Hansen has publicly objected to what he views as the Administration   s unprecedented screening of information flow from scientists to the public      Other examples include changes made by the White House or agency political appointees that distorted scientific findings and summaries in reports  articles  and press releases from EPA  NASA  and NOAA addressing climate change      We request that the Government Accountability Office investigate the extent to which White House officials and political appointees at federal agencies have interfered with federally funded science on global warming    Specifically  we request that GAO         Review and evaluate the changes made or requested by White House officials to documents produced by federal agencies that relate to climate change         Review and evaluate the changes made or requested by political appointees at federal agencies to documents produced by federal agencies that relate to climate change         Review and evaluate any efforts by White House officials or political appointees at federal agencies to influence the direction of federally funded science related to climate change         Review and evaluate other efforts  if any  made by White House officials or political appointees to interfere with federally funded science related to climate change      We look forward to consulting with you about this important request     Sincerely      John F  Kerry Henry A  Waxman U S  Senator Ranking Minority Member Committee on Government Reform U S  House of Representatives                                                                          20510
