John Kerry on the Senate floor this afternoon   Remarks are as prepared                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mr  President  none of us will ever forget the hours after September 11th  the calls to our families  the evacuations  the images on television    and then the remarkable response of the American people as we came together as one to answer the attack against our homeland          We drew strength when our firefighters ran up the stairs and risked their lives  so that others might live  When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon   When the men and women of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation   s Capitol   When flags were hanging from front porches all across America  and strangers became friends   It brought out the best in all of us            That spirit of our country should never be reduced to a cheap and divisive political applause line from anyone who speaks for the President of the United States   I am proud that after September 11th all our people rallied to President Bush   s call for unity to meet the danger   There were no Democrats   There were no Republicans   There were only Americans   That   s why is hard to believe that last night the most senior advisor to the President of the United States is twisting those days of unity to divide us  that rather than focusing attention on finding Osama bin Laden and smashing al Qaeda  he is instead challenging the patriotism of Americans every bit as committed to fighting terror as he is          For Karl Rove to equate Democratic policy on terror to    indictments    and    therapy    is an outrageous attempt to divide the nation at just the moment we must be unified   Just days after 9 11 the Senate voted 98 0 and the House voted 420 1 to authorize President Bush to use    all necessary and appropriate force    against terror   After the bipartisan vote  President Bush said  I quote     I am gratified that the Congress has united so powerfully by taking this action   It sends a clear message    our people are together  and we will prevail             Karl Rove also said last night  quote     No more needs to be said about the motives of liberals      Well  I think a lot more needs to be said about Karl Rove   s motives  because they   re not the people   s motives  and if the President really believed his own words of unity  then he should fire Karl Rove   If the President of the United States knows the meaning of his own words  he should listen to the plea of Kristen Breitweiser  who lost her husband when the Twin Towers came crashing down  she said     if you   re going to use 9 11  use it to make this nation safer than it was on 9 11   And that   s not being done  If you   re going to use 9 11  if you   re going to be impassioned about the lives lost on 9 11  then do so by making us safer          Karl Rove doesn   t owe me an apology  he doesn   t owe Democrats an apology  he owes her an apology    he owes an apology to every one of those families who paid the ultimate price on September 11th          Millions of Americans across our country are questioning whether this Administration is making us safe  Kristen Breitweiser wants to tell her daughter that she   ll grow up in a country safer than on the day her father was taken from her           Mothers and fathers spend sleepless nights worrying about sons and daughters in humvees in Iraq that aren   t protected   They   re asking Washington for honesty and results and leadership  not political division            Before Karl Rove delivers another political assault  he needs to think about those families   The 9 11 Commission has given us a path to follow  endorsed by Democrats  Republicans  and the 9 11 families   Implement the recommendations of that commission   We shouldn   t be letting ninety five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected   We shouldn   t be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection            Until they   ve done the work of making America safe  don   t dare question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction   Before wrapping themselves in the memory of September 11th  and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth  they should remember what America is really all about    that leadership isn   t insult or intimidation  it   s the strength of making America safe    they should remember what their responsibility is to every American    and start to do the work of living up to it                                                                                           20510
