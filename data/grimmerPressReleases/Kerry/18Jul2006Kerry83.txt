       Releases                                                                                                                                           07 18 2006 John Kerry to President on Stem Cell Debate   Don   t Veto Hope                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Below are the remarks of Senator John Kerry on the Senate floor today on his support for stem cell research   Kerry was accompanied by Beth Kolbe  a Massachusetts college student and stem cell advocate originally from Tiffin  Ohio  who is interning in his Washington office this summer      As prepared for delivery          Mr  President  for each of us  and for millions of Americans  this is a personal issue  almost impossible to separate from our own experiences   I will never forget almost two years ago standing in the amphitheater in Denver  talking to people     many in wheelchairs  many who had lost loved ones to disease  and many who knew a cure wouldn   t come in time for them    who held out hope that stem cell research might save them  save a loved one  or save others   They wanted leadership   They wanted someone to fight for them back in Washington  and I promised them that I would   I will never forget the looks in their eyes  or the promise they were asking of leaders they placed their hope in     When I think about them  when I think about the people I met all over the country who were so personally invested in this issue  I   m even more deeply troubled to see that today we find ourselves in a place of division when we could have been united     so much promise threatened by President Bush   s threat to veto a bipartisan bill that funds stem cell research     In more than five years  President Bush hasn   t vetoed a single bill  Not one  He   s signed 1 129 bills into law without raising his pen to veto a single one   And now he wants to use the first veto of his presidency to nix the hopes of millions of Americans suffering from devastating illnesses     A veto now would send a message to all Americans that  on crucial issues  our differences are greater than our shared convictions   It would tell the world that America no longer wants to be the country that wants to be the world   s leader in scientific knowledge and discovery     The bipartisan legislation before Congress shows that Congress has taken the politics out of the debate on stem cell research   It   s time the White House does  too     The current policy is eroding our national advantage on stem cell research   We   re tying our scientists    hands  We   re holding back our doctors   We need a policy that is not driven by narrow interest group politics   We need a federal policy that builds on the advances being made in our states  in our universities  in our private foundations and research centers   Senate passage of H R  810     with veto proof majorities     will put us on that path        What a tragedy it would be if the first veto of Bush   s presidency were used to make a political wedge of something that Washington and the rest of America overwhelmingly support    regardless of political party    and a promise that offers hope to millions and could put America on the path to leading the world in the discovery of cures   This is not some    wedge issue     These are people   s lives     For all of us  the issue of stem cell research is deeply personal and raises profound moral questions   But people of good will and good sense can resolve these complicated ethical issues without stopping lifesaving research     America has long led the world in great discoveries  always upholding the highest ethical standards  with our breakthroughs and our beliefs going hand in hand   And when it comes to stem cell research  and all scientific research  we will demand no less       This legislation  already passed last year by the House of Representatives with bipartisan support  would provide important ethical safeguards by extending federally funded research only to embryos that are       Donated by in vitro fertilization clinics        Created specifically for fertility treatment        In excess of treatment needs and would otherwise be discarded  and       Donated by treatment seeking individuals who provided written informed consent and were not offered financial inducements    As the Los Angeles Times editorialized in May 2004     The moral decision is between putting these few so called embryos in the trash and using them to possibly bring back lost memory  keep people out of wheelchairs or free them from a life of insulin injections   It is not a simple decision  but it is also not a close call      Growing numbers of conservatives from John McCain  Bill Frist  and Orrin Hatch to Nancy Reagan have looked carefully at the scientific facts and searched their own consciences and arrived at the same conclusion   opposing stem cell research is the opposite of a    pro life policy     Here in the Senate and across the country  Americans are approaching an ethical consensus that bans human cloning while protecting stem cell research   The stakes couldn   t be higher   More than 100 million Americans suffer from illnesses that might one day be cured away with stem cell therapy   Stem cells could replace damaged heart cells or cells destroyed by cancer   They could offer a new lease on life to those with a diagnosis that once came with a death sentence   Research has the potential to slow the loss of a grandmother s memory  calm the hand of an uncle with Parkinson s  save a child from a lifetime of daily insulin shots or permanently lift a best friend or colleague from a wheelchair     Beth Kolbe shares that hope   She is a summer intern in my office who has followed the stem cell research debate very closely over the years  and especially this week   Beth has spent the last two days watching the debate on the Senate floor     her presence now is a silent  powerful reminder of what is at stake here       At the age of 14  Beth was in a car accident and suffered a terrible spinal cord injury   In that instant  she was paralyzed from the chest down   After 2 neck surgeries  2 weeks in intensive care  2 months as an inpatient in a rehab hospital  and 2 years as an outpatient in physical therapy  she is living a very full life   She loves her live as a junior at Harvard  studying biology and health care  navigating the campus in her wheelchair   But she told me it would be a lie to say that there are not challenges           She wants more  Not just for her  but for others  Here   s what she said      Since that day six years ago  my family and I have been following stem cell research because it can help so many people   I   m just one of the millions who can be helped   As a person in the disability community  I   ve met so many people whose main goal is just to get better  and stem cell research is their one opportunity to find a cure    I hope to be a face that the Senators can see  so that they can see what they   re voting for        Beth is here because she wants to see the United States Senate vote for hope   Some of the most pioneering treatments and miraculous cures could be at our fingertips  right around the next corner  but because of politics they could remain beyond reach  Every day we wait  more than 3 000 Americans die from diseases that may someday be treatable because of discoveries made through stem cell research   Americans have been presented with a false choice between the sanctity of human life and the scientific knowledge that can save it   The President   s veto rests on the false assumption that we have to choose between our dreams and our principles   We can have both     We can support our scientists  help the sick  and ensure that our legal and ethical boundaries continue to reflect our unshakable sense of human dignity and the value of human life     If we get votes from 67 out of 100 Senators   then we can send the President a veto proof message   Stop tying our scientists    hands  put down your veto pen  stop being part of the problem and become a part of the solution     The American people believe in stem cell research for many of the same reasons as a remarkable woman I met at a town hall meeting on stem cell research  She stood up  her frail body shaking  and pleaded for her government to embrace stem cell research  It was the moral clarity of her message that will stay with me forever    Many Americans know a woman like her   maybe it   s a grandparent with Alzheimer   s or a friend in a wheelchair      It s too late for me     she said     but we need to do this for those who still have hope        It   s too late for my friend  Christopher Reeve  who passed away in 2004   But it   s not too late for this President to change his mind before tying the hands of doctors  scientists  and ethicists with a preemptive veto   Chris would agree that it   s not too late to give millions of Americans what they want most of all  hope   And in closing  I want to share one more story   It   s from Lauren Stanford of Plymouth  Massachusetts   She is 14 years old and has suffered from juvenile diabetes for 9 years   She and her mother  Moira McCarthy  come down to Washington  DC  each year as citizen lobbyists in support of stem cell research and finding a cure for diabetes       I want to read you a few passages from an essay she wrote          For as long as I can remember  I   ve had to take a lot of leaps of faith  I   ve had to believe my parents when they told me taking four or five shots and day and pricking my finger eight or more times a day was just    a new kind of normal           I   ve had to smile at the world and say I really don   t mind wearing the insulin pump that   s now connected to my body 24 hours a day  seven days a week        Yes  in my nine years of life with Type 1 diabetes  I   ve learned to accept a lot of things as    just the way it is and the way it has to be          But when I watched  with my parents  President Bush   s decision on stem cell research in the summer of 2001     and his vows now to veto the bill     I just could not accept it        You see the one thing that has helped me accept all I   ve had to accept these years is the presence of hope        When I feel like I might just scream if I have to live another day fighting this endless disease  I think about all the researchers out there working to help me be cured  Now  it might seem corny to think of a teenage girl dreaming about researchers in labs  but that   s what kids who have incurable diseases do        Stem cell research could mean I can go to college without a machine attached to my belly keeping me alive  It could mean I can have children just like anyone else  not with teams of doctors working with me daily just to make it happen     It might mean my children won   t even know what diabetes was       President Bush talks about protecting the innocent  I wonder  what about me  I am truly innocent in this situation  I did nothing to bring my diabetes on     How  I ask my parents  is it more important to throw discarded embryos into the trash than it is to let them be used to hopefully save my life     and to give me back a life where I don   t have to accept a constant  almost insane level of hourly medical intervention as    normal     How could my nation do this to me       I am so happy to hear that the Senate is thinking of passing HR 810    I can dream again     dream of that great time when I write a thank you letter to the Senate  the House and everyone who helped me become just another girl  a girl who dreamed and hoped and one day  got just what she wanted  her health and future  That   s all I   m really asking for  And allowing stem cell research can do just that for me      So please join me in voting for this important legislation by a veto proof margin   We need to send a message to the President that the American people have decided to move forward   responsibly but resolutely   on vital stem cell research   Beth  Lauren  and millions of other Americans like them are counting on us to do the right thing
