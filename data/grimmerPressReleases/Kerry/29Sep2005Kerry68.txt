Senators John Kerry  D   Mass   and Richard Durbin  D   Ill   together with U S  Representatives Hilda Solis  D   Calif   and Alcee Hastings  D   Fla   introduced the Public Health and Environmental Equality Act  which will protect public health  environmental and environmental justice laws during the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina        Hurricane Katrina caused an unprecedented environmental and public health crisis in the Gulf Coast region  Not only did 9 major oil spills occur  but 60 underground storage tanks  5 Superfund sites  and numerous hazardous waste facilities were hit   Over 1 000 drinking water systems were disabled and lead and E Coli levels in the floodwaters have far passed the EPA   s safe levels       The Public Health and Environmental Equality Act resolves that public health and environmental laws should be protected during the time residents of the Gulf Coast need them most   Low income and minority communities   those most negatively affected by pollution and poor environmental standards   are also those who have been hardest hit by Katrina   s wrath   Protecting these environmental laws will help those most affected communities and protect the environment from greater risk for future generations  The bill is an important signal that many in Congress will stand against the opportunistic and needless repeal of environmental and health protections in the name of rebuilding after Katrina          The victims of Katrina must not be victimized twice  first by a hurricane then by Washington s assault on clean air and clean water  It s wrong to talk one week about the poverty of the Gulf Coast then the next week rollback basic safeguards that protect children in our most needy communities from permanent health risks     Senator Kerry said     Every family in the Gulf Coast deserves decent public health and environmental protections  and a callous leadership in Washington should not exploit this moment by launching a shameful sneak attack on environmental justice  I am proud to work with Senator Durbin  Representatives Solis and Hastings on this important effort          Senator Durbin added     This issue is about ensuring that the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita are not victimized again  For the well being of all Gulf Coast residents  we must ensure that public health is protected and that environmental compliance remains a priority             I believe that as responsible policymakers we should be pushing for greater protections for the poor  the elderly  children  minorities and other under served communities   not selling off their health to the highest corporate bidder     Representative Solis said     These communities are the most likely to become sick and suffer because of dirty air and water  the most likely to live in closer proximity to refineries  toxic dumps and hazardous waste sites  and the least likely to be able to protect themselves  Hurricane Katrina showed the vulnerabilities of our nation s infrastructure and safety net  As we rebuild the Gulf Coast and plan for our nation s future  we should remember the suffering of Katrina and do more   not less   to protect public health and the environment          Representative Alcee Hastings said     When you look at the areas that were and still are flooded in New Orleans  we know who lives there  we know what they look like  and we know their income bracket   What good are we doing in sending people home to drink water that isn t potable  walk on soil that is contaminated  and breath air that downright toxic  The first inclination is obviously to get people back in their homes   But that inclination alone is not enough to give the Bush Administration carte blanche authority to waive every critical environmental regulation on the books           The Public Health and Environmental Equality Act resolves that       Hurricane Katrina and other such disasters will not be used to weaken  waive  or roll back Federal public health  environmental and environmental justice laws   State  local  and regional authorities retain their authority for compliance and permitting of industrial and other facilities and their role in enforcing cleanup    Testing  monitoring  cleanup and recovery in the Gulf Coast region is completed in a manner designed to protect public health and the environment and ensure habitability of the region   Federal rebuilding of communities and the economy of the Gulf Coast region becomes a model of the integrated  diverse and sustainable society that all Americans desire and deserve    The act is co sponsored by  Senators Durbin  Reid  Obama  Boxer  and Jeffords and Representatives Solis  Hastings  Leader Pelosi  Allen  Andrews  Baldwin
