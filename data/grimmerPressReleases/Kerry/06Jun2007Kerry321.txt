Senator John Kerry challenged the Democratic Majority to take bold approaches to solving our environmental crisis when the Senate debates the energy bill next week  In addition  with President Bush arriving at the G8 summit today  Kerry urged him to reengage in a global effort to fight climate change abroad and to agree to firm limits on emissions rather than flexible goals  In his speech  delivered at the National Press Club  Kerry also called on Congress to pass serious cap and trade legislation and reduce CO2 emissions  Below are his remarks  as prepared  For years now  some in Washington have clung to any excuse or rationalization they could findno matter how thin to avoid confronting the imminent threat of climate change  But last week  on the heels of President Bush saying that this is a serious issue  we reached a new low when Michael Griffin  the Administrator of NASA  the agency that oversees climate change science     offered a disturbing insight into what many of us have long feared is the true thinking of this Administration  He said that while he acknowledges the existence of global warming  hes not sure its fair to say that its a problem we must wrestle with  He said he isnt sure which human beings should have  and these again are his words    the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today  right now  is the best climate for all other human beings  He thinks its arrogant to think that the government should act on climate change  I have news for Administrator Griffin  History will show that whats arrogant is how this Administration ignores pleas from the world community  from Democratic and Republican governors  from CEOs of major corporations  from religious leaders of every denomination   to do something about climate change  Its not a privilege for this Administration to protect us from climate changeits an obligation  And anyone in power who thinks otherwise ought to have the privilege of being voted out of office or fired  And yet  when it comes to energy independence and fighting climate change  neither the blame nor the burden for inaction falls on one party alone  Washington has never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity  Even President Bush is now fond of saying that America is addicted to oil  But Washingtons preferred policy has been to feed the addiction  the governments attitude on greenhouse gases has been to let them increase  Congresss energy alternatives have been token  and again and again the partisan approach to crisis has been to denigrate the environment  Last November Americans spoke out  the people know the truth  America is not addicted to oil because it wants to be  Washington has been addicted to oil because that s the way powerful interests want it to be  But the good news is that right now  this summer we have a chance to begin to get it right  In a single month  we could rewrite the shameful story of procrastination  manipulation andmost of allfailed leadership that has defined our energy policy for thirty years  Here at home  the Democratic Senate has a chance to pass an energy bill that shapes our countrys energy policy and our research priorities for years to come  And overseas  at the G 8 conference in Germany  the President has a chance to remind the world of what America should always stand for by committing our country to concrete measures in the fight against climate change  That is why today Im calling on the President to do whats right at the G 8 Summit in Germany  And I believe it is imperative that Congressparticularly we Democrats with a mandate for changedo whats right here at home  For Democrats  the energy bill coming to the floor of the Senate is a test of our will  and a question of whether we are serious about the responsibility we hold to govern differently  to deliver bold changenot warmed over offerings  Democrats took a majority of both houses in Congress because we promised to do things differently  We werent elected to be the party of Big Oil  only a little less obviously  We werent elected to be like Republican Congresses of the past  only a little more progressive  No    if we merely tinker around the edges of energy policy or climate change  or write an energy bill indistinguishable from the ones we criticized Republicans for passing then we have not earned our majority  The energy bill the last Congress passed was a hollow exercise masquerading as a new direction while giving the majority of the spoils to the same old special interests  It had no guiding national goal  no tough decisions  no change in priorities    just a collection of logrolling  back scratching subsidies for any industry with the clout to get a seat at the table and a share of the pork  A few good ideas  a lot of bad ideas and ugly ideas  Washington smiled equally upon all of them  It was the latest chapter in the long story in both parties of politics at its worst    ducking the difficult choices  giving into the big contributors  substituting words for deeds  postponing the reckoning until the day after tomorrow  If you offend no one  you change nothing  But the world is changing and now the reckoning is real  The question now is what will our Democratic Congress offer to break with the past  what will we do to begin to break the oil addiction that leaves us at the mercy of hostile regimes in the Middle East and pushes the world ever closer to a global climate change tipping point that would be irreversible  A serious energy bill must include three components  1  a major increase in the efficiency of all sources and uses of energy  from pickup trucks to fluorescent light bulbs  2  dramatic incentives for all renewable energy sources  including the requirement that at least 20  of our energy come from renewable sources like wind and solar by 2020  and 3  a comprehensive plan to get clean coal technologies and carbon sequestration off the drawing board and under construction  First energy efficiency  improving fuel economy is the cornerstone of the strategy to reduce our reliance on imported oil  Since Americas second oil crisis in 1980  our oil imports have increased from 37  to 56   but our passenger fleet averages 25 miles per gallon  mpg   the same as in 1981  And theres no reason for it  But dont take my word for it    the National Academy of Sciences found that existing engine technologies were cheap enough to pay for themselves over the life of a vehicle and could enhance fuel economy by 8 to 11 mpg with no net cost to consumers  This is happening right now  Today theres a company in Massachusetts that has developed the technology for a plug in hybrid car that gets 150 miles per gallon  The average Americans commute is less than 30 miles roundtrip and this car can travel that far without any meaningful contribution from a combustion engine  Just think of the fuel savings if the average commute required almost no fuel  Senator McCain and I first proposed a 35 mpg increase to fuel standards in 2002  and Ive supported efforts to move in this direction for my entire Senate career  However  the current version of this energy bill includes loopholes that may allow automakers to avoid increasing the average fuel economy as much as they claim to  And anything less than a guaranteed 35 miles per gallon over the next decade is unacceptable But its not just our automobiles that need to be more efficient  Its our buildings too  You want to know why green buildings matter  Look at the Texas Instruments building in Dallas  To save enough money to justify building their new plant in Texas instead of India or China  they built green  And you know what happened  Theyre saving  3 million per year on water and energy  bringing a  14 5 billion boost to Texas economy  and creating over 88 000 permanent jobs  Second  this energy bill currently offers no mandate for renewable energy production  Over the last five years  24 states and the District of Columbia have implemented local requirements that 20  of our energy come from renewable sources by the year 2020  And yet Republicans continue to stand in the way of a federal Renewable Portfolio Standard  States are screaming for leadership on this issue  and I will once again fight for an aggressive renewable portfolio standard in this bill  Finally  this energy bill doesnt adequately address our number one source of energy  coal  Coal is available  abundant and cheap  thats truebut its also a huge source of US greenhouse gas emissions 1 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year  Why is clean coal so important  Because if we even stand a prayer at addressing climate change  we have no choice but to get serious about cleaning up coal  In the last 250 years  carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen from 270 parts per million to 370higher today than at any time in the past 150 000 years  And carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for a century or more  trapping the suns heat and warming the planet  Scientists tell us that we have to keep CO2 concentration below 450 parts per million  which corresponds to an increase of 2 degrees Celsiusto avoid a large scale catastrophe  And we only have ten years in which to act  But unless we take dramatic action  were expected to reach 600 700 parts per million by the year 2100  With the emissions already in the atmosphere and those we cant hope to prevent  the window is already closing on ustheres no room for error here  This is urgent  And its not being driven by politicsits being driven by facts and by the alarms that scientists across the planet are sounding today  This energy bill is inseparable from climate change because better energy policy is at the heart of any serious solution to climate change  And so any energy bill worth the paper its printed on should make dramatic investments in developing technologies for clean coal  on the order of a billion dollars a year  MIT recently introduced a ground breaking study calling for a dramatically expanded effort to develop carbon capture and sequestration or CCStechnology  They say that CCS will allow us to use coal to meet our energy needs without sabotaging our efforts to fight climate change  But like so many great ideas  we havent tested CCS on a scale commensurate to the size of the problem  We need large scale demonstration projects with government support  and massive funding for research so that we can reclaim the most readily available energy assets we have for the 21st century economy  I will be introducing legislation  which I will also offer as an amendment to the energy bill  that will pave a path for a clean coal future  Those are the steps Democrats must take  And we must have the courage to do something that Democrats have not done as boldly as we should have  stand up to big oil  We need to use this energy bill to dramatically increase the number of tools in our arsenal to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions because climate policy is energy policy and vice versa We should be massively increasing our investment in wind  solar  and other renewable electricity sources  We should promote the purchase of cleaner vehicle fleets  and we should be supporting green buildings  And how can we pay for this bold new plan  Last time I checked  Big Oils profits were hitting historic highs  In fact  big oil companies have pocketed  255 billion in profits since the start of 2005  Thison top of the billions in tax breaks and sweetheart deals President Bush and his oil buddies in Congress have delivered  At the same time American consumers are paying record prices at the pump  Enough is enough  Even President Bush has said that some of the tax breaks should go  The CEOs of big oil say theyre unnecessary  Whats stopping us in the Senate from acting  I have a bill that would roll back the subsidies for big oil  saving over  20 billion dollars  This is about priorities  Honestly  which do you think is more important  Voters ought to be asking every member of Congress for an honest answer  Once we pass a serious energy bill  we must also bring a cap and trade bill to reduce C02 emissions to the Senate floor  Olympia Snowe and I have proposed a bill that does just thatthe most aggressive bipartisan legislation introduced to date  For too long  Democrats have been part of the problem  Now we have the power in Congress to drive a real solution  And Democrats need to stand up and be counted  The second major opportunity we have is unfolding in Europe at the G 8 Summit  where the President could follow up on his promises from last week with specifics that will transform our nation from the worlds laggard to the worlds leader in the fight against climate change  Im pleased to see that President Bush is now taking the first tentative steps  which his top environmental advisor describes as aspirational goals  Good intentions are welcome  but we need mandatory caps too  The President last week called for an international dialogue on climate change  Hes apparently so new to this issue that he doesnt even realize that we already have one  over ten years ago we signed onto the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change  This isnt the time for talk  its the time for action  We cant let the President use the cover of conversation to weather the G 8 and punt this problem to the next Administration  As the G 8 summit convenes today  President Bush should sit down with Chancellor Merkel and the other world leaders and agree to work inside the established international framework to reduce Carbon Dioxide emissions  He should agree to personally represent the US at the upcoming meeting in Bali and engage in negotiations with the leaders of developed and developing nations to secure their buy in going forward  Thats what real leadership worthy of the American people would look like and we should demand nothing less  We should be driving the process to create a new international agreement to replace the flawed Kyoto treaty  and that process should begin today at the G 8 summit  Its time for those of us who are serious about fighting climate change to take the next step toward decisive action  pass a bold and visionary energy bill at home  enact serious cap and trade legislation to reduce domestic CO2 emissions  and reengage in a global effort to fight climate change abroad  This wont be easy  and it wont happen on the cheap  But  as John F Kennedy once told a crowd at Rice University in Texas  We choose to go to the moon in this decade    not because  it is  easy  but because  it is  hard  because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills  because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept  one we are unwilling to postpone  and one which we intend to win Great challenges bring greatness to those who master them  and either through the ferocity of our fight or the weakness of our willpower  this will be the challenge that defines us  I choose to fight  So for the second time in our history let s declare and win our independence  This time not from foreign rule but from foreign oil  If we are as Lincoln said the last best hope of Earth  let s stop being the denier of global warming that endangers the Earth  Let s give our people back the truth  and let s give the world back its future                                                                                20510
