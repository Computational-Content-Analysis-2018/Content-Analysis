Kerry today said that dozens of critical programs related to health care  education  law enforcement and even Amtrak operations would suffer under the budget plan presented by President Bush today  Kerry said that budget was bad news for Massachusetts residents because of significant cuts to school grants  including arts education  career counseling  technical education and safe and drug free school grants              This budget runs counter to what working Americans expect from their government  but prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans   Kerry said this afternoon   It s filled with bad news for families  commuters  local governments  hospitals  fire departments  first responders  small businesses  teachers and other educators   among others  It shortchanges our children by directing another  245 billion to pay for the ill advised war in Iraq  even after a majority of voters told President Bush that we re headed in the wrong direction there  I promise to review this budget very closely try to prevent the President s reckless recommendations from moving forward              The following is a preliminary review of the budget s impact on key programs and services             VETERANS             Health Care  The Bush plan would continue to shortchange our brave men and women by continuing to impose co payments  enrollment fees and higher drug co pays for some veterans  Many returning vets are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome  yet the Administration s budget offers little hope for them  Finally  many veterans will have a hard time finding housing after the Bush plan proposed a cut in housing credits                    EDUCATION              Overall  The Bush FY 08 budget would cut Education Department funding by   1 5 billion  for a total of  56 0 billion   down from  57 5 billion this year          Grants  Elimination of 44 grant programs  including Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants  education technology state grants  arts education  and school counseling  and large cuts to numerous other programs including career and technical education  and safe and drug free schools state grants  An estimated 28 302 children in Massachusetts would be denied afterschool funding under the president s budget        Special Education    Retreats on its commitment to students with disabilities by directing the federal government to provide a smaller share of states  total costs for special education       Afterschool Programs    Funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers would remain flat  at  981 million    1 5 billion below the  2 5 billion authorized level for this year       Vouchers    Bush proposed a  300 million private school voucher plan       AmeriCorps    The FY08 budget once again proposes deep reductions in national service programs like VISTA  which would be cut by  5 7 million   Also  AmeriCorps State and National grants would be cut by  9 2 million  And finally  one of the four National Civilian Community Corps centers would be closed  for a cut to the program of  15 million         Head Start    The budget would cut Head Start by  100 million  for a total of  6 79 billion    Since 2002  Head Start has been cut by 11 percent in real terms    The program currently only serves only about one half of the children eligible for the pre school program  much fewer in Early Head Start                    SMALL BUSINESS              Manufacturing  The President wants to roll back funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program by 56 percent  This same program is designed to help small and mid sized manufacturers  and has helped create or retain more than 2 900 jobs in Massachusetts during the last year               Technology  The president s plan also would eliminate the Advanced Technology Program  which provides grants to support research and development of high risk  cutting edge technologies  Scores of Massachusetts companies have benefited from this grant program                    AMTRAK             Service  Bush s plan would slash the Amtrak budget from  1 293 billion  to  800 million   likely resulting in the elimination of 350 jobs in Massachusetts and cuts in service along key routes  like   Boston Worcester NY Chicago  and  DC to Burlington  via Springfield and Amherst                      TRANSPORTATION             Bridge  Due to proposed cuts in the Coast Guard Budget  construction of a new Chelsea Street Bridge in Boston would suffer  delaying the completion date of this critical project                    PUBLIC SAFETY HOMELAND SECURITY             Fire  The budget proposes a 55 percent cut in FIRE Act grants for local fire departments to purchase equipment and provides no funding at all for the SAFER Act which helps department hire staff  Funding would go from  662 million this year to  300 million              Police  The president s budget also severely cuts the COPS program   a program that Senator Kerry helped create   as well as slashing funds for the Office on Violence Against Women   That office received  2 5 million last year and would fall to  1 2 million              Homeland Security  Less than a week after the scare that gridlocked downtown Boston  Bush proposes a severe cut to three different programs that help the state work with local governments to pay for critical anti terror safety programs  The state grant program would go from  509 million to  187 million  the Urban Area Security Initiative goes from  747 million to  600 million  and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Grants  which trains our police  goes from  364 million to  263 million                    HEALTH CARE             Children  Bush would cut payments for low income children s health care and increase the number of uninsured kids by targeting the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   Under Sen  Kerry s plan  every one of the nation s 11 million uninsured kids would be covered       Medicare  Bush favors cutting  300 billion over ten years from Medicare and Medicaid  hurting the most needy and the elderly at a time of rising health care costs    Massachusetts hospitals and other providers would face more than  400 million in cuts in the next five years alone       Physician reimbursement  Bush offers no plan for addressing the cumulative cut of nearly 50 percent in physician reimbursement over the next 10 years  Failure to address this issue is typical of the Administration s overall neglect of Medicare priorities  and compromises the overall quality of our health care delivery system       Research  Bush would slash funds for NIH  CDC and other important health programs       Uninsured  The Bush budget includes more incentives for employers to drop coverage by creating a plan that seeks to foster individual insurance at the expense of the group market                    HOUSING             Low Income Housing  Bush would cut or eliminate critical federal housing programs  including taking nearly  33 million of the Massachusetts cities allocation from the Community Development Block Grant program  which helps build and rehabilitate affordable housing in low income communities    He would also eliminate funding for Empowerment Zones  Enterprise Communities  the HOPE VI program and other critically needed housing and economic development programs that focus on low income communities             LIHEAP  The Bush plan cuts funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP    reducing the program from the authorized level of  5 1 billion to  1 5 billion  This vital funding helps pay the winter heating bills or summer cooling bills of low income and elderly people  The budget also cuts back on funds for the weatherization program  which enables low income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient
