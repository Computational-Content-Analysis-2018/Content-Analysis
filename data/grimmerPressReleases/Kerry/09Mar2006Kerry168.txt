Wednesday  U S  Senator Maria Cantwell  D WA   Minority Leader Harry Reid  D NV   Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Senators Joe Lieberman  D CT  and John Kerry  D MA   and 14 other senators made clear their deep opposition to any move to authorize drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge through the budget process          Last year the American people made it clear that they don   t want Congress to use backdoor tricks to implement any policy  let alone one that would destroy an irreplaceable natural treasure     said Cantwell      The profit rich oil industry doesn   t need another underhanded giveaway or another free pass on national environmental laws   American families deserve better   We need real solutions to our energy needs  not rehashed policy that continues our oil addiction and has been opposed by a majority of Americans time and time again   We stopped this shortsighted proposal last year  and I   ll fight for the same result this year            We should not allow another abuse of power by the Republican Congress to force through a special interest drilling provision into our nation   s budget     said Senate Minority Leader Reid      Drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge is not a solution to our nation   s dependence on foreign oil  will not make us stronger and does not belong in our nation   s budget   Democrats know that America can do better than an abusive end run around the rules of the Senate            The Senate remains deeply divided over this issue  and the Budget Committee should not include ANWR in its budget assumptions this year     said Senator Bingaman  Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources      Senate Democrats are acutely aware of the nation   s energy needs  and we support energy production where it can be done in an environmentally responsible manner   But most of us do not believe that oil and gas activities can be done in an environmentally responsible manner in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge   If the Senate ultimately decides to permit these activities in the Refuge  it should do so under regular order  so that it may give appropriate consideration to amendments and provide for necessary environmental protections           Big oil   s Republican allies are once again trying to hijack the budget to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge     said Senator Kerry      Just how many times will Democrats and many Republicans have to reject this bad idea before real energy security gets addressed in a serious way   ANWR has become the great white whale for some drill at all costs ideologues who refuse to acknowledge we can   t drill our way to energy independence  we have to invent our way there  It   s time to stop wasting the American people   s time with this giveaway to big oil and put some real energy solutions on the table for consideration            By using a budget resolution to open the Arctic Refuge wilderness to oil drilling  the Budget Committee mocks both Americans    bedrock environmental values and the Senate   s fundamental rules of full and fair debate in a single stroke     said Senator Lieberman      That the Republican majority can work its anti conservation will only by twisting the rules only goes to expose the hollowness of its agenda        In a letter Wednesday to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  R TN   the senators underscored their strong opposition to using this year   s budget resolution to authorize drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge          We are writing to voice our strong opposition to the inclusion in the Budget Resolution of assumed revenues and a reconciliation instruction for the Energy and Natural Resources Committee linked to opening the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing and development     the senators wrote      Should this language move forward to the floor of the Senate  we can assure you that every effort will be made to strike this reconciliation instruction        Last December  on the floor of the Senate  Cantwell and her colleagues successfully stopped legislation attached to a defense spending bill that would have given a green light to Arctic drilling   By leading the fight to keep Arctic drilling out of the 2006 Defense Department Appropriations Act  the senators stopped this attempt at legislative blackmail and kept the Senate playing by the rules   The Arctic drilling measures previously proposed by drilling proponents  in addition to authorizing drilling  would waive numerous existing environmental laws and regulations in order to clear the way for oil companies     Established by President Eisenhower in 1960  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is a diverse and fragile ecosystem   Proponents of drilling want to open up the most biologically diverse part of the Refuge  the coastal plain  to oil exploration
