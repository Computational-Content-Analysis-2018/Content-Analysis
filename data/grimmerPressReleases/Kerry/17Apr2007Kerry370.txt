day millions of Americans tax returns are due to the IRS  Senator John Kerry  D Mass   spoke on the floor of the Senate on the urgent need to fix the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT         The AMT  which was originally put into effect decades ago to ensure the wealthiest Americans were paying their share of the tax responsibility  now burdens more and more middle class families every year and threatens to affect over 20 million Americans next year        Earlier this year  Kerry sponsored legislation that will address the AMT for 2007 and repeal the lower tax rates on capital dividends for 2009 and 2010          Below are Kerry s remarks as prepared for delivery        Mr  President  as America prepared its taxes this year  millions of families in Massachusetts and across the country found an unpleasant surprise   Beyond their regular income taxes  families found another hidden income tax  the alternative minimum tax   that cost many of them thousands of dollars           Most taxpayers are accustomed to computing their income tax liability the usual way   adding up their income  making whatever deductions they re entitled to  subtracting exemptions for dependents   and checking their tax bracket to find out how much they owe           But this year  many of these same taxpayers discovered another tax that ate up any exemptions and deductions they might have claimed   a hidden income tax that affects all the wrong people and grows worse each year that we don t address it            A tax that made a great deal of sense when it was first enacted in 1969 has since become bloated and illogical   The tax was first put in place when Treasury Secretary Joseph Barr   during his one month as the shortest tenured treasury secretary in history   told Congress about 155 wealthy Americans who had paid no income tax in 1966   Congress was overwhelmed with mail expressing outrage that these 155 rich Americans weren t pulling their weight   In response  Congress passed the first version of the AMT          Urging tax reform  Barr coined the phrase   Taxpayers  revolt    and that s what we re likely to see unless we get this right   In 1970  20 000 taxpayers were affected by the alternative minimum tax   This year  about 4 million Americans will pay it   and next year that number could rise to 23 million         What was originally a small fix at the edge of our tax code has now ballooned into a massive inconvenience at the center of the tax code   Instead of serving their original purpose  these illogical  deceptive tax cuts are targeting the very people we re supposed to be helping   the middle class   and shifting the burden away from the wealthiest people the tax was designed to target          The AMT is poised to make a dramatic shift from the wealthy to the middle class   In 2006  taxpayers earning more than half a million dollars will pay 47  of the tax   By 2010  that number will drop to 16      Meanwhile  investment income is not impacted by the AMT  and the top AMT rate is lower than the top marginal tax rate   so a tax designed to apply to the rich has become a solidly middle class tax        This tax also punishes northeastern states like Massachusetts   In 2007  24  of Massachusetts taxpayers  up from about 5  last year   will be hit   That is the fourth most of any state in the country   We shouldn t be putting an undue burden on the middle class  and we shouldn t be putting one on Massachusetts and a small number of states  either        Worse still  the tax penalizes families with children because it eliminates any dependent exemptions   In 2007  the AMT will impact a family with four children and an income of  57 000  Married couples will be more than 12 times as likely as singles to face the AMT in 2010   We wrote these exemptions specifically to help families   do we really want to burden them with this tax           Even the President acknowledges that this is a failed policy   There is room for bipartisanship here   Congress and the President need to work together to address what has become a major structural problem in our tax code   I commend my colleague from Massachusetts  Richard Neal  for tackling this issue in the House   I look forward to seeing his proposal           In fixing this tax  there are two major pitfalls we should strive to avoid   The first is simply repealing this tax without paying for it   We just can t afford to do that   it s not fiscally responsible  and it doesn t really solve the problem          And second  we need a permanent solution   The AMT itself was originally a small fix for another tax issue   It s the accumulation over time of stopgap measures that has brought us to the current problem   We should not push this any further down the road          We also need to work to create simpler  more straightforward  and common sense tax policy    Our tax problem was made significantly worse by the Bush tax cuts   and the AMT was used to quietly tax more and more middle class families because in fact we couldn t really afford the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans           We can all agree that the main reason this tax has grown out of proportion is that it wasn t indexed to inflation   The same money went a lot further in 1970  when the movies cost  1 65   but we haven t adjusted the tax brackets to rise with inflation         Another major problem has been the AMT s interaction with the Bush tax cuts   This Administration and the Republican Congress purposely allowed our tax system become unbalanced to hide the true cost of the tax cuts     Normally  sound tax policy involves changing the alternative minimum tax to reflect changes in regular tax cuts   For example  in 1993 we raised rates for both taxes simultaneously   But under this President  in 2001  2003  and 2004  we cut the regular income tax rate without making significant corresponding changes in the AMT          Instead of paying up front through the regular income tax  this Administration used the AMT to finance tax cuts for the very people the AMT was designed to tax   The AMT quietly  takes back  a portion of the Bush tax cuts   by 2010  about 29    transferring the tax burden from the top tax brackets to largely middle class families          Before the Bush tax cuts  17 million taxpayers would have been affected by the AMT in 2010    with the Bush tax cuts  that number almost doubled to 31million  If we let the Bush tax cuts expire in 2011  the number of AMT taxpayers would drop dramatically          In 2007 a family with two children and an income of  80 000 will see 59  of their tax cut taken back by the AMT   As Tom Waits  the 1970s singer songwriter  once said   the large print giveth  and the small print taketh away    The small print  my friends  is the Alternative Minimum Tax  and it s erasing American families  tax savings         We should be honest about the costs of our tax cuts   Back in 2001  I proposed an amendment that exempted all taxpayers with incomes under  100 000 from the AMT   At that time  I warned that the AMT is encroaching on middle class tax payers   and that the tax cuts would only make things worse   That fix for the AMT problem was then estimated to cost  110 billion over ten years   money that is instead now being paid by middle class families   The amendment was revenue neutral   it offset the cost by delaying some of the Bush cuts  and cutting the 39 6  rate down to 37  instead of 35    Unfortunately  the amendment failed          I don t believe we should put this problem off any longer   for the sake of middle class families  we can t afford to   Unless we reform our tax system  we will pay for it one way or another   with debt passed onto our children or with taxes passed on from the wealthiest Americans to an ever growing slice of the middle class            We need a bipartisan  fiscally responsible  permanent approach   not one that masks the costs of irresponsible tax cuts or becomes a burden for the middle class   And not one that gives more and more families an unpleasant surprise on tax day
