could benefit millions of Americans    WASHINGTON D C    Today  Senator John Kerry  D Mass   spoke on the floor of the Senate in support of the Harkin legislation to fund live saving stem cell research      Kerry  a longtime supporter of stem cell research  today vowed to fight President Bush s promised veto and work with Senators across the aisle to solidify a veto proof majority for the bill      Below are Kerry s remarks as prepared for delivery      Mr  President  last summer  I spoke on the Senate floor accompanied by a summer intern from my office  a college student from Massachusetts named Beth Kolbe   Paralyzed from the chest down in a car accident when she was 14  Beth came to Washington  like so many young people each summer  to learn about government        But she also came to fight for the scientific research that holds untold promise for her  and for tens of millions of Americans   Beth wanted to be  as she put it a face that Senators can see so that they can see what they re voting for        The truth is  there are people like Beth in every community across America  who hope to benefit one day from life saving stem cell therapy   Grandparents with Parkinson s  soldiers back from Iraq  crippled by roadside bombs  children whodecades from nowwill suffer from a disease that stem cells could cure      Since we first heard about stem cell research several years ago  this country has taken a journey together   We ve discussed this  politicians and families alike   We ve debated it and learned more about the promise and the peril of stem cell research         At first  our natural reaction was to temper our excitement with a well founded fear that this technology posed insurmountable ethical hurdles   And the President himself deliberatedhe appointed a task force   He studied and debated the fine points with a team of bio ethicists  And he reached what he felt was a reasonable compromise      In August 2001  he announced to the American people that federal funds would only be used for research on a few lines of stem cells already harvested    Back then  he said  stem cells offer both great promise and great peril  so I have decided we must proceed with great care      And since then  America s understanding of this issue has evolved   We have learned that the lines available for research are far less useful than we had initially hoped   We have learned that this technology is just as promising as we dreamed it might be   And we have come to understand that embracing stem cell research does not condemn us to a slippery slope toward human cloning      Since the President s decision  stem cell research   funded by private sector and by stateshas gone ahead across this country   Slower than many of us might like in the absence of crucial federal funding   but fast enough to fill the pages of our major scientific journals with exciting new discoveries   And this research has taken place on a large enough scale  at our most important educational and research institutions  to assuage our worst fears        What  in the summer of 2001  might have seemed like well founded suspicion has proven overblown   As Newt Gingrich told me yesterday  after reversing himself and acknowledging that the threat posed by global warming is both real and direserious legislators change their stances over time        Just look at the Senate  Republicans like John McCain  former Majority Leader Bill Frist  and Orrin Hatch have looked carefully at the scientific facts and searched their own consciences  and they have reached the same conclusion  Opposing stem cell research is the opposite of a pro life policy        Last summer  63 SenatorsRepublicans and Democrats alikeand 235 House members voted in favor of a stem cell bill   That was a responsible bill  a consensus bill  designed specifically to address the concerns of lawmakers worried about bio ethics         It is difficult to get 63 Senators to agree on anything more controversial than mom and apple pieespecially on such a polarizing  emotionally charged issue   But we came together  hammered out our differences  and arrived at smart legislation that reflects our consensus and respects our conscience        And when we did so  we were confronted by a President whose promise to proceed with great carewhose commitment to deliberatehad calcified into a stubborn refusal to confront reality or to reengage a changing debate   America has evolved  but the President has stood still      And that is why  over an overwhelming bipartisan Senate majority  the President finally dusted off his veto pen and offered up the first andto date   only veto of his entire presidency   The President has signed good and bad bills alike  torture bills and pork  giveaways to oil companies and tax cuts for millionaires        But when it came to an emerging national consensus on an issue that brings hope to families across this country  the President chose to shut down the debate and block federal funding for scientific research      Make no mistake  this is a deeply personal issue for each of us in this chamber and for the President   I assume that President Bush made his decision about stem cell research over 6 years ago  he really did search his own heart and mind  just as all of us who care passionately about this issue have done        If he vetoes stem cell research yet again  it would send a message that this country no longer wants to be the global leader in scientific knowledge and discovery  And it would send a message to Americans suffering from Parkinson s  from spinal injuries  from countless ailments  that their well being is not the most important thing to us   We are telling these people that we could do more to cure you  but we won t   We are telling them that help is not on the way      The current policy is eroding our national advantage on stem cell research  and it is undermining the hopes and dreams of millions of Americans  We are tying our scientists  hands and holding back our doctors   We need a federal policy that builds on the advances being made in our states  in our universities  in our private foundations and research centers        This research is showing tremendous promise   In my home state of Massachusetts  some of the best scientists in the world are working at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at MIT and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute   We are still in the early stages of this line of research  but here is the kind of discovery we are already making  the Harvard Stem Cell Institute identified cells they call master cardiac stem cells  a single cell type that gives rise to the major cellular building blocks of the mammalian heart   That discovery rewrote the story of cardiac development and contributed a significant building block toward what could become revolutionary new treatments for heart disease        We re already seeing cures for diseases in our labs    At the Whitehead Institute  a leading stem cell researcher  Rudolf Jaenisch and his team used stem cell therapy to cure a mouse suffering from an immune deficiency disease   As you can see  the research is still in the early stagesand we shouldn t expect to see immediate resultsbut rest assured  today s breakthroughs in mice often become tomorrow s cures for humans         Now we can all hope that alternatives to embryonic research hold similar promise  but we can t wish away what our scientists are telling us  research on embryonic stem cells is incredibly promising  pivotal to this new field  and not easily sidestepped  Nobel prizewinners   past and most likely future   believe that this is the future of biology and medical science         People of good will and good sense can resolve these complicated ethical issues without stopping lifesaving research  This country has led the world in revolutionary discoveries  with our breakthroughs and our beliefs moving ahead together       Senate passage of this bill  with a veto proof majority   will put us on that path       Mr  President  we are giving this Administration yet another chance to consider a misjudgment with profound consequences   We are working to create a framework for ethical  federally funded research   Like the bill passed last summer  this legislation provides important ethical safeguards by extending federally funded research only to embryos that are      Donated by in vitro fertilization clinics   Created specifically for fertility treatment   In excess of treatment needs and would otherwise be discarded  and  Donated by treatment seeking individuals who provided written informed consent and were not offered financial inducements      In addition  the bill promotes other alternative methods of deriving stem cells too  without prejudging which ones will be most effective   The point here is clear   We should be clearing the way for all forms of responsible  ethical stem cell researchespecially those that scientists tell us are the most promising      What may not have been clear to us initially ought to be clear by now   It simply does not make sense to allow in vitro fertilization to create millions of embryos that will never become human beings and then prohibit science from using them to cure sick people and relieve human suffering        Valuing the mysteries and sacredness of human life underlying every religion on this planet   Stem cell advocates are no different   Here in the Senate and across this country  Americans are approaching an ethical consensus that bans human cloning while protecting stem cell research      But we do not have the luxury of patience    Not when 100 million Americans suffer from illnesses that might one day be cured away with stem cell therapy    Not when more than 3 000 Americans die from diseases every day that may one day be made treatable by stem cell research       Americans have been presented with a false choice between the sanctity of human life and the scientific knowledge that can save it  The President s veto rests on the false assumption that we have to choose between our dreams and our principles  We can have both  We can support our scientists  help the sick  and ensure that our legal and ethical boundaries continue to reflect our unshakable sense of human dignity and the value of human life  If we get votes from 67 out of 100 Senatorsfour more than we had last summerthen we can send the President a veto proof message       Last summer  the Senate sent the Administration a strong message by passing a bill that would responsibly fund stem cell research   And the American people showed their agreement last November when they sent an even bigger majority back to Washington to vote in ever greater numbers to support life saving scientific research   63 votes are not enough   We need a veto proof margin        We need to send a message to the President that the American people have decided to move forwardresponsibly but resolutelyon vital stem cell research
