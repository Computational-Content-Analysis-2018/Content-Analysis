       Releases                                                                                                                                           07 06 2005 SENATOR JOHN KERRY FIGHTS FOR MASSACHUSETTS BASES AT PUBLIC BRAC HEARING                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Mr  Chairman  members of the commission  your work   which is to provide an objective assessment of the Defense Department   s recommendations   is vital to the BRAC process   And I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss Massachusetts    bases with you       I won   t waste my limited moments here waxing nostalgic about the tradition of military service in Massachusetts and throughout New England   But it   s as old as the country itself  and we are proud of our military bases and we are proud of the men and women who serve on them   They are an important tie between communities and the nation   They live among us   Their children go to school with our children   No matter where they are from  they are our sons and daughters   We want them to stay       But the case for Massachusetts    bases is not founded on emotion or economic impact   It   s based on hard facts       The presentation we   ve just seen makes clear  Otis Air National Guard Base remains vital and relevant to the threats we face today   The Defense Department got it wrong in putting Otis on its list         Let me recap the main points    Otis    military value was not fully captured in the Defense Department   s calculations  particularly as it relates to Homeland Defense   The Air Force   s expected savings from closing Otis are over stated and ignore the other costs that the government will incur    And finally  the closure of Otis will gravely undermine the ability of other federal tenants   and there are 28 of them   on the base  including the United States Coast Guard  to perform their missions     Congress told the Department of Defense to consider impacts on other tenants  But DOD failed to do that  Closing Otis would significantly jeopardize the sustainability of U S  Coast Guard Station Cape Cod   Over the last two years  the Coast Guard has conducted 520 search and rescue operations from Otis   And for the Coast Guard  Otis    value is all about geography   Losing Otis puts U S  Coast Guard Station Cape Cod in serious jeopardy of loss or relocation   and that is not acceptable       But ignoring the Coast Guard   s Mission at Otis is part of a bigger problem  a general failure by the Air Force to factor Homeland Defense into its considerations   You saw the charts   You saw the routes used by international flights   You know that more than 400 of those flights every month are considered    Flights of Interest      And if you look at the location of Otis and its access to supersonic air space you can see  Otis Air National Guard Base is the best positioned air base to rapidly intercept threats at maximum range       The bottom line is simple  Otis Air National Guard Base should remain open   Its unique geographic location  access to unrestricted airspace  and its importance to other vital federal missions   including the operations of the Coast Guard   make it critical to the nation   s security       There are several other bases in Massachusetts that warrant our attention today  I would like to share some additional thoughts on a few in particular         Massachusetts and Connecticut have long held a common pride in the service of the 104th and 103rd Fighter Wings of the Air National Guard   Both Wings fly the A 10 Warthog   Barnes Air National Guard Base  home of the 104th  and Bradley International Airport  home of the 103rd   are just 12 miles apart  but there are significant differences between those bases   differences that make Barnes the right base for the future of the A 10 and its successor       We will provide additional details on the merits of Barnes to the commission in the days ahead  But in the mean time  let me just say  Barnes Air National Guard Base is very well suited to meet the operational needs of the warfighter   Its munitions storage facility currently stores War Reserve Materials for six other military units  including Connecticut   s 103rd Fighter Wing   At present  Barnes has significant reserve capacity for aviation and support requirements for everything from air to air missiles  high explosive rounds  hand grenades  and other munitions   Barnes Air National Guard Base has more than enough space for its current and future missions   According to the Air Force  Barnes is suitable for every transport aircraft in the U S  inventory   the C 141B  the C 5  the C 130  the C 17  the KC 10  the KC 135  and so forth   It also has the advantage of being able to deploy combat loaded aircraft or load and unload munitions from transport aircraft         In short  this is an exceptionally capable facility  well suited for current and future missions         Hanscom Air Force Base plays a vital role in building and maintaining America   s high tech air and space forces   Its unique location in the heart of the nation   s preeminent high technology cluster is a strategic asset  The Air Force recognized Hanscom   s unique value in seeking to consolidate some of its high tech research  development  and program management at the base       Hanscom is ready and able to welcome the influx of personnel and new missions the Air Force has planned for it   And so is Massachusetts   Our high tech workforce  our world class research institutions and universities  and our commercial investment in research and development make the Commonwealth well suited to support the high technology mission of Hanscom   The Milliken Institute has singled out Massachusetts for its excellence in these fields   In its 2004 ranking of states by science and technology  Massachusetts received a    dominant    first place ranking       Unfortunately  the Air Force wants to move two elements of the Air Force Research Laboratory  AFRL  from Hanscom  the Battlespace Environment Division of the Space Vehicles Directorate and the Electromagnetic Technology Division of the Sensors Directorate   Doing so would be a mistake   The unique synergy and collaboration that occurs every day between AFRL and the high tech community in and around Boston would be lost   Equally important  it is expected that of the 225 scientists and engineers who would be affected by relocating these missions  only about 10  would move   depriving the Air Force of one of its most vital assets   human capital       This type of expertise does not come easily and is sustained by the cluster of high technology companies  research universities  and professionals in the Boston area   If the professionals who run these programs and conduct this research refuse to move with their jobs  the impact on vital programs  including sensor fusion  automated target recognition  and space situational awareness   all vital components of future military capability   will be disrupted   Hanscom   and the high technology cluster around Boston   is the place for these missions       Here in Boston we also have a military organization with an unfortunate name  the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Boston Detachment   This is a self sustaining planning yard separate from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard   Their only association with Puget Sound is for administrative and accounting purposes   They provide engineering and design  logistics and planning support for the modernization and repair of U S  naval vessels   They are the only Naval Engineering Activity to win a public private competition in which the Navy recognized it could not afford to lose their expertise   Yet we still find them on the list for closure   There are legitimate doubts about the Navy   s calculation of military utility and cost savings that may be derived from the closure of the Boston Planning Yard   questions Congressman Lynch will examine in much greater detail   I urge you to give it the review it warrants       I also want to say something about the Pentagon   s recommendation to close Portsmouth Naval Shipyard   More than 100 Massachusetts residents work at Portsmouth   and the economic impact on my state is significant   But the case for Portsmouth goes beyond jobs and the economy   it   s about a national asset that  once lost  will be forever gone       In formulating its BRAC list  the Department of Defense had to make assumptions about the future nature of conflict and the future of naval force structure   That   s true of any planning exercise  but it   s particularly problematic in this instance since the Department of Defense is in the midst of the Quadrennial Defense Review  QDR    a review that will determine strategy  force structure  and organization for all the services   But without the benefit of the QDR   s conclusions  the Department of Defense was left to make assumptions about the future needs of facilities like Portsmouth Naval Shipyard   And their conclusions were flawed       Members of the commission have visited the shipyard   They know that it is a state of the art facility  honored for its quality workmanship and its efficiency   They know that it is a model for returning ships to the fleet on time and under budget   But the evidence suggests the Department of Defense failed to properly anticipate future requirements  the unique value of Portsmouth as a nuclear licensed shipyard  the expertise of its workforce  and the increasing reliance on submarines for a range of military missions   not just anti submarine warfare       Finally  I want to conclude with a request   Over the years  BRAC has taken more and more bases from the Northeast   a dangerous trend if you  like me  believe that our military must resemble the country it serves   Every time we lose a base in the Northeast  we lose that example of service   that tie to the nation   The bases we   ve discussed today stand on their own merit   But I hope you will also consider the damage done to the fabric of the nation every time a base is closed                                                                           20510
