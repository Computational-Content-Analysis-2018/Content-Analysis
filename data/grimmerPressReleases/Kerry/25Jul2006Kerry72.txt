Clarity From Maliki On Hezbollah  Iran  Situation in Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senator John Kerry sent a letter to President Bush this morning  asking that when Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki addresses Congress tomorrow  the Prime Minister be clear and candid about realities on the ground in Iraq and that he strongly condemn the use of terror anywhere in the world     including by Hezbollah against Israel   Below is the text of the letter       July 25  2006      The Honorable George W  Bush  The President  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  DC  20500      Dear Mr  President       As you know  Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki will be addressing a Joint Session of Congress tomorrow   I write in hopes that you will encourage Prime Minister Maliki to use this as an opportunity to address some important issues that are on the minds of many Americans          Members of Congress strongly support Prime Minister Maliki in his efforts to end the sectarian violence and bring stability to Iraq  and we share his hope for a better future for his country  I believe that addressing the following issues will only help to build confidence in his government as they embark on the difficult tasks ahead               1   Hezbollah and Iran   Many are very concerned about comments made by Prime Minister Maliki about the ongoing Israeli initiative against Hezbollah  a terrorist organization which started the current conflict by mounting an attack against Israel   Specifically  Prime Minister Maliki described the Israeli operations in Lebanon and Gaza as    criminal    and called    on the world to take quick stands to stop the Israeli aggression     This is in notable contrast to comments from other key regional powers  including Saudi Arabia  Egypt and Jordan  which criticized Hezbollah for    unexpected  inappropriate and irresponsible acts      Given that it is essential to send a clear message that terrorism is never acceptable  and that ending support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah by countries including Iran is key to winning the war on terror  Prime Minister Maliki should clarify that he condemns Hezbollah for its attack on Israel  and that he believes that Iran should not continue to provide weapons to Hezbollah            2   Civil War  Prime Minister Maliki acknowledged on Monday that approximately one hundred Iraqis were being killed every day in sectarian violence  yet he maintains that there is no civil war  in fact he said that    Civil war will not happen to Iraq     Many in Iraq and here in America believe that a civil war is already under way  and would appreciate hearing from Prime Minister Maliki what conditions he believes would rise to the level of a civil war  what exactly his plan is for ending the sectarian violence  and what role he envisions for U S  troops if the sectarian violence continues to get worse           3   U S  Forces in Iraq   Ambassador Khalilzad recently said that he and General Casey had been discussing with the Iraqi government the formation of a joint commission to outline terms and conditions for the withdrawal of U S  troops from Iraq  and that they planned to sit down with Prime Minister Maliki to establish this joint commission as soon as Ambassador Khalilzad returned to Iraq  When asked Monday how long he thought Iraq would need the assistance of foreign troops  Prime Minister Maliki said  It is definitely not decades  not even years     Prime Minister Maliki should provide an update on the status of negotiations with this joint commission  and give us his best estimate on when U S  troop withdrawals could begin  and when he expects this process to be complete    4  Militias  Prime Minister Maliki was quoted on Monday as saying that  We have reached an agreement in the government that we will have to confront them  the militias  and deal with them     Given the importance of disbanding these militias  Prime Minister Maliki should let us know exactly what this agreement is  what specifically his plan is for disbanding these militias  including whether it is part of his reconciliation plan  and state definitively that there will be no amnesty for Iraqis who kill U S  soldiers         Addressing these issues will help to ensure that the Prime Minister   s visit is as successful and productive as possible  Thank you for your attention to this request       Sincerely        John Kerry
