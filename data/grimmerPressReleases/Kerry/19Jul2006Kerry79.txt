John Kerry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The Internet can bring people a continent away together  It can empower Americans to spread their ideas and innovations across the globe  But the Internet also allows child pornographers to take advantage of speed and anonymity to exploit vulnerable young people and spread horrifying images across the Web       If you don t believe the Internet can cause such harm  all you have to do is listen to Masha s story  When she was just 5  Masha was adopted from a Russian orphanage by a man who began sexually abusing her the night she arrived  Today  after escaping the horrors of this abuse  Masha has come forward to tell her story and raise awareness so others are spared her unspeakable experiences       This courageous 13 year old has worked tirelessly to close loopholes in child pornography laws that allow predators to download pornographic images of children without significant penalties  All parents owe her a debt of gratitude       The Senate and House are drafting child exploitation legislation  and Masha s Law should be a critical component of any new bill passed       According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  child pornography has become a multibillion dollar Internet industry  and  worse still  the tools available to law enforcement are years behind the evolving technology used by child pornographers to escape detection       The real problem with child pornography is that it prolongs the child abuse indefinitely  long after the child is rescued  as Masha was  from the abusive home  Not only was Masha physically abused  but her adoptive father preserved that abuse to revisit himself and to share with the world  This despicable man is in jail but pedophiles spread his revolting photographs across the Web       For thousands who have suffered abuse as Masha has  the knowledge that such photographs are still out there is a nagging reminder of the horrors they have endured  a persistent source of hurt and shame  For criminals  it is a financial incentive to shatter more lives by creating and selling more exploitative photos       Adding civil penalties on top of prison sentences is an appropriate response to a crime whose wounds show up not only in the initial crime but also in the repeated trafficking of images that follows       That s why I wrote  Masha s Law   which I have introduced along with Sen  John Isakson  Georgia Republican  Our bill will triple civil penalties for anyone who downloads child pornography off the Internet  raising it from  50 000 to  150 000  If Masha s Law passes  the penalty for downloading child pornography will at least equal the penalty for illegally downloading a song from the Internet       Our bill will also fix a serious loophole in the existing law  Now  the law does not allow victims to receive damages once they become adults  even if their childhood images are still being downloaded  Our bill clarifies that victims over 18 can still sue for damages if those pictures remain in circulation  This common sense correction ensures child predators cannot rest easy once their victims turn 18   Masha and I stood side by side earlier this year as we introduced this important legislation at the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children       As a father  I am so proud of Masha for speaking out to protect other children  She has a maturity and strength that defies her years  She spoke directly about her own terrible experiences and her hope no other child should ever have to endure the same       We cannot undo the hurt Masha lives with every day  but we need to pursue every avenue of justice  We owe it to Masha and to every other child who has suffered from sexual abuse to do everything in our power to protect them  And we need to send a message to child pornographers that they will be punished severely       John F  Kerry  Massachusetts Democrat  is a member of the United States Senate                                                                            20510
