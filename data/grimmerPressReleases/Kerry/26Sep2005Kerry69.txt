to business leaders at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce  Senator John Kerry addressed America s ability to compete in the global economy   In his remarks  Senator Kerry emphasized that the current approach is only making the U S  more beholden to countries like China and Saudi Arabia without giving American businesses any advantage in the global race to success   Kerry laid out a national strategy that offers Americans building blocks    skills in science and math  affordable college education and a national research and development strategy    while removing road blocks to competitiveness like soaring energy and high health care costs         Senator Kerry s remarks as prepared for delivery follow   _________________________________________________________________________________      In the last weeks America has experienced the consequences of the failure to heed warning signs of impending or potential disaster   The nation has been painfully reminded of the price we pay   all of us   in lives and in dollars   for waiting too long to address critical challenges that are right before our eyes if we bother to look           Sometimes these warning signs are so big and bright and alarming that they just can t be ignored   I ll never forget as a teenager standing in a field in October of 1957 watching the first man made spacecraft streak across the night sky   The conquest  of course  was Soviet   and while not everyone got to see that unmanned craft pass overhead at 18 000 miles per hour that night   before long every American knew the name Sputnik   We knew we weren t competing hard enough   We knew we had been caught unprepared   And we knew that failure to maintain our supremacy in science and technology was not simply a blow to our pride and prosperity  it was a blow to our strength and security as a nation in a dangerous world         It was no accident that America s most immediate response to Sputnik was to enormously expand our national investment in higher education  with special attention to math and science   And it was no accident that the legislation taking this step was entitled the  National Defense Education Act          Today  we recognize Sputnik as the symbol of an awakening of our country to a new competitive challenge   And now  the question staring us in the eye is whether the number  9 11  and the name  Katrina  will be remembered the same way by future generations of Americans   In fact  we ve heard it said that 9 11  changed everything  for government   I think it s more accurate to say that it changed too little         The truth is we had warnings well before 9 11 that we were dangerously unprepared for terrorist attacks on our country  most notably in the report published by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman in 2000  Amazingly  Washington has yet to implement most of that report s top recommendations   We should not just be alarmed by that  we should be outraged   And as the chairman of the 9 11 Commission  former Governor Thomas Kean  recently noted  the federal response to Katrina showed we have yet to take the most basic steps to fix the problems that left us in the dark four years ago   Think about that   four years later   longer than it took to fight and win WWII   and the federal government is still not prepared       Katrina itself provided a vivid and painful reminder of all the unmet challenges our country faces  from protecting our people against terrorist attacks and natural disasters  to protecting the environment  from building a true partnership among different levels of government  to building the physical infrastructure that spurs economic growth and makes safety from wind and water possible  from achieving energy independence  to addressing entrenched poverty by offering hope of health care  jobs and housing to every citizen       Many of the ideas emanating from Washington about how to rebuild Louisiana and Mississippi show how ill equipped Washington truly is to rebuild America s competitive strength in a global economy as perilous and as ever changing as a Category 5 hurricane       And the current Administration s response to Katrina is a perfect microcosm of its response to our country s economic challenges  There really is no mistaking the pattern of willful negligence   When a crisis approaches  do the bare minimum  if that  When all hell breaks loose  shift the blame to others   When public action is needed  ignore fiscally responsible options and instead borrow lavishly from foreign creditors   the friendly bankers of Beijing and Riyadh   If innovative policies are called for  simply dust off every ideological gimmick you can find  vouchers  sub minimum wages   ownership  initiatives  corporate subsidies and wholesale abandonment of environmental regulations   And above all  don t forget the prime directive  the philosopher s stone  the alpha and omega  the answer to every question  never stop cutting taxes on the wealthiest individuals and the most powerful corporations  come hell or high water  in war as in peace  and in debt as well as in surplus         Well  here s the reality  America simply cannot calmly accept the course we re on without inviting devastating consequences   Just as there was no plan for Katrina  there really is no plan to make the United States more competitive in the global economy   Yet we are surrounded by flashing warning signs of failed economic leadership as clear and dramatic as Sputnik s appearance in the night sky         I think it s urgent that we put in place an economic strategy geared to the huge challenges to our competitiveness   Most of all  we need a clear understanding of government s role in fostering economic growth  spreading its benefits  managing its risks  and shaping the global economy we largely created   The effort to rebuild New Orleans cannot obscure the need to rebuild our country at the same time   We must retool our nation to prepare for the challenge we already face to maintain our position in the global economy   And this much is certain  America will not have national security without economic security       For America to prosper in a competitive 21st century global economy  Washington must at last meet two critical obligations  provide people the building blocks they need for a successful life  and remove the road blocks to our country competing   Today  we re not even close to prepared       Unfortunately  building blocks for too many people are disappearing or nonexistent  while more and more roadblocks to a competitive America are set up   The combination is lethal   It s government s job to help remove these roadblocks like high energy costs  failing schools  soaring health insurance premiums  unbalanced trade agreements  aging infrastructure and insufficient funding for innovation   But today  in every one of these areas  shortsighted policy in Washington holds us back as competitors leap ahead         How many times have you heard a public official say  it all starts with education  the building block to every child s future   Well  education in America is under funded by billions every year   And what we do spend could be used more wisely  Only half of every education dollar gets to the classroom in large school districts   We don t even crack the top 20 in math and science rankings  and our kids make about a quarter less progress in reading than other industrial nations         That s just not good enough  yet the barriers to a good education in America grow higher and higher   The cost of tuition and fees for a private four year public college have increased 35 percent in only four years   Not surprisingly  as those costs rise  loans have become the predominant form of financial aid  and that debt is just another hurdle to a kid considering a college degree  Washington isn t fixing that  it s making things worse by cutting student financial aid       Our international competitors have national plans to prepare their kids for the global economy   China produces more engineers than Japan  the U S  and Europe combined   In five years  time  China will produce more PhD s than the U S   You know something is wrong when American students can t even earn half the engineering spots at MIT         Firms are finding skilled talent overseas that will work just as hard for less   Foreign industry is on its way to capturing our competitive advantage   Believe me  our competitors have a plan   They re not racing us to the bottom  they re racing us to the top       When China and India are graduating tens of thousands more engineers and PhDs than we are  America needs to close the growing math and engineering skills gap between America and the rest of the world   We should support all girls math and science schools and special after school and summer programs that aim to get more girls and minorities engaged in math and science at an early age  We also should give colleges new financial incentives to increase the number of science  technology and math majors they graduate  and double the National Science Foundation s graduate scholarships in these fields       In the end  America must make college education affordable and accessible for every child willing to work for it   And America has to stop making a mockery of the words No Child Left Behind       But it s not enough just to educate our kids   That s only one of the building blocks   We need to put that education to work inventing a better future  Whether the cotton gin  the Model T or the silicon chip  America has always been built on innovation         Every one of us knows what innovation means to our economy   Fifty percent of U S  economic growth in the last half century is due to scientific breakthroughs and technological innovation   Most of our productivity comes from it   And yes  our competitors know this too  and they re catching up   Collectively  the world s fastest growing economies are on track to match our research and development investments   Yet  inexplicably  the Administration is set to cut basic research for the first time in a decade       Federal funding for fusion research at Princeton and MIT  for nuclear physics at our national labs and for much more is all slated for deep cuts   The Administration wants to cut the Manufacturing Extension Program  and even the Advanced Technology Program   In Massachusetts companies like Lexia Learning Systems  Tissue Engineering  and Kopin Corporation  now the number one exporter of LCD displays to Japan  have utilized these programs to create jobs and growth   These programs led to the invention of the digital mammogram   It make no sense to cut a partnership that creates high paying high tech jobs when we know Asia and the EU are implementing large scale  long range R projects aimed at developing leading edge commercial technologies        The bottom line is  a national budget should reflect your values and priorities  but the choices in our budget today have a dramatic negative impact on our nation s ability to innovate and compete   This moment is screaming for focus on skills training and technical education  We should ease access to loans  venture capital and R  We need trade that protects intellectual property and levels the playing field   We need a tax code that rewards investment in American production and American workers   And instead of more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans  we must make the long term investments that create wealth in America       Unfortunately  our poor commitment to R isn t the end of it   Washington creates another roadblock for American business by failing to invest in high tech infrastructure   The U S  has dropped from 4th to 16th in broadband Internet usage   The digital divide is still enormous  Our transportation infrastructure is aging   We ve spent more in Iraq this year than we ll spend on infrastructure for the next six years       Sadly  Washington is so shortsighted that it helps ideology become a roadblock to innovation and progress   If today s biology students in America don t do the groundbreaking stem cell research tomorrow  the biology students in Europe or Asia will  and they ll take the high paying jobs and commercial revenue with them       Another roadblock to a competitive America that s been staring us in the face for years is our dependence on foreign oil   Gas prices shot up 70 cents when Katrina slowed domestic production   Small businesses and farmers are suddenly forced to cope with 30  cost increases they never budgeted for   Some lose hard earned profits   Others have to lay off good people   The least fortunate go out of business altogether   And all of this was predicted   Imagine if something happened in Saudi Arabia and production was delayed not for days or weeks  but months or years       The list of other countries moving in a different direction   from Asia to Europe   is too long to recite   Even oil companies are acting  Chevron has declared the era of easy oil over and is touting conservation in their commercials   But Washington continues its blind obsession with oil  despite the inevitable economic repercussions   You can already see it in the automobile market  where we re losing the race on hybrid vehicles   The global market for hybrids by one estimate will be 4 5 million units by 2013  perhaps  65 billion in the U S   If we don t build them  someone else will  and they will take our market share and take our jobs        Today  Japan is far ahead of us   Toyota is rebuilding their production lines to market a new line of ten hybrid cars   No U S  auto maker is close   It s true that Ford has the Escape  but it s also true that Ford licenses it hybrid technology from Toyota   It comes down to this choice  do we want to invest in efficient domestic automobile production or buy foreign oil   Washington chooses more oil         It s long since time to put America on the path towards energy independence   We can create tens of thousands of jobs by focusing America s ingenuity on new technologies and alternative fuels   We need to create tax incentives that help automakers produce more fuel efficient cars  and reward the consumers who buy them  We must conserve energy and create clean  renewable sources of energy that no terrorist can sabotage and no foreign government can seize       Healthcare costs are another devastating roadblock for a competitive America   We know kids who see a doctor do better in the classroom   And the sad truth is that only because of Katrina  many children will get vaccinations for the first time and thousands of adults will see a doctor after going without a check up for years   Illnesses lingering long before Katrina will be treated by a healthcare system that just weeks ago was indifferent  and will soon be indifferent again  For the rest of the year this nation silently tolerates the injustice of 11 million children and over 30 million adults in desperate need of healthcare   Their plight is no less tragic   no less worthy of our compassion and attention       The stark reality for our economy is that by 2012  health care costs will account for 17 7  of our GDP and  expenditures will total  3 1 trillion   This is an incredible burden on our country   it amounts to a tax our competitors aren t paying   GM s health care costs now account for  1 400 per vehicle   Toyota recently put a major new plant in Canada  instead of the U S because of healthcare costs       The picture gets even bleaker for small businesses   Only 60 percent provide insurance   and that s a decline from 69 percent just a year before   I am working on a compromise bill with Republican Senator Olympia Snowe that will fundamentally reform the health care system for small businesses and give them access to a more affordable range of options to care for their employees   We are in the final stages of drafting our proposal and look forward to bringing it to the Senate floor in the coming months   Maybe we can get something done       And here in Massachusetts  the healthcare community is working hard with legislative leadership to address this issue   I applaud their efforts and urge you to complete this project soon   The benefits to our economy  and the example you can set for the nation  can be enormous       In fact  a reformed healthcare system can be a real opportunity for our economy   We should be the worldwide leader in health information technology  but we re not making the national investments necessary to make it happen   Health IT can save money and lives at home  and we can export our technology and expertise abroad for profit   But the president s budget invests just over  100 million in Health IT standards and development nationally   less funding than what one hospital system in Massachusetts spends all by itself       When you try to figure out why Washington is moving so slowly  or even backwards on competitiveness  the reasons are not so different from what we saw in New Orleans   What s missing is the urgency   the roll up your sleeves leadership   the sit at the table until you get it done decision making   the forward looking set of priorities         Washington has failed to realize the scope of the challenge we face   in this case the global economy   But the reality is that globalization is here to stay   We created it  and we must embrace it to realize the full benefit   Let there be no doubt  globalization has  in fact  been an astonishing success   Consumers across America enjoy lower prices   Our businesses have access to new markets   Nations who may have once turned to violence to compete now compete through trade and the talents of their own workforce         The door has been opened to more prosperity than America has ever known if we re willing to walk through   This shift isn t easy  but we shouldn t be distracted from the real opportunity   In just decades globalization will spawn over a billion new members of the global middle class   They will have extraordinary purchasing power  and they should be our customers   The people of China and India and Eastern Europe will finally be able to purchase the sophisticated  high quality products and services that American industry is known for   But to take advantage of this opportunity  and capture this business that will fuel another generation of prosperity  we have to embrace the full responsibility of globalization       One thing is certain  we can t wall ourselves off from the rest of the world   The French are building those walls and pursuing protectionist policies   And they re doing that because they can t compete   We re America   There is no one America can t compete with when we put our minds to it   The problem is that government is not competing as hard as you are  and in many cases actually makes it harder for you to compete   Washington s inattention to the road blocks and building blocks is costing every one of you       We have to acknowledge that there s something wrong when 22  of college freshmen require remedial math   When U S  students only outperformed Cyprus and South Africa in a major international mathematics competition   When American kids spend less time on homework than any of our competitors  do   And as Tom Friedman says  when in China Bill Gates is Brittany Spears   and in America Brittany Spears is   well   Brittany Spears       Washington still acts like our primary competition is with other Americans  Nothing could be more self defeating   The great risk is not jobs lost by South Dakota to South Carolina  but jobs lost to South Korea  To succeed    even just to compete    in this global economy we need a national economic innovation strategy to race against countries closing in on our heels   Otherwise  the truth is  we ll lose company after company   job after job   and we won t create the new jobs to replace them   That s why our nation cannot afford an achievement gap   That s why we can t afford for Americans to fall through the cracks of our education system  small businesses to be eaten alive by the cost explosion in our health care system  or companies to be strangled by other nations  superior commitment to research   We are all in this together  and Washington needs to start acting like it       This Administration and the Republicans who control Congress give in to special interests and rob future generations   Real leadership stands up to special interests and sets the course for future generations        For 225 years  America has been defined by our sense of limitless possibility   We ve always approached the future with imagination and daring  What other nation could dream of flight   and have two bicycle mechanics from Ohio make it happen   What other nation could put the first footprints on the moon and find a path to the stars   What other nation could set out to learn more about disease and illness   and then lead an international coalition to map every single gene in the human body        In this remarkable time for the world  I refuse to believe it s time to stop believing in the possibilities of our remarkable country  I refuse to accept the downsizing of the American Dream  I refuse to bet against American entrepreneurial spirit and American ingenuity        The competition s tough  and it requires us to be tougher   tough minded  never hard hearted        Some ask  how can we do it   My question is  how can we commit ourselves to anything less  Together  we can restore America s competitive edge   and together  we can win                                                                                        20510
