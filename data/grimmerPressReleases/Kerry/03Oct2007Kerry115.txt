Brave Burma Protestors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                WASHINGTON D C   Sen  John Kerry made the following statement today  during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Burmas Saffron Revolution  The hearing included witnesses from the State Department  Human Rights Watch  the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the U S  Campaign for Burma     Senator Kerrys Opening Statement  as prepared     The last few weeks weve witnessed firsthand the incredible courage of the Burmese people standing up against one of the worlds most repressive regimes  After years and years of oppression  what began a month ago as modest  impromptu protests mushroomed into a nation wide  peaceful democratic groundswell with tens of thousands of students joining Buddhist monks in what became the Saffron Revolution     Weve been here before  This is the second time in twenty years theres been blood shed on the streets of Burma in response to peaceful protest  The democratic uprisings of 1988 and the repression that followed show the horrible human toll of our collective failure to act  Back then  the United States and the world spoke out  and then lost focus  And so here we are again     The question  more important than why now  is whats next     Im glad the Senate has spoken by unanimously passing a bipartisan resolution that I introduced condemning the military crackdown  But we wont end the oppression in Burma  restore democracy  and honor these courageous protests just by resolutions expressing our disapproval  it takes a concerted policy  it takes a strategy  and most of all it takes focus and it demands ongoing pressure     So  the question that remains is whether the United States is serious about leading the world in making certain that the end of these protests marks only the beginning of a renewed effort to spur democratic reform in Burma  We must finish what the people of Burma have started by leading the international community in pressuring the military junta to release all political prisoners  starting with Aung San Suu Kyi  and take steps down the path towards political reform     The Presidents decision last week to target the top generals for financial sanctions sent an important message  but U S  sanctions alone are not enough  and they alone will not solve the problem     The United Nations mission to Burma  led by Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari  showed some promise  meeting with Than Shwe  the leader of the junta  and twice with Aung San Suu Kyi  But Ambassador Gambari has now left the country without any tangible signs of progress  I believe that the United Nations must reinforce its commitment to playing a meaningful role in moving the political dialogue forward  and the United States should be leading the effort to make that happen     We also need to demand a lot more from those countries that are best positioned to pressure the regime  China  India  Russia  and the ASEAN nations  The President and the United Nations must engage in strenuous diplomacy with Beijing  which carries the most sway with Burmas generals  and urge the Chinese to press for political reform    China has in its grasp a momentous opportunity to demonstrate leadership commensurate with its growing power and status  This is an important test  The world is watching  Yesterday  I joined a group of senators in what was a frank    and I believe productive    meeting with the Chinese Ambassador to convey this message     As the international community exerts greater pressure on the military junta  it must also reach out more aggressively with humanitarian assistance  Many of Burmas 52 million people live in abject misery  About one third are mired in poverty  Malaria and tuberculosis are widespread  and mortality rates in Burma are among the highest in Asia  At least 37 000 died of HIV AIDS in 2005  and over 600 000 are infected with HIV     The international community must respond to this ongoing tragedy by pressuring Burmas military junta to lift all restrictions on humanitarian aid delivery and then allow humanitarian aid groups to work to alleviate human suffering  The resilient and brave Burmese people have shown they are more than worthy of our support and compassion     A peaceful  pro democratic outcome in Burma is within reach  the UN  ASEAN  India  Russia  and especially China must stand with America in solidarity with the Burmese people  The people of Burma have risked their lives and endangered their safety to be free  and they have a chance to succeed  but only if the international community maintains its vigilance and stands with them in their hour of need
