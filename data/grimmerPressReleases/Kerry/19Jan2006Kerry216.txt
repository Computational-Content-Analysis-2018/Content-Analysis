John Kerry  D Mass   and Senator Barack Obama  D Ill    sent a letter to IRS Commissioner Everson asking that the Criminal Investigation Questionable Refund Program be temporarily suspended until questions are answered about the program and an assessment of the value of the program can be made  Earlier this month  the National Taxpayer Advocate Report to Congress hi    January 19  2006   The Honorable Mark W  Everson  Commissioner  Internal Revenue Service 1111 Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20224   Dear Commissioner Everson                On January 6  2006  National Taxpayer Advocate Nina E  Olson released the National Taxpayer Advocate Report to Congress   The report highlights 21 of the problems encountered by taxpayers   We are specifically concerned with the second problem  Criminal Investigation Refund Freezes  and its impact on the earned income tax credit  EITC    Under this program  the IRS is freezing the refunds of primarily low income taxpayers without giving the taxpayers notice or any opportunity to be heard                We support vigorous efforts to prevent tax fraud and abuse and to promote compliance with tax law   We are concerned that this program may not effectively promote compliance or reduce fraud  while potentially abrogating taxpayer rights   It is essential  that all IRS efforts to maintain tax compliance respect the basic tenets of our legal system   including due process                  The Advocate   s report describes how the IRS Criminal Investigation  CI   through its Questionable Refund Program  QRP   places a    freeze    on hundreds of thousands of refund claims each year   When fraud is suspected  any refund is immediately withheld   Unfortunately  taxpayers are not permitted an opportunity to make arguments supporting their claims or to provide the appropriate documentation   This is particularly serious since many of these taxpayers are poor                  In 2005  the Taxpayer Advocate Service  TAS  received more than 28 000 requests for assistance from taxpayers who had their refunds frozen   TAS studied a randomly selected sample of cases and looked at the ultimate disposition   The results showed that in 80 percent of these cases  the taxpayer was eligible for a full or partial refund  and in 66 percent of these cases there was no evidence of fraud  The median adjusted gross income of these taxpayers was  13 330  and the median refund was  3 519                  It is extremely disturbing that taxpayers who have done nothing wrong have had their refunds delayed without their knowledge   According to the report  most taxpayers who were ultimately eligible for a refund did not receive the refund for over eight months                Experiencing a lengthy delay in receiving a refund     in this program  typically 26 percent of a taxpayer   s annual income  using the numbers cited above   is especially detrimental to low income taxpayers   In more than 74 percent of the cases studied by TAS  taxpayers claimed the EITC   We are strong supporters of the EITC and believe it is a successful program that lifts more children out of poverty than any other government program                Certainly  there has been some noncompliance with the EITC  but most of this is due to error and not fraud   Steps have been taken to reduce the error rate  and the IRS should continue making improvements   These improvements should be carried out in the context of EITC compliance and outreach initiatives of which Congress has received regular reports  and the customary audit processes that protect taxpayers    basic rights   However  we believe that the EITC should be strengthened  and the IRS should not take any actions that weaken its benefits   Taxpayers who benefit from the EITC should not be singled out to have their refunds frozen                We are concerned that the revenue protection benefits of the program do not outweigh the hardship that taxpayers may incur   In the TAS sample  the IRS froze  1 552 574  and ultimately paid out  2 457 309  including over  81 000 in interest                  In order for us to evaluate the administration of this program and its effectiveness in reducing fraud and increasing compliance  we request the following information    1        Explain the role of the CI  the reason for its creation  and the goal of the QRP     2        Explain why CI has been involved in EITC cases and why the IRS Examination function does not make the determination of the validity of the claim for the EITC     3        Explain the rationale for targeting of EITC taxpayers by this program  given that EITC taxpayers already are over targeted for audit  constituting 48 percent of the individual tax returns audited in FY2004 though EITC returns were only 17 percent of the total filed   despite representing a very small portion of the tax gap    4        In addition to the EITC  a list of other specific programs or deductions that have resulted in refunds being frozen    5        For the last three fiscal years  a breakdown by income of the taxpayers that have had their refunds frozen   For each category  provide the number and percentage of taxpayers that ultimately received the full refund and the number and percentage of taxpayers that received a partial refund                  We request that you provide this information by February 1  2006   In addition  we recommend that the IRS temporarily suspend the QRP until the above questions are answered and an assessment of the value of the program can be made   Thank you    Sincerely  John Kerry Barack Obama                                                                                    20510
