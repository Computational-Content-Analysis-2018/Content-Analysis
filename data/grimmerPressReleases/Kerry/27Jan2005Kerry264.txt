                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  For the past two years  I experienced a special privilege of meeting those families every single day all across our country   good people who love their communities  love their country  and are determined to build a better life for their kids        What I saw and what they told me was moving and motivating  I ll never forget the single mother I met who lies awake worrying that her child s health care might cost more than she makes in a month  Moms and dads who save and save for their kids  college education  but still come up short when they get a bill for their elderly parents  health care that s higher than Medicare will pay        In Erie  Pennsylvania  I met a man named Albert Barker  He wonders how he ll pay thousands of dollars in medical bills  After he suffered a heart attack and underwent surgery  his employer stopped his health coverage just because it was too expensive  His wife said she just prays nothing else happens  The message is clear  In the United States of America  decent health care shouldn t be a faith based delivery service    that s wrong  and we can do better than that         In Council Bluffs  Iowa  I met a woman named Myrtle Walck    82 years old  she still volunteers at her neighborhood school    and she doesn t know what she ll do if the price of her medicine rises any higher  As it is  she pays a good chunk of her Social Security check   her only source of income   to the drugstore every month just to cover the cost of her two daily prescriptions  That s wrong  and we can do better than that        And in Jacksonville  Florida I met Renee Harris  who owned a school bus company that was in her family for over fifty years  But recently  she was forced to sell it because she could no longer afford to insure her workers or herself  That s wrong  and we can do better than that        In Canonsburg  Pennsylvania  I met Lori Shelton who said to me that every month she pays her families  bills    clothes  books  food  and doctor s bills   health insurance    and she said   Senator  I m tired of having to tell my children  no          I met people like Lori every day  and I ll never forget them  Their struggle didn t go away on November 2nd    the issue is as compelling today as it was every day of the campaign  and the mission is clear  we need to make something happen on health care  So today I want to ask you to stand up again and join me in a fight for a very simple proposition    that America can no longer afford to ignore the millions of children who aren t covered by health insurance      On Monday I introduced the Kids First Act of 2005  which would cover every one of the 11 million uninsured children in America  putting the force of law behind a commitment that so many Democrats and Republicans have supported in principle over the years  a commitment that this Congress and this administration have failed to redeem for far too long        Just think about it  nearly seven million of those 11 million kids are already eligible for coverage under the federal and state Medicaid and SCHIP programs  But they aren t getting the insurance we promised to them        That s wrong  and we break a fundamental promise to those children again and again each day we tolerate the status quo        The cost of our broken promises  the burden we place on families  on businesses  on communities  and on the states  also rises every day        You know the numbers  Health care costs are up 64   Drug co pays are up 50   Average family premiums are up  3500 a year  And the ranks of the uninsured went up by 5 million just last year  leaving 45 million Americans with no coverage at all  Increasingly   health care is out of reach for average Americans and those who get it struggle through a maze of maybe get covered  maybe get paid problems    I fought these last two years for a comprehensive health care plan that expanded coverage and lowered premiums  but Washington today is unwilling to tackle comprehensive health care reform  But we can sure begin where the cost of immediate action is low  and the cost of continued inaction is so very high  with our children        Today the President is in Ohio addressing health care but his effort is the same window dressing  avoidance of reality that we ve seen the last four years  Unfortunately  the White House plan for health care will actually make matters far worse  It will let insurance costs get higher  not lower  It will abandon still more families and kids to fend for themselves  It will force still more sick people out of cheap preventive care and into expensive critical care  with the rest of us footing the bill  And it will decisively repudiate the national responsibility to promote quality  affordable health care at a time when health care is unmistakably a national challenge        Pare back all the rhetoric  and the White House plan is this  let s not import less expensive drugs  Let s not negotiate better drug prices  Let s ignore the 45 million Americans without any health care coverage  Let s forget about patients  rights  Let s weaken coverage  Let s raise premiums with a phony small business health plan  Let s pretend the answer for families struggling to afford insurance is just another tax cut for the wealthy that leaves them behind  And while we re at it  let s dump the responsibility for covering low income families and their kids on the states  and let them take the heat for dumping them altogether  That s how the president who promised to usher in a  responsibility era  proposes to deal with a real and present health care crisis  even as he seeks to hype a phony crisis in Social Security  You know what that sounds like to me  Sounds like a cradle to grave irresponsibility plan    My Kids First proposal is meant to serve as the first step towards ending this irresponsibility era and keeping our promises  And when it comes to giving kids health care coverage  it s a promise we not only can afford to keep  but one we cannot afford to break        Covering all kids would reduce avoidable hospitalizations by an estimated 22 percent  Putting aside the unnecessary pain and tragedy we cause when we let illnesses develop and grow  covering kids means replacing expensive critical care with inexpensive preventive care  And the long term cost savings  not only in health care  but in education  in job training  in the stress on our families  are incalculable  We do know that children enrolled in public health insurance programs achieve a 68  improvement in measures of school performance  If no child is left behind in the doctor s waiting room  then we will have a much better chance of ensuring that no child is left behind in school        While our proposal most definitely reestablishes a national responsibility for children s health care  it also builds a strong partnership with the states  which are responsible for actually running our children   s  health care system  and most of all  with parents  who are fundamentally responsible for raising healthy kids        Instead of dumping the problem on cash strapped states with a severance check and best wishes for success  my proposal offers states a new bargain  the national government will give states significant immediate fiscal relief in exchange for a state commitment not only to cover all kids  but to aggressively make sure they get the coverage they re eligible for  That means cutting out the red tape and bureaucratic obstacles that are responsible for about two thirds of the gap between kids who are eligible and kids who actually get covered  And it is a net plus in dollars to cash strapped states        We propose a new bargain with parents as well  We will make it possible for them to use money set aside for children s health care to buy employer sponsored coverage where it s available  And we will also allow parents who don t normally qualify for public programs to buy coverage for their kids at cost  and to maintain current coverage at an affordable cost  Their side of the bargain is to take advantage of these tools to get their kids covered  and if they don t exercise this basic parental responsibility  they will not be able to claim the child tax credit on their federal tax returns  I don t think that s too much to ask   if we believe drivers have a responsibility to buy car insurance  surely we believe parents have a responsibility to buy health insurance for their kids        There s one other basic responsibility we accept in proposing this initiative  the responsibility to show how we will pay for it  even though we know the long term payoff for this investment will be enormous  In a proposal called  Kids First   I will not add a nickel to the enormous debt already being dumped on our kids by this administration  Their version of this initiative is  Kids Pay First         My proposal would finance the coverage expansion by asking something back from the least needy beneficiaries of Washington s big borrowing spree  individuals earning well over  300 000 per year  A portion of the Bush tax cuts benefiting these most fortunate citizens would be repealed  making the top rate a bit closer to the rate under which wealthy individuals did so spectacularly during the 1990s  Like all Americans  the wealthiest among us would benefit greatly from covering all kids  through less taxpayer financed uncompensated care and fewer state and local tax increases in the short run  and through stronger families and communities and a better educated and trained workforce in the long run  That s the value of shared responsibility    and that s a test of who really believes in the United States of America        And in a city where politicians like to use the word  values   insuring kids is a test of who just talks about family values and who really values families  In the Book of James we are taught   It is not enough  my brother to say you have faith when there are no deeds   Faith without works is dead   For me  that means having and holding to a vision of a society of the common good  where individual rights and freedoms are connected to our responsibility to others  It means understanding that the authentic role of leadership is to advance the good that can come to all of us  when we work together as one united community  That means health care for every child in America  and if anyone in Washington wants to have a debate about values  let s have at it  So here s my message to you and to all who will hear of this initiative through your voices in the days ahead  It s long since time to keep our promise to give every child a healthy start in life  We don t need to expand government  we simply need to fulfill commitments we have already made  We don t need more bureaucracy to cover all kids  we actually need less  We don t need Washington to do more than it should  we simply ask Washington to do its fair share in partnership with the states and with parents        What we offer here are new opportunities as bold and innovative as the latest medical breakthroughs  and what we call upon are mutual obligations as old and as unchanging as the Scriptures  The best way to create a genuine  responsibility era     a genuine commitment to families and to the values they reflect    is to begin with those to whom we owe the greatest responsibility    those whom we most value    our kids  Let s not just talk about it    let s put kids first
