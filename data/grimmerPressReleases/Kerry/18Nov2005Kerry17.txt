Responds To Sickening Attacks on Decorated Veteran Rep  Jack Murtha                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Today Senator John Kerry spoke on the floor of the U S  Senate   Kerry responded to Republican attacks on Congressman Jack Murtha                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Below are Senator Kerry   s remarks  as prepared          Mr  President  yesterday  Jack Murtha  a respected congressman on military matters  and former Marine Drill Sergeant and decorated Vietnam veteran  spoke out on our policy in Iraq   He didn   t come to that moment lightly   He spoke his mind and spoke his heart out of love for his country and support for our troops   I am not going to stand for a swift boat attack strategy against Jack Murtha          It disgusts me that a bunch of guys who have never put on the uniform of their country venomously turn their guns on a marine who served his country heroically in Vietnam and has been serving heroically in Congress ever since         No matter what J D  Hayworth says  there is no sterner stuff than the backbone and courage that defines Jack Murtha   s character and conscience           Dennis Hastert   the Speaker of the House who never served   called Jack Murtha a coward and accused him of wanting to cut and run   Well let me tell you  Jack Murtha wasn   t a coward when he put himself in harm   s way for his country in Vietnam and earned two purple hearts   he was a patriot then  and he is a patriot today  Jack Murtha didn   t cut and run when his courage in combat earned him a Bronze Star  and his voice should be heard  not silenced by those who still today cut and run from the truth        Just a day after Dick Cheney  who had 5 deferments from Vietnam  accused Democrats of being unpatriotic  the White House accused Jack Murtha of surrendering   Jack Murtha served 37 years in the Marine Corps   He doesn   t know how to surrender   not to enemy combatants  and not to politicians in Washington who say speaking his conscience is unpatriotic          Robert Kennedy once said     The sharpest criticism often goes hand in hand with the deepest idealism and love of country      Chuck Hagel showed he hasn   t forgotten that when he said     The Bush administration must understand that each American has a right to question our policies in Iraq and should not be demonized for disagreeing with them     But too many in the Republican Party forgot that long ago   They forgot that asking tough questions isn   t pessimism  it   s patriotism        We   ve seen the politics of fear and smear too many times   Whenever challenged  Republican leaders engage in the politics of personal destruction rather than debate the issues   It doesn   t matter who you are   When they did it to John McCain  we saw it doesn   t matter what political party you   re in   When they did it to Max Cleland  we saw it doesn   t matter if your service put you in a wheelchair   And when they did it to Jack Murtha yesterday  perhaps the most respected voice on military matters in all of Congress  we saw that this administration will go to any lengths to crush any dissent        Once again  they   re engaged in the lowest form of smear and fear politics because they   re afraid of actually debating a senior congressman who has advised presidents of both parties on how to best defend our country  They   re afraid to debate a decorated veteran who lives and breathes the concerns of our troops  not the empty slogans of an Administration that sent our brave troops to war without body armor  They   re terrified of actually leveling with the American people about the way they misled America into war   and admitting they have no clear plan to finish the job and get our troops home  Whether you agree with Jack Murtha   s policy or not is irrelevant         The truth is there is a better course for our troops and for America in Iraq and I am going to keep fighting until we take that course for the good of our country        American families who have lost  or who fear the loss  of their loved ones deserve to know the truth about what we have asked them to do  what we are doing to complete the mission  and what we are doing to prevent our forces from being trapped in an endless quagmire   Our military families understand that open debate about what   s going on in Iraq doesn   t put our troops at risk  it   s the only way to get it right in Iraq so we can get their sons and daughters home        I think all of us should be mindful  as the White House yet again engages in character assassination to prevent Americans from listening to the words of military experts  of the consequences we have already endured from the failure to listen         When the administration could have listened to General Shinseki and put in enough troops to maintain order  they chose not to  When they could have learned from George Herbert Walker Bush and built a genuine global coalition  they chose not to   When they could have implemented a detailed State Department plan for reconstructing post Saddam Iraq  they chose not to         When they could have protected American forces by guarding Saddam Hussein   s ammo dumps where there were weapons of individual destruction  they exposed our young men and women to the ammo that now maims and kills them because they chose not to act  When they could have imposed immediate order and structure in Baghdad after the fall of Saddam  Rumsfeld shrugged his shoulders  said Baghdad was safer than Washington  D C  and chose not to act  When the Administration could have kept an Iraqi army selectively intact  they chose not to  When they could have kept an entire civil structure functioning to deliver basic services to Iraqi citizens  they chose not to         When they could have accepted the offers of the United Nations and individual countries to provide on the ground peacekeepers and reconstruction assistance  they chose not to  When they should have leveled with the American people that the insurgency had grown  they chose not to  Vice President Cheney even absurdly claimed that the    insurgency was in its last throes            And now  after all these mistakes  who is the administration to accuse anyone of wanting to cut and run   We are in trouble today precisely because of a policy of cut and run  This administration made the wrong choice to cut and run from sound intelligence and good diplomacy  to cut and run from the best military advice  to cut and run from sensible war time planning  to cut and run from their responsibility to properly arm and protect our troops  to cut and run from history   s lessons about the Middle East  to cut and run from common sense  That is the debate they are afraid to have in our country  Shame on them        Instead of letting his cronies run their mouths  the President should finally find the courage to debate the real issue instead of destroying anyone who speaks truth to power as they see it  It   s time for Americans to stand up  fight back  and make it clear it   s unacceptable to do this to any leader of any party anywhere in our country          And I hope my colleagues will come down to this floor and debate the issue on its merits  instead of attacking the character of a man like Jack Murtha  because believe me   that   s a fight nobody   s going to win in our America
