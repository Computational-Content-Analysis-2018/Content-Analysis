Kerry  D Mass   and Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D Mass   along with twenty other Democratic Senators sent a letter to Majority Leader Frist urging him to allow a floor vote to fully fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   Kerry first introduced an amendment in October 2005 that would have allocated  3 1 billion of emergency funding to LIHEAP  bringing it to the level authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005  but the amendment was denied an up or down vote  Since October  Kerry and his colleagues in the Senate have continued to push for full funding of the program  but efforts have continually been blocked by procedural moves      Senator Kerry said     We   ve fought for months to get adequate funding for LIHEAP  a program that is essential to helping our families cope with skyrocketing home heating costs   Too many Americans this year are having to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table   It   s just plain wrong that the Republican Leadership is playing politics with the most basic needs for our families  and I   ll continue to fight for full funding until it becomes a reality        Senator Kennedy said     The Republican Congress has blocked numerous attempts at fully funding LIHEAP  Misplaced Republican priorities left us with a federal budget plagued with cuts to programs Americans depend on  I urge Congress to finally put their money where their mouth is and provide a total of  5 1 billion for LIHEAP   We   ve left families shivering in the cold for too long  we must act now and help the most vulnerable in our society make it through the winter        Below is a copy of the letter    January 25  2006     The Honorable William H  Frist                                       Majority Leader                                                                         United States Senate                                                                  Washington  DC 20510                                                      Dear Majority Leader Frist                 High energy prices are threatening the health and economic well being of low income households across the United States   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table for their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions or paying utility bills   Unfortunately  these stark choices are a reality for too many Americans across the nation   We strongly urge you to take immediate action to help low income Americans by bringing a measure to the floor that provides an additional  2 92 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   as supported by the majority of the Senate                 Since October 5  2005  the Senate has voted six times to increase LIHEAP funding to  5 1 billion   Bipartisan amendments offered to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill  the Transportation  Treasury and HUD Appropriations bill  the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill  and the Tax Reconciliation bill received a majority of the Senate   s support   Unfortunately  these amendments were not given the opportunity for a straight up or down vote   In December  63 Senators supported a successful motion to instruct  which directed the Budget Reconciliation Conference Committee to provide  2 92 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006   Yet  the conference report for the Budget Reconciliation bill includes only  1 billion  with this spending designated for FY 2007   Procedural maneuvers are preventing vital assistance from reaching Americans   These families and seniors deserve help from the federal government                 As you know  the Department of Defense  DoD  Appropriations Conference report originally provided an additional  2 billion for LIHEAP   The LIHEAP funding provided by the DoD conferees was designated as emergency funding   The emergency designation funding is warranted given the high cost of energy this winter  and the lack of growth in workers    wages   Unfortunately  other more controversial matters included in the conference report prevented the retention of the LIHEAP money in final action on that bill                   The Energy Information Agency forecasts that households heating with natural gas will experience an average increase of 35 percent over last winter   Households heating with oil will see an increase of 23 percent  and households using propane can expect an increase of 17 percent   In addition  wages are not keeping pace with inflation   The Real Earnings report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average hourly earnings of production and non supervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls were lower in December 2005 than they were a year ago  after accounting for inflation   Working families are continuing to lose ground  meaning more families also need LIHEAP assistance this year   Paychecks are being stretched thinner as families face higher prices for home heating  health care  and education                We respectfully request that you bring a measure to the Senate floor at the end of this month  or at the latest  early February  that funds LIHEAP at the  5 1 billion level supported by the Senate   We also urge that these resources be allocated in such a way that they will benefit all states and ensure they receive this necessary assistance promptly   American families and seniors have been waiting too long for relief from high energy costs   Thank you for your consideration for this essential request                                                                 Sincerely     Jack Reed Edward Kennedy John
