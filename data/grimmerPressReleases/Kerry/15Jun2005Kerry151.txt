Administration to Keep Massachusetts IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers Open that Help Elderly and Low Income Citizens

with the National Treasury Employees Union to fight to save four Massachusetts IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers slated for closing by the Bush Administration  The closures would negatively impact low income and elderly citizens                                                                                                                                                            Today  Senator Kerry wrote a letter to the President of the National Treasury Employees Union  NTEU   Colleen M  Kelley  in support of the IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers  The letter addresses President Bush   s decision to cut  134 million from Taxpayer Services and to close 68 of the IRS Centers across the United States  four in Massachusetts and one Boston call site  In 2004  the four Taxpayer Assistance Centers and Boston call site directly affected by the cut helped over 9 000 taxpayers file their returns       Big corporations can afford to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on lawyers and accountants at tax time  but working people are left on their own to navigate a tax code that s thousands of pages long  It s wrong to punish hardworking families and the elderly who will lose the opportunity to get tax law assistance if George Bush succeeds in closing IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers  It is essential that these centers remain open to maintain direct  personal connection between the government and people of Massachusetts   said Senator Kerry on the issue   The Boston call site and the IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers located in Fitchburg  Hyannis  Pittsfield  and Quincy are proposed to be cut  These centers offer walk in service to relieve tax inquiries  explain IRS notices  and organize reasonable payment plans  They also provide multilingual assistance    Below is a copy of the letter sent from Senator Kerry to the National President of the NTEU  Colleen M  Kelley   Colleen M  Kelley  National President  NTEU  1750 H St   NW  Washington  DC      Dear Ms  Kelley       I have been told that the National Treasury Employees Union is holding a rally in Boston this week to protest the closing of the Boston call site and related Taxpayer Assistance Centers  TACs  in Fitchburg  Hyannis  Pittsfield  and Quincy   I share your concerns about closing these centers and the resulting loss of a valuable service to the taxpayer   The President   s decision to cut  134 million from Taxpayer Service and close 68 assistance centers runs directly counter to the 1998 IRS Restructuring and Reform Act   s mandate that the IRS    place a greater emphasis on serving the public and meeting taxpayers    needs      It is yet another example of how this Administration   s priorities are not the priorities of the American people         The Boston Call Site provides necessary and effective service to taxpayers throughout the United States   It operates with 98 percent accuracy  an accuracy rate much higher than sites in other locations   It was the first to begin answering taxpayers    questions via e mail   The eighty two employees are experienced and well supported   They have an impressive record of answering tax questions from all parts of the country on even the most complex provisions of the tax code         The assistance centers in Massachusetts have an equally impressive record  and closing four of the nine located in Massachusetts will hurt our taxpayers   These facilities are the IRS   s frontlines in the battle to prevent costly retroactive tax collection by helping citizens file their tax forms correctly the first time   They help the elderly  low income  and non native English speaking customers who do not have access to high tech alternatives like the Internet   The four TACs which are scheduled to be closed in Massachusetts helped over 9 000 taxpayers file their 2004 tax returns       By closing these facilities  the Bush Administration sends a clear message that accessible taxpayer service is no longer a priority   Although the IRS claims that these actions will have little impact because taxpayers prefer to use the Internet or telephone  according to Ms  Nina Olson of the National Taxpayer Advocate  a recent Pew study found that a significant percentage of individuals prefer face to face service when seeking assistance from the government   Further  Mr  Russell George  Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration  has testified before the Finance Committee that he is    skeptical that the IRS has adequate data to assess the impact that closing these centers will have on customer service      Nor does he believe that taxpayers who currently use the centers will be able to contact the IRS through other methods   There is simply no substitute for the personal service afforded to them by center personnel       I have expressed my concerns about the closing of the Boston Call Site and four TACs to IRS Commissioner Everson   I have also written the Senate Appropriations Committee to express my opposition to the closing of theses centers and to request that these programs be adequately funded   I will continue to do whatever it takes to keep these valuable resources open and available to the people of Massachusetts       Sincerely   John F  Kerry                                                                            20510
