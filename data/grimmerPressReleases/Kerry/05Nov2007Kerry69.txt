on Pentagon to Ensure Quality Care for Returning Service Members with Eye Injuries

John Kerry  D MA   Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Pete Domenici  R NM  and Chuck Hagel  R NE  sent the following letter to the Assistant Defense Secretary for Health Affairs  Dr  S  Ward Casscells  calling on him to provide comprehensive information on eye injuries sustained by service members in Iraq and Afghanistan  According to the Presidents Commission on Care for Americas Returning Wounded Warriors  48 cases of blinded service members have been reported  while other estimates show that the total number of vision related complications exceeds 1 000  especially when vision impairment resulting from Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs  is considered  However  based on current available information  there is a lack of comprehensive eye injury data as well as questions about the accuracy of these numbers  In continuing efforts to provide the best available care for our wounded warriors  it is imperative that we have an accurate system of accounting for these eye injuries so there can be sufficient planning and treatment    In the letter  the senators ask the Pentagon to provide the total number of eye injuries sustained in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  an estimate of the total number of eye injuries sustained that did not result in a medical evacuation  the number of cases of TBIs that also contained a diagnosis of a vision impairment  the number of eye injuries that required surgery in military medical facilities  and the number of blinded service members referred for either outpatient or inpatient Department of Veterans Affairs Blind Rehabilitative Services or private agency rehabilitation    The best military medicine in the world is saving lives on the battlefield  but an antiquated health care system is failing our soldiers when they come home with complex eye and brain injuries  which are the hallmark wounds of this war  said Senator Kerry  Perfecting the science to treat these wounds means nothing without the planning and resources to get care to our soldiers at home  The military and veterans healthcare system must be capable of diagnosing  treating and providing rehabilitative services for those that need it most    The very least we owe our men and women in uniform is the best health care we can provide  said Senator Obama  Whether these heroes are suffering from eye injuries or traumatic brain injuries that can lead to vision impairment  we have a commitment to provide them with the highest quality medical care both in combat and once they return home  The fact is  the story of eye injuries in this war has gone largely untold  To fully care for our veterans  we need to have a comprehensive understanding of the number of veterans affected  and I hope we receive this information from the Pentagon in a timely and efficient way    It is important that we fully understand the extent to which eye injuries are being experienced by our men and women in uniform  Only then can we ensure that we are providing the necessary resources to help address the needs of our veterans  said Senator Pete Domenici    The text of the letter is below    The Honorable S  Ward Casscells  M D   Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs   1200 Defense Pentagon   Washington DC 20301 1200   Dear Dr  Casscells  We write to request information regarding the prevalence of eye injuries sustained by U S  military personnel serving

Administration is currently providing service connection disability for 230 OIF and OEF veterans who have been discharged with some vision injuries  And still other estimates show that the number of vision related complications exceeds 1 000     especially when the vision impairment resulting from Traumatic Brain Injuries is taken into account  Based on the information available to us  we have concerns about not only the lack of comprehensive data with respect to eye injuries  but the accuracy of these numbers    In our continuing efforts to provide the best available care for our wounded warriors  it is imperative that we have an accurate system of accounting for these eye injuries  If we do not understand the magnitude of the problem  it is impossible to properly plan for and invest in adequate treatment  It is for this reason that we respectfully request the following information for the period October 1  2002 through September 2007  broken down by quarter     The total number of eye injuries  force wide  sustained in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  including the total number of such injuries that resulted in a medical evacuation from theater   The Departments estimate of the total number of eye injuries sustained in combat but that did not result in a medical evacuation from theater      The number of cases of Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs  that also contained a diagnosis of a vision impairment or other vision dysfunction due to TBI injury      The number of eye injuries that required eye surgery in Army  Navy  or Air Force medical facilities  and     The number of blinded service members referred for either outpatient or inpatient Department of Veterans Affairs Blind Rehabilitative Services or private agency rehabilitation       We know you
