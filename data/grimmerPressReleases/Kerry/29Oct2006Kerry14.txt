       Releases                                                                                                                                           10 29 2006 The LiveStrong Summit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This weekend I had the incredible honor of heading down to Austin  TX to speak with cancer survivors and activists about my Personal Action Plan as a cancer survivor  and the plan of action we need to beat cancer as a nation  The LiveStrong Summit was created by one of my favorite inspiring all American heroes  Lance Armstrong       What can I say about Lance Armstrong       As a cycling fan  he   s given me some of the exhilarating and inspiring moments I   ve ever had watching his record setting performances time and time again         As a cancer survivor  he   s reminded all of us that beating this illness can give us courage to go beyond what we thought was possible   He   s reminded us of our special responsibility to speak out so others will be cured       And as a friend and biking partner  I   ve chased Lance up and down trails in Austin and across the world         Let me put it this way    in the fight against cancer and on the bike  it   s a full time job just trying to keep up with Lance   The Lance Armstrong Foundation has invested nearly  2 million into five survivorship centers across the country   It   s invested nearly  1 6 million into survivorship education and outreach initiatives with over 60 national and regional partnerships   And thanks to their advocacy work  they   ve helped increase the National Cancer Institute   s Office of Cancer Survivorship budget by 256  and the CDC Comprehensive Cancer Control budget by 383    That is a record to be proud of  and that is a record that saves lives       I also want to thank Lance for the tiny  yellow gift he gave our country off the bike   the gift of these yellow bracelets  I can   t tell you how many people on the campaign trail     in restaurants  in ropelines  in town hall meetings    in 2004 noticed my bracelet and pulled me close and pulled back their sleeve to show me they wore one too  Husbands who wore the bracelet for a wife battling ovarian cancer  Children who wore them for a parent  Big guys with their tears in their eyes who wore the bracelet because their father died of prostate cancer  but they beat it  Men who felt so lucky that they would live to see their grandchildren  men who knew they were lucky       That is my story in a lot of ways  but it   s not the biggest lesson I took away from my brush with cancer        It   s true    my father wasn   t as lucky  They caught his prostate cancer too late  He struggled a long time with it and we lost him in the summer of 2000   His struggle was a reminder to me why early testing was so important  and I was lucky to be married to the daughter of a doctor who was always reminded me     pushing me     she   d tell you nagging me     to get tested and to ask questions of my doctor  I   m glad she did       But the lesson I took away from beating prostate cancer was a little different  I got tested  I got diagnosed  I had surgery  and thank God I was cured  It all happened as I was starting to run for president  Like anyone else  that word    cancer    was jarring  But I got cured  It didn   t stop me from doing what I have spent most of my adult life doing     being an advocate        Cancer wasn   t my first brush with my own mortality  but it had the same crystallizing  focusing effect on me that I had as a young man when I saw so many of my best friends die too young in a war gone wrong  It made me angry  A lot of us who were lucky enough to come home from Vietnam in one piece did so with a saying     every day is extra     35 years ago  I used those extra days to stop that war  I took my anger and it gave me absolute certainty that I had a responsibility to stop others from getting killed       I have extra days after cancer as well     and again given a choice between being scared of cancer  or being philosophical about it  I   d rather just be pissed off at cancer     and use my anger to do what I do  be an advocate     and make things better for other people who weren   t as lucky as I was        What cancer did was open my eyes even more to what was going on around me     outside my own personal experience        I have a friend in Massachusetts named Tom Farrington  Tom and I are both lucky  We were cured  And once Tom got well  he started learning more and more   and a statistic that stays with me   and with Tom    who is African American   speaks volumes  African American men are 80  more likely to die of prostate cancer than white men  I started digging more  and discovered the unacceptable apartheid of health care in America  Black children five times more likely than white children to die of asthma  African Americans 70  more likely to have diabetes and 27  more likely to die from it  Just as the doctrine of  separate but equal   was wrong in education  it s wrong in health care  The quality of health care should never depend on the color of any American s skin        Then there   s my daughter Vanessa  I couldn t be more proud of her  She s in her final year of medical school  I ve seen her pack up and leave Massachusetts to study immunization in Ghana I ve visited her as she s worked in hospitals here at home  and we ve had more than our share of father daughter talks about the kind of public service she s chosen  We lost her mother     my former wife     to cancer this spring  It is tough to know that two daughters in their early thirties won   t have their mom there to turn to  It makes me almost feel like I don   t belong here on this stage talking about how I beat cancer when so many others have struggles with the disease that are like night and day compared to mine  But I think about Vanessa  and I think about her loss of her mother  and I also think about her compassion as a doctor for her patients     and I think  I do have a special responsibility to try and fix the health care system in which Vanessa is going to spend her life trying to help people  That I can do     and that we must all try to do together       And in those areas     finding a cure for cancer  making health care work for people     we have miles to go     and that   s a race where I   m going to really try my best to keep up with Lance Armstrong       Make no mistake  we   ve made progress  In 1971  fewer than half of all cancer patients lived five years beyond their diagnosis   Today  the 5 year survival rate is 64  for adults and 79  for kids 14 years and younger   In 1971  this country had 3 million cancer survivors when the National Cancer Act was established  now there are 10 million of us   The question is how those of us who are survivors will use our voices         I think we need to use our voices to end the doctrine of separate but equal in health care and in cancer treatment  Congressman Greg Meeks and I recently introduced a bill to fight the prostate cancer crisis in the African American community today  We   re urging Congress to provide the funds necessary  and to encourage African American men in particular to get screened   The goal of our resolution is to combat disparities between races in education and awareness and  ultimately  in health   Good luck to any politician who wants to come home to their district and explain it was more important to send your money on a bridge to nowhere or more giveaways for the oil companies than it was to make sure that no one in our country dies of cancer just because of the color of their skin  It is time to say no to the apartheid in cancer treatment in America        But that   s not all  Every one of us needs to challenge Washington   s lack of vision on cancer research and treatment  We can   t be content to ask whether we   re doing better when the American question has always been    are we doing enough            Just think  the science tells us that about one third of the 570 280 cancer deaths estimated in 2005 were related to nutrition  physical inactivity  and overweight obesity and therefore could also have been prevented  Are we doing enough        How many of the one million skin cancers that are expected to be diagnosed in 2005 could have been prevented by protection from the sun   s rays  Are we doing enough       Every day were finding links between environmental factors and cancers   Workers in oil refineries  rubber  and drug manufacturing facilities  and those who have high exposures to pesticides  are at higher risk for brain cancer  Exposure to radiation or to benzene and other gasoline related chemicals is known to cause leukemia  Other factors that have been associated with the disease in some studies include exposure to pesticides and to electromagnetic fields    radiation emitted by power lines and other electrical sources  And yet were moving backwards on the environment     moving backwards n workplace safety     moving backwards even on the protections we demand about knowing what chemicals we put into the air and water  Can anyone really say we   re doing all we can       Regular screening examinations by a health care professional can result in the prevention of cervical and colorectal cancers through the discovery and removal of precursor lesions        Screening can detect cancers of the breast  colon  rectum  cervix  prostate  oral cavity  and skin at early stages and when treatment is more likely to be successful  Cancers that can be prevented or detected earlier by screening account for about half of all new cancer cases   Are we doing all we can        The answer is no     of course not         When the President signs a bill for  31 million less for cancer research than the year before     the first hard cut since the passage of the National Cancer Act in 1971     something is wrong in Washington  And when the President announces his budget for 2007 that slashes an additional  40 million  it   s clear that we   ve got a Washingon that says one thing and does another         I know what people say  Are we spending lots of money on cancer research  You bet  But when federal funding is cut you know what happens  it deters young investigators  meaning fewer drugs for development and application in the future  It means other nations are increasing research funding  with the likelihood that some of the top investigators in the U S  will be drawn overseas  eroding our nation s competitive advantage in this field  When did you ever hear an American citizen write to their congressman and say    cut cancer funding     I want the United States to become a follower not a leader     This is crazy  folks         And this march backwards comes even as study after study reminds us that the declining death rates we celebrate come from research advances in the early diagnosis and treatment of tumors  So why aren   t we pushing the curve of discovery  We know we   ve made only marginal progress against the most intractable cancers  such as pancreatic  lung  and liver cancers  Why aren   t we committed to making beating them the next great cancer success story          And why are we tolerating a coarse political culture where Rush Limbaugh can sit comfortably on his backside in a radio studio and attack Michael J Fox for speaking out about stem cell research  We need to use our voices to applaud Michael J Fox  not attack him     and we need to ask why our country isn   t committed to finding the cures of tomorrow today    and that   s the fight to fund stem cell research that could one day lead to a cure for cancer          Can you imagine if someone had told me or Tom Farrington that twenty years earlier a bunch of politicians had blocked research that would have cured our father   s cancers and saved their lives   That could well be the future we   re looking at twenty years from now unless we embrace stem cell research and unleash its full potential         For each of us  and for millions of Americans  this is a personal issue  almost impossible to separate from our own experiences  I will never forget almost two years ago standing in the amphitheater in Denver  talking to people    many in wheelchairs  many who had lost loved ones to disease  and many who knew a cure wouldn   t come in time for them    who held out hope that stem cell research might save them  save a loved one  or save others        They wanted leadership  They wanted someone to fight for them back in Washington  and I promised them that I would  I will never forget the looks in their eyes  or the promise they were asking of leaders they placed their hope in        When I think about them  when I think about the people I met all over the country who were so personally invested in this issue  I   m even more deeply troubled to see that today we find ourselves in a place of division when we could have been united       I wrote to President Bush with a very simple message     Don   t Veto Hope      But after signing well over a thousand bills into law without raising his pen to veto a single one  he used the first and only veto of his Presidency to stop federal funding for stem cell research  I think that veto sent a message to all Americans that  on crucial issues  our differences are greater than our shared convictions  I think that veto told the world that America no longer wants to be the country that wants to be the world   s leader in scientific knowledge and discovery  That   s not the country that you and I and Lance Armstrong live in  and that   s not the way a President should lead         The stakes couldn   t be higher  More than 100 million Americans suffer from illnesses that might one day be cured away with stem cell therapy  Stem cells could replace damaged heart cells or cells destroyed by cancer  They could offer a new lease on life to those with a diagnosis that once came with a death sentence  Let me be very clear     curing cancer is the ultimate    pro life    policy       These are areas where we have a responsibility to lead  It   s personal to us  Let me tell you  Senators and Congressmen give themselves great health care  I woke up from my surgery in a hospital bed with doctors and nurses in one of our country   s greatest hospitals and they said    we got it all     Well  beating prostate cancer made me understand better than ever  it   s not just getting health care  it   s quality  affordable health care     for everyone  everywhere  guaranteed  now   That   s my    National Action Plan     I think health care for every American is just as important as any politician   s health care in Washington  D C       Here   s the bottom line  I don   t think I   m special that I beat cancer  I just think I   m lucky  Lucky that I had an early diagnosis and great care  But one of the things I   ve learned from fighting cancer   and I   ve only had it reinforced through my friendship with Lance   is the essential importance of fighting to spread the luck that I   ve had to as many people as possible   That   s the only way to truly beat cancer   to live as fully and as fearlessly as you possibly can   Not just to live as if you   d never had the cancer  but to live with the wisdom and resolve you gain from beating it       Survivorship isn   t just grace  or relief  its responsibility         And our responsibility today teaches me that it is immoral to see our great country slow down just as we   re hitting the home stretch in our race for the cure  and it is our responsibility to go out of here and make hone calls and knock on doors to make clear that we won   t let up for one instant until we   ve crossed the finish line and found one        So many times in the history of our country  we   ve dreamed of something  then made it a reality  Lance is a great example of that  Americans do the impossible very day  Daring and vision is written in the American DNA   We must never compromise on our determination to defeat cancer   in our labs  in our hospitals  and in our homes  regardless of race   and we will never give up on our dream to cure cancer until it   s a reality     that   s who we are  and that is who these little yellow bracelets remind us we must be again today  Let   s go out and make America America again     let   s find a cure  and let   s make it available to every American  Thank you and God Bess                                                                          20510
