                                                                                                            Senator Klobuchar  Crapo Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Increase Investment in Biodiesel Education                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  July 16  2007  Washington  D C    Today U S    D MN  and Senator Mike Crapo  R ID  introduced a bill to extend funding for the Biodiesel Education program for an additional five years  The 2002 Farm Bill provided  1 million per year  this new bill would increase the funding to  2 million annually    When it comes to renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel  its one thing for the government to give incentives to produce the fuel  but its another thing altogether to make sure the public knows what the fuel is  what its made from  and that it works in their car  said Senator Klobuchar  Thats why I support these crucial education programs    Senator Crapo said  In the face of rising gasoline prices and increasing calls for energy independence  people are looking for alternatives to conventional petroleum  When I visited the University of Idaho  one of the worlds leaders in biodiesel research  to receive a briefing on the outstanding work that the staff there is doing  it was indisputable that this technology is something that our country needs  The value of the Biodiesel Education Grant Program is that is helps people understand  from seed to gas tank  the benefits of biodiesel  including production practices  standards and fuel quality  and basic economics  so that they can make educated decisions about their fuel purchases    The Biodiesel Fuel Education Program was established as part of the energy title of the 2002 Farm Bill  The program provides educational funding to support increased fuel quality measures  increase acceptance of biodiesel by engine manufacturers  vehicle fleet operators  and the general public     Senator Klobuchar introduced similar legislation this year for ethanol education under the Ethanol Education and Awareness Act  That bill was modeled on the Biodiesel Education Program  Both initiatives are part of what Klobuchar has called for as a silver buckshot approach to reducing Americas dependence on foreign oil  These education programs are important in educating consumers and businesses about renewable  environmentally friendly energy     Senator Crapo has long been recognized for his efforts to promote alternative energy  particularly support for biodiesel and ethanol programs  As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  he has advocated successfully to include biodiesel and ethanol use in the 2002 Farm Bill and continues that push as the 2007 Farm Bill is being crafted  He also serves as a member of the Senate Renewables and Energy Efficiency Caucus    Biodiesel is the only alternative fuel to have fully completed the health effects testing requirements of the Clean Air Act  The use of biodiesel in a conventional diesel engine results in a substantial reduction of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide  Research also documents the fact that the ozone forming potential of the hydrocarbon emissions of pure biodiesel is nearly 50  less than that of petroleum fuel  Pure biodiesel does not contain sulfur and therefore reduces sulfur dioxide exhaust from diesel engines to virtually zero    Since its inception in 2002  this program has been vital in getting the word out to drivers about biodiesel and helping the industry grow  noted Klobuchar
