2007 Farm Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Senate passes bipartisan bill to improve vital programs for family farmers December 14  2007 Washington  D C   Today  U S   voted for the forward looking 2007 Farm Bill that passed the U S  Senate by a vote of 79 14  The bill includes a stronger safety net for Minnesota farmers and ranchers  permanent disaster relief and a groundbreaking energy title that includes several initiatives that Klobuchar authored and secured in the final bill  After visiting farmers all over our state  it is clear that they need this bill  said Klobuchar  This bipartisan effort builds on the success of the 2002 farm bill and strengthens the safety net for our Minnesota farmers  Klobuchar authored key initiatives in the Farm Bill that will invest in the next generation of renewable fuels  Included in the final bill is Klobuchars first of its kind provision to encourage American farmers to produce cellulosic crops  Klobuchar also secured a provision that will increase consumer access to renewable fuels  Agriculture Committee Chairman Harkin  D IA  recognized Sen  Klobuchars work on the historic energy provisions in the Farm Bill stating  There are several progressive elements of this farm bill  investments in renewable energy  conservation  nutrition and rural development in addition to a new income protection option for producers  said Sen  Harkin  Senator Klobuchar from the beginning advocated strong new incentives for farmers to produce energy crops and support for rural energy facilities and biorefineries in addition to common sense reform of farm payments  It was obvious she was listening to Minnesotans and carrying their message to the Senate  The cellulosic provision in the farm bill was modeled after Sen  Klobuchars Farm to Fuel Investment Act  which aims to reduce American dependence on foreign oil by providing transition assistance for farmers to grow dedicated energy crops  like switchgrass which can be grown on marginal land solely for the purpose of producing energy  Minnesota farmers have already completely changed the way we look at energy  and they will continue to be a key part of our nations energy policy  said Klobuchar  Investing in our farmers is essential for America to achieve energy independence  The farm bill also includes Klobuchars Ethanol Education and Expansion Act of 2007 to provide grants through the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to farmer owned ethanol producers to install additional E 85 pumps at rural gas stations as well as the equipment needed to sell E 85 directly to gas stations  This language will expand access to E 85 and ensure that more drivers across the country have access to home grown ethanol and the lower prices that come with it  My goal is to ensure hard working Americans arent spending all of their money at the pump while oil companies rake in profits  said Klobuchar  By dramatically increasing the availability of E 85  Americans will be able to choose domestically produced fuel  while helping farmers invest in homegrown renewable energy and reducing our dependence on foreign oil  The Agriculture committee also included Klobuchars amendment to increase funding for The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program  which will create opportunities for farmers and ranchers in developing markets like organic farming and energy production  The amendment will provide mentoring and outreach for new farmers  and training in business planning and credit building  the skills they need to succeed and stay on the land  The legislation will also increase funding for the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Individual Development Account  IDA  Pilot Program  This initiative will support matched savings accounts to help new farmers invest in land  buildings and equipment  and start building equity in farming operations  And because the timber industry is crucial to Minnesotas economy  the Senate Farm Bill also includes a vital provision addressing fluctuations in the lumber market that have put hundreds of Minnesota logging and lumber mill jobs at risk  This amendment grants more flexibility to the U S  Forest Service to adjust logging contracts in response to market downtowns and use a pricing index that more accurately reflects market conditions  The bipartisan bill includes many reforms to provisions Klobuchar sees as vital to improving Americas farm policy and investing in farmers  In addition to a strong energy title  the bill also includes long overdue permanent disaster assistance for farmers and strong conservation provisions  Permanent Disaster Assistance is particularly important to Minnesota and neighboring states that have seen droughts  flooding and other disasters in years  The provision will help family farmers with the financial fallout of natural disasters and bad weather  The Farm Bill also strengthens programs for dairy and sugarbeet producers  restoring the safety net for dairy farmers and protecting sugarbeet producers from a possible surge of imports in the coming years  The permanent disaster program means a great deal to our farmers and ranchers in the Midwest facing financial hardships  said Klobuchar  Our hardworking families shouldnt have to come to Congress with a tin cup when they are struggling to stay in business during severe cycles of drought and flooding  The Farm Bill increases funding for conservation programs by more than   4 billion to improve the effectiveness of programs that help Minnesotas environment and ensure that Minnesota farmers and ranchers will continue to have rich and productive farmland  The Senate also voted on Senator Klobuchars groundbreaking proposal to reform federal farm subsidies  The Klobuchar amendment won 48 votes  however  Senate rules require 60 votes for the amendment to become part of the larger farm bill  I knew this would be an uphill struggle  Klobuchar said  but it was worth the effort to make sure that we are spending the publics money wisely and that federal support is going to the nations hardworking farmers and not to urban millionaires
