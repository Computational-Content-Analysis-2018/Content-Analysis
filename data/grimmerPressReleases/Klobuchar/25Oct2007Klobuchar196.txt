                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Klobuchar delivers tribute to Paul and Sheila on floor of Senate on the anniversary of their death October 25  2007 Washington  D C     D MN  today spoke on the floor of the United States Senate to honor the life and career of Senator Paul Wellstone  along with his wife  Sheila  The Wellstones died five years ago today in a plane crash outside of Eveleth  Minnesota  Below is the text of Senator Klobuchar s speech as delivered  Mr  President  I wish to speak this morning to honor the memory of Paul and Sheila Wellstone  Today is exactly five years that they died in a plane crash just outside of Eveleth  Minnesota  a beautiful area of the state called the Iron Range where  in some ways  Paul Wellstone got his political start  Part of it was the farms in southern Minnesota where he stood up for our farmers when their farms were being foreclosed on  but part of it was the work he did with the iron ore miners  My grandfather was an iron ore miner working 1 500 feet under the ground in the mines of the Iron Range where Paul died  His daughter was killed and his long time staff members were killed  as well as the pilot and copilot of the small plane that carried all of them  On this day  five years later  the people of our state  the people of Minnesota  are remembering that crash and remembering Paul and Sheila  It s so hard to believe that it has been five years since we lost them  It feels both so long ago and not so long ago at all  Part of why it doesn t seem so long ago to me is because everywhere I go in this Capitol people remind me of Paul  When I say I m the Senator from Minnesota  they remember Paul  It s people like Ted Kennedy who worked with him on mental health issues  to the tram drivers like Darrell who for years and years and years has driven that tram from the Capitol to the Russell office building  When I said I was the new senator from Minnesota he said Paul Wellstone  he was the senator from Minnesota  The cops that guard the Capitol  they remember Paul  The secretaries in the offices  they remember Paul  And that s because he treated everyone with such dignity in this Capitol and such dignity in our state  That was Paul Wellstone  For me as for so many other Minnesotans  it is impossible to forget the moment that we first heard about the plane going down and then the wait to get the final news that there were no survivors  Paul and Sheila would be the first to tell us that we should not look back on what they accomplished and stood for  They would be the first to insist that our responsibility is to look ahead to the work that still must be done to carry their legacy forward  Although Paul and Sheila are no longer with us  we know their dreams and passions remain very much alive  I get my own special reminder every day    not just with the employees in the Capitol but also the flags from Paul s Senate office that are now in our Senate office  Every day it s a powerful reminder of me for Paul and all he tried to do here in Washington  During his lifetime as an educator  as an activist and as a United States Senator  Paul inspired people throughout Minnesota and throughout America  Even now  his work and his spirit continue to inspire people of all ages  from all walks of life  all across our country  who remember Paul for the fundamental values that he fought and struggled for  He was a voice for the voiceless  He and Sheila stood up for victims of domestic violence who were afraid to talk about it  or were afraid to go to court  They stood up for them and made this their life s passion  He brought power to the powerless  People like the iron miners in Minnesota  People like those farmers  whose homes  farms  are foreclosed on  He brought justice to those who suffered injustice  He brought opportunity to those who didn t have opportunity  You go to any Somali event in our state and they remember Paul  Some of them  the elders  can hardly speak English  but they can say Wellstone  I know that I will forever be humbled by the oath that I took to be the Senator from Minnesota  And I know that not I or anyone else can follow  truly  in Paul s footsteps  But he is an inspiration for us all  Paul is my friend and my mentor  He taught me how to campaign on city buses  We would get on    because this is when I first ran for office  Mr  President  when I ran for county attorney    we would get on a city bus and we would work the entire bus  We would meet everyone on that bus and we would get to the end of eight blocks we would say  We got to go  we are at our stop  and we would get on a bus going the next way  And we would go around and around and around for hours until we met everyone that had been on the buses on the mall in Minneapolis that afternoon  Paul Wellstone worked bus by bus  block by block  precinct by precinct to touch people in a way that made people believe  made people know  that involvement in politics could make a real difference in their lives  That was what he told those new immigrants  those new citizens  He told them that involvement in politics can make a difference in their lives  He did it not only by his words  but by how much he went out and touched them and was a part of their lives  He was crusader and a man with many passions  But anyone who ever met or talked with him quickly found out that he had a special passion for helping those  as Senator Reid mentioned  helping those with mental illness  That was shaped by the suffering by a member of his own family  Many of you may know Paul s story about his brother  Steven  As a young child  Paul watched his brother s traumatic dissent into mental illness  As a freshman in college he suffered a severe mental breakdown and spent the next two years in mental hospitals  Eventually he recovered and graduated from college with honors but it took his immigrant parents years to pay off the hospital bills  Writing about this  Paul recalled the years that his brother was hospitalized  For two years the house always seemed dark  even when the lights were on  It was such a sad home  Decades later  Paul knew there were far too many sad homes in our great nation  too many families devastated by the physical and financial consequences of mental illness  Paul knew that we can and we should do better  For years  he fought to allocate funding for better care  better services and better representation for the mentally ill and for years he fought for mental health parity in health insurance coverage  Finally  this year  at last  it looks like Paul s dream may finally come true  Just last month  the Senate unanimously voted in support of legislation that will guarantee equity for mental insurance  health insurance coverage  This will be a victory if we can get this passed and work with the House and get the strongest bill possible  This will be a victory for millions of Americans living with mental illness who face unfair discrimination in their access to affordable health care treatment  For Paul  this was always a matter of civil rights  of justice  and of basic human decency  And  of course  on this issue  as every other issue  Sheila and Paul were together  And they moved quickly  Paul and Sheila had so much energy and they were always on the move  They brought such enthusiasm and such joy to their work  They were animated  They were tireless  They were persistent in their fight against injustice  I had the opportunity to work closely with Sheila when I was the chief prosecutor for Hennepin County  She focused on domestic violence and instrumental in creating and funding the Hennepin County Domestic Abuse Center which I supervised during my eight years as county attorney  That center is a national and international model for serving victims of domestic violence by bringing together a full range of services and resources in one central location  Victims of domestic violence don t have to go through the red tape that would be even hard for a lawyer to figure out  There s a center where children can come and play  prosecutors  police  shelters    all located under one roof  Sheila knew the statistics on domestic violence and knew these kids were six times more likely to commit suicide  and 24 times more likely to commit sexual assault  They are 60 times more likely to exhibit delinquent behavior and most chilling of all  little boys who witness domestic violence  are 100 times more likely to become abusers themselves  Sheila knew these numbers  It was just a few weeks before the tragic crash that I saw Sheila and Paul  Sheila and I had been asked to speak to a group of new citizens  immigrants from Russia  And it was a very small group  I think there were about 50 people there  And we talked about our own immigrant experiences  She talked about her parents and growing up in Appalachia  and I talked about my Slovenian relatives coming over and making their way  saving money in a coffee can in the basement so that they could send my dad to college  And we were in the middle of these stories in this very small room  And all of a sudden in walked Paul  and he wasn t supposed to be there  He had gotten an early flight home from Washington  And he wasn t supposed to be there because he was just about a month out on one of the biggest elections for the United States Senate in the country  He had just voted  taken the brave vote  the courageous vote  to vote against the resolution on Iraq  He knew he was up for reelection  he knew it might cost him the election  But he did the right thing  And he came into that room where there s no press  no reporters  a few weeks before this election  At the time I thought  Why did he do this when he s got to be out there campaigning  And I knew then that there were two reasons that he did it  First is that he loved Sheila  and he wanted to surprise her and he wanted to be there by her side while she gave her speech and gave her remarks  But he was also there because he embraced the immigrant experience  He liked nothing more than talking about how you can come to this country with nothing and pull yourself up by your bootstraps  You can be a guy working 1 500 feet underground in the mines in Elie  Minnesota  and your granddaughter can be a United States Senator  You can be someone with mental illness like Paul s brother and grow up to get a college degree and be a teacher  You can be a victim of domestic violence and get your life back together and have a home for your kids  That s what Paul and Sheila stood for  That was their legacy  And today in our state of Minnesota and throughout this country and this Capitol  we think of them and what they stood for  and we pledge to work again to fill their legacy  Thank you  Mr  President  I yield the floor  And I note the absence of a quorum
