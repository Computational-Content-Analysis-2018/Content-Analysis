                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senator Convened Summit to Hear from Veterans Groups October 9  2007 St  Paul  MN Joined by a wide range of representatives from military and veterans groups  U S   convened a Minnesota Veterans Summit this morning at the State Capitol to focus on priorities for supporting the states veterans  The meeting was an opportunity to highlight new federal legislation and gather information from the veterans community about how best to meet their needs  whether by action at the grassroots community level or in the halls of Congress  Among those attending Klobuchars summit were General Larry Shellito  Adjutant General of the Minnesota National Guard  and Clark Dyrud  Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs  Our men and women in uniform have served our country on the front lines  said Klobuchar  But  on returning home  too many have found themselves shunted to the end of the line for the health care  benefits and support theyve earned  Klobuchar noted that the war in Iraq has placed an unprecedented burden on the National Guard and Reserves  Reservists and National Guard members have accounted for up to 40 percent of all U S  troops in Iraq  Nationally  almost a quarter of all Reserve and Guard members have had multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan  The excessive reliance on Guard and Reserve units means that it is a different kind of soldier serving on the front lines in Iraq and Afghanistan  Klobuchar said  In Vietnam  the average age of an American soldier was 19 years old  In Iraq and Afghanistan  the average age of active duty soldiers is 27  But the average age of National Guard members over there is 33  We need to cut through the red tape paralyzing the system and do anything and everything we can to make the climb back to normal life a little easier for these veterans and their families  At the summit  Klobuchar described legislation that Congress has already passed this year to increase funding for veterans services and to support returning National Guard members and Reservists  Klobuchar also outlined new Congressional legislation she is introducing that will make it easier for veterans to receive the educational benefits they are entitled to  make it easier for veterans families to get the mental health care services they need  and make it easier for veterans in rural communities to get access to health care and other services they have earned  Education Benefits  Last week  Klobuchar introduced the National Guard and Reserve Education Benefit Fairness Act to provide educational benefits to members of the Selected Reserve based on the length of their actual Active Duty service  not the service date printed on their orders  The bill comes as a direct response to the case of the Minnesota National Guard members of the 1 34th Brigade Combat Team  in which about half of the soldiers returning from a 16 month deployment in Iraq were denied full educational benefit packages  Mental Health  Klobuchar said she will introduce legislation this fall to require the Department of Defense to ensure that National Guard and Reserve family members have ready access to affordable mental heath services  This will include requiring the TRICARE system to reimburse family members for counseling and treatment at state accredited mental health facilities  rather than only those currently accredited by TRICARE  Rural Veterans  Klobuchar said she will introduce legislation this fall to mobilize the resources of the VA to go to rural communities and respond to veterans needs closer to where they live  This would include assistance to veterans in applying for eligible benefits  getting access to needed medication for chronic injuries and disabilities  and receiving mental health screenings and counseling  The summit featured two panel discussions  A panel on state and federal issues included  Dr  Robert Petzel  Director  Veterans Integrated Service Network Region 23  Duane Kamp  Outreach Coordinator  U S  Veterans Affairs Minnesota Regional Office  Al Loehr  Legislative Chair  Minnesota Veterans of Foreign Wars  and Jim Copher  Commander  Minnesota American Legion  A panel on grassroots community based solutions included  Colonel Eric Ahlness  Minnesota National Guard  Lt  Colonel Jim Swanson  Minnesota National Guard  Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve  ESGR  and Minnesota Military Appreciation Fund  MMAF   Barb Baker  Operation Happy Note  which sends free musical instruments to troops overseas   and Dennis Donovan  Warrior to Citizen Campaign  which promotes community efforts to welcome troops home
