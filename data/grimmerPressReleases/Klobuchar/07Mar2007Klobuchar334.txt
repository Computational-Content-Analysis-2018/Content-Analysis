Assistance and Health Care Support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                March 7  2007  Washington  D C   U S   today spoke in support of Minnesota s veterans  National Guard and Reserve forces and pushed for increased benefits for them  Veterans care will be a major focus in the Senate in the coming weeks as members debate President Bush s budget  Klobuchar said  Our veterans didn t stand in long waiting lines when they were called up or volunteered to serve our nation  So why are we asking them to stand in line now to get needed medical care       We need to do better  we can do better  and we know what needs to be done  Klobuchar outlined three major areas for improvement for veterans care  Increased funding for the Veterans Administration particularly for improvements to VA hospitals  more equitable assistance for National Guard and Reserve forces  and increased health care benefits and support for veterans  specifically for polytrauma and mental health disorders  Minnesota has one of the four VA system s polytrauma rehabilitation centers in the country   The full text of Klobuchar s Senate floor speech is below  Mr  President  I rise today to pay tribute to our brave soldiers fighting overseas  in particular the nearly 3 000 members of the National Guard who recently had their stays extended in Iraq  And I wish to speak about our duty to these soldiers for their sacrifices on behalf of our nation  It is an issue that must transcend partisanship  Whether you support the President s escalation or oppose it like I do  there s one thing that we can agree on   we must support the soldiers on the battlefield  and when they return home  we must give them all the support they need  In the past four years  American military service personnel and their families have endured challenges and stressful conditions that are unprecedented in recent history  including unrelenting operational demands and recurring deployments in combat zones  One and a half million American service men and women have served in Iraq and Afghanistan  These wars are creating a new generation of veterans who need their country to stand with them  Many of the soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan are doing it not only to serve their country  but also to provide for their families  One of these soldiers was Army Sergeant William B J  Beardsley who lived in Minnesota  Sergeant Beardsley joined the Army just after high school and completed one term of service  But when his wife  Stacy  encountered medical ailments  Sergeant Beardsley decided to re enlist  in part so that his health insurance would cover the treatment that Stacy required  His personal sacrifice to family and country allowed his wife to successfully undergo surgery  Tragically  the day Stacy left the hospital  Sergeant Beardsley was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq  I have always believed that when we ask our young men and women to fight and to die for this nation  we make a promise that we will give them all the resources they need to do their job  And when they return home  we will take care of them and their families  Sergeant Beardsley will not be coming home  but for too many of his fellow soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan who do return  our promise to take care of them has repeatedly been broken  As a nation  we have an obligation Mr  President to wrap our arms around the people who serve us  who have sacrificed for us  Today  our veterans need us more than ever  While the President pushes ahead with his  surge  of additional American troops into Iraq s civil war  here at home we are already experiencing a vastly larger  surge  of returning soldiers   many of them citizen soldiers from the National Guard and Reserves  More than three thousand have returned having made the ultimate sacrifice  leaving behind grieving families and communities  Tens of thousands have come home physically wounded  Tens of thousands more return suffering from post traumatic stress  depression and substance abuse as a result of their service  These are men and women who have served our country on the front lines  But  on returning home  too many have found themselves shunted to the end of the line   left waiting to get the health care they need  left waiting to receive the benefits they have earned  and  as the shocking revelations from Walter Reed show us  some have been left waiting in the most squalid of conditions  We are now learning that it is not isolated incident  In Minnesota  one of those left waiting was Jonathan Schulze  Jonathan   from Stewart  Minnesota   was a 25 year old Marine who had fought in Iraq and earned two Purple Hearts  He told his parents that 16 men in his unit had died in two days of battle  When he returned home in 2005  the war did not leave him  He suffered flashbacks and panic attacks  He started drinking heavily to stave off nightmares  According to VA Secretary Jim Nicholson  Jonathan was seen by the VA 46 times in Minneapolis and St  Cloud  Minnesota  But this was not enough  In January  this young war veteran hanged himself  And we now learn that the VA Medical Center in St  Cloud has just 15 acute in patient psychiatric beds   while  a decade ago  there were 198 beds  That means the number of acute psychiatric beds available for veterans there has declined more than 90 percent in the past decade  It s as if nobody even realized that we have been at war for the past four years  and that tens of thousands of Minnesotans have returned from combat   with many more to come  Our veterans didn t stand in long waiting lines when they were called up or volunteered to serve our nation  So why are we asking them to stand in line now to get needed medical care  As a former prosecutor  there s a saying that  justice delayed is justice denied   I would add that  for our veterans   health care delayed is health care denied   And that  too  is an injustice  We need to do better   much better  And we can  In fact  we know what needs to be done  Federal Funding First  we need to stop shortchanging our veterans during the budget process  Just as this administration sent our soldiers into battle without a plan for victory  it also failed to develop a plan to address their needs once they returned home  The administration shockingly underestimated the number of veterans who would require medical care  In its Fiscal Year 2005 budget request  the Department of Defense estimated that it would have to provide care for 23 500 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan  In reality  more than four times the number required assistance  Last year  the Pentagon underestimated the number of veterans seeking care by 87 000  The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the largest medical system in the nation  It has a reputation for high quality care  with many talented  dedicated doctors  nurses and other staff  But the VA s resources are now severely strained  The waiting lists and delays get longer  The shortages are especially severe in mental health care  Last year  the VA underestimated the number of new post traumatic cases by five times  For the past several years  this administration has submitted a budget request for the VA that significantly underfunded the needs of America s 25 million veterans  This is from the same administration that each year asks Congress to authorize tens of billions of dollars for projects in Iraq  I was pleased that the Continuing Resolution passed a few weeks ago increased funding for the VA by 3 5 billion dollars over Fiscal Year 2006 levels  However  this should be only the beginning of a renewed commitment to our servicemen and women  both on the front lines and on the home front  When the President s budget comes to this floor later this month  I will join my like minded colleagues in pressing for a substantial increase in VA funding  National Guard and Reserves Assistance Second  we need to start treating our National Guard and Reserves like the soldiers they are  Up to 40 percent of the troops fighting in Iraq have been National Guard members and Reservists  Minnesotans know all too well the burden that is being placed on our Guard forces  The National Guard was not built to serve as an active duty force for prolonged periods of time  Yet that s exactly what we are requiring them to do  Guard funding and benefits have not gone up correspondingly to match its increased duties  Meanwhile  the Pentagon is stripping Guard units of their equipment in order to make up for shortages in supply  States rely on the presence of a strong and well equipped Guard in order to respond to domestic emergencies  Department of Defense policies have weakened the Guard to the point that a recent commission found that 88 percent of Guard units in the United States cannot meet preparedness levels  It is time we recognize the elevated position and importance of the National Guard to our national security  As a member of the National Guard caucus  I support the National Guard Empowerment Act which will promote the commander of the National Guard to a four star general and make him a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  It will also grant the Guard more responsibility over coordinating federal and local agencies during emergencies  We must also upgrade Guard members from their perceived status as  second class veterans    in other areas including health care  pension plans  education and reintegration programs  We need to do a better job of integrating our returning veterans back into our community when they return  This is particularly hard for National Guard members when don t have a base to go to and have to go to literally thousands of communities and small towns across this country  In Minnesota  we are proud to have created the Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program which provides counseling and support to National Guard members and their families  Across my state  right now  the National Guard is sponsoring a unique series of Family Reintegration Academies  Several weeks ago  I had the honor of attending one of these academies in Alexandria  Minnesota  This pilot reintegration program has helped ease the transition for soldiers and their families  and it has gotten fabulous reviews from the participating families  What works in Minnesota can work in every state across the nation  As we enter this appropriations process  I will be working with my colleagues to insist that the federal dudget include funding for reintegration programs for Guard members and Reservists  Veterans  Healthcare Third  we need to improve the healthcare for all our soldiers  The problems found at Walter Reed are all too common at veterans  hospitals and centers nationwide  I have joined my colleagues in legislation that will begin to solve the personnel and building shortages at Walter Reed hospital and similar centers across the nation  I also will join the Democratic leadership in the Senate in their HEROES Plan to provide more oversight to veterans  affairs and develop legislation to address these problems  One of the most glaring needs in veterans  health care today is funding for research and treatment of polytraumatic injuries  As Bob Woodruff of ABC News showed us so vividly last week  with his own example and that of many wounded soldiers  brain trauma has become a signature injury of this war in Iraq  Minnesota is home to one of the VA system s four  polytrauma rehabilitation centers    The others are in Palo Alto  Richmond  and Tampa  These centers were created in recognition of the large number of service members sustaining multiple severe injuries as a result of explosions and blasts  These centers provide a full array of inpatient and outpatient services  with specialized programs for traumatic brain injury  spinal cord injury  blind rehabilitation and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  I have visited the VA brain trauma center in Minneapolis  We need more of these centers  and more research into the permanent effects of brain trauma caused by explosions on the battlefield  But our current VA infrastructure is not equipped to deal with these injuries and to care for brain injured vets once they leave these specialized centers and return home  This must be a priority  Another issue that is only beginning to receive sufficient attention is the proliferation of mental health disorders among veterans  According to a Veterans  Health Administration report  roughly one third of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who sought care through the VA were diagnosed with potential symptoms of post traumatic stress  drug abuse or other mental disorders  The Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act  introduced by my colleagues from Iowa  will help ensure 24 hour access to mental health care for veterans deemed at risk for suicide  And it will create VA programs to help veterans cope with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other mental illnesses that too often lead them to take their own lives  Nearly one thousand veterans receiving care from the VA commit suicide each year  It s too late for Jonathan Schulze  But it s not too late for the many other suffering soldiers who are at risk of suicide  In the coming weeks and months  I hope to engage my colleagues and cooperate on new legislation that will increase the funding and commitment to veterans  mental health services  In years past  veterans like my father could count on the fact that their government would stand by them  After World War II  our government  Mr  President  did just that  adopting the GI Bill to provide health  housing and educational benefits that gave returning veterans the help they needed to heal  to raise families and to prosper  At a time when we are spending billions on the reconstruction of Iraq  funding for health care for veterans is far below what s needed  Those are the wrong priorities for our country  We cannot abandon the brave soldiers who fought for us once they return  At his Second Inaugural  President Lincoln reminded the American people that  in war  we must strive  to bind up the nation s wounds  to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan   Today  Americans are again called to bind up our nation s wounds and to care for those who have borne the battle  as well as their families who have shouldered their own sacrifice  Let us live up to this solemn obligation to bring our troops home safely and to honor our returning soldiers and their families by giving them the care and benefits they have earned  Thank you  Mr  President  I yield the floor
