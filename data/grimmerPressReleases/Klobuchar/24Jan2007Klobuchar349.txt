                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              January 24  2007  Washington  D C   U S   today spoke on the U S  Senate floor discussing the need for an increase in the federal minimum wage  Klobuchar s speech as delivered is below  Mr  President  I am proud to rise today in support of the working men and women of this country  I am proud to speak for an idea whose time has long since come  our lowest paid workers   people who really help drive our economy   deserve a raise  And I will be proud to vote for a bill that gives them their raise   a bill that increases the minimum wage from  5 15 an hour to  7 25 an hour  This raise is years overdue  Right now  the purchasing power of the minimum wage is at its lowest level in more than half a century  since Dwight Eisenhower was president and Bill Haley and his Comets topped the charts Mr  President  The value of the current wage is 30 percent lower than it was 25 years ago  I know a little something about earning minimum wage  I ve had a number of minimum wage type jobs  As carhop  as highway worker  and as a pie cutter  If there are other pie cutters in the U S  Senate  I d like to meet them  Of course  I also was a waitress to help me pay for school  My career as a waitress came to an abrupt end  Mr  President  when I spilled 12 iced teas on one customer  that s when I decided to go to law school  But I can tell you that this job taught me how important it is for our leaders to look out for minimum wage workers  Today  nearly 15 million American workers   more than 10 percent of the workforce   are counting on us to help them get a fairer wage  Almost seven million of them would directly benefit because their hourly pay is below  7 25 an hour  Another eight million with wages slightly above this level would also get a needed boost  In my state  Minnesota  more than 200 000 people are waiting for Congress to do its job  Lifting the minimum wage is the fair thing to do  Working class families are getting left behind even as corporations see record profits and corporate executives and the super wealthy are making more and more money  If the minimum wage had increased at the same rate as the salary increase for CEOs  the rate would now be more than 23 dollars an hour  This is not just about the kids working at the local fast food places  although they certainly deserve a better deal too  80 percent of workers who would benefit from this bill are age 20 or older  More than half work full time  More than a third are their families  sole earners  The bill we are debating today provides real relief to these workers and their families  Even as the purchasing power of the minimum wage has gone down  costs for working families have gone up  and they are still rising  Health care costs in our state have gone up 60 percent in just the last six years for the premiums  College tuition at the University of Minnesota has gone up 80 percent in just the past seven years  It s getting tougher to afford a house and to go to school  Wherever I go in Minnesota  I see people struggling with the brutal combination of lower real wages and increasing costs  At the lunch counters  at the gas stations  in big cities and at county fairs  they talk about the need for some help  This is the time for us to give them that help  Lifting the minimum wage is also the principled thing to do  A raise means more than money to these working families  It sends a signal that we as a community value hard work and that we insist on a fair deal for all Americans  This is a signal that the old leadership in Washington failed to send  With this bipartisan bill  we can tell our workers what we stand up for the hardworking people of America  And lifting the minimum wage is the smart thing to do  It will decrease poverty  increase family buying power  and strengthen the consumer base in our communities  Some like to say that a minimum wage increase kills jobs  People have consistently made this argument when the minimum wage is debated  They have consistently been wrong  States that have raised their own minimum wages have not seen job losses  and many have actually outperformed the rest of the country in job creation  A raise won t only have positive economic effects  it will also have positive social effects  As a prosecutor  I saw firsthand how crime took over communities when people couldn t make ends meet  When people struggled  even after working hard  they often turned to drugs or violence or both  I learned how good jobs and fair wages can be the best crime fighting tool  Lifting the minimum wage is the fair  principled  and smart thing to do across the board  But it will also have a particularly powerful effect on women  Women make up less than half of the workforce  but they make up roughly 60 percent of those who will directly gain from this raise  More than 40 percent of these working women have full time jobs  Three million working mothers will see a benefit from this legislation  including hundreds of thousands of single moms  Many of these women work in demanding retail jobs   waitresses  store clerks  hotel maids   where they are on their feet or running around all day  Despite their hard work  they have an almost impossible time making ends meet  They struggle to afford health care or tuition for their kids  or even basics like gas and groceries  I am in awe of these women  I am a working mother and wife  and I have worked at minimum wage  but I have never had to do both at the same time  Today  we can do something for them  The challenges of working in the hospitality industry raises the final issue that I d like to talk about today   the so called tip credit  Under current federal law  tipped employees   including waitresses  bellhops  and maids   are entitled to a federal minimum wage of only  2 13 an hour  They have to make up the difference between  2 13 and the real minimum wage with their tips  States have always been allowed to change this rule  My state  Minnesota  like several other states  has done just that  The people of Minnesota decided that tipped workers should receive the same minimum wage as all other workers  That is now the law of Minnesota and six other states  Tipped workers earn the state minimum wage and pay taxes on both their wages and their tips  Last year  the old Congress tried to take away Minnesota s right to enforce this law  The minimum wage bill proposed back then would have preempted state law and would have caused Minnesota tipped workers  wages to immediately fall by about four dollars per hour  Thankfully  this provision did not become law  But unfortunately  some people in Congress have talked about trying it again this year  They are seeking to pass a provision that limits Minnesota s future right to fix a fair wage for tipped workers  They think Washington knows better than the people of Minnesota what our state s wage policy should be  I oppose these efforts  For one thing  the people of Minnesota had good reasons when they eliminated the tip penalty  They saw that tips are uncertain income  given at the discretion of the consumer  They recognized the hard work and long hours that tipped employees put in  They determined that customers give tips to reward service  not to directly pay the wages of the people who serve them  And they wanted the state wage law to reflect these facts  The people of Minnesota know about women like Marie Hanson of Rochester  I ve spoken with Marie  and her story is the best argument I can think of for making sure our tipped workers get fair wages  Marie has been a waitress at the Kahler Grand Grill in Rochester for many years  She s put two kids through school on her waitress salary  and now she is looking to save for her own retirement  If her wages are cut  or if she had been paid lower wages these past few years  her already difficult task of raising kids and making ends meet would have become impossible  For too long  Congress has favored corporations and billionaires who stash money in tax havens in the Cayman Islands  Now it s time for Congress to pay attention to women like Marie Hanson  Against this backdrop  Washington should not undo the will of the people of Minnesota  States have always had the sovereign right to set their own wage policy  above a federal floor  And for good reason  We all know that states understand the unique conditions and challenges they face in a way that Washington never can  And many states  including my state  have crafted their own minimum wage laws that are stronger and fairer than the current federal law  That is how it should be  If we take away Minnesota s right to determine wages for tipped workers  what s next  Will the people who are pushing this proposal next seek to stop states from setting their own  higher minimum wages  Will they subvert the will of the people in more than 25 states that have stronger laws than the federal law  People who would require Minnesota and like states to impose a tip penalty say that they are doing it to help small businesses in these states compete against small businesses in neighboring states  But the exact same argument can be made in support of a federal law forbidding all states from setting higher minimum wages  Is that the next step  I don t think so  As someone who visited all 87 counties in Minnesota last year  I understand very well the importance of small businesses to our communities  I want to make sure that small businesses remain a vibrant driver of our economy  And I know that the tip penalty concerns of small businesses in Minnesota  especially those in towns bordering other states  are real  And they shouldn t be ignored  But they are not best resolved here   they are best resolved much closer to home  in the state capital  Washington cannot possibly understand  let alone balance  all of the competing concerns that arise in this aspect of state wage policy  Saint Paul  Minnesota can  That is how it has always worked  and it should continue to work this way  This is not to say that there aren t small business issues common to all states that this Congress can address  I ve talked to small business owners in Rochester and Duluth and Willmar about the challenges they face  including higher health care costs  I see the value of giving some relief and some incentives to small businesses trying to thrive  But Congress shouldn t stop states from protecting tipped workers  With all of this in mind  Mr  President  I urge this chamber to fight for the working families  and especially the working women  of this country  And I urge this chamber to pass a long overdue minimum wage increase that does not deny or limit states  historical rights to pursue their own wage policy  Thank you very much
