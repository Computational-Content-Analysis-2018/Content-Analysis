                                                                                                          January 14  2008 Maple Grove  MN  In front of a new 150 foot wind energy turbine at the new headquarters of Great River Energy  Minnesotas second largest electric utility  U S   announced that she is introducing major new federal legislation to promote further development of wind power and other renewable energy sources in Minnesota and nationwide  Klobuchar also emphasized that the legislation would create new opportunities for economic growth  with clean technology businesses and green collar jobs  As we rightfully debate the details of an economic stimulus package in the coming weeks  Klobuchar said  we must also focus on long term policies to spur economic growth and jobs  While I support middle class tax relief  we also need policies to promote job growth and a stronger economy for the long term  This package of renewable energy incentives does that  When the Senate reconvenes later this month  Klobuchar said she will introduce the American Renewable Energy Act  The legislation includes two key provisions  First  it will create strong  consistent incentives for private sector investment in renewable energy by extending the federal Production Tax Credit for five years  It is otherwise set to expire at the end of 2008  The Production Tax Credit applies to electricity generated from certain renewable energy sources  including wind and solar  To pay for the additional renewable energy tax credit  Klobuchars legislation would rollback several tax giveaways to major oil companies  A second key provision of the legislation will establish an aggressive  nationwide standard that requires utility companies to produce at least 25 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by the year 2025  This 25 x 25 national standard would be similar to the Minnesota renewable electricity standard passed by the state legislature last year and signed into law by the Governor   The combination of a nationwide renewable electricity standard and a strong package of tax incentives will promote new jobs and business opportunities while also moving our nation onto a cleaner  more secure energy path  said Klobuchar  Minnesota is already a leader in the renewable energy revolution thats just beginning to emerge  As this revolution advances  I want our state to stay a leader   Industry leaders praised Klobuchars legislation   David Sparby  the President of Northern States Power Company  an Xcel energy affiliate commented stating  The Minnesota congressional delegation has always been among those leading the way to ensure the development of clean energy sources  We applaud Senator Klobuchar for continuing that tradition with this newest initiative   This legislation is about jumpstarting our economy with green collar jobs   green for the environment  and green for the money theres to be made in remaking our energy economy with efficiency and renewables  said Michael Noble  Executive Director with FRESH Energy   Senator Klobuchars legislation will be the most important job creating legislation heard by this session of Congress  said Dave Foster  Executive Director of the Blue Green Alliance  It has the potential to revitalize American manufacturing and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs   Lisa Jacobson  Executive Director of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy  praised Klobuchars proposal stating  Passage of a comprehensive set of policies to accelerate renewable energy now is essential to making a down payment on greenhouse gas reduction  alleviating our energy security challenges and creating new high quality clean tech jobs in the US  The Council applauds Senator Klobuchar for leading this urgent effort   Gregory Wetstone  Senior Director of Governmental and Public Affairs for the American Wind Energy Association  commented  Senator Klobuchars American Renewable Energy Act includes key policies that will increase wind energy production in the United States  In doing so  her bill will mean more American jobs and economic growth  improved energy security  and a cleaner environment  AWEA and our 1 200 member companies applaud her for her vision and leadership
