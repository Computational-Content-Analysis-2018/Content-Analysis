the letter is below  December 6  2007 Stephen L  Johnson   Administrator  United States Environmental Protection Agency  Ariel Rios Building  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  DC 20460 Dear Administrator Johnson  As you know  U S  Environmental Protection Agency Region 5 in coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency  Minnesota Department of Health  and the City of St  Louis Park has begun a study to determine the extent of  and any potential risks from  underground chemical vapors in St  Louis Park  MN  I am pleased that the EPA has already begun to take action to investigate this matter and appreciate the early reports my staff has received from the city about your staffs efforts to coordinate your work  Such early cooperation is commendable and necessary to build a strong working relationship  As I have learned in other areas requiring major Federal State Local partnership  sustained  transparent  pro active engagement with the public about solutions is a critical ingredient in maintaining public confidence  I also wish to commend you on participating in the public meetings set for December 13th and 15th  They will no doubt go a long way toward providing the community with an understanding of how seriously the EPA addresses this mater  My staff will be in attendance at those meetings should you wish to discuss anything with them in person  At this point it is my understanding that the study was prompted by the discovery of Volatile Organic Compounds  VOCs  earlier this year in ground water and soil samples in the area of Highway 7 and Wooddale Avenue in Saint Louis Park  While not yet found in the city drinking water  the presence of these VOCs in the area has generated a reasonable concern in the community  Included in the hundreds of structures in the search area are homes  schools  apartment buildings  businesses  daycare facilities  and religious centers of all denominations  and the people who live  work  and serve our citizens in them deserve only the most thorough and comprehensive approach to this problem  In addition to requesting periodic briefings from your staff to mine  I would appreciate a written response to the following questions  First  please clarify the role your agency will assume as it relates to investigating the origins of the pollution  determining what steps are necessary to remediate the source of the contamination  and what costs will be covered by EPA  Because it would be of particular use to have an agency with the experience of the EPA involved  I would encourage your agency to participate fully in the investigations and cover all related costs  Second  I understand that where VOC contamination has affected residential properties  the costs of necessary remediation for those properties will be covered by your agency  The city has not  however  received similar assurances related to other public buildings  including but not limited to schools and libraries  community buildings such as churches and synagogues  and commercial buildings  A number of these structures provide services to the young and elderly  groups that are especially vulnerable to the effects of VOC exposure  I would encourage you to include them in your remediation commitment  Fourth  I ask for clarification with regards to the boundaries of the study area and how that is determined as the study moves forward  While I understand the criteria to choose the initial boundaries  those boundaries should be subject to reconsideration based on the ongoing results of the study  Therefore if unsafe concentrations of pollutants are discovered  the study area can be redrawn based on those findings  growing larger  until we can be confident that the full extent of the problem has been uncovered  Please provide an assurance that the agency will adopt an appropriately flexible approach as it relates to the boundaries of the study area  Finally  I would request from your staff an estimated time line regarding the investigation and remediation of this problem and any other related key steps in your agencys plan of action  Thank you again for the agencys prompt start to its action  I look forward to hearing from you on this matter and would welcome a meeting with you to discuss it    Sincerely    s  Amy Klobuchar  United States Senator
