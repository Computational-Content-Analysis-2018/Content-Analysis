                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   July 14  2008 St  Louis Park  MN  At a forum with health care leaders and senior advocates  U S   said today that reform of the Medicare system must aim for the best care at the best price by paying health care providers according to the actual quality of care they deliver rather than the volume of procedures they perform    Created in 1965  Medicare provides health coverage to nearly 44 million Americans  including about 37 million people age 65 and older and another 7 million adults with permanent disabilities  Medicares annual spending is over  400 billion and accounts for about 14 percent of the federal budget    On Wednesday  July 9  Klobuchar voted in the Senate to preserve access to quality health care for Medicare beneficiaries by avoiding a harmful cut in physician payments and by beginning to create new incentives to reward quality improvement practices  The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act passed the Senate by a vote of 69 30 and now goes to the President     But Klobuchar said that  sooner rather than later  Medicare requires fundamental reforms to control costs and promote better quality care for patients    At the forum hosted by Park Nicollets Methodist Hospital  Klobuchar noted that the average senior in Miami costs Medicare about twice as much per year as a senior in Minneapolis  Yet  Medicares own reports show that the quality of care is significantly higher in Minnesota   Demographic and cost of living differences account for only a portion of the geographic disparity     Klobuchar pointed to a color coded national map of Medicare spending per patient  It shows a broad expanse of the Midwest and the West with low Medicare spending  while areas in the East  the South and California have spending levels that are twice as high or more   See map below     Instead of rewarding doctors and hospitals for quality care  Klobuchar said  Medicare is making payments based on the sheer volume of services  regardless of need or outcomes  As a result  states with traditionally high utilization of services but poor quality outcomes get reimbursed at a higher rate  A high quality  low cost state like Minnesota gets shortchanged     Klobuchar said there is now overwhelming research that more medical procedures often do not produce better medical outcomes    She pointed to research at Dartmouth Medical School  which examined the records of millions of Medicare patients who died from 2001 to 2005 and who had at least one of nine severe chronic illnesses  Total Medicare spending for this population during that period was  289 billion    According to the Dartmouth study  if Medicare spending per patient everywhere in the country mirrored the efficient level of spending at the Mayo Clinic  Medicare could have saved over  50 billion on this group of patients alone    The current Medicare payment system isnt doing right by our seniors or our taxpayers  said Klobuchar  and its not doing right by our health care providers  either    Klobuchar said the solution is for Medicare to tie its spending to quality care and medical outcomes  She is offering three specific proposals for Medicare to begin moving in that direction     Incentives for Quality Care  Medicare should provide stronger incentives to reward providers for delivering quality care  For many illnesses and health conditions  the medical profession has widely accepted practice guidelines proven to result in better outcomes  These quality guidelines should be the basis for Medicare payments to providers     Bundling Services  Medicare should adopt a bundling approach for its payments  Instead of paying indiscriminately for any and all procedures  Medicare would pay for a bundle of services appropriate for a patients specific condition  which would encourage better care coordination and less incentive to bill Medicare purely for volume     Hospital Certification  Medicare should base its certification of hospitals on how well they educate patients about appropriate health care and health care choices  Studies show that educated patients are more efficient  healthier consumers of health care     Klobuchar acknowledged that there will be no action this year on these proposals  But  she said  the momentum for reform will be strong in 2009  with a new president and many new members of Congress who must answer to the publics demand for change  In addition  the financial pressures on Medicare will only get more severe because of the aging Baby Boom population     In addition to Senator Klobuchar  participants in the forum included      Dr  Sam Carlson  Chief Medical Officer of Park Nicollet Health Services   Dr  Jennifer Lundblad  CEO of Stratis Health   Dr  Ben Whitten  representing the Minnesota Medical Association   Lee Graczyk  Issues Director for the Minnesota Senior Federation   Michele Kimball
