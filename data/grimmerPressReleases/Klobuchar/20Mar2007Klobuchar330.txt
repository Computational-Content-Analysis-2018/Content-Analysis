                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Klobuchar highlights experience as Hennepin County Attorney March 20  2007  Washington  D C   U S   today delivered a speech on the U S  Senate floor about the ongoing investigation of the Administration s recent firing of at least eight U S  Attorneys  Klobuchar recently co sponsored bipartisan legislation  S 214  that would allow the Attorney General to appoint an interim U S  Attorney for 120 days  If after that time the President has not sent up a nominee to the Senate and had that nominee confirmed  the authority to appoint an interim U S  Attorney would fall to the district court  Text of the Senator s speech is below  As a former prosecutor  I m here to speak in support of S  214  I d like to thank members of the Judiciary Committee for introducing and reporting out this important bill and I m proud to be a co sponsor  I returned from Iraq yesterday Mr  President and I look forward to reflecting on lessons learned from that trip later on the week  But I will say that I and my Senate colleagues had extensive discussions with Iraqi political leaders as well as the American military leaders about the importance of building and maintaining the rule of law in Iraq  I have always been proud that our judicial process has been the gold standard for the rest of the world  It is ironic  then  that even as I spoke with Iraqi leaders about their challenges  we Americans were learning a very public lesson about how the rule of law can be undermined in even the most advanced democracies  We have learned this past month that our nation s chief law enforcement officer   our leading guardian of the rule of law in this country   has allowed politics to creep too close to the core of our legal system  This administration has determined that Washington politicians  not prosecutors out in the field   and even perhaps in some cases not even the facts   will dictate how prosecutions should proceed  The consequences are unacceptable  Good prosecutors  by all accounts doing their jobs  upholding their oaths  following the principles of their professions  basing their decisions on the facts before them  were pressured  and or fired  and or unfairly slandered by this administration   and all of this  it would seem  was motivated by rank politics  That is simply not how we do things in this country  That is why last week I called for the Attorney General to resign  Before I came to the Senate  Mr  President I was a prosecutor  I managed an office of nearly 400 people  And we always said to our prosecutors  that if you do the right thing  if you do your job without fear or favor  at the end of the day you have no regrets  It may not be easy  whatever your decision is  it may not make everyone happy but you have to explain it  But if you do your job without fear or favor you will have no regrets  That was true even though I had been elected through the political process   I checked politics at the door when it came to my job  I remember when I first came into the office  There were two prosecutors in my office who supported my opponent  And I went and met with them the day after I was elected and I said  you know I ve heard nothing but good things about you two I ve heard you re great prosecutors and I d like to know what jobs you want in the office   One of them wanted to be the head of the drug team the other wanted to be the head of the gang team  And I put them in those jobs and I never regretted it  They did incredible jobs  They got along with the police they worked well with the community  And that is because we knew that when it came to prosecution there were boundaries  Those boundaries   this month in Washington we found out   were crossed  Another case I ll always remember was a case where we prosecuted a judge who had stolen 400 000 dollars from a mentally disabled woman that he was supposed to protect  This young lived in a world of stuffed animals and dolls  She needed people to take care of her and he was the person who was in charge of her money in her accounts  And he systematically stole all 400 000 dollars in those accounts  He was a politically connected judge  he was a Democrat  And when that case came into our office I got so many calls  dozens of calls from people in the community  Political people saying  you know he messed up but he s a good guy  he shouldn t go to jail   Well Mr  President he went to jail  we asked for a four year sentence and we got that sentence  I still remember that courtroom packed with all of his friends  all of his pals  We did the right thing and at the end of the day we had no regrets This is a tradition in this country  a simple and deeply rooted tradition  that our party affiliation should not get in the middle of decisions about who we prosecute and how we enforce the law  That tradition is as true   perhaps even more true   in our federal prosecutor s offices as it is in local DA s offices  This tradition emerged because our justice system is ultimately built on a foundation of trust  Without that trust  the system doesn t work  When our leaders play politics with the judicial process  we lose that trust  When people get fired for political reasons  we lose that trust  When good prosecutors are removed to make room for political cronies  we lose that trust  And in losing that trust the very lifeblood of our justice system comes under threat  The legislation we are considering will not undo the damage that this administration and this Attorney General have caused  But it will prevent this Attorney General   and future Attorney Generals   from ever doing something like this again  It is time once again to allow federal prosecutors to do their jobs without fear or favor  It is time to place much needed limits on an administration that has far too often and far too flagrantly exceeded its authority and abused the public trust  Today  by passing this bill  we seek to curb that abuse and to give trust back to those that gave it to us   the people of this country      Radio Actuality Information
