                                                                                                            Statement on Senate Ethics Reform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Statement for the Senate Record                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  August 2  2007 Mr s   President  following the tragic collapse of the 35W bridge in Minneapolis that took place yesterday  August 1  2007  I returned to Minnesota this morning to learn all of the facts  and pledge the necessary federal resources for the victims  the investigation  and the repair  By returning to Minnesota  I was  unfortunately  unable to be in Washington  DC to vote on  i  the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House Amendment S 1  and  ii  the motion to concur with the House Message to S 1  Had the tragedy in my state not taken me back to Minnesota  I would have voted for the motion to invoke cloture as well as the underlying bill  In short  I would have voted to change the course in Washington  When I arrived in Washington in January  my husband  daughter and I pulled up in our family Saturn  loaded with my husbands college dishes and a shower curtain that I found in the basement from 1980  But we brought a little more than dishes and shower curtains  We brought a commitment for change  something the people of our state  Democrats  Independents  and Republicans  from Worthington to Moorhead to Duluth to Rochester  called for very clearly and loudly in November  We also brought a Minnesota moral compass  grounded in a simple notion of Minnesota fairness  A notion that all people should be on equal footing in the halls of Congress  But they cant be on equal footing when their elected representatives are selling their votes for trips to Scotland or have cash in the freezer  They cant be on equal footing unless this new Congress delivers real  meaningful ethics reform  Thats why I came to Washington back in January and why I am delighted to see that the Senate passed a strong  bipartisan ethics reform package today  Instead of maintaining business as usual  this ethics legislation will bring meaningful and robust reform in a number of critical areas  Among other things  this legislation will bring about more transparency for lobbyist bundling and political campaign fund activity  greater transparency in earmarking  a strong lobbyist gift ban  meaningful limits on privately funded travel  strong revolving door restrictions  and expanded public disclosure of lobbyist activities  Stated simply  these reforms are needed  and they are needed now  to restore the American publics faith in the integrity of their government as well as their elected representatives  It is hard to exaggerate the importance of whats at stake  Ethics is woven into the very fabric of how our government does business  And ethics reform goes to the very heart of our democracy  to the public trust and respect thats essential to the health of our constitutional system  Recent scandals have cast a shadow over the legitimacy of the laws and policies that come out of Washington  The American publics receding faith in the integrity of our legislative process means that ethics reform is now central to every public issue that we will consider  whether its energy policy  or health care reform  tax policy  or even homeland security  The ability of Congress to deal credibly and forthrightly with these other issues depends on reforming our own ethical rules  The long term challenges that we face in this country are enormous  They include high energy prices and a growing dependence on foreign oil  health care costs that have spiraled out of control  global warming that threatens the future of our environment and our economy  a mounting national debt  and a growing middle class squeeze  I believe that there are solutions to these challenges  We can achieve energy independence by investing smart and having some guts to take on the oil companies  We can get this country back on the right fiscal track  and move forward to more affordable health care  We can deliver much needed and long overdue relief to the middle class  These are the things that the people of Minnesota sent me to Washington to fight for  The people of Minnesota also sent me here because they have not yet seen the bold change of direction that we need to make these solutions happen  Instead  they have seen a Washington where the rules are tilted against them and where the interests of well connected lobbyists come at the expense of the interests of the middle class  When our energy policy is drafted in secret meetings with the oil companies  we all end up paying more at the pump because theyve failed to invest in renewable energy  When our health care legislation is written by the drug companies  we all pay more because theyve banned negotiation on prices  The people of this country know corruption when they see it and they saw last November who was benefiting and who was getting hurt  Business as usual doesnt only generate bad policy and wasteful spending  It also erodes public trust in the integrity of our government institutions  our elected leaders  and the law making process itself  We the American people know what we want from Washington  It is this  a government thats focused on doing whats best for our nation  and on securing a better and more prosperous future for the people  This reform legislation gets us there  By passing this legislation  we will make a positive difference in how Congress performs its duties  and these reforms will send a strong  clear message to the American people that we are here for them and focused solely on representing their interests  And thats the way it should be
