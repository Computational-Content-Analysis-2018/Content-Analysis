when they return                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       March 21  2007    Washington  D C   U S   today took to the Senate floor praising the increases in veterans funding included in the proposal for the federal budget and marking it as a first step to caring for soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  The Budget Resolution is an annual framework within which Congress makes its decisions about spending and taxes  The Senate s resolution   which includes  3 5 billion above the President s request for veterans funding   is scheduled to be voted on by the end of this week  it will then be merged with the House resolution in the coming weeks  At a time when we are spending billions on wars and reconstruction projects overseas  we can certainly afford this increase in veterans funding at home  said Klobuchar  The VA funding in this resolution is just the first in a series of payments towards that debt that we owe these soldiers on the front lines who have sacrificed for us  The full text of the Senator s speech is below  Mr  President  I rise today to implore my colleagues to support the Budget Resolution currently before the Senate  I particularly want to speak in support of the additional funding the resolution provides for the Veterans Administration  funding that will help address one of the most important challenges facing this nation today  That challenge is how we repay our men and women who have sacrificed for us on the front lines in the battlefield when they return home  and how do we ensure that they have all the support and services that they need to resume their lives  But before I turn to the VA funding I want to first speak about the current economic condition in America and how this resolution even the economic playing field for the people of this country  I have to say whenever you go around now  especially in rural America  and you start talking about economic issues  I would have situations where I would think 10 people would come to a small caf and a 100 people would show and that s because when the price of gas goes up to over three bucks a gallon like it did last summer people with farther ways to drive feel it first  And when they ve got two kids that they re trying to send to college and tuition at the University of Minnesota goes up 110 percent they feel it first  When their health care premiums have gone up 60 percent in the last seven years like they have been in our state middle class people feel it first  And when it s their kids that are going to war and their neighbors and their cousins and their grandkids  they feel it first in their heart  That s what this is about  At the national level  the economic policies have produced record deficits and ever amounting debt  What was a 128 billion dollar federal budget surplus in 2001 turned into a 258 billion dollar deficit in 2006  A 5 6 trillion dollar 10 year projected surplus in 2002 has turned into a two trillion dollar deficit  Federal debt has gone up by 1 5 trillion with most of it being held by governments in China and India and many of our economic competitors  This resolution will begin the effort to restore fiscal sanity and responsibility to our government and includes a strong pay as you go rule that requires that we pay for any new mandatory spending or offsets or else get 60 votes to approve it  There will be no more  spend as you like  bills  This does not mean that there will not be any new mandatory spending or tax cuts to help working families  In fact the resolution includes a reserve fund for new tax relief measures but only if we find appropriate offsets  It just means that we have to work to implement them in a fiscally responsible way  The resolution also makes it much harder to push through budget reconciliation measures that are now used in the opposite way than they were intended to increase the budget deficit or decrease the budget surplus  This resolution signals an end to the spend as you like policies that have created fiscal problems at the national level  My colleagues and I on the economic committee are dedicated to reversing this trend and to putting the interests of middle class families front and center  This budget resolution is a good start  Now I would like to address the veterans provisions in the resolution which I think is also very important to middle class families in our country  In the past four years  American military service personnel and their families have endured the conditions that are unprecedented in recent history  including repeated deployments  I can t tell you Mr  President how many families I speak to where their kids have been asked not just to serve once in the National Guard but to be repeatedly called back and every time they say  yes   One and a half million American service men and women have served in Iraq and Afghanistan  These wars are creating a new generation of veterans who need their country to stand with them  These are men and women who have served our country on the front lines  When they come back to this country they re too often shunted to the end of the line   waiting for health care waiting for education benefits and now as the shocking revelations from Walter Reed shown us  some have been left waiting in the most squalid of conditions  I want to commend Chairman Conrad and members of the Budget Committee for recognizing that the President s budget request for Fiscal Year 2008 severely shortchanged the needs of veterans in this country  Passing this resolution with the  3 5 billion added to the President s request  for a total of  43 1 billion in discretionary veterans  spending  should be our highest priority  At a time when we are spending billions on wars and reconstruction projects overseas  we can certainly afford this increase in veterans funding at home  In addition to providing billions more for veterans health care and other support programs  this Resolution rejects the President s apparent belief that now is the time to increase mandatory fees veterans must pay under TRICARE  The President s budget called for an increase in TRICARE pharmacy co payments from eight to 15 dollars  It called for an annual enrollment fee based on a veteran s family income  And it proposed to require veterans to cover their entire co payment for non service connected disability  This Budget Resolution blocks those outrageous proposals  This administration has shockingly underestimated the number of veterans who would require medical care  To give you one example in its Fiscal Year 2005 budget request  the Department of Defense estimated it would have to provide care for 23 500 veterans when they came home from Iraq and Afghanistan  In reality  more than four times that number required help  Last year  the Pentagon underestimated the number of veterans who would require care by 87 000  That this administration underestimated and under funded veterans  programs should not come as a surprise  Ever since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began  the administration has seemed oblivious to the fact that when you send hundreds of thousands of soldiers into battle  you must have a plan to provide for the hundreds of thousands of veterans that you are creating and active duty soldiers that will require substantial support when they return home  With this additional discretionary funding  we can begin to seriously address the epidemic of Traumatic Brain Injuries and polytraumatic injuries suffered by soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan that has so tragically become the signature injury of this war  We can enhance and expand the recovery and rehabilitation centers for the 30 000 wounded Iraq and Afghanistan veterans  We can provide increased counseling and create greater awareness for the tens of thousands of veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other mental illnesses  According to a Veterans  Health Administration report  roughly one third of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who sought care through the VA have been diagnosed with potential symptoms of post traumatic stress  drug abuse or other mental disorders  And  on an issue that is particularly important to Minnesotans  we can increase benefits and services for National Guard members and Reservists who are being asked to play the role of active duty soldiers on the battlefield  but are then treated as  second class veterans  at home  This past weekend  I traveled to Iraq with three of my colleagues to visit our troops in the field and assess the situation on the ground  I was fortunate to have the opportunity to thank many of the brave men and women from my state for their sacrifices  The sacrifices our troops are making  and the risks they are taking  was driven home in a poignant and powerful moment at the Baghdad Airport when I stood with nine firefighters who are members of Minnesota s National Guard  They were there to show their respect for fallen soldiers and they stood there and saluted as six caskets were loaded on an airplane  all were draped in the American flag  I watched these men stand stoically  but sadly  and then I saw them return to their task at hand  With all of the political noise in Washington about the war in Iraq  we often lose touch of what the perspective is of the men and women on the front lines  I went to Iraq to find that perspective  I met Marines in Fallujah from Roseville and Rochester  Minnesota  I met a Navy Seabee from Appleton  Minnesota  I met Army soldiers assigned to help train Iraqi troops from Minneapolis and Saint Paul  I met Army Reservists based out of Fort Snelling  And I met National Guardsman attached to the fighter wing in Duluth These soldiers and National Guardsmen I met in Kuwait  Baghdad  and Fallujahthey didn t ask about the resolutions the Senate was debating  They didn t ask me what my plan was to bring them home to their families  They didn t ask about the shortages in equipment and body armor  They didn t ask about repeated tour extensions  They only asked about two things  First  they asked about the results in the Minnesota High School Hockey Tournament  But they asked one more thing  they asked that we take care of them when they returned home  I pledged to them  and I bring that pledge to the Senate floor today  that their sacrifice would not go overlooked  that their service would not be forgotten  and that our debt to them will be repaid  The VA funding in this resolution is just the first in a series of payments towards that debt that we owe these soldiers on the front lines who have sacrificed for us  I have always believed that when we ask our young men and women to fight and make the ultimate sacrifice for our nation  we make a promise that we re going give them the resources they need  This has always been a country where we believe in patriotism and patriotism means wrapping our arms around those that have served us  In his Second Inaugural address  President Lincoln reminded the American people that  in war  we must strive  to finish the work we are in  to bind up the nation s wounds  to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan   Today  Americans are again called to bind up our nation s wounds and to care for those who have borne the battle  as well as their families who have shouldered their own sacrifice  Let us live up to this solemn obligation to bring our troops home safely and to honor our returning soldiers and their families by giving them the care and benefits they have earned  That is why Mr  President I support the veterans funding that is included in this budget resolution  Thank you
