                                                                                                          June 20  2008 Washington  D C   U S   today announced that  2 85 million passed the Subcommittee on Commerce  Science  and Justice for law enforcement and major Minnesota initiatives  The funding aims to aid a variety of initiatives for public safety and protection     Klobuchar was able to secure funding for child protection initiatives in Minnesota   700 000 was allocated for Winona State Universitys National Child Protection Training Center  which opened in 2004  In 2007  Senator Klobuchar participated in the opening of the center and has secured  600 000 for the center  Among other things  the Universitys facility teaches investigators and prosecutors the science of interviewing young children victimized by abuse   As a former prosecutor  I recognize law enforcements commitment to protecting children from abusive situations  Thats why I commend the impressive work being done at Winona State Universitys premier National Training Center and why todays funding is so critical  said Klobuchar     Victor Vieth  the Director of the National Child Protection Training Center  commented on todays announcement stating  As a result of strong support from Senator Klobuchar and other members of the Minnesota congressional delegation  the National Child Protection Training Center will continue its work to provide training and other resources to law enforcement officers  prosecutors  and other child protection professionals handling cases of child abuse    Klobuchar helped secure funding for Goodhue and Itasca counties transition to Minnesotas ARMER radio system that will provide law enforcement with great information sharing to keep Minnesotans safe  Goodhue could receive  750 000 for this program and Itasca could receive  300 000 to complete the final phase of implementing its 9 11 radio system as part of the ARMER radio system     When I was County Attorney I would often meet with law enforcement officials across our state to discuss best practices and areas for improvement  It became very clear very quickly that they needed tools to help them better communicate between jurisdictions  especially in our rural areas  said Klobuchar  Im pleased to see that my efforts to help these counties made significant headway today     We really appreciate Senator Klobuchars work on this project  said Itasca County Sheriff Pat Medure  This funding will help us dramatically to complete upgrading our communications system to help fire fighters  law enforcement  EMS  and emergency management better serve residents    The bill also includes  600 for the successful Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program  including  50 million for a COPS hiring program  COPS has funded 118 000 officers in more than 12 000 communities nationwide since it was created in 1994  Researchers have credited it as a significant factor in the national decline in violent cream that began in the 1990s  Since coming to the Senate  Klobuchar has been working in the Senate to restore funding cuts to the program    Klobuchar has also been active in fighting to keep Byrne grant funding that the Administration has sought to cut by 67 percent  The Byrne grant program provides support to local law enforcement authorities for multi jurisdictional drug task forces  anti gang efforts  specialized prosecutors and other crime fighting initiatives  Last year Minnesota received almost  6 5 million in Byrne grants  Klobuchar has also cosponsored a bill to return the total funding to the 2006 level of  1 1 billion   Ive always believed that the first responsibility of government is to protect the safety of its citizens  said Klobuchar  who was Hennepin Countys chief prosecutor for eight years before her election to the U S  Senate  And I believe that responsibility begins right here  at the local level in our neighborhoods and our communities  where people live and work  To fulfill that essential responsibility  our local police need the support of our government in Washington    The appropriations bill now moves to the Senate for full consideration  The Appropriations Committee receives thousands of requests for local projects from Members of Congress from every state  but includes only a fraction of the requests in the final bill     Also included in the bill are the following state projects     300 000  City of Minneapolis  To provide squad car cameras and mobile data computers  MCD       250 000  City of St  Paul
