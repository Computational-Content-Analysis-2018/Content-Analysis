Special Committee on Aging  and Senator Chuck Grassley  R IA   Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance  were joined by Rep  John D  Dingell  D MI   Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  Rep  Joe Barton  R TX   Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  and other Senate and House colleagues in releasing a report by the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO  on the consumer protections states have in place for those who purchase long term care insurance  LTCI      Due to the rapid aging of Americas population  the marketplace for long term care services is expected to expand significantly  Private LTCI has emerged as one possible way individuals can prepare for their long term care needs later in life  In their request to GAO  members of Congress expressed their interest in examining the frequency with which consumers are experiencing denial of benefits and exorbitant rate increases  In light of such practices  the GAO report examined the robustness of states rate setting standards and the rules for settling of benefit denials    Congressional requesters expect to use the report findings as a guideline for determining the future viability of LTCI and to consider what  if any  regulatory steps could be taken on the federal level to strengthen consumer protections  Tomorrow at 10 00 a m  in 2123 Rayburn House Office Building  Rep  Bart Stupak  D MI   Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  will hold a hearing entitled  Long Term Care Insurance  Are Consumers Protected for the Long Term  This hearing is the second in the subcommittees series to explore issues of long term care service delivery and financing issues    GAO found that rate increases for LTCI policies fluctuate widely from state to state and plan to plan  For example  one company cited in the report repeatedly raised premiums  resulting in a cumulative increase of more than 70 percent since 1991  while another company has raised premiums only once since 1975  According to the report  rate stability standards  which are designed to protect consumers against sharp premium increases  have now been adopted by more than half of all states  However  because many states have not yet adopted these standards  a vast number of consumers are still left unprotected  Additionally  because the rate standards are so new  state regulators are unsure of how successful they will be in moderating future premium increases    GAO also reviewed claims settled by LTCI companies in ten states by evaluated consumer complaints  The report found that standards for the timely payment of consumer claims varied significantly by state  with timely being defined as five days in one state and 45 days in another  One state did not have a timeliness requirement at all  GAO also noted that some states are considering implementing an external appeals process for adjudicating disputed claims    The federal government expects that as many as 30 states will have Long Term Care Partnership programs in place by the end of this year  These programs encourage the private purchase of LTCI and feature state approved plans that combine private LTCI with possible add on Medicaid coverage in policies that allow consumers to protect some portion of their accumulated financial assets  Many state officials  as well as LTCI providers  are enthusiastically supporting rollout of these Partnership programs  As programs of this nature unfold across the country  the GAO reports findings make it clear that consumers who are urged by state governments to purchase these plans must have access to comprehensive  accurate information about Partnership approved plans to determine whether they are a sound and affordable choice for them    The report was requested jointly by the following     Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging   Senator Chuck Grassley  R IA   Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance   Rep  John D  Dingell  D MI   Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce   Rep  Joe Barton  R TX   Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging   Senator Byron Dorgan  D ND      D MN    Senator Barack Obama  D IL    This report underscores the need for a new approach to long term care insurance to ensure that as the baby boom generation ages  standards will be in place to help people plan for their health care needs  said Senator Klobuchar  Long term care insurance will be critical to ensuring that our seniors have the care they need to live independently and stay in their own homes as long as possible    We need to make sure we get some of these already troubling issues resolved  especially since state governments are partnering with long term care insurance companies  said Senator Kohl  Congress is doing the right thing by taking a close look at long term care insurance to make sure consumers are protected    The very high costs of long term care make it smart public policy to help people manage their financial risk with long term care insurance policies  Its also important to make sure these products are viable and dont leave consumers with big premiums and little security  This new report provides helpful information for federal and state lawmakers  regulators and consumer watchdogs in meeting that challenge  Senator Grassley said    The GAOs findings and our own Committee staffs investigation have identified troubling weaknesses in the states ability to protect consumers from abusive practices  said Rep  Dingell  If the insurance industry is not up to the task of correcting these problems swiftly and treating vulnerable policyholders and their families fairly then Congress will need to consider steps to ensure strong  uniform national standards  Our oversight hearing tomorrow will lay the groundwork for urgently needed reforms in the industry and at the state and federal levels    As more and more Americans choose to purchase private long term care insurance to prepare for future needs  we must ensure that the product is fair and accessible  Companies  in partnership with government  should offer fair pricing  transparency in premium increases  and timely responses to complaints  I am proud that my state of New York was a pioneer in the Long Term Care Partnership program  and also holds some of the highest standards in the country for these types of consumer protections  As this GAO report makes clear  however  the federal government has a role to play  we need to take steps to ensure that seniors have the resources and information they need to make the right choices about long term care  said Senator Clinton    When planning for their long term care  people want the peace of mind that their insurance premiums wont be increased in dramatic and unpredictable ways  and that theyll have timely access to care  said Senator Dorgan  This type of basic stability for long term care will protect consumers and provide better healthcare access for those who need it    Affordable and comprehensive long term care is critical for the health  safety and independence of Americas seniors  said Senator Obama  Many Americans are spending thousands of dollars on private long term care insurance  and yet when they need help the most  they often face lengthy waiting periods and wrongful denials of claims  We must take steps to strengthen oversight of this industry  ensure claims processes are consistent and fair  and guarantee that benefit packages offer the financial protection promised  I commend Chairman Kohl for his leadership on this important issue  and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address the findings of this report     The GAO has identified significant gaps among the states in their abilities to protect consumers from abusive practices by their insurance companies  Rep  Stupak said  We look forward to hearing more tomorrow from GAO  other experts  state regulators and the industry itself about these issues  and to hearing their ideas for addressing the problems that policyholders face when they need to use the insurance they have struggled so hard to pay for          The GAO report can be found
