                                                                                                            Klobuchar  Coleman Introduce Amendments to Help Minnesota National Guard Troops                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Amendments range from education benefits to recruitment tactics July 11  2007 Washington  D C    In an effort to ease the reintegration process of the 2 600 Minnesota National Guard troops returning home from combat in the coming weeks  Minnesota Senators and Amy Klobuchar  D MN  and Norm Coleman  R MN  today introduced a variety of amendments to the fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization bill  The amendments will address an array of issues faced by Minnesota troops during and after their combat duty  including education benefits  pay disparity issues  recruiting efforts  and professional licensing and certification challenges     As a nation  we have an obligation to wrap our arms around those who serve and sacrifice for us  said Klobuchar  I believe America can do much better  especially for the men and women of our National Guard and Reserves  The sacrifices our troops have made  and the risks they have taken  were very clear to me when I visited Iraq this past spring  These amendments are a step forward in honoring their sacrifices and ensuring that our debt to them is repaid    Our countrys armed forces make unimaginable sacrifices each and every day to protect our freedom  our national security  and our overall way of life  It is our duty as the citizens they protect to ensure they have access to the most important resources upon their return  said Coleman  I have spent time with our troops and their families to learn about their pressing needs  and have crafted several amendments that will begin to address them  Passage of these amendments is the least we can do to repay our troops and their families for their heroism     Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program    This amendment would create a national reintegration program for National Guard and Reserve troops based on the Minnesota National Guards highly successful Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Program  The program would provide informational events and activities to assist National Guard soldiers  families  and community members through all phases of the deployment cycle including pre and post deployment  The resources provided in this amendment include family and marriage counseling  financial planning and education  small business planning  community outreach  and healthcare and veterans benefits education     I have secured and will continue to seek funding for this exceptional program for Minnesotas troops  With this amendment  we will ensure the programs continuance  not only in Minnesota  but throughout the nation  said Coleman  These folks risk their lives for our country  we must be certain that their transition from military life to civilian life goes as smoothly as possible  This amendment will ensure that these men and women have an opportunity to be successful before  during and after their service     A family and community reintegration program like Beyond the Yellow Ribbon is especially important for Guard members  said Klobuchar  Instead of going back to an active duty military base  they return to civilian lives in literally hundreds of communities and small towns across this country  Beyond the Yellow Ribbon has already helped ease the transition for many Minnesota soldiers and their families  What works here can work in every state across the nation     Nursing Licensure Exemption    National Guard and Reserve troops who are Certified Nurse Aids in the private sector are currently at risk of losing their certifications due to extended active duty tours in Iraq  Under current law  if a Certified Nurse Aid goes 24 months without performing medical services they lose their certification and are forced to retake training and certification exams which are costly and time consuming  This amendment would allow nursing aids who have served on active duty an additional 24 months after returning from active duty service to perform nurse or nurse related services before expiration of their certifications  Additionally  the amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to report recommendations to Congress on legislative action to exempt or delay licensure and certification requirements of other Reserve Component professionals called to active duty  The amendment comes as a direct result of a conversation Senator Coleman had with Minnesota National Guard members in Iraq     Soldier Pay Discrepancy    Currently  Minnesota National Guard and Reserve soldiers who were deployed in Kosovo and now Iraq are eligible for assignment incentive pay   1 000 per month  because of their extended service  Those who were previously deployed to Bosnia are not receiving the assignment pay due to a technicality in their mobilization orders  This amendment allows the Secretary of Defense to eliminate this discrepancy by authorizing Assignment Incentive Pay for these troops regardless of their mobilization orders
