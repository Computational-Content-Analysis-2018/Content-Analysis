nations more than 230 million cell phone subscribers was heard before the United States Senates Commerce Committee today  The rules governing our wireless industry are a relic of the 1980s  when cell phones fit in a briefcase instead of a pocket  said Klobuchar  who chaired todays hearing  While cell phones have modernized  the rules havent  Its past time for more consumer friendly policies that keep up with the needs of consumer  allowing them to get a phone that works when and where they need it at a price they can afford  Klobuchar  D MN  and co sponsor Jay Rockefeller  D WV  unveiled the Cell Phone Consumer Empowerment Act in September  requiring wireless service providers to share simple  clear information with current and potential customers  Among the bills provisions are detailed data on coverage areas and dropped calls  pro rated early termination fees for those who exit their contract after thirty days  the ability to exit a contract within thirty days without a termination fee when wireless service is found to be unsatisfactory  and transparency in contracts and billing  including explanations of taxes and fees  At the hearing  Klobuchar noted that most cellular companies put disclaimers on their maps  including the one on ATTs website noting actual coverage area may differ substantially from maps  making it difficult for consumers to make informed decisions on the cellular service that will meet their needs  Klobuchar also cited a Verizon billboard in Fosston  Minnesota on U S  Highway 2 where  despite a map that indicates coverage and the presence of the Verizon advertisement  their cellular service does not work in the vicinity of the billboard  Multi million dollar marketing campaigns by the cell phone companies tell us to choose the service with the most bars  the best coverage  or the least dropped calls  said Klobuchar  But when the maps are substantially different or calls dont work where theyre advertised  the cell phone industry is not giving consumers the tools they need to make the best decisions  This is simple  consumer friendly legislation to empower cell phone users with information  Witnesses at todays hearing included Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam  Chris Murray from the Consumers Union  and Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson  The burden should not be on the consumer to figure out the rules of the cell phone shell game  The United States Congress should pass meaningful legislation so that consumers are treated fairly and not subjected to a game of hide the ball when navigating the cell phone maze  Swanson said  Todays hearing was held at the request of Senators Klobuchar and Rockefeller  both of whom sit on the Commerce Committee  A summary of the legislation is attached  To access radio actualities from the
