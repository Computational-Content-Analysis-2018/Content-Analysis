                                                                                                          May 24  2007  Washington  D C   Today in an effort to provide Americans relief from record high gas prices U S  Senators Amy Klobuchar  D MN   Barack Obama   D IL   Kit Bond  R MO   George Voinovich  R OH   and Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced legislation to expand consumer access to 85 percent ethanol fuel  or E 85  an affordable  home grown alternative to gasoline  The Ethanol Education and Expansion Act of 2007 would work to reduce prices at the pump for consumers by providing grants through the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to farmer owned ethanol producers to install additional E 85 pumps at rural gas stations as well as the equipment needed to sell E 85 directly to gas stations  With gas prices up over  3 00 a gallon and oil companies raking in record profits  its time to move forward with homegrown energy  remarked Sen  Klobuchar  E 85 and other renewable fuels mean jobs for our country and cheaper fuel for our cars  We can produce all the homegrown energy we want  but without the pumps to take the fuel from our farms to the tanks in our cars  we will never have energy independence  Reducing our nation s consumption of gasoline and encouraging the use of renewable fuels  like ethanol  are important steps in combating global climate change  said Sen  Obama  Expanding our ethanol infrastructure  as this legislation proposes  will inject competition into the market  give Americans the power to choose domestically produced  environmentally friendly fuel and reduce our dependence on expensive foreign oil  Ethanol has become a popular alternative for the 6 million Americans with flexible fuel vehicles  vehicles capable of using gas or E 85 as fuel  looking for relief at the pump and an environmentally friendly fuel  However  many consumers have a hard time finding E 85  since it is available at just 1 200 stations   less than one percent of the approximately 170 000 gas stations in the U S  As hard working Americans continue to feel the pain at the pump  we need to provide access to more energy alternatives to fuel consumers  said Sen  Bond  This bill is a good step towards making our country more energy independent  The addition of E 85 pumps will better serve our nation s need for a reliable renewable resource  Keeping America competitive in the global marketplace requires an overhaul of our national energy policy   we must become less reliant on foreign sources on energy  Sen  Voinovich said  To do so  we must increase our energy supply  conserve more energy and explore and expand our use of new technologies including E 85  Our bill will help dramatically increase the availability of E 85  making it a viable source of fuel for everyday Americans who are committed to our nation s energy independence  As part of the grant program  the bill would allow farmer owned ethanol producers to install the infrastructure needed to bypass oil companies and sell E 85 directly to gas stations  This would ensure that American farmers receive the benefits of home grown fuels such as E 85  The bill would also create the new E 85 Education Program  which would award competitive grants to non profit organizations to educate gas station owners  vehicle fleet operators and the general public about the benefits and availability of E 85  Currently  most ethanol is sold to oil companies who then re sell to gas stations  often at higher prices  Klobuchar s bipartisan proposal eliminates the middle man  thus reducing prices at the pump for consumers and keeping energy dollars in the Midwest instead of lining the pockets of oil cartels in the Middle East  Renewable fuels are one of the keys to America s drive toward energy independence  These fuels reduce our reliance on foreign oil and enhance our ability to control our own security and economic future   while helping our farmers by increasing demand for their crops  Durbin said  One of the biggest challenges in increasing the use of renewable fuels is that many consumers don t have access to fuels like E 85  This legislation takes an important step toward overcoming this hurdle and paves a path to greater production and use of renewable fuels  Sen  Klobuchar will work to include the legislation in the 2007 Farm Bill  which the Senate is expected to take up in the coming months  The bill sets the amount of federal grant assistance at 20 percent of the total project cost  providing enough funding to complete 1 000 2 000 new E 85 pumps over the five year life of the Farm Bill  Senators Ben Nelson  D NE   Debbie Stabenow  D MI   Sherrod Brown  D OH   Hilary Clinton  D NY   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and John Kerry  D MA  are also co sponsors of the legislation
