Soldiers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      April 16  2008 Washington  D C   A bipartisan group of U S  Senatorsincluding Amy Klobuchar  D Minn    Blanche Lincoln  D Ark    Sherrod Brown  D Ohio   Bob Casey  D Pa    Mike Crapo  R Idaho   Gordon Smith  R Ore    John Kerry  D Mass    Barbara Mikulski  D Md    Ken Salazar  D Colo    and Evan Bayh  D Ind  today unveiled their plan to provide the men and women of our National Guard and Reserves with benefits that better reflect their increased service to our country     The Reserve Educational Assistance Program  REAP  Enhancement Act of 2008  introduced today  would make three much needed improvements to the structure and value of the Montgomery G I  Bill education benefits for our citizen soldiers by providing accruable benefits for those who have served multiple deployments  by replacing the current three tiered formula for REAP benefits with one that more accurately reflects service rendered  and by shifting jurisdiction of REAP benefits from the Department of Defense to the Veterans Administration     Our brave men and women didnt have to stand in line when they signed up to serve  and they shouldnt have to stand in line when they come home  said Klobuchar  We owe our Guard and Reserve members the opportunities for a better future   this bill honor their service as they return from long deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan    Last year  Congress made important progress by improving access to educational benefits for our citizen soldiers  but too many inequities still remain in the current G I  Bill  Lincoln said  Approximately 3 000 members of Arkansass 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team deployed to Iraq last month  The majority of the brigade has returned for a second tour  but these members will not receive one additional penny of educational benefits because benefits are based on the single longest deployment for each soldier and are not accruable  With increasing frequency  our country is calling on our citizen soldiers to place themselves in harms way on our behalf  Its time that a grateful nation takes needed steps to more appropriately honor their sacrifice    The government must ensure that the men and women who serve our country excel when they go back to college  Brown said  This bill would provide the Guard and Reserve with support when they return so they can make a seamless transition back into their life at college  Soldiers should not be punished academically or financially because they were called to duty    As a nation  we lean on our National Guard to protect us at home and abroad  said Casey  Pennsylvania currently has over 700 troops in Afghanistan  A year from now  Pennsylvania could have at least 7 000 National Guard members in Iraq  Providing them with these extended benefits is the least we can do to repay them for spending time away from their families  homes and jobs for our protection    The scope of assignments given to the National Guard and Reserves has grown significantly since September 11  2001  Crapo said  Their efforts to meet our national security needs must be equally met with the appropriate recognition and compensation    Our National Guard and Reservists lay their lives on the line to protect our freedom  Their contributions in battle cannot be underestimated  Smith said  Despite serving in the trenches of the war on terror  they are not eligible to receive the same educational benefits as full time members of the military  Giving every opportunity for a bright future is the least we can do for the brave men and women who wear our uniform in battle    Only in Washington would some people fail to understand that soldiers who serve longer should receive more benefits  Its an insult to those who have worn our countrys uniform to tell them that only a fraction of the days they put their lives on the line are counted towards their benefits  This reform recognizes every day each soldier spends serving their country in a war zone and honors their sacrifices  Giving soldiers the educational benefits they deserve is one small way we can repay our Guard and Reservists  said Kerry    The brave men and women in our Guard and Reserve have been fighting side by side with our active duty troops in Iraq and Afghanistan so that we may live in freedom  Our citizen Soldiers make great sacrifices and honor their country by volunteering to serve  often second  third and fourth tours of duty  said Mikulski  We must recognize and honor their service and sacrifice  not just with words  but with deeds  Thats why I am fighting for benefits that reflect the unprecedented sacrifices they are making for their country    The GI Bill helped millions of American soldiers get an education after World War II  opening important doors of opportunity for them and propelling the growth of the middle class in this country  said Salazar  Today  more than five years into the war in Iraq and six years into the war in Afghanistan  it is time that we re evaluate the educational benefits we are offering those who are serving our country to ensure that we are properly honoring their service and doing all we can to improve retention and recruitment  I am pleased to support the Reserve Educational Assistance Program  REAP  Enhancement Bill of 2008 that aims to improve the educational benefits available to the Guard and Reserve  those citizen soldiers who have been called upon to give more than ever expected in the last six years  It is only right that we offer educational benefits that match their service    The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have placed an extraordinary burden on our reservists and National Guard  and we need to step up and show them how much we value their service  Bayh said  No Americans serving multiple and extended tours in a combat zone should come home and find themselves unable to afford an education    The REAP Enhancement Act builds on the progress of Lincolns Total Force Educational Assistance Enhancement and Integration Act of 2007  S 644   A significant provision of the Total Force billallowing citizen soldiers who have served combat tours to access their educational benefits for up to ten years following their service  just as active duty soldiers have been able to dowas signed into law as part of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act     The REAP Enhancement Act is endorsed by the Military Officers Association of America and the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States
