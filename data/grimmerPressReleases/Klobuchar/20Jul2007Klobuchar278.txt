                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     July 20  2007  Washington  D C    U S  Senators Amy Klobuchar  D MN  and Norm Coleman  R MN  announced today that they were successful in securing federal funds for several agriculture and rural development initiatives in the Senate Agriculture and Rural Development Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008  The full committee approved the bill today and will send it to the Senate floor for consideration by the full Senate    This funding is vital for the rural economy and the farm families of Minnesota  said Klobuchar  Minnesotas farmers produce food for us all and this passage helps to ensure their continued success  America enjoys a safe and abundant supply of food because our farmers work harder and work smarter those of any other nation  and in order to keep that competitive edge  our farmers need access to the best science available  said Coleman  Thats why these appropriations projects are so critical  they provide our producers the tools they need to feed and fuel our nation and maintain our competitive edge in the global marketplace  said Coleman    Klobuchar and Coleman secured  198 000 for a Soybean Genomics research at the University of Minnesota  St  Paul  Soybeans grown in the Upper Midwest tend to have lower protein content than soybeans grown further south  These funds will support more research that is needed to identify genes that contribute to improved protein levels and soybean oil quality  This project is a key priority for Minnesotas soybean growers  and helps fund studys that could drastically increase the productivity and income of farmers     Minnesotas Senators were also able secure  302 000 for Cereal Disease Research at the ARS Laboratory  in St  Paul  This funding will support research to improve small grains resistance to scab and rusts and reduce the economic losses caused by these diseases  During the 1990s  Cereal Disease devastated the wheat and barley crop in the Red River Valley  adversely affecting both yield and quality  The research being conducted at the U of M to control diseases in wheat  barley  and oats is vitally important to the producers of these crops  Farmers in the Red River Valley and southeastern Minnesota should benefit greatly from this continued research  and I am pleased to have helped secure the funding for it  said Klobuchar  I am proud to say Minnesotas innovative citizens are pioneering cutting edge technologies and practices in agriculture  said Coleman  Soybean genomics and Cereal Disease research are two outstanding examples of how Minnesota know how is leading U S  agriculture to a brighter future  I applaud the Senate Appropriations Committee for recognizing the needs of Minnesota agriculture by approving this funding  In addition  to the above funding  Senators Klobuchar and Coleman secured appropriations for the following projects      295 000 for the Uniform Farm Management Project   Funds would to go the University of Minnesotas Center for Farm Financial Management  which is creating a national database of farm financial information to help farmers make better management and business decisions       325 000 for Wild Rice Breeding and Germplasm Program at the ARS Laboratory  St  Paul  Minnesota   This programs research addresses some of the most critical problems for wild rice producers  shattering resistance  disease resistance  germplasm retention and seed storage  Wild rice is the only cereal grain native to North America  Minnesota is the nation s 2nd largest producer of wild rice  with production concentrated near the Red Lake Band of Ojibwe Indian Reseravation      250 000 for the Midwest Poultry Research Program   The Midwest Poultry Consortium is an association of 13 poultry producing states  including Minnesota  whose mission it is to support poultry research programs at land grant universities in the Midwest  Funds support research based on issues critical to Midwest poultry producers  such as food safety  animal health  waste management  and combating poultry diseases     Restore  1 356 000 for the National Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative   This project is important to combating scab  or fusarium head blight  that devastated the wheat and barley crop in the Red River Valley during the 1990s  reducing both production and quality       600 000 for the Great Lakes Basin Program for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control   This program would protect and improve water quality in the Great Lakes by reducing soil erosion and controlling sedimentation through financial incentives  information  education and technical assistance      650 000 for Wood Utilization Research Centers   This funding will help the forest products sector develop new products  new technologies  and new business systems to position Minnesota as a continued leader in wood products manufacturing
