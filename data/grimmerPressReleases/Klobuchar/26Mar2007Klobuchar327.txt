wrongdoing by insurance companies in denying seniors their payment of claims for assisted living facilities and other benefits  Today s New York Times  1  reported that certain insurance companies are employing improper tactics to deny legitimate long term care insurance claims made by seniors who have paid their premiums for years  One such insurance company  Conseco  has previously been fined  2 5 million by Minnesota Department of Commerce for deceptive marketing of annuities to seniors   the largest monetary penalty Minnesota has ever imposed against an insurance company  If these reports are true  and there are very real reasons to think they are  then these insurance companies have committed the very worst kind of fraud against our seniors  against their families  and against the American taxpayers  said Klobuchar  After aggressively courting seniors to sign up for their long term care insurance plans  and after happily accepting timely payments from these seniors over a period of years  these companies apparently are making up their own rules and breaking their promises  I addressed the growing problem of financial fraud against seniors as County Attorney  and I intend to get to the bottom of this issue as Senator  Klobuchar has met with numerous care providers and seniors across Minnesota about long term care issues  She has also proposed a  1 200 tax credit for families caring for aging loved ones  As Hennepin County Attorney  Klobuchar installed an Elder Abuse Team dedicated to prosecuting crimes against the elderly  Two prosecutors focused on fraud  theft  and other property related crimes  Below is the text of the letter Senator Klobuchar sent today   1  Charles Duhigg  Aged  Frail and Denied Care by Their Insurers  New York Times  March 26  2007   March 26  2007 Senator Edward M  Kennedy Chairman Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions 428 Senate Dirksen Office Bldg Washington  DC 20510 Dear Chairman Kennedy  I am growing increasingly concerned about abusive practices by the long term care insurance industry  The New York Times today reported what I have been hearing from others for some time now  certain insurance companies are using improper tactics  some might call them cheap tricks  to deny legitimate long term care insurance claims made by senior citizens who have conscientiously paid their premiums for years  Whether it is unduly complicated and burdensome claims procedures  unjustified rescissions  baseless rejections  or some other questionable method  these reports indicate that the end result is the same  The insurance companies get paid  the seniors get nothing  and their families  and taxpayers  are left scrambling to cover the costs of long term care  As the chief prosecutor for Minnesota s largest county   covering 1 1 million people and 45 cities   I confronted financial exploitation of seniors  My staff and I established a Senior Initiative to ensure the more effective investigation and prosecution of crimes  including financial crimes  committed against senior citizens  Our Elder Abuse teams aggressively prosecuted these cases and also promoted outreach and education activities to promote public understanding  We acted  and the results speak for themselves  It is time for us   for this Congress   to investigate these recent reports of insurance abuse and to take any needed steps to protect our seniors and to punish any wrongdoers  The urgency of this issue cannot easily be overstated  At present  more than eight million seniors own long term care insurance policies  and that number is growing rapidly as our population ages and life saving and life improving technologies become more prevalent  These eight million seniors have families  When they are denied insurance benefits  their families   middle class folks already straining to make ends meet   have to help pay the skyrocketing costs of care  And this is not just a moral issue  it is a fiscal issue as well  When insurance policies fail  federal programs like Medicaid help fill the gaps  so taxpayers have to help pay for the insurance companies  refusal to live up to their promises  We know enough to conclude that there is a real problem here  We know that in California alone  nearly one in every four long term care claims was denied in 2005  We know that thousands of grievances and lawsuits have been filed by seniors against long term care insurers in recent years  We know the individual stories of seniors and their families who lived up to their bargain only to be left with nothing by insurance companies  And we know that at least one of the major insurance providers identified by the Times   Conseco   has been known to mislead its customers  especially seniors  Last year  Conseco was fined  2 5 million by the Minnesota Department of Commerce for deceptive marketing of annuities to seniors  It was reportedly the largest monetary penalty Minnesota has ever imposed against an insurance company  We know all of these things  but we need to know more before we can act  That is why I respectfully request that the HELP Committee hold a hearing on this issue at the earliest possible opportunity  I would be happy to work with you to organize this hearing  I also look forward to working with you to address this issue in other ways  Thank you for your consideration of this request  Sincerely  Amy Klobuchar
