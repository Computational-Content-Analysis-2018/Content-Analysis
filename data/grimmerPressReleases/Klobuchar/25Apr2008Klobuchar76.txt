Gouging on Pediatric Drug                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Wants FTC to examine anticompetitive behavior after price of infant heart drug rose 18 fold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      April 25  2008 Washington  D C   U S   today called on the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to investigate potentially anticompetitive behavior by OVATION Pharmaceuticals in connection with pricing of an important pediatric drug  Klobuchar specifically asked the FTC to examine how the price of a medication for premature babies has shot up 18 fold since the company acquired the rights of the drug  intravenous indomethacin  Indocin I V    in 2006    There are serious questions about the suggested justifications for this price increase  since costs related to marketing  physician education  and research would appear to have been stable since OVATION began distributing the drug  said Klobuchar  In a time when rising prices for prescription drugs stretch the budgets of middle class families and threaten the stability of our nations economy  we must be vigilant in stopping practices that would limit access to vital medicine     Indocin I V  is the most frequently used  cost effective medicine in treating patent ductus arteriosis  PDA   a condition that prevents holes within the chamber of an infants heart from sealing shortly after birth  The ailment is most common in premature babies    OVATION also owns the rights to intravenous ibuprofen  the only other FDA approved treatment for the condition  raising questions whether the companys purchase of Indocin I V  and pricing structure is a move to corner the market for available drugs to treat PDA and will eventually lead to a monopolization of nonsurgical treatments for PDA     Last month Klobuchar joined with Dr  Alan Goldbloom and Dr  Phillip Kibort  respectively president and chief medical officer of Childrens Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota  and Dr  Ellen Bendel Stenzel  a neonatologist with Minnesota Neonatal Physicians  in calling attention to the price increases for the drug    Klobuchar said  This company is exploiting a life saving drug to engage in price gouging at the expense of vulnerable  premature babies  Even though its an American company  the price they charge in the U S  is actually 44 times higher than what they sell it for in Canada  Nothing can justify that kind of huge price disparity          Please find the text of the letter below    April 25  2008   The Honorable William E  Kovacic  Chairman  U S  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Ave  N W   Washington  D C  20580   Dear Commissioner    I am writing to request that the Federal Trade Commission initiate a formal investigation into any potential anticompetitive conduct or consequence arising out of OVATION Pharmaceuticals market actions and dominance in the area of nonsurgical treatments for PDA  a disorder impacting certain infants hearts shortly after birth   particularly regarding a dramatic 18 fold increase in price that the company has applied to the drug intravenous indomethacin since acquiring its rights in 2006     Intravenous indomethacin  sold by OVATION under the name Indocin I V   is a drug used to treat patent ductus arteriosis  PDA   a rare cardiac disorder that can affect premature infants  Since its approval in the 1970s  the drug has become the most frequently used  cost effective method for treating this disorder  which prevents holes within the chamber of an infants heart from sealing shortly after birth  OVATION Pharmaceuticals drastically raised the price after acquiring the distribution rights from Merck  There are serious questions about  and the need for your Commissions expertise  to review the suggested justifications for this price increase  since costs related to marketing  physician education  and research would appear to have been stable since OVATION began distributing the drug     I am also concerned that OVATION is the sole source of intravenous ibuprofen  the only other FDA approved drug on the market for PDA  Published studies have indicated that the drug may be as effective as indomethacin in treating the disease  OVATION offers their intravenous ibuprofen product at a price that is comparable to Indocin I V     I am concerned that the companys purchase of Indocin drug may have resulted in OVATION becoming the sole source for non surgical drug treatment for PDA  and may lead to a monopolization of nonsurgical treatments for PDA    Unfortunately  Indocin I V  is not the only pediatric drug treatment to see a dramatic price increase  Recently  the cost of H P  Acthar Gel  a drug used to treat children with epilepsy  rose from  1600 to  23 000 a vial  This staggering price increase proves that drug manufacturers are putting profits before patients  Further  an April 2008 New York Times article exposed the pricing activities of pharmacy benefit managers  who appear able to inflate prices for specialty drugs like H P  Acthar Gel by entering into exclusive distribution arrangements with drug companies  While Ovation has assured my staff that it has no such exclusive distribution agreements  the FTC may wish to consider the implications of these relationships  in restraining a competitive specialty drugs market    In a time where rising prices for prescription drugs stretch the budgets of Medicare and Medicaid and threaten the stability of our nations economy  we must be vigilant in stopping any effort to prohibit access to vital medicine  To minimize the exploitation of the market  I urge the FTC to investigate the pricing and potential monopolization of nonsurgical treatments of PDA by OVATION Pharmaceuticals     Thank you for your attention to my request  If you require additional information  please contact Ryan Crowley of my office at 202 224 3244         Sincerely         Amy Klobuchar       United States Senate
