                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     August 2  2007 Washington  D C   U S    D MN  issued the following statement on the floor of the Senate this evening  in recognition of the recent tragedy in Minneapolis    I thank my colleague  Senator Coleman  for those fine words and his description of the history of Mississippi River which is such an important part  as he noted  of our state s history     But for me its personal  I live only eight blocks from where this bridge buckled under and this is a place where everyday I drive with my husband and our 12 year old daughter  as I looked down at that bridge  when I stood on the sides and saw that school bus just barely hanging to the side of that falling concrete  I thought of those drivers I thought of those other moms with their kids in the back seat     That on an August day  maybe going to the Twins game or driving home from work  never did they expect that a massive eight lane interstate highway bridge would suddenly buckle to the ground  That s what we saw when we went there this morning    But the other thing that I saw  that I come back to tell the nation is that there are little miracles every day  the miracle of that school bus  where kids from a very poor neighborhood in Minneapolis were sitting in that bus and somehow were saved  Acts of heroism  a woman diver that went in and back in and back in without any safety equipment among the concrete and shards looking for survivors     This was a disaster that no one expected but it was something that our city and our state had planned for  We learned the lessons from 9 11  we had many practices for these kinds of disasters     I was the former prosecutor for this area and I remember meeting with the sheriff and the police chief and we planned the drills and we went through them and you could see the results today  You could see the lives that were saved     When we got in today and drove on this highway there were actually billboards  billboards already up telling people how to get around the scene and 24 busses added to the transit service already at 6 00 a m  in the morning and advertised so people could get to work  This is going to be a model as we go forward for how to handle national disasters     The Mississippi River starts in Minnesota    you can walk across it  as Senator Coleman noted  You go down and it gets bigger and bigger and soon it ends  Mr  President  It ends in New Orleans  I think about what happened today and I think of a bigger and more massive disaster with Katrina and how that was handled and how people in Washington responded     In some way I think of those people stranded on those roofs  I think of the mirror of those people was a reflection of leadership and a lack of leadership  We re not going to let that happen in Minnesota  We know this is not the massive disaster of Katrina  but it is a huge mess and it involved a loss of life     So  we are coming together  bipartisan  with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle    Senator Reid is fully behind this  Senator Durbin  Senator Schumer  Senator Murray  they all talked to me already this morning  They pledged their support  So  what we have proposed with the work with Senator Coleman  we are working together on this with the Republican leadership  is that we get a bill passed tonight to at least authorize a lifting of the cap so we can move forward for emergency disaster relief     I think that this is also a reminder  Mr  President  as we go forward  that we have to invest in our in nation    in our nation s infrastructure  We do not know the cause  I learned as a prosecutor you do not come to conclusions unless you know the cause     Its a reminder we need to invest in our long term infrastructure and we need to have the emergency funds in place because a bridge like this in the middle of America shouldn t just fall into a river on an August day     We need to get to the bottom of this and we will rebuild this bridge and we will rebuild this country  Our prayers are with the families  our thoughts are with the rescue workers  we thank them for working throughout the night     We thank our hospital personnel and our firefighters and our police officers and the ordinary citizens that were just walking by right in the middle of the University of Minnesota campus and dove into that river to help     This was a true spirit of Minnesota and the world watched last night  Thank you  I thank my colleagues for their support and all the help they ve given us as we move further  This is going to be a long process  it s not just going to end tonight  Our goal is to get this bridge rebuilt and to get our city moving again  Thank you very much  I yield the floor
