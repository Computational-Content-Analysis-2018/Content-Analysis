with Long Term Care Insurance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          October 31  2007 Washington  D C     U S  Senators Amy Klobuchar  D MN  and Barbara Mikulski  D MD  today introduced federal legislation to assist families who care for aging family members and to ensure the integrity of long term care insurance policies  The legislation is designed as a starting point to relieve the financial and other burdens faced by family caregivers  Seniors want to be able to live independently and stay in their own homes as long as possible  and family support is essential to making that option available  said Klobuchar  Millions of families already find themselves as members of the Sandwich Generation  coping with the challenges and costs of care for elderly parents at the same time as they are caring for their own children  As the baby boom generation ages  the numbers will continue to grow  Just as the country addressed the needs of working moms and dads in the 1970s  we must now address the needs of our working daughters and sons  When I came to Congress  I vowed to do everything I could not just to support research   the search for a cure or a cognitive stretch out   but also to create a safety net for families  We know the family is always the first caregiver  said Senator Mikulski  I am so proud to stand with Senator Klobuchar to take another modest step towards giving caregivers the resources and assistance they need  In the coming years  the United States will experience the dramatic effects of an age wave as the Baby Boom generation retires and a growing number of people live into their 80s and beyond  According to the Third Way  the fastest growing segment of our population are Americans age 80 and over  while more than 44 percent of adults aged 45 55 had aging parents or in laws as well as children under the age of 21  Adult children are the most common providers of informal care  and many also provide direct financial assistance to their parents  1  The result is a Sandwich Generation of Americans caring both for children and for aging parents  and incurring the related costs  The two bills introduced today  the AGE  Americans Giving care to Elders  Act and the Long Term Care Insurance Integrity Act  seek to relieve the burden on the Sandwich Generation    Enhance support for family caregivers by establishing the National Caregiving Resource Center as a central clearinghouse where families  public agencies and private organizations can learn about best practices and promising innovations to support families in their caregiving roles  The legislation will also strengthen the National Family Caregiver Support Program which helps fund direct services to family caregivers    Provide financial relief to family caregivers by creating a tax credit for elder care costs  Families will be able to qualify for up to  1 200 each year to offset a wide range of costs in caring for an aging or ailing relative  The tax credit will begin to phase out for families making over  120 000 per year and will be eliminated for families making over  200 000    Protect consumers with long term care insurance by establishing a third party review board to address one of the most common complaints about these policies  the denial of appropriate and timely benefits by insurance companies  Currently  those who are denied benefits must seek recourse through the court system  which is expensive and time consuming at a time when people are most vulnerable and in need  While some 8 million Americans have already purchased long term care insurance policies  there have been growing complaints about the refusal of insurance companies to pay out appropriate and timely benefits  The legislation has been endorsed by the Family Caregiver Alliance  National Alliance for Caregiving  National Association of Area Agencies on Aging  National Rural Health Association  Senior Citizens League  and Third Way  We know how hard caregivers work and the strain they feel  I will keep fighting for legislation to make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans caring for an aging loved one  said Senator Mikulski  I believe we must approach chronic diseases like Alzheimers with the urgency it needs  but while we search we must help the caregivers who are giving so much of themselves  This approach is good for our seniors  for our families  for our businesses and employers  and for all of us as taxpayers  said Klobuchar  Senator Mikulski  Chairman of the Retirement and Aging Subcommittee of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  was one of the key authors of the Older American Act Amendments of 2006 and has been a tireless advocate for aging in place and caregiver initiatives  Senator Klobuchar chaired a Congressional Joint Economic Committee hearing in May about the impact of elder care responsibilities on families and employers  She has also held several roundtable discussions in Minnesota with family caregivers
