                                                                                                          December 13  2007 Washington  D C   Today  as part of the Senate Energy Bill  the U S  Senate passed the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act of 2007 to reduce hazards posed by dangerous swimming pool drains  The legislation includes key amendments authored by Senator Klobuchar  which ensure that stronger safety standards will apply to both new and existing pools  Klobuchar also succeeded in including language that ensures pools have additional safety measures to eliminate the risk of injury or death from entrapment  This is strong legislation that will make sure no more innocent children are hurt enjoying a day at the pool  said Klobuchar  An accident can change someones life forever  Parents shouldnt have to worry about their children getting stuck in a drain when they go to the local pool  Senator Mark Pryor  Chairman of the Consumer Affairs Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee  commended Klobuchars work  We cant stand idly by  especially when the solution to install safe drain covers is so obvious and simple  Pryor said  I appreciate Senator Klobuchars unyielding efforts to enhance pool safety and help protect kids from preventable accidents  In the summer of 2007  six year old Abigail Taylor of Edina  Minnesota was severely injured at a wading pool in St  Louis Park when she accidentally sat over an open drain hole who cover had come loose or been removed  The drains powerful suction force tore out most of her small intestines  Abigail was hospitalized for weeks and underwent several surgeries  She is expected to need a feeding tube for the rest of her life  Klobuchar has been spoken with Abigails parents several times since the tragedy  Abbey is an amazing little girl  and the Taylor family has such a positive spirit  said Klobuchar  Their work to help make this legislation happen  and willingness to speak out to so we can prevent incidents like this from occurring to other children in the future has been an inspiration  Klobuchar added  This little girls courage has now become an inspiration for change in Washington  In 2005  the U S  Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a report saying that  since 1990  at least 130 people  mostly children  have been entrapped by the suction force of pool and spa drains  resulting in 27 deaths and many more emergency room visits and hospitalizations  The legislation is named the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act in memory of the seven year old granddaughter of former U S  Secretary of State James Baker  Five years ago  she drowned in a hot tub at a graduation party when the drains powerful suction trapped her underwater  It took two adults to pry her body free from the drain  Co sponsored with Senators Mark Pryor  D AR   Chris Dodd  D CT  and Ted Stevens  R AK   the legislation will    Prohibit the manufacture  sale or distribution of drain covers that do not meet anti entrapment safety standards established by the U S  Consumer Product Safety Commission      Create an incentive grant program for states to adopt comprehensive pool safety laws requiring certain safety devices in swimming pools to protect children     Establish a National Drowning Prevention Program within the Consumer Product Safety Commission     Require public pools to incorporate anti entrapment drain covers and other layers of protection  In the original bill  the new safety standards applied only to new pools  In Commerce Committee action last July  Klobuchar secured passage of her amendment extending the new safety standards to existing public pools  including those at apartment complexes  fitness clubs and other sites intended for multiple users  This fall  Klobuchar successfully added language that will require additional layers of protection for public pools  such as simple technology to shut off pool suction when a drain is blocked  Klobuchar has worked on this bipartisan legislation with Congressman Jim Ramstad  R MN  and proponents on the House Energy and Commerce Committee  Theres a saying that when an accident happens that could have been reasonably prevented  its not really an accident at all  its actually a failure  said Klobuchar  In the case of injuries and deaths caused by pool entrapment  its not a failure by children or their parents  Its a failure of our safety laws  which means its within our power to correct with reasonable measures like those in this legislation
