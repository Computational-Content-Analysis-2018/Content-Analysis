                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    At Klobuchar s request  USDA agrees to buy up  50 million in surplus pork for nutrition programs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 May 1  2008 Washington  D C   U S   announced that the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  will purchase  50 million in surplus pork to help pork producers who have been devastated by a combination of low hog prices and high input costs  USDA will donate the food to school lunch programs and other federal nutrition services  Klobuchar sent a letter two weeks ago urging the USDA Secretary  Ed Schafer  to help stabilize prices and help Minnesota pork producers who have been hit hard with the crisis  Klobuchar spoke by phone yesterday with Secretary Schafer emphasizing the importance and urgency of the situation   Plunging hog prices have created a crisis in an industry that is vital to our states economy  Klobuchar said  Some of our working families are being hit by a combination of economic forces completely beyond their control  I appreciate Secretary Schafers responsiveness and will continue to push to help Minnesotas pork producers in this difficult time    The Minnesota Pork Producers Association  MPPA  Executive Director David Preissler commented on the decision  Id like to thank Senator Klobuchar for her swift attention to this issue and for making personal contact with the Secretary  MPPA is very appreciative of her efforts  This is a win for people who need nutrition assistance and it also helps pork producers in Minnesota    In April  wholesale pork prices hit their lowest level in four years  At the same time  pork producers are paying record prices for inputs such as feed and fuel  Earlier in April  250 pork producers convened an emergency meeting in Mankato  Minnesota  to address this crisis  and many expressed concerns to Klobuchars office that their operations would not survive the year under current conditions    Minnesota is the nations No  3 pork producer  with 2 500 farms and more than 20 000 jobs in hog production and pork processing  By one estimate  the U S  pork industry could lose as much as  3 5 billion this year    Section 32 of the 1935 federal Farm Bill gives the Secretary of Agriculture authority to buy commodities in time of market surpluses to stabilize farm income and supply federal nutrition programs  Klobuchars letter to Schafer to use federal authority that allows the Department of Agriculture to buy surplus commodities  taking them off the market and donating them to school lunch programs and other federal nutrition services   This is exactly the kind of market crisis that Congress had in mind  and it is time for USDA to use that authority  Klobuchar said    The full text of the Klobuchars letter from last month is below      April 18  2008   The Honorable Ed Schafer  Secretary  U S  Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Avenue S W   Washington  D C  20250   Dear Secretary Schafer    I write to urge you to take prompt action to support American pork producers who are facing severe economic hardship due to falling hog prices and rising input costs    Pork producers across the country are currently facing the lowest cash prices for hogs in four years  at a time when the costs of feed and energy are soaring to record highs  Earlier this week  250 pork producers convened an emergency meeting in Mankato  Minnesota to address this crisis  and many expressed concerns that their operations would not survive the year under current conditions  Nationwide  these conditions may result in losses to hog farmers of more than  3 billion this year     Minnesota ranks third in the nation in pork production  with more than 10 million animals raised on 2 500 farms each year  Hog farming also provides more than 20 000 jobs and  7 billion in economic activity to the state each year    I am deeply concerned for the future of pork production in Minnesota and the country if quick action is not taken  I therefore urge you to use Section 32 funds to purchase surplus pork for use in USDA nutrition programs     As you know  under Section 32 of the Act of August 24  1935  the Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to support farm prices by purchasing surplus commodities for use in school lunches and other domestic food programs  This will not only assist our pork producers in weathering the current crisis  but it will also provide a much needed boost to schools  child care centers  food banks and other domestic food providers who have come under extreme pressure from rising unemployment and reduced commodity donations from USDA    I thank you for your consideration of this request  and for your continued work in support of American farmers         Sincerely         s         Amy Klobuchar       United States Senator
