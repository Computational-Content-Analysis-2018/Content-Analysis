System   This would lead to greater sharing of information between counties and also increased protection of the Duluth airport  international border and ship port  When I was County Attorney I would often meet with law enforcement officials across our state to discuss best practices and areas for improvement  It became very clear very quickly that they needed tools to help them better communicate between jurisdictions  especially in our rural areas  said Klobuchar  Im pleased to see that my efforts to help these counties made significant headway today  Also included in the bill are the
