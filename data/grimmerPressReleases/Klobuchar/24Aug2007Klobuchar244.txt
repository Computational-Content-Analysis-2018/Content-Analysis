the president s declaration of six southeastern Minnesota counties as emergency disaster areas will bring much needed federal aid to the flood ravaged region    The declaration means federal assistance will be available for affected families  businesses  farmers  and public infrastructure  The assistance will take the form of grants up to a maximum of  28 200 and low interest loans to help replace housing  personal property  business structures and inventory  and crops    I spoke with the president earlier this week and impressed on him the need for fast federal action to assist this entire flood damaged area  said Klobuchar  This federal aid provides the foundation for the enormous task of rebuilding homes and businesses as well as roads and bridges  And it s an opportunity to rebuild hope for these communities and their residents who ve suffered so much but also demonstrated so much strength in these difficult days    Strong communities are a hallmark of southern Minnesota  but some disasters are too large for even the strongest community to withstand on its own  There has already been an outpouring of private support from around the state and the nation  and I am glad that the federal government is ready to do its part to help the survivors pick up the pieces  Walz said    Minnesota Families    The emergency declaration today will qualify many Minnesota
