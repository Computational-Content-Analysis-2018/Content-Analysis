                                                                                     April 21  2007  Washington  D C   Today  U S   delivered the national Democratic response to President Bush s weekly radio address  Klobuchar discussed her recent visit to Iraq where she met with Minnesota troops and Iraqi and U S  officials  Klobuchar also spoke about the tragic events which occurred on the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University campus on Monday  Senator Klobuchar s address was carried nationwide as well across Minnesota on radio stations that subscribe to news services such as ABC  CBS  CNN  AP  UPI or USA  Full text of Senator Klobuchar s radio address is below  Good morning  This is  from Minnesota  I first extend my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those so tragically killed and wounded this week at Virginia Tech  Among those who died  an engineering professor and Holocaust survivor who barricaded the door to his classroom to save the lives of his students  And a 19 year old girl who grew up in the foothills of the Shenandoah Mountains and dreamed of becoming a veterinarian  As a former prosecutor  I learned early on that whenever someone dies from unconscionable violence  their families and those who loved them suffer more then we can ever imagine  All of us are affected as we step back and mourn the senseless loss of so many innocent lives  Knowing that the victims could have been anyone s children  it reminds us that ours is a country built on the simple idea that we wrap our arms around those who suffer and sacrifice in times of need and through even the worst of tragedies  we join together   because what unites us is always stronger than what divides us  This spirit of cooperation inspires the very best in each one of us   and it inspires the very best in our nation  It is with this same spirit that Democrats in Congress continue to reach out to the President for a change of course in the war in Iraq  Last month  I visited Baghdad and Fallujah and saw   firsthand   the bravery and commitment of our troops  Three thousand of the 22 000 troops involved in the surge are Minnesota National Guard and Reserve members who were expected home many months ago  When I met these soldiers in Iraq  they didn t talk about war policy  They didn t complain about the heat  They didn t complain about their extensions  They only wanted answers to a few questions  who won the state hockey tournament  Did I have any more Twins baseball caps  And would I call their moms and dads and husbands and wives when I got home   and tell them they were OK  When our soldiers signed up to serve our country  there wasn t a waiting line  When they come home  they should not be shunted to the end of the line  These are first class soldiers  and they should be treated as first class soldiers when they come home  with the benefits and support they deserve  But the very best thing we can do for our troops is to get this policy right   This means sending a clear message to the Iraqi government that we are not staying there indefinitely  This means  as recommended by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group  that we begin the process of redeploying our troops with the goal of withdrawing combat forces by next year   while acknowledging that some troops may stay  to train the Iraqi police  to provide security for those who remain  and to conduct special operations  This means not a surge in troops but a surge in diplomacy  economy and Iraqi responsibility  Our troops have done what you ve asked them to do  Mr  President  They deposed an evil dictator  They gave the Iraqi people the opportunity to vote and establish a new government  And now the Iraqi government has the responsibility to govern  Last week  I went to the White House and met with the President   along with three other senators  including two Republicans  I appreciated the time he took to honestly discuss our points of agreement and disagreement on the war  I told him that now is the time to forge cooperation with our Democrats in Congress  My most enduring memory from Iraq was standing on the tarmac of the Baghdad airport  I was called over by nine firefighters  proud members of the Duluth National Guard  They were there doing their duty   standing tall and showing their respect as six caskets  each draped in the American flag  were carried onto the plane  The firefighters didn t know the soldiers who died  But they saluted each time as  one after another  these fallen soldiers were carried off from the sands of Iraq to the arms of their grieving families  who will never be the same  Our troops have been standing tall in Iraq  Now is the time for our leaders in Washington to stand tall  We urge the President to work with Congress to pass a bill that   finally  after four years   begins a responsible change of course in Iraq and gives our brave soldiers the help they need when they come home  This is  from Minnesota  Thank you for listening
