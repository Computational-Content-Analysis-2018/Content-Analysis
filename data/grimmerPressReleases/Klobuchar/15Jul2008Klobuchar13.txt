

Gasification Project  and Lewis   Clark Rural Water System for southern Minnesota                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             July 15  2008 Washington  D C   Continuing her efforts to secure funding for important statewide initiatives  U S   announced that over  45 454 000 has cleared a major hurdle by passing through the Senate Appropriations Committee on Energy and Water  The projects  included in the appropriations bill  will now be sent to the full Senate for consideration    Klobuchar secured  2 8 million for the continuation of work on the Red River of the North Flood Control project in Breckenridge  After the massive Red River basin floods of 1997  government officials decided to implement permanent flood damage reduction projects for the communities along the river  including Breckenridge  Funding announced today will go towards a high flow diversion channel and two separate permanent levee reaches that will protect all of Breckenridge   Early federal support was vital to Minnesotans efforts to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the 97 floods  said Klobuchar  This summers flooding in the Midwest demonstrated how important these projects are to help communities avoid catastrophe  Flood projects like this can mean the difference between life and death and minor damage and total destruction    Along with five senators from South Dakota  Iowa and Minnesota  Klobuchar announced further federal funding allocations for the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System  Klobuchar announced today that  30 million would be sent to the project for the construction of a water pipeline that will provide clean water from the Missouri River to over 300 000 people in Minnesota  South Dakota and Iowa through its 20 member cities and rural water systems    This important initiative will provide fresh  clean drinking water to people across southern Minnesota  said Klobuchar  In the land of 10 000 lakes  we value clean water and this project will deliver that to families and businesses    In addition  Klobuchar secured  700 000 towards a new Plasma Gasification Waste To Energy facility in Koochiching County that converts municipal solid wastes into energy and other marketable by products in an environmentally sound manner  The Renewable Energy Clean Air Project  RECAP  would use the funds to conduct a feasibility study to assess technical  economic and environmental matters    This is the type of innovation and leadership that we need to achieve energy security  said Klobuchar  At a time of skyrocketing energy costs it is important that we invest in new technologies and the homegrown energy that will create new jobs and fuel our future    Senator Klobuchar secured  1 million for the expansion of the Waste to Energy facility shared by Pope and Douglas Counties  The expansion is needed in order to meet the growing needs of the two counties  The Waste to Energy facility provides steam energy to neighboring businesses  such as the 3M Manufacturing plant and the Douglas County Hospital  and produces 500 kilowatts per hour of electricity for the Waste to Energy facility itself   The Pope Douglas Waste to Energy facility is an example of Minnesotans leading the push for homegrown energy  said Klobuchar  Projects like this can create good jobs in Minnesota while capturing new energy sources  reducing our dependence on foreign oil  and protecting the environment    Klobuchar also secured  10 million for a program to improve navigation efficiency and environmental restoration efforts on the Upper Mississippi River  The Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program works to ensure economic and environmental sustainability of the Upper Mississippi River System  It aims to reduce commercial traffic delays and protect and restore the environment    Klobuchar was also successful in securing funding for a public use harbor and dock in Duluth  The McQuade Road Safe Harbor Project includes a three acre harbor where small craft can be protected during storms  ramps for boat and kayak launching  and adjustable docks  The facility also includes fishing spots and sidewalks above the shore and an underpass beneath Scenic Highway 61    In addition  Klobuchar obtained funding to guard against floods in Granite Falls  Minnesota  The funding will be used to relocate a water treatment plant as part of the Granite Falls Flood Control Project    Klobuchar secured funding for the restoration of Minnehahas Painter Creek  a water system which was straightened for agricultural uses in the early 1900s    Klobuchar also pushed through other major Minnesota environment and water initiatives      300 000 for repairing two levees damaged by ice in April 2005 in Crookston  MN     227 000 for funding towards the Marsh Lake Aquation Ecosystem Feasibility study which would identify measures to restore more than 5 000 acres of wetland habitat within the existing reservoir and to reconnect Lac qui Parle to more than 750 miles of streams in the Pomme de Terre River basin  This restoration would allow more Minnesota hunters  anglers  birders  canoeists and outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy thousands of migratory waterfowl and other birds and fish      350 000 for use by the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District for flood mitigation between Lake Itasca and Lock and Dam  2  near Hastings  MN    It s our responsibility to provide communities with clean drinking water  protect our homes and businesses from flooding and restore our beloved rivers and lakes said Klobuchar  Today we took a significant step in making sure that we invest in infrastructure to allow communities to grow and our ecosystems to prosper
