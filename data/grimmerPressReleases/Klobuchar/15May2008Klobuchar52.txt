for during negotiations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             May 15  2008 Washington  D C   U S  s efforts to include reform of federal farm payments and groundbreaking investments in cellulosic biofuels in the 2008 Farm Bill passed as part of the final bill today by a vote of 81 15 in the Senate  The final reform language is close to the eligibility caps that Klobuchar authored last year and represents an important step toward payment reform  Klobuchar also helped to strengthen the safety net for Minnesota farmers and provide the first ever permanent disaster assistance that passed in the final bill    This bill not only takes a significant step toward payment reform  but makes critical investments in nutrition  conservation  and renewable energy that are vital to all Americans  said Klobuchar  This is a good bill for Minnesota farmers and ranchers  and I want to thank our Committee Chairmen  Representative Collin Peterson and Senator Tom Harkin  for their leadership in negotiating a strong and bipartisan bill    Agriculture Committee Chairman Harkin  D IA  recognized Sen  Klobuchars work on the historic energy provisions in the Farm Bill stating     Senator Klobuchar from the beginning advocated strong new incentives for farmers to produce energy crops and support for rural energy facilities and biorefineries  in addition to common sense reform of farm payments  It was obvious she was listening to Minnesotans and carrying their message to the Senate    Klobuchars groundbreaking provision to invest in cellulosic biofuels was modeled after her Farm to Fuel Investment Act  which aims to reduce American dependence on foreign oil by providing incentives for farmers to grow dedicated energy crops  such as switchgrass  which can be grown on marginal land solely for the purpose of producing energy    This is a forward looking farm bill that will foster advances in cellulosic biofuels that will fuel the future  said Klobuchar  This is a significant investment in the next generation of renewable  home grown energy that will help create jobs and new economies in Minnesota and across America    Klobuchar was also a leading voice for reform in the Senate bill  Her reform proposal received a majority vote in the Senate last year  but procedural rules required 60 votes for the amendment to become a part of the overall Farm Bill  The final legislation makes anyone with non farm income exceeding  500 000 ineligible for all federal commodity payments  a measure designed to make sure that federal support goes to working farmers  It also will make individuals with farm income exceeding  750 000  after expenses  ineligible for direct payments    This has been an uphill struggle  Klobuchar said  But it was worth the effort to make sure that we are spending the publics money wisely and that federal support is going to the nations hardworking farmers and not to urban millionaires    Klobuchar also worked to strengthen the safety net for Minnesota farmers  The final legislation made crucial improvements to the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  Program and increased the loan rates for the successful sugar program which Klobuchar has advocated for  The final legislation will increase the payment rate in the MILC program back to 45  from the current 34  and raise the sugar loan rate by over  cent per pound in the sugar program    These are critical programs for Minnesotas dairy farmers and sugar producers  said Klobuchar  These improvements will help Minnesotas dairy and sugar producers continue to deliver reliable products and support these industries that contribute billions of dollars to the states economy    The legislation passed today includes long overdue permanent disaster assistance  which Klobuchar was successful in helping include in the final legislation  This provision is particularly important to Minnesota and neighboring states that have seen droughts  flooding and other disasters in years  The provision will help family farmers with the financial fallout of natural disasters and bad weather   The permanent disaster program means a great deal to our farmers and ranchers in the Midwest facing financial hardships  said Klobuchar  Our hardworking families shouldnt have to come to Congress with a tin cup when they are struggling to stay in business during severe cycles of drought and flooding    Klobuchar also was pleased to see that the final funding for conservation programs was increased by more than   4 billion in the final bill  The conservation title is vital to improve the effectiveness of programs that help Minnesotas environment while ensuring that Minnesota farmers and ranchers will continue to have rich and productive farmland     Im very proud that we have provided the necessary resources to increase the effectiveness of our conservation programs to protect our water quality and provide habitat for wildlife  said Klobuchar  To see video of Senator Klobuchars statement click
