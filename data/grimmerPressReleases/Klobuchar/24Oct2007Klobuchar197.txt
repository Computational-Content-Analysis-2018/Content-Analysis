D Mich    Following is the text of the letter sent by the members of the Senate Womens Caucus on Burma to Prime Minister Singh  October 23  2007 The Honorable Manmohan Singh  Prime Minister  Republic of India  New Delhi  India Dear Prime Minister Singh     We are writing to ask your government to join the growing international condemnation of Burma s military government and its brutal repression of its own citizens  As the worlds largest democracy  India should use its influence to put pressure on the regime to stop the violence against pro democracy activists  release all political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi  and begin a true national dialogue on national reconciliation that will lead to a restoration of democratic government  We believe that the United States and India share a firm commitment to the rule of law and democracy  a quest to expand prosperity and economic opportunity worldwide  and a desire to increase mutual security against the common threats posed by intolerance and terrorism  Because of these values that we share  we are concerned that recent actions by India  including high level visits by members of your government to Burma  may be interpreted as implicitly supporting the military junta  the State Peace and Development Council  We understand that Petroleum Minister Murli Deora visited Burma  even as the protests were reaching a crescendo  to discuss energy cooperation and to sign a deep water exploration deal     In addition  we are also deeply concerned about reports of India s ongoing military and technological support for the military government in Burma  We understand that India has supplied the Burmese military with military hardware  including field guns and howitzers  The Indian Navy has provided the Burmese military with BN 2 Defender Islander maritime surveillance aircraft  deck based air defense guns and surveillance equipment     We understand India s geopolitical imperatives and its desire to maintain good neighborly relations with Burma  We appreciate the threat posed by militant groups in northeastern India close to the Burma border  As the host to thousands of Burmese seeking refuge in India  the threat of an increasing torrent of refugees is certainly of serious concern to you     But we firmly believe that any support for Burma s current government will only aggravate these problems  A stable  representative civilian government in Burma will be the best ally in addressing these problems     As a regional leader and one of the chief trading partners of Burma s government  India has a unique responsibility to help democratic forces in Burma  Mr  Prime Minister  as proponents of closer ties between the United States and India  we urge you to join the United States in leading the global effort to support the people of Burma  Sincerely   Senator Dianne Feinstein  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison   Senator Barbara Boxer   Senator Maria Cantwell  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  Senator Susan Collins  Senator Elizabeth Dole    Senator Mary Landrieu   Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln  Senator Claire McCaskill   Senator Barbara Mikulski   Senator Lisa Murkowski   Senator Patty Murray   Senator Olympia Snowe  Senator Debbie Stabenow Cc  The Honorable Nicholas Burns   Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs
