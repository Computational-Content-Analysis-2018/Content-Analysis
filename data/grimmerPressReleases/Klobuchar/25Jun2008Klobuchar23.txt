                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     June 25  2008 Washington  D C After sending a letter to President Bush supporting a Presidential Disaster Declaration for four southern Minnesota counties severely damaged by recent flooding  Senators Amy Klobuchar  Norm Coleman and Congressman Tim Walz announced today the President has responded and a declared major disaster for Fillmore  Freeborn  Houston  and Mower Counties  The four counties sustained an estimated  8 3 million in damage due to the flooding  These counties are now eligible to receive aid through FEMAs Public Assistance Program  Public Assistance is oriented to public entities and can fund the repair  restoration  reconstruction  or replacement of a public facility or infrastructure  which is damaged or destroyed by a disaster  State officials  assisted by FEMA  will conduct Applicant Briefings for State  local and PNP officials to inform them about the assistance available and how to apply for it    These communities have shown tremendous courage and resilience since the floods hit  Klobuchar said  But at a time like this local communities should not be expected to fend for themselves  The federal government has an essential role to support communities as they recover and rebuild  and Im proud that we will be able to deliver help quickly    All four of these counties have experienced their second serious flood in just a few short years  This presidential declaration allows affected cities to obtain hazard mitigation funding that can help prevent flooding in the future  said Congressman Walz  Businesses like Austin Packaging Company are counting on federal dollars to help make it possible for them to continue operations in our area  I believe this declaration will make the difference for APC and others who are trying to recover and plan for the future    Southeastern Minnesota is in need of assistance right now  and this disaster declaration will help the region recover  said Coleman  After visiting the flood stricken areas  I saw firsthand the toll the storms took on these communities  A Presidential Disaster Declaration will deliver the assistance these counties need to rebuild their communities and their lives  I applaud the President for this decision    it will make all the difference for an area of the state that has endured great hardship     The support letter sent by Klobuchar  Coleman and Walz  followed an official submission for assistance by Governor Pawlenty who requested federal assistance to help respond to the flooding of June 7 8th and 11 12th that severely impacted Houston  Fillmore  Mower and Freeborn counties     The text of the letter follows     Dear President Bush     As representatives of communities devastated by last weeks flooding throughout the Midwest  we are writing to request your assistance as residents of southern Minnesota begin to recover     On June 7 8  2008  up to 10 inches of rain fell across southern Minnesota  causing flash floods  mudslides  evacuations  power outages  and numerous injuries  Just three days later  severe weather  including several tornado touchdowns  again developed over southern Minnesota  These storms dropped even more rain on already saturated ground and caused creeks and rivers to overflow their banks  This too resulted in devastation and one fatality     Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty has declared a State of Emergency in Freeborn  Fillmore  Houston  and Mower Counties  Additionally  he has determined that this incident is of such severity that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State  and to that end  he has requested a Presidential Disaster Declaration for these areas as well     Given the degree of damage to the region  we strongly encourage you to issue such a declaration and allow FEMA to begin to supplement state and local recovery efforts in these flood stricken areas     Tragically  Minnesotans have faced several disasters in the past year  and nowhere has this been truer than in Southeastern Minnesota where less than a year after historic flash flooding  they have been hit yet again with massive rainfalls which have tested their ability to recover  We are confident that  just as they did with the floods of last August  the residents of southeast Minnesota will recover and rebuild  and we urge you to make the federal government a full partner in that effort     Thank you for your consideration of this request and for your assistance in helping the recovery and rebuilding effort in southern Minnesota
