                                                                                                           Includes Funding for Northstar Commuter Rail  Central Corridor  Hastings Bridge Replacement  and other vital transportation infrastructure projects throughout Minnesota                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         July 11  2008 Washington  D C   U S   announced today that Minnesota could receive over  101 million in federal funding for Minnesota projects as part of the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2009  Klobuchar said funding for Minnesota transportation initiatives was included in the bill that cleared committee late yesterday and will now be sent to the full Senate for consideration     Senator Klobuchar secured  2 million towards the replacement of the Hastings Bridge in Hastings  Minnesota  with work scheduled to begin by 2010  The bridge  which carries 32 000 motorists per day over the Mississippi River between Dakota and Washington Counties on Highway 61 has multiple structural problems and is sorely in need of replacement  The Minnesota Department of Transportation is currently implementing interim repair measures until the new bridge can be built   Thousands of Minnesotans rely on this bridge everyday and they need to know that it is safe  said Klobuchar  Infrastructure initiatives like this are critical in creating jobs to fuel the economy and provide safe and reliable transportation all Minnesota families    Klobuchar also secured  72 million for the Northstar Corridor commuter rail project  The 40 mile line from the Twin Cities northwest to Big Lake  will have station stops in Anoka  Coon Rapids  and Elk River  The proposed schedule will include five inbound and one outbound trip each weekday morning and five outbound and one inbound trip each weekday afternoon  The project also includes a four block extension of the Hiawatha light rail train line to reach the downtown Minneapolis commuter rail station    Minnesota deserves a 21st Century transportation system to match its 21st Century economy  Klobuchar said  The tremendous growth of communities along the I 94 corridor is one of the great success stories of the Upper Midwest  and Northstar will help to keep that growth on track     In addition  Klobuchar also secured  20 million for the development of an 11mile Central Corridor light rail commuter line connecting downtown St  Paul and downtown Minneapolis via the State Capitol  Midway  and the University of Minnesota  The project is expected to serve over 40 000 passengers each day by 2030    A growing metro area needs a forward looking transportation policy  one that gives people choices  gets them out of rush hour traffic and reduces congestion on our roads  Klobuchar said  The Central Corridor light rail commuter line is the next step in reducing the metro areas congestion    Klobuchar also was successful in securing funding for a vital congestion mitigation project for the severely congested I 35W Highway 10 area  Local access interchanges serving four major redevelopment projects and connections to the metro area beltway are expected to support over 14 200 new homes  42 000 jobs and over  4 6 billion in private investment in the area  Klobuchar secured  1 million for the project     Klobuchar secured an additional  1 million for the interchange at Highways 13 and 15 in Burnsville in order to reduce congestion and improve safety  The project has been identified by MnDOT  Dakota and Scott Counties  and the Cities of Burnsville and Savage as needing improvements to address safety  traffic operations  and access issues     Klobuchar also pushed to include  2 million for the U S  Highway 14 Partnerships project to provide a streamlined transportation option between New Ulm  Mankato  Waseca  Owatonna and Rochester with connections to other interregional corridors  State Highway 60  Interstate 35   Highway 14 is generally known as one of the most dangerous stretches of highways in Minnesota  The funding provides for safety and capacity improvement measures such as removing through traffic within cities and doubling the number of lanes to four    Additionally  Klobuchar secured funding for the following projects      1 million for the Minnesota Valley Railroad Authoritys rehabilitation of the Redwood Falls rail line     1 million for the development of the Cedar Avenue Corridor Transitway Bus and Rapid Transit project including the preliminary design  environmental documentation  development of stations and park and ride facilities along the corridor and shoulder improvements for transit operations in Dakota County     1 million to finish construction of Highway 610 from Highway 169 to I 94  completing the Highway 10 610 corridor from I 35W to I 94 in Maple Grove     1 million for safety improvements to the stretch of U S  Highway 59 between Clarksfield and Marshall  The 21 mile project will increase safety on the highway  widening the shoulder safety zones to six feet on each side
