Rules

Minnesotans as New Requirements Take Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             January 24  2008 U S   is urging Minnesotans to be aware of new identification requirements by the U S  Department of Homeland Security that will affect people crossing the border to Canada  The new rules take effect January 31st  Klobuchar said her office is available to assist Minnesotans with questions about the new requirements  People may call her office toll free at 1 888 224 9043 or visit her website at  Senator Klobuchar continues to push the Department of Homeland Security for additional time for border residents to prepare for the transition  and has already secured several delays in implementation  However  residents should be prepared for a January 31st start date for increased border identification requirements  and the June 2009 start time for passport or passport cards  Earlier this month  Klobuchar met with customs officials  business owners and residents in Minnesotas border cities  including International Falls  Warroad and Baudette  During my local visits on the border  Klobuchar said  I learned firsthand how these new regulations from the Department of Homeland Security will affect businesses  workers  hunters  anglers and families  While everyone wants to protect national security  its also important for the government to minimize the red tape for law abiding Minnesotans who want to travel to Canada  Since taking office  Klobuchar has been working to help Minnesotans comply with the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   which passed Congress in 2004 and is now taking effect  This new law requires that U S  citizens hold a passport for all international travel  including border crossings into Canada  For the many Minnesotans who do not already have passports  this new requirement might create a significant burden of time  money and inconvenience  To correct this problem  Klobuchar supported a cheaper and more convenient alternative passport card for travel between the U S  and Canada  Mexico and the Caribbean  Applications for these passport cards will be accepted beginning February 1  2008  A link to the application is available on Klobuchars Senate website at  Klobuchar also succeeded in delaying full implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative until June 2009 so Minnesotans traveling to Canada will not be tied up in red tape  As a result  until June 2009  a passport or passport card is not required as long as the U S  citizen can present a birth certificate and drivers license when crossing the border  Children are required to have proof of citizenship  such as a birth certificate  Below is a fact sheet from Senator Klobuchar with details on the new federal rules  Minnesotans can also get this information by calling her office toll free at 1 888 224 9043 or visiting her website at  WHAT MINNESOTANS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW U S  CANADA BORDER CROSSING RULES Beginning January 31  2008  the U S  Department of Homeland Security will no longer accept oral declarations of citizenship for travelers over age 19 who enter the U S  by land or sea  This changes what had been standard practice for decades  Below are the documents now required under the Homeland Securitys new regulations  If you have questions or need assistance  please contact Senator Klobuchars office at 1 888 224 9043 or visit her website at   Acceptable Documents as of January 31  2008   Only one of these documents is required   U S  or Canadian Passport    Birth Certificate

to have proof of citizenship  such as a birth certificate  For additional information please go to the   To Apply for a U S  Passport Card  Minnesotans can apply in advance for the new U S  Passport
