                                                                                                            Klobuchar Leads Hearing on the Importance of Examining the Nation s Bridges and Infrastructure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Senator testifies regarding I 35W bridge  questions witnesses including Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters September 20  2007 Washington  D C   At a Senate Environment and Publics Works committee hearing today  U S    D MN  said a critical investment in maintenance and major reconstruction of our nations transportation infrastructure is imperative  Klobuchar worked closely with Senator Barbara Boxer to secure the hearing to help ensure a tragedy like the I 35W bridge collapse never happens again  Klobuchar is a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  and chaired much of todays hearing  This wasnt a bridge over troubled waters  it was a troubled bridge over the water  said Klobuchar  Although we do not yet know the exact causes for the I 35W bridge collapse  this disaster has shocked Americans into a realization of how important it is to invest in safe  sound infrastructure  Klobuchar said it is crucial to know how fast the structurally deficient bridges can be replaced or improved  and what the best way is to fund Americas transportation infrastructure  Of the almost 600 000 bridges listed in the National Bridge Inventory  roughly 12  are classified as structurally deficient  functionally obsolete  or both  and more than 73 000 are structurally deficient  The estimated cost to fix all of the nations bridges is about  65 billion  When almost 12  of all American bridges are in need of serious repairit is time to act  said Klobuchar  When the Highway Trust Fund is projected to go into deficit in FY09there is a serious funding problem  When we are building new bridges  and not properly maintaining the ones we already have  there is a problem with our priorities  And when the American people question the integrity of the bridges they cross each and every dayit is a national embarrassment  Put all of this together  it is a call for action   I thank Senator Klobuchar for her strong leadership on the issue of bridge safety  said U S  Senator Barbara Boxer  D Calif    Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  She is an invaluable member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  Senator Klobuchars testimony  as delivered  Thank you Chairman Boxer and thank you Senator Coleman for joining us today  and thank you for holding this important hearing  The horrific collapse of the I 35W Bridge has provoked concern among all Americansnot just Minnesotansthat the bridges they drive across each day may not be safe  As I said the day after our bridge collapsed  In America  a bridge just should not fall down  Especially not an eight lane interstate highway  especially not one of the most heavily traveled bridges in the state  and especially not at rush hour in the heart of a major metropolitan area  But the I 35W Bridge in Minneapolis did fall down on August 1  And from what we know so far  this wasnt a bridge over troubled waters  it was a troubled bridge over waters    I cant even begin to count how many times that my husband  my daughter  and I drove across the I 35W Bridge  That bridge was not just in my backyard  it was in my front yard  It was eight blocks from our house  It was one of the most heavily traveled bridges in our State  an estimated 140 000 vehicles crossed that bridge every day  and our states economy loses an estimated  400 000 in revenue each day the bridge cannot be used  When I watched what unfolded that night  I was shocked and horrified  But on that evening and in the days that followed  the whole world watched as our state came together  I was proud to be a Minnesotan  We saw true heroes in the face of unimaginable circumstances  We saw off duty Minneapolis firefighter  who grabbed her life jacket and was among the first at the scene  Tethered to a yellow life rope  in the midst of broken concrete and tangled rebar  she swam from car to car searching for survivors  We saw that school bus perched precariously on the fallen bridge deck  I call it the Miracle Bus  Inside were dozens of kids from a local neighborhood who had been on a swimming field trip  Their bus was crossing the bridge when it dropped  Thanks to the quick action of responsible adults and the kids themselves  they all survived  Now  with the perspective of over a month  we can begin to look at this catastrophe and see  what can we take away  First  we must get to the bottom of why this enormous bridge suddenly fell down into the Mississippi River  killing 13 people and injuring 123  It didnt happen because of an earthquake or a barge collision  Something went terribly wrong and we need to get answers  As a former prosecutor  I know we must wait until all the evidence is in before we reach a verdict  We will need to be patient as the investigation continues  It will take time  but we need to know  Second  the emergency response to the bridge collapse demonstrated an impressive level of preparedness that should be a model for the nation  So many more people could have died  You can never feel good about a tragedy like this  But I feel good about our police officers  our firefighters  our paramedics and our other first responders  Third  we need to move ahead to build a new  safe bridge  Although the recovery and rebuilding efforts have only just begun  fast action in Washington has already helped pave the way  In just three days  Senator Coleman and I worked together in the Senate to secure  250 million in emergency bridge reconstruction funding  Representative Oberstar led the way in the House  Approval of this funding came with remarkable speed and bipartisan action  Capitol Hill veterans tell me it was a rare feat  aided by the unity among Minnesotas elected leaders across the political spectrum  Finally  America needs to come to grips with broader questions about our deteriorating infrastructure   Although we do not yet know the exact causes for the I 35W bridge collapse  this disaster has shocked Americans into a realization of how important it is to invest in safe  sound infrastructure  Unfortunately  it has taken a disaster to put the issue of infrastructure investment squarely on the national agenda  We must take steps to make sure no other bridge falls down like this  in Minnesota or anywhere else in the nation   I would also like to thank Secretary Peters for her efforts in the immediate aftermath of the bridge collapse  The early relief the Department provided helped Minnesota  And with the money that we appropriated last week with the Klobuchar Coleman Amendment to the Transportation Bill  Minnesota now has the initial funds to begin the rebuilding process  When the new bridge is completed  I know it will serve as a model of structural integrity and engineering for years to come  A critical investment in maintenance and major reconstruction of our nations transportation infrastructureespecially our bridgesis needed  As this map shows  of the almost 600 000 bridges listed in the National Bridge Inventory roughly  12  are classified as structurally deficient  That is almost 74 000 bridges  Now  what does structurally deficient mean  When inspectors evaluate a bridge they examine the bridges deck  superstructure  and the substructure  Each of these components are ranked on a scale of 0 to 9  with 0 being failed and 9 being excellent  If the deck  superstructure  or substructure is given a 4 or less  the bridge is classified as structurally deficient  And weve actually sent around to each senator a map of their state with the number of structurally deficient bridges in their state  As my colleagues can see  a rating of 4 or less includes corrosion or movement of key support beams  or advanced cracking and deterioration in the bridges foundation  In June of 2006  the I 35W Bridges superstructure    meaning the physical conditions of all structural members    was rated at a 4  The bridge s deck was rated 5  and the substructure  comprised of the piers  the footings and other components  was rated a 6  The Minnesota Department of Transportation was in the process of completing their 2007 inspection when the Bridge collapsed  As todays panelist will be able to tell usthere are plenty of bridges throughout the country with worst inspection records than the I 35W Bridge  When almost 12  of all the American bridges are in need of serious repairit is time to act  When the Highway Trust Fund is projected to go into deficit in FY09there is a serious funding problem  When we are building new bridges  and not properly maintaining the ones we already have  there is a problem with our priorities  And when the American people question the integrity of the bridges they cross each and every dayit is a national embarrassment  Put all of this together  and it is a call for action  It underlines the fact that my colleagues and I on this Committeewhich has been entrusted with the responsibility of building and maintaining our infrastructurehave a lot of work ahead of us  With that in mind  I look forward to hearing from the panelists and working with my EPW colleagues to get this work done  so that we ensure our national transportation system has the confidence of the American people  as well as being the envy of the rest of world  Thank you Madam Chairman
