                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Klobuchar also Discussed the Nearly 3 000 MN National Guard Troops Facing Extended Stays in Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 January 12  2007  Washington  D C   U S   today presented her first speech on the U S  Senate floor about ethics reform  Klobuchar also spoke about the Minnesota National Guard troops who may have their tours of duty extended as a part of President Bushs recent proposal on Iraq  Klobuchars remarks as delivered from the Senate floor are as follows  Thank you  Mr  President  I wanted to briefly address the ethics bill before this Congress but before I did that I wanted to discuss an issue of paramount importance to my state in light of the presidents recent address and that is the war in Iraq  Sending more American troops is not the change of course that the people of Minnesota and the American people called for in this past election  and it is not the change in course that our military forces deserve  We learned this week that 3 000 of the 22 000 troops added for the escalation are from Minnesotas National Guard  These Minnesota soldiers have already served honorably and well  They and their families were told they would be coming home in March  And I just talked to General Shellito who heads up the National Guard in Minnesota and he said that the hardest thing for them is theyve been hanging on  in his words hanging on through March  now they are extended well into the summer  These brave soldiers will be thrust even more deeply into the midst of Iraqs civil war  Havent we asked our soldiers and their families to sacrifice enough  The great burden on Minnesota and the rest of the country should remind us that what is needed is a surge in diplomacy and not a surge in troops  With that  Id like to change to the issue of ethics reform  And I wanted to thank Senator Reid and the other Senators for their leadership and for making ethics reform a real priority for this Congress  When I arrived in Washington last week  we pulled up in our family Saturn  loaded with my husbands college dishes and a shower curtain that I found in the basement from 1980  But we brought a little more than dishes and shower curtains  We brought a commitment for change  something the people of our state  Democrats  Independents  and Republicans  from Worthington to Moorhead to Duluth to Rochester  called for very clearly and loudly in November  We also brought a Minnesota moral compass  grounded in a simple notion of Minnesota fairness  A notion that all people should be on equal footing in the halls of Congress  But they cant be on equal footing when their elected representatives are selling their votes for trips to Scotland or have cash in the freezer  They cant be on equal footing unless this new Congress delivers real  meaningful ethics reform  Ethics reform is an issue of great importance to the people of my state  Wherever I went  Minnesotans told me this was the kind of change that they wanted to see in Washington  Its not an abstract political science issue  It affects real people in the real world  And today it comes out of the political science classrooms and into the halls of Congress  Ethics is woven into the very fabric of how our government does business  And ethics reform goes to the very heart of our democracy  to the public trust and respect thats essential to the health of our constitutional system  Recent scandals have cast a shadow over the legitimacy of the laws and policies that come out of Washington  The American publics receding faith in the integrity of our legislative process means that ethics reform is now central to every public issue that we will consider  whether its energy policy  or health care reform  or even homeland security  The ability of Congress to deal credibly and forthrightly with these other issues depends on reforming our own ethical rules  The long term challenges that we face in this country are enormous  They include high energy prices and a growing dependency on foreign oil  health care costs that have spiraled out of control  global warming that threatens the future of our environment and our economy  a mounting national debt  a growing middle class squeeze  I believe that there are solutions to these challenges  While not always immediate  these solutions are within our grasp  We can achieve energy independence by investing smart and having some guts to take on the oil companies  We can get this country back on the right fiscal track  and move forward to more affordable health care  We can deliver much needed and long overdue relief to the middle class  These are the things that the people of Minnesota sent me to Washington to fight for  They sent me here because they have not yet seen the bold change of direction that we need to make these solutions happen  Instead  they have seen a Washington that too often served big special interests at the expense of the middle class  As a prosecutor  I learned first hand how the well connected and powerful do not face the same challenges as middle class families  Every day  I would go into our courthouse in Minnesota with a mission to treat people the same no matter where they came from  When we prosecuted a wealthy well connected person for a white collar crime the courtroom was packed with his friends  and I would get all kinds of calls  One of my favorites was  I know he stole 400 000 dollars from a mentally disabled woman  but hes such a good guy  he shouldnt go to prison  But when we prosecuted someone who was poor or middle class  they were lucky if their mom could take the day off work to stand behind them in the courtroom  And I figured my job was to even the playing field  to treat people the same no matter where they came from and who they knew  That is still my job  it is our job  it is the job of this Congress  With that in mind  we have to change business as usual  Business as usual has created a playing field tilted toward special interests and against the middle class  When our energy policy is drafted in secret meetings with the oil companies  we all end up paying more at the pump because theyve failed to invest in renewable energy  When our health care legislation is written by the drug companies  we all pay more because theyve banned negotiation on prices  The people of this country know corruption when they see it and they saw this last November who was benefiting and who was getting hurt  Business as usual doesnt only generate bad policy and wasteful spending  It also erodes public trust in the integrity of our government institutions  our elected leaders  and the law making process itself  We the American people know what we want from Washington  It is this  a government thats focused on doing whats best for our nation  and on securing a better and more prosperous future for the people  There are so many people of good faith on both sides of the aisle that want to see this happen  Like me  they want to solve the great challenges of our day and to restore public faith in our government  They know  as I do  that General Omar Bradley was right back in 1948 when he said that we need to start steering our ships by the stars  and not by the lights of each passing ship  The new leadership that took the helm last week has already begun that change in course  They have introduced the ethics reform package at issue today as the very first bill to be considered by the new Senate  It has been an honor to work with Senator Reid  colleagues like Senators Feingold and Obama  and with a great class of freshmen  that includes you Mr  President as well as Senator Tester who is here with me today  who share my passion for ethics reform  I am also pleased by the bipartisan support for this bill  The proposals being offered will strengthen the original S  1 in a number of important areas  including stricter travel rules  enhanced lobbying disclosure requirements  tougher restrictions on the revolving door between Capitol Hill and lobbying firms  and additional earmarking reforms  It is also my understanding that the Senate will thoughtfully address methods to improve ethics enforcement in debates and hearings over the next few months  Speaking as a former prosecutor  I have expressed to a number of Senators the great value of strong  sensible enforcement  I am particularly gratified to see Senator Reids Amendment number four contains improvements to the Senate gift and meal rules  Under current law  anyone  including a lobbyist  is permitted to buy a gift or a meal for a Senator or a staff member  up to a certain dollar amount  We need to make sensible changes to this current law  A decade ago  the Minnesota legislature passed a strong  clear rule in this area  lobbyists and those who employ them cannot give gifts or meals to state or local officials  subject to very limited exceptions that were meant to be just that  limited exceptions   For more than ten years  our state officials have abided by these rules  which are rooted in Minnesota values  I followed them as county prosecutor  And the result has been greater fairness in our democratic process and a greater faith in our government  A rule banning gifts and meals from both lobbyists and those who hire lobbyists worked in Minnesota  and it can work in Washington  D C  I want to make clear that my support for this rule is no reflection on my colleagues  who have humbled me with their good faith  with their honor  and integrity since I arrived in Washington  Instead  I support it because the urgency of our need to restore the publics faith in government has convinced me that clear  bright line rules are best  Such rules do not impose unreasonable constraints and does not adversely affect citizens rights to petition their government  But it does send a strong  clear message and an important signal to the American people that we are focused solely on representing their interests  Last week at my swearing in  a number of people and Senators from both sides of the aisle came up to me remembering the great Senators who have come to Washington from the state of Minnesota  It is humbling to follow in the footsteps of people like Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale and Paul Wellstone  I was reminded many times this past week of the great things that they did and that they said  On Humphreys gravestone  there is an inscription  a quote from Humphrey himself  It says  I have enjoyed my life  its disappointments outweighed by its pleasures  I have loved my country in a way that some people consider sentimental and out of style  I still do  And I remain an optimist with joy  without apology about this country and about the American experiment in democracy  Like Humphrey  Mr  President  I too remain an optimist about this grand experiment in democracy  I remain an optimist because the people in my state and across the country have spoken up for change  I remain an optimist because the people in this chamber are devoted to getting things done  and getting them done the right way  I remain an optimist because this American experiment in democracy has worked best when we  the American people  have  without apology  demanded accountability  This past November was one of those times  The American people spoke out for change  We need to answer them  Thank you
