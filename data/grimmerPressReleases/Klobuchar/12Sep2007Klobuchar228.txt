September 12  2007 Washington  D C   Minnesota  today testified before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government regarding her efforts on toy safety  Senator Klobuchar discussed the importance of enacting her proposed ban on lead in childrens products  toys  and jewelry  As a parent of a twelve year old  I find it entirely unacceptable that these unsafe toys continue to make it into our marketplace  said Klobuchar  holding a recalled Thomas the Tank Engine  Its time to act  and make it crystal clear that these toxic toys have no place on our shores or on our store shelves  Yesterday  Klobuchar introduced legislation taking direct aim at toxic toys  Klobuchars legislation makes recalled products both easier to identify and illegal to sell  and effectively bans lead from all childrens products  including toys and jewelry  Currently  there is no federal law banning the use of lead in childrens products  Senator Klobuchar also participated in the questioning of hearing witnesses  including Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman Nord  Toys R Us CEO Gerald Storch  and Mattel CEO Robert Eckert  The full text of Klobuchars testimony is below  REMARKS OF SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR  APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT HEARING  SEPTEMBER 12  2007 Thank you very much Senator Durbin and thank you for your work in helping to build the CPSC and working to provide more resources  I dont think one guy in an office like that should be charged with ensuring the safety of  22 billion worth of toys  We clearly need change and I also am proud to be on the Commerce Committee with my two colleagues who are working so hard on this issue  This issue hit home to us in Minnesota when a little four year old boy named Jarnell Brown died when he swallowed a little heart shaped charm  And this charm was given to him for free with a pair of tennis shoes  He didnt buy it  his mom didnt buy it  And he didnt die from swallowing it  he didnt die from choking on it  He died when the lead creeped into his blood stream  It fatally poisoned him  it took a number of days  And when the Minnesota Department of health tested that charm it was 99  lead  It came from China and his blood level contained three times the amount of lead than what health officials consider dangerous  This was preventable  This little boy should never have had that charm in the first place  As a parent of a 12 year old  like everyone else  I am alarmed by the reports that have been coming out about all toys  Look at this Thomas the Train toy set  Over a million pieces of this toy  recalled  This has got to stop  My daughters 12  as I said  and I have to tell you  she was sort of embarrassed by my interest in this issue  Chairman  because she didnt care about Spongebob  or Thomas the Train set  it was sort of embarrassing for her  But when she heard that the Barbies were recalled  she came into the kitchen and said  Mom  this is really getting serious  And this is getting serious  Its time for us to take action  These toys should not be on our shores and they should not be in our stores  Ive introduced two pieces of legislation that have been incorporated into the bill that Senator Pryor referenced  The first is to effectively ban lead in childrens toys  We looked at what was going on with the Consumer Product Safety Commission  practically  Right now what happens is they have a voluntary guideline standard and then after that if it doesnt meet that standard they have to go through a number of tests  There are proposals out there for rule making  We decided  Mr  Chairman  it would be easier just to ban lead  allowing trace levels of lead  at a level thats actually lower than they have now  to  02 for jewelry  which is a case like what we have seen with the little boy in Minneapolis  For thirty years  weve been aware of the dangers posed to children by lead paint  It is time to change our current system of voluntary guidelines and use the force of law and have an actual federal standard  The other piece of legislation that I introduced  which is also incorporated into this bill  will make it easier for parents to identify recalled toys  Now  imagine if you are a parent at a toy box and youve heard that Thomas the Train set has been recalled  You try to figure out which is recalled  is it the caboose or is it the boxcar  Or if you have a Barbie and you are trying to figure out the difference between one and another  it is nearly impossible  Our legislation requires that batch numbers or identifications be on these toys so that when there is a recall it is easier for parents to tell what that recall is  It also requires that it be on the packaging because while larger retailers are able to put recalls into their computer systems and stop the sale right when it occurs  and we have worked with the retailers on this  some of the smaller operations or online services wouldnt be able to do this  So thats the other piece of the bill  Finally the legislation makes it illegal to sell a recalled toy  taking action against those bad actors who are out there  We have seen too many headlines  we have had too many deaths  For one little boy in Minneapolis and for the others that could be prevented  we have to stop just bemoaning the recalls  and we have to act now  Thank you for your leadership
