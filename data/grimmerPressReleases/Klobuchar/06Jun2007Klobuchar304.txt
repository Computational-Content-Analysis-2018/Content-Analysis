                                                                                                            Senator Klobuchar Floor Statement Introducing the Renewable Electricity Standard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   June 6  2007  Washington  D C   Mr  President  today I come to the floor to discuss some of the changes that need to be made to our national energy policy  The simple truth is that our country is headed down the wrong energy path  Our current path has lead to record high electricity and gas prices  These prices are not only hurting ordinary families  theyre also hurting businesses who are seeing their costs go up dramatically  The growth of energy intensive industries  such as manufacturing  is actually being stunted due to skyrocketing electricity costs  And we already know the negative global impacts that our current energy path is having on our environment  So it is clear that we cant continue down this energy path anymore  Its not good policy  its is not good economic policy  and is not good environmental policy  So today  I am introducing a bill that will lead the nation down a path to a better  cleaner  more independent energy economy  A path that takes us away from higher electric bills  and leads to new opportunities for investment and innovation  more jobs  and more economic development As the chart beside me illustrates  52  of our electricity is currently generated from coal in this country  15  from natural gas  3  from petroleum  20  from nuclear  7   from Hydro  and 3  from renewable energy  clearly this is not a diversified energy portfolio  And clearly  something needs to be done about rising energy costs  It s estimated that Americans will spend over 200 billion dollars more on energy this year than last year  That s an increase of nearly 25 percent  The bill will allow us to meet our future electricity needs  It will allow us to diversify our electricity supply  It will allow us to reduce the vulnerability of our energy system  It will allow us to stabilize electricity prices  protect the environment  and most of all stimulate the economies of rural America  Its time to act Mr  President  It is time to pass an aggressive renewable electricity standard  one requiring that all electricity providers would have to generate or purchase 25  of their electricity from renewable sources by the year 2025  22 states throughout the country have already demonstrated the value of establishing renewable electricity standards  Now you see this chart here and you see what is going on all around the country  I am looking here Mr  President  for Rhode Island  just to try one state  16  standard by 2019  You see California  20  by 2010  you see Washington  15  by 2020  You look at all over the country and you see change afoot  the checkered states are ones that have voluntary goals like Illinois  the striped states have standard goals  and the green states actually have standards put into law  While the states are already heading down the path toward the new green economy  the federal government has not even made it to the trail head  The federal government  Mr  President  is stuck in the fossil age  I am proud to say that Minnesota is further down the path than any other state  In February  the Democratic Minnesota State Legislature passed  and our Republican Governor signed into law what is considered the nations most aggressive standard for promoting renewable energy in electricity production  Its a 25 by 25 standard  By the year 2025  the states energy companies are required to generate 25 percent of their electricity from renewable sources such as wind  water  solar and biomass  The standard is even higher for the states largest utility  Xcel Energy  which must reach 30 percent by 2020 and their CEO has been in my office and said that it is going to be tough  but they are going to make it and they are going to meet this goal without raising rates  I admire what the states and communities and businesses are doing across the country  I admire their inspiration and I admire them for their initiative  You know  there is a famous phrase  The laboratories of democracy  Thats how Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis described the special role of states in our federal system  In this model  states are where new ideas emerge  where policymakers can experiment  where innovative proposals can be tested  It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system  Brandeis wrote over 70 years ago  that a single courageous state may  if its citizens choose  serve as a laboratory  and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country  But he did not mean for this to serve as an excuse for inaction by the federal government  Good ideas and successful innovations are supposed to emerge from the laboratory and serve as a model for national policy and action  That is now our responsibility in Congress  The courage were seeing in the states as they deal with global warming and climate change should be matched by courage in Washington  DC  We should be prepared to act on a national level  especially when the states and local communities are showing us the way  So now there is an opportunity for the federal government to act  It is time for the federal government to begin moving toward an aggressive national standardon par with Minnesotas 25 by 25 standard  There are many economic benefits of this aggressive standard  yet perhaps more importantly  an aggressive national standard opens the door to a new electricity industry that will bring thousands of jobs and pump billions of dollars into our economy  Over the last 20 years  Americas renewable energy industries  and the wind industry in particular  have achieved significant technological advancements  The industries for solar  wind  and biomass energy systems are expanding at rates 30 percent annually  And the clean energy revolution is still in its infancy  I think of it like of it like the beginnings of the computer revolution  when the computer used to take up an entire room  Now they are much cheaper and theyre much more efficient and thats whats happening with our green technology  but it will not happen unless we get into the act and set the standards as they should be  Businesses are coming on board and CEOs from major corporations like DuPont  Duke Energy and General Electric see the opportunities  High tech entrepreneurs in our country want to develop the green technologies before they do it in India and Japan  Its already starting and nationally venture capital investments in green or clean technologies have increased dramatically  Last year  venture capital investment in green technologies reached an impressive  2 9 billion  From 2001 to 2006 there was a 243  increase in green technology venture capital investments  Not only is clean technology the fastest growing venture capital sector  it is now the third largest category  behind only biotech and computer software  And the economic benefits are not just limited to high risk investors  In September of 2004  the Union of Concerned Scientists used the Energy Information Administrations National Energy Modeling System to examine the costs and benefits of an aggressive national standard  Their analysis found that an aggressive national standard would reduce electric and natural gas prices and provide significant economic benefits for all of America  For an example  as you can see from this chart  an aggressive national standard would create more than 355 000 new jobs  nearly twice as many as generating electricity from fossil fuels  Wed see economic development like  72 6 billion in new capital investment   16 2 billion in income to farmers ranchers and rural land owners  and  5 billion in new local tax revenue  Wed see consumer savings   49 billion in lower electricity and natural gas bills  Wed have a healthier environment Mr  President  Reductions in global warming pollution equal to taking nearly 71 million cars off the road  Wed see less air pollution  less damage to land  and better water use  So while traditional manufacturing jobs continue to move away from the U S   the country now has an opportunity to become a global hub of new  high quality jobs in manufacturing and other high skill areaswhile generating environmental benefits at the same time  So the future looks bright  Never before have we seen such strong interest and growth in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies  But the question we face is this  Does the United States want to be a leader in creating the new green technologies and the new green industries of the future  Or are we going to sit back and watch the opportunities pass us by  In this country  we have the fields to grow the energy that will keep our nation moving  And we have the wind energy to propel our economy forward  And right here in the United States  we have the science  We have the universities  We have the technological know how  And we have the financial capital to harness our homegrown energy  It is time to act  The only thing holding us back Mr  President is complacency  A national renewable energy standard will be a major contributor in driving innovation in green technologies  Now I know there are critics of a national standard  These criticswho I believe are stuck in the fossil agebelieve that an aggressive standard would negatively affect the reliability of an energy system  Yet these critics  seem to forget that numerous countries in Europe  including Spain  Germany  and Denmarkwhere wind power supplies over 30 percent of their electricity have seen no adverse impacts on the reliability of the system  In fact  a renewable electricity standard can actually increase the overall reliability of a system  It can diversify our electricity sources  so that we are not so reliant on energy sources such as natural gas that are vulnerable to periodic shortages or other supply interruptions  Not only is a national standard reliable  and good for the economy  It will also of course protect the environment and public health  Electricity production has a significant impact on the environment  Today  electricity accounts for more than 26 percent of smog producing emissions  one third of toxic mercury emissions  and some 40 percent of climate changing greenhouse gases  An aggressive standard will reduce CO2 emissions by 434 million metric tons per year by 2020reductions of 15 percent below current levels  This is I said  equivalent to taking nearly 71 million cars off the road  A couple of weeks ago  Minnesotas own Tom Friedman had a cover story in the New York Times Magazine about The Power of Green  It should be required reading for anyone who cares not only about the future of our environment  but also our economic future  and our future national security  He talked about the need in this area for setting the standards  and when you set the standards and people can see off into the future  well see the investment  And people say  well why do you have a standard set at 2025  Obviously our bill is going to have a standard growing each year  but the reason you want to go out to 2025 is you want American businesses and capitalists and people involved in this to understand if they invest where they are going  In his article Tom Friedman asks  How do our kids compete in a flatter world  How do they thrive in a warmer world  How do they survive in a more dangerous world  The answer is in making the most of the economic and technological opportunities to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and the greenhouse gas pollution that comes from it  Friedman says that clean energy technology is going to be the next great global industry  Well  if thats the case  and I believe hes right  then we need to make America the leader  We cant afford to sit back and watch the opportunities pass us by  As I mentioned before  we are seeing unprecedented interest and growth in renewable energy technologies  But at the same time  we are no longer the world leader in two important clean energy fields  We rank third in wind power production  behind Denmark and Spain  We are third in solar power installed  behind Germany and Japan  Ironically  these countries surpassed us largely by adopting technologies that had been first developed right here in the United States  We came up with the right ideas Mr  President  but we did not capitalize on these innovations with adequate policies to spur deployment  Our foreign competition was able to leapfrog over American businesses because these other countries have government driven investment incentives  aggressive renewable energy targets and other bold national policies  Friedman proposes a Green New Deal  one in which governments role is not funding projects  as in the original New Deal  but seeding basic research  providing loan guarantees where needed  and setting standards  taxes and incentives that will spawn all kinds of new technologies  I agree  Its about leading the new economy  Its about making America the global environmental leader  instead of a laggard  Its about creating a better economy for the next generation by inventing a whole new industry  which will not only give us the clean power industrial assets to preserve our American dream but also give us the technologies that billions of others need to realize their own dreams without destroying the planet  Its about not being complacent  Its about getting on a new energy path  And I believe that an aggressive renewable electricity standard leads us down that path  So I urge all of my colleagues to support an aggressive standard  I suggest Minnesotas standard  25  by 2025 for renewable electricity  Its the start down the path  Thank you Mr  President  and I yield the floor
