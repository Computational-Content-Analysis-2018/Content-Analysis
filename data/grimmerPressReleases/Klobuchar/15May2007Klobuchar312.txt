                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   May 15  2007  Washington  D C   Today U S    D MN   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee  and Kent Conrad  D ND   Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee  introduced first of its kind legislation that aims to reduce U S  dependence on foreign oil by encouraging American farmers to produce cellulosic energy crops  The legislation  the Farm to Fuel Investment Act  would provide transition assistance for farmers to grow dedicated energy crops  crops like switchgrass grown solely for the purpose of producing energy   Farmers are going to be a key part of our nation s ability to achieve energy independence  said Klobuchar  These crops could revolutionize how we look at energy just like ethanol and biodiesel have  Now its time for Congress to act and reward our farmers at home  protect the environment  and pave the way for tomorrow s energy  When we draw our energy from farm fields and other renewable sources here in the U S   and reduce our dependence on the oil fields of the Middle East  that is a win  win  win for America  said Chairman Harkin  This bill charts a course for initiating the extensive production of biomass feedstocks while continuing to protect wildlife and promote sound soil and water conservation practices  I commend Senator Klobuchar for her work to push additional biofuels production from biomass and the contribution she is making to the debate on the new farm bill  I just held a field hearing in Fargo where I was told that native prairie grasses can be a phenomenal source of cellulosic ethanol  Senator Conrad said  I m supporting this legislation because I believe that North Dakota can help this nation grow its way out of our dependency on foreign energy   whether it s from cellulosic ethanol or biodiesel  It s time we turned from the Mid East for our energy and turned instead to the Mid West  The bill would provide three years of transition assistance to farmers who produce dedicated energy crops in an area 50 miles around a biorefinery that will produce fuels like cellulosic ethanol  Incentives are needed for the first few years because it takes about three years for crops like switchgrass to reach their first mature harvest  The three year period also takes into account the time needed to develop a biorefinery to purchase the crop  After a market has developed and the crops have matured  the transition assistance would phase out  To participate  farmers would have to agree to adopt conservation practices for soil quality  water quality and wildlife habitat  This legislation also allows for an additional incentive to farmers who produce native perennial energy crops  such as prairie grass mixtures  because of the tremendous conservation benefits those crops provide  Perennial grasses protect soil and water quality  sequester carbon  create wildlife habitat and save farmers money on fuel and fertilizer  Renewable fuels groups and farmers organizations alike back the bill  The Renewable Fuels Association applauds Senator Klobuchar for her leadership in identifying a critical need in achieving the goals for renewable fuel use our nation has put forward  goals that will require more than grain based ethanol to achieve  said Bob Dinneen  President and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association  Senator Klobuchar s legislation  which would provide transitional assistance for farmers interested in producing bioenergy crops  is a logical first step in bringing farmers and biorefineries together to grow the feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol facilities across the nation  Tom Buis  President of the National Farmers Union commented on the legislation stating  Developing commercial production of cellulosic ethanol offers a bright future for rural America  The Farm to Fuel Investment Act of 2007 will create economic opportunities for farmers  ranchers and their rural communities while moving our nation toward energy independence  I commend Senator Klobuchar for her leadership in creating a means to help rural America achieve our country s energy goals
