Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  insisting that he provide a detailed explanation for why the Administration chose to set the new limit on the allowable amount of pollution forming ozone in the air at 75 parts per billion  EPA scientists recommended a more aggressive and safer standard of 60 ppb  a level that some scientists say could avoid anywhere between 3 000  9 200 deaths per year  Klobuchar pressed the EPA to implement a more aggressive level  and chided the Administration for setting the bar too low and ignoring the risks to public health and the recommendation of its own professional staff  For over thirty years  protecting public health has not harmed the economynor is it likely to do so in the future  In fact  history has proven that our industry can and will rise to the challenge of high standards  creating the technology to meet them and allowing us to make continued progress on this critical issue  said Klobuchar  As public officials  we are charged not with setting policies that are expedient  but which are in the best interests of the American people now and in the generations to come  Research shows that pollution levels in the ozone have a direct impact on rates of heart and respiratory disease that result in premature deaths  The move would not only save lives  but could save between  2 billion and  19 billion annually in health benefits while only costing polluters between  7 and  9 billion  The full text of Klobuchars letter is below  March 13  2008   The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  N V  Washington  DC 20460 0001   Dear Administrator Johnson  I write to express my deep disappointment with your recent decision to set the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone at a level inconsistent with scientific data and the recommendations of your own scientific advisers  Rejecting the recommendations of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and setting air quality standards based on industry concerns defies logic  discounts undisputed science  and disregards the law  The Clean Air Act assigns you the responsibility of protecting the American public from dangerous air pollutants  Ozone  the primary cause of smog  is linked to many of our nation s health problems  including asthma  respiratory illnesses  and even death  Your own scientific advisors  as well as numerous major medical and public health organizations recommended a standard between 60 and 70ppm to adequately protect public health  The decision to ignore the advice of the nations leading medical and public health experts and set a standard at 75ppm is unacceptable    The Clean Air Act does not permit the Environmental Protection Agency to consider anything but public health when setting national ambient air quality standards  The Supreme Court  in Whitman v  American Trucking Association 531 U S  457  2001   unanimously held  to consider anything but the impact on public health is outside the bounds of the law  As Senator Edmund Muskie famously stated when passing the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970  neither Congress nor the EPA was to be limited by what is or appears to be technologically or economically feasible but to establish what the public interest requires to protect the health of persons    For over thirty years  protecting public health has not harmed the economynor is it likely to do so in the future  In fact  history has proven that our industry can and will rise to the challenge of high standards  creating the technology to meet them and allowing us to make continued progress on this critical issue  To quote one of your own scientists in todays Washington Post  because it is difficult does not mean it is not worth doing  As public officials  we are charged not with setting policies that are expedient  but which are in the best interests of the American people now and in the generations that follow  Your decision breaks that trust with the people  and shirks your responsibilities as a public servant    Any revision to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards not purely based on public health concerns is unacceptable  To that end  I ask that you provide me with a detailed explanation of the factors you considered when determining the new standards for ozone    Sincerely   s Amy Klobuchar  U S  Senator
