Bipartisan Legislation to Help Veterans Become Civilian Paramedics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Proposal Supports Rural Communities in Need of Trained EMTs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      May 8  2008 Washington  D C  U S   introduced legislation today that is designed to relieve the shortage of emergency medical personnel  especially in rural areas  by streamlining civilian paramedic training for returning veterans who already have emergency medical experience from the military    Senators Mike Enzi  R WY  and Tom Harkin  D IA  joined Klobuchar in introducing the bill  and Representatives Stephanie Herseth Sandlin  D SD  and Jerry Moran  R KS  introduced Klobuchars bill in the House   On the one hand  we have a severe shortage of emergency medical personnel in rural communities  said Klobuchar  On the other hand  we have an abundance of returning veterans who have significant training and experience  Theyre an ideal talent pool to relieve the shortage   The medical training that many of our service members receive is of great value both on the battlefield and when they return home  said Enzi  This legislation will recognize that value by promoting a smooth transition into the civilian emergency medical service workforce  This bill will help our returning soldiers along rewarding career paths  while addressing the health care worker shortage in rural areas like Wyoming   I have long believed we have an obligation to ensure that men and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are provided with every opportunity to continue their education and training when they return to the United States  in recognition of their service  said Harkin The Veterans to Paramedics Transition Act will not only further that effort  it will also help our rural communities who are currently experiencing health provider shortages     The Veterans to Paramedics Transition Act will not only help service members obtain employment that recognizes their military training  but will also help relieve a shortage of emergency medical personnel in rural states such as South Dakota  said Herseth Sandlin  This is a common sense bill that does right by our nations veterans by helping to ease the transition from the military to civilian life    Kansas and many states are facing a severe shortage of EMS providers  Moran said  Kansas EMS has taken the initiative and is working to address this issue  I am hopeful we can serve as a model for other states to help veterans secure employment while providing valuable health care to our communities     The legislation  S  2993  is called the Veterans to Paramedics Transition Act  It would accelerate and streamline the transition to civilian employment for returning veterans who already have emergency medical training     Klobuchar explained  When we have soldiers who are trained to save lives on the front lines of combat  they should also have the opportunity save lives on the front lines right here at home    Specifically  the bill would provide federal grants for universities  colleges  technical schools  and State EMS agencies to develop an appropriate curriculum to train these veterans and fast track their eligibility for paramedic certification  A standard paramedic training program can take one to two years to complete    This bipartisan legislation has already been endorsed by the American Ambulance Association as well as the Minnesota Ambulance Association and the National Rural Health Association    There are more than 300 licensed ambulance services in Minnesota  with 85 percent of them located outside the Twin Cities and other urban areas like Rochester  Duluth and St  Cloud    Rural communities have long faced critical shortages in emergency medical personnel  A Minnesota Department of Health study several years ago described it as a quiet crisis  In that study  75 percent of rural emergency medical service providers said they needed to add more staff  and 67 percent reported having difficult covering their shifts    We very much welcome this legislation to address Minnesotas shortage of emergency medical personnel  said Buck McAlpin  president of the Minnesota Ambulance Association  Every year  one to two ambulance service operations close in rural Minnesota and  in some places  there is growing concern about whether an ambulance will even be available when someone calls 911  Minnesotans have a right to expect that a well trained emergency responder will be there for them    Meanwhile  thousands of men and women in the military receive emergency medical training as part of their duties  For example  most Army combat medics are currently certified as Emergency Medical Technicians  EMTs  at the basic level     When these veterans return to civilian life  however  their military based medical training is not counted toward training and certification as civilian paramedics  Many existing programs require all students to begin with an entry level curriculum  For veterans  this means spending extra time and money for training that  in effect  they have already received    Klobuchar first announced the legislation in Minneapolis in April  when she was joined by Jesse Folk  a Minnesota National Guard member from Ortonville who served in Iraq for one year and received training as a combat medic  He described his emergency medical training and experience  as well as his frustration at trying to find a civilian paramedic education program that would recognize and build on the training he already received in the military   We cannot afford to squander this wealth of skill and experience  especially when rural communities have such a shortage of emergency medical personnel  said Klobuchar  Our nation has invested in developing the skills of our servicemen and women  We need to make the most of this investment when they return to civilian life
