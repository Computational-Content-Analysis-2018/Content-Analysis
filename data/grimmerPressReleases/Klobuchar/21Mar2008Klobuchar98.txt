                                                                                                            Statement of Senator Klobuchar on the Passing of Abigail Taylor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    March 21  2008 Senator Klobuchar today offered the following statement on the passing of six year old Abigail Taylor  of Edina  MN  who was injured by a pool drain in the summer of 2007  I join all Minnesotans and so many others across America who mourn the passing of Abbey Taylor  an amazing little girl whose life was an inspiration for change in Washington  What I will remember most about Abbey is her incredible smile and spunk  and her parents devotion to her  From the beginning  Abbey said she wanted her story told so that it would make a difference  And it did   Although Abbey is no longer with us  she will always live on through this important new law that will protect other children so they do not have to suffer what she did  I am certain this new law would not have passed except for the inspiring courage of Abbey Taylor  It was her gift to all the children of America  One of the most touching moments in my time in the Senate was last December when I was able to call Scott Taylor from the Senate cloakroom to let him know that the pool safety bill had passed and that it was going to be signed by the president  Abbey may have been a small girl  but theres no doubt she had a super sized impact on our world  Our thoughts and prayers are with the Taylor family  President Bush signed the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act of 2007 on December 19  2007  as part of the Energy Bill  Working with the Taylor family and child safety experts  Klobuchar included provisions in the legislation to create tough new safety standards that require all existing public pools with single drains to install the latest drain safety technology
