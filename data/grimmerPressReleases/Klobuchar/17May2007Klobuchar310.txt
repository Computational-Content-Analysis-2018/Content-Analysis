were considered for dismissal by the U S  Justice Department   not the eight that Attorney General Gonzalez testified to last week   U S   called for an investigation into why Minnesota s former U S  Attorney  Tom Heffelfinger  was a part of that group  I am so appalled that Tom Heffelfinger was targeted for firing  said Klobuchar  That s why I am asking the Justice Department today that they tell us why Tom Heffelfinger  someone of such integrity  would even be on this list  And I m asking our Judiciary Committee to look into the fact that this man  this good man  was even on this list  We have learned these past few months that our nation s chief law enforcement officer  our leading guardian of the rule of law in this country has determined that Washington politicians   not prosecutors out in the field   and even perhaps some cases not the facts themselves will dictate how prosecutions should proceed  This is just wrong  I call for the resignation of this Attorney General and I ask that the country understand what a great man Tom Heffelfinger is that he should have never been on this list  Klobuchar sent letters this morning to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the U S  Justice Department asking for an investigation into the facts surrounding the Department of Justice s efforts to identify and potentially remove Tom Heffelfinger from office  Klobuchar continued in the letters  I hope to learn whether the Department of Justice allowed the federal prosecutors targeted for removal to do their jobs without fear or favor  Radio Actuality Information  Number  1 800 511 0763 Code  1086 Weblink The full text of Klobuchar s Senate floor speech is below  Today I was shocked to read in the Washington Post that Tom Heffelfinger  the former U S  Attorney for the District of Minnesota  was among those recommended for removal by the Justice Department under Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  Tom Heffelfinger had previously been appointed U S  Attorney for Minnesota by the first Bush administration in 1991  and had the distinction of being appointed again  in 2001 by George W  Bush  During his second term as U S  Attorney  I had the privilege of working with Tom as the district attorney and chief prosecutor for Minnesota s largest county  The relationship between a U S  Attorney and the district attorney for a large metropolitan county is a very important one but also a difficult one  I can tell you this  it has been my experience that the people of the country don t care who prosecute a casethey don t care if it s a local attorney or a state attorney or a federal attorneythey just want us to get the job done  That was the spirit with which I worked with Tom Heffelfinger and his predecessor  B  Todd Jones who was appointed by President Clinton  When I was first elected in 1998 B  Todd Jones had been appointed by President Clinton Todd Jones and I forged an excellent relationship  We spoke often about the various cases in our jurisdiction in the surrounding area and together we worked when jurisdictional lines were blurred deciding if a case would be prosecuted federally or locally  It s not a small thing  In other jurisdictions there are often disputes that are not in the best interest of the citizens  But we were able to forge that relationship  I remember that we made a plan early on and that is that we were going to work together  And I remember when Mr  Jones and I decided that we were going to have a party for our joint offices and he invited the County Attorney s prosecutors over to the U S  Attorneys and I have to tell you there is traditionally a little jealousy that goes on  The County Attorneys always look at the U S  Attorneys and figure they can have less cases and more resources to do those fewer cases  And the U S  Attorneys may look at the County Attorneys and say why can t they spend more time on a case  So we decided we d bring the people together  I still remember when we had the party at their beautiful offices  I got there first and I never told my office but U S  Attorney Todd Jones got on the intercom and before my office came over said  nail down the furniture the cousins are coming over   Since then we ve forged an amazing relationship  So when George W  Bush appointed Tom Heffelfinger as U S  Attorney  Tom Heffelfinger of course was a Republican  I was a Democrat  You might think that there would be problems  well there weren t  Tom Heffelfinger basically ran the office the same way that Todd Jones did in a professional manner  Many of the same people continued to work there and in fact the Chief Deputy remained the same under both the Republican appointed U S  Attorney and the Democratic appointed U S  Attorney  An example of Tom s professionalism comes to mind when there was an armored truck robbery in the southern suburbs in our metropolitan area  The victim was killed execution style  He was kneeling next to a truck  he was a Brinks truck driver  and the case had gone unsolved for a number of years  And Tom came to my office   I want you to know that he didn t have to do this  he could have had just a press conference and announced the charges and that would be the end of it  But he came to my office weeks before the case was charged to tell me that he thought that they were closing in on the suspect  To tell me that he knew that for most cases  murders were handled by our office but that this case was going to be different  It was different because the feds had been investigating it for a number of years  It was different because it involved an armored truck  It was also different because it could potentially be eligible for the death penalty and he knew that I was personally opposed to the death penalty and that Minnesota didn t have a death penalty  But nothing required him to come and talk to me about that case but Tom Heffelfinger did because he had the respect for me and he had the respect for our office that you don t always see in people in government service  Our office jointly prosecuted many cases and when there was a jurisdictional issue  Tom and I would always talk about it  We did a number of criminal focused initiatives together  We saw our offices as partners not as rivals  And as time when on  as the years went on  the respect between both our offices grew  And as I said each came to see each other  the people in our office  not as rivals but as partners in justice  That is way I am so appalled that someone like Tom Heffelfinger was targeted for firing  I take Tom at his word   and we ve talked many times in the last few months   that he had made a decision to leave the office  that he never knew he was on such a list  that he made a decision based on the fact that his wife was going to retire  But the issue is not that he made the decision on his own  The issue is that someone with such integrity as Tom Heffelfinger was ever targeted by this Justice Department for firing  I ve always believed that as a prosecutor you do your job without fear or favor  It may not be easy but whatever your decisions  and you know that they re not going to make everyone happy  but whatever your decisions  you want to know at the end of the day that you did the right thing and then you have no regrets  Well we have learned these past few months that our nation s chief law enforcement officer  our leading guardian of the rule of law in this country  has allowed politics to creep too close to the core of our legal system  This administration has determined that Washington politicians   not prosecutors out in the field   and even perhaps some cases not the facts themselves  will dictate how prosecutions should proceed  The consequences are simply unacceptable  Good prosecutors like Tom Heffelfinger who by all accounts have been just doing their jobs  upholding their oaths  following the principles of their professions we find out were targeted for firing  And the new information we also got this week is while this Administration repeatedly said  well we were only focusing on these eight prosecutors  it turned out it was 26 people that they were considering  That s why I am asking the Justice Department today that they tell us why would Tom Heffelfinger  someone of such integrity  even be on this list  And I m asking our Judiciary Committee to look into the fact that this man  this good man was even on this list  We have seen cases all over the country now where prosecutors were pressured  that they were fired  that they were unfairly slandered by this Administration and all of this it would seem was motivated by rank politics  This was the week that was law enforcement week and it made me a little melancholy for my previous job  I had a number of police come in talk to me  so many of them that I had known and worked with and we talked about cases  And I also treasured the relationships and the work I did with the prosecutors throughout our state from the smallest counties to the U S  Attorney s office  This is what our justice system is about in America  It s about putting justice first  It s about doing our jobs without fear or favor  That is why I believe that this Attorney General must resign  I ve been saying it for months  But you simply cannot have a cloud over the Justice Department where they can t be doing their jobs because they are constantly plagued by investigations and by everything that s been going on because of the brute political decisions made by this Administration  This is just wrong  I call for the resignation of this Attorney General and I ask that the country understand what a great man Tom Heffelfinger is that he should have never been on this list  And I stand tall to tell the people of my state that this is a man of integrity and I respect him very much
