fair and inclusive process                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          September 19  2007 Washington  D C   U S    D MN  testified before the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration stressing the need to reform the currently chaotic Presidential primary election process  Klobuchar highlighted legislation she introduced in late July with Lamar Alexander  R TN   and Joseph Lieberman  I CT  as a sensible step towards fixing a primary process that many have referred to as a big mess  Primaries were not intended to be an arms race  said Klobuchar  the lead sponsor of the bill  We seek to give order to this chaotic  messy  and unrepresentative process  This schedule gives power and influence back to the voters in every state  Concerns about the election schedule have gained national attention in recent months as states have leap frogged each other in a race to the front of the calendar  In 2008  at least 25 states will hold their primaries on or before February 5th  Klobuchars legislation  The Presidential Primary and Caucus Reform Act  would provide structure to the primary election and caucuses by establishing a rotating schedule of regional Presidential primaries and caucuses  The reformed system would de compress the schedule  allowing candidates to focus their time and efforts and giving voters in all states the opportunity to have a powerful voice in the selection of party nominees  The bill would create a region by region primary system where  on a rotating basis  states in the West  Midwest  South  and East take turns hosting the first batch of primaries and caucuses  Beginning in 2012  primaries and caucuses would start on the first Tuesday in March  continuing on the first Tuesday in April  May  and June until each region has chosen candidates for the party conventions  The next presidential election year  a different region would have a chance to go firstrotating through all the regions every 16 years  Iowa and New Hampshire would remain as the historical first caucus and primary in the nation  The current schedule undermines the spirit of the primary process  remarked Klobuchar  It risks turning our primaries and caucuses into a tarmac campaign  with candidates forced to partake in a blitzkrieg campaign strategy across the entire country  It is time to deescalate the primary arms race and restore the spirit of the primary process that allows for meaningful discussion with voters across the country  Senator Klobuchars Testimony for todays hearing is below  Thank you  Madam Chairman  for holding this timely hearing on the Regional Presidential Primary and Caucus Act of 2007  and for inviting me to testify  I am honored to appear before your committee in considering this vital issue  and Im happy to have this opportunity to testify about the bill that I introduced along with my senior collegues Senator Alexander and Senator Lieberman  Our presidential primary system is broken  Its time to stop the primary arms race  Each individual in this country should have a voice in electing the President of the United Statesa voice that begins with selecting the candidates through primaries and caucuses in each state  A vast number of voters in many states across the nation  however  have lost their voice in the presidential primary selection process  because of its drastically altered calendar  Currently  were in a race where each state is trying to leap frog the next  as all the states appear to be vying to hold the earliest primary  The voters of each state no longer have a say  unless they are able to compete with the slew of other states that are trying to go first  The presidential primaries and caucuses are turning out to be  to quote an editorial in a San Antonio paper  a big mess  And reforming this mess is long over due  This legislation would not take effect until 2012  but the primary season now underway shows why this reform is needed  In the 2008 primary season  at least 26 states will hold primaries or caucuses by the first Tuesday in Februarya huge increase from the 9 primaries held by the first Tuesday in February  which was called Super Tuesday  in the 2004 primary cycle  Now 19 states are holding primaries or caucuses on the first Tuesday of February in 2008  as you noted Madam Chairman  Many states have felt forced to move their primaries up to this date for fear of being left out in the cold if they wait any longer  New Jersey moved its primary to February 5th because  in the words of its state Senate President  its time we stopped being the Rodney Dangerfield of presidential primaries  This current system undermines the spirit of the primary process  It turns our primaries and caucuses into a tarmac campaign  with candidates forced to partake in a blitzkrieg campaign strategy across the entire country  Candidates fly from airport to airport and appear on television  but if this continues theyll have little opportunity for meaningful  targeted discussions with voters  That might be suitable for the last week of a general election campaign but not for the primaries and caucuses  Voters will also be forced to vote on dates long before they traditionally paid attention to presidential politics and before they may be ready to do so  Its time to de escalate the primary arms race  Senators Alexander  Lieberman  and I seek to give order to this chaotic  messy  and unrepresentative process  The states cannot solve this problem individually  As the current scramble shows  each state knows that if it holds its primary at a later date  it will be disadvantaged by states that go earlier  And I know  Senator Bennett  you raised some issues about the Constitutional authority  I believe that Congress has the constitutional authority to take this action  The Supreme Court has recognized broad congressional power over presidential elections and has recognized that this power extends to presidential primaries  This bill is tied to Congresss clearest power over presidential electionsits express  constitutional power to determine the Time of choosing the Electors  In fact Justice Scalia  in an article written when he was a law professor  said that this congressional power means that Congress must have at least authority to specify the dates of primaries  So Congress is empowered to create an orderly process that brings a voice back to every state  To do this  we propose that  during each presidential election  a different region of the country have the chance to host the first primaries and caucuses  These four geographic regionsWest  Midwest  South  and Eastwill each have 12 or 13 states  as you see on this map  and relatively the same number of electoral votes  One region would be selected through a lottery system to go first for the 2012 primariesholding their primaries on the first Tuesday of March  or anytime in the following week   The states in the next region would hold their primaries on the first Tuesday of April  the next region on the first Tuesday of May  and the final region would hold primaries on the first Tuesday in June  The order of the regions would rotate with each presidential election    This decompresses a system that  in its current form  is haphazard and disorganized  It brings greater predictability to the voters with a balanced  orderly sequencing of primaries and caucuses  and with that greater opportunity for meaningful choice in presidential candidates  This bill does not forget the importance of face to face  door to door  and neighborhood to neighborhood campaigning that the early primaries in New Hampshire and caucuses in Iowa provide  something that I know my two colleagues here enjoyed so much during their presidential campaigns  and I know will never forget  The Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary hold an obvious historical significance  but they also represent grass root efforts that can only be accomplished on a smaller scale  and with a smaller population  As candidates meet with communities on a very intimate level in these states  the voters of the entire country are able to watchand get to know the candidate on a level that is difficult to replicate in a multi primary system  Regional primary plans  combined with several small state primaries  have been gaining wide spread support  particularly by the National Association of Secretaries of Statesa group equally frustrated with states clamoring to schedule earlier primaries  Without reform to the primary selection process  we risk losing the founding principle of the democratic processgiving the voters in every state a voice in the electoral process  Regional presidential primaries provide a viable solution to what is likely going to become a debilitating primary process to the presidential candidates of the future  I am proud to be part of this tri partisan effort  Thank you very much
