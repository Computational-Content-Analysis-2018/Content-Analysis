                                                                                                            Senator Klobuchar Statement on General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker Testimony                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   September 11  2007 Washington  D C   U S   released the following statement in response to testimony by both General David Petreaus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker before separate hearings in front of the Senate Foreign Relations and Senate Armed Services Committees today    I have the deepest respect for General Petraeus and all of our brave troops whove served in Iraq  both now and in the past  Despite the good work of our troops  the real results for securing Iraqs future can come only from the Iraqis themselves  as General Petraeus acknowledges    We need a real change in course in Iraq  I did not support this war from the beginning  As we approach nearly five years in Iraq  Americas troop levels in Iraq are now at the highest level theyve ever been  and every day we see more American and Iraqi casualties  over the course of this war  weve lost thousands of lives  And while Im pleased to learn that some troops will be returning as early as July  2008  this plan will only return us to the pre surge troop levels  leaving approximately 130 000 troops in harms way  Staying the course in Iraq with these high troop levels does not push the Iraqi government to take responsibility for their own security and destiny    The surge isnt only about meeting military objectives  it is about providing the climate for the Iraqi government to achieve political progress  and the Iraqis have not delivered
