                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   March 25  2008 Washington  D C   U S   urged National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  Chairman Mark Rosenker to hold a public hearing as part of the boards investigation of last summers collapse of the I 35W bridge in Minneapolis  Klobuchar said four year old photographs released by the board in recent days have increased demands for a transparent investigation and undermined public confidence in bridges of the same design  A bridge in America should not just fall down  Klobuchar said  Now we have photographic evidence that the bridge design was producing a safety hazard fully four years before the I 35W bridge collapsed  A detailed public hearing will serve to produce more information on the I 35W bridge collapse and give the public a forum in which to understand what can be done to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future  A public hearing will help to restore public confidence that all safety issues have been considered  For that reason  I urge you to reconsider your decision and hold a public hearing  Klobuchar said that the newly released photos of the I 35W bridge  showing gusset plate damage as early as 2003  as well as the recent closure of the bridge on Minnesota State Highway 23 in St  Cloud  Minnesota underscore the need to address these serious questions in a transparent manner  with the input and understanding of the public  Two of the boards five members had called for a public hearing  but were out voted  As board members Higgins and Hersman wrote in their dissent  This is one of the rare accident investigations the Board has undertaken that has involved the total collapse of a major interstate highway bridge  Given the number of interstate bridges that exist in this country  the age of those bridges  and the use of those bridges  there is a significant need to explore whether this accident is likely to remain rare in the future  We believe we would be abandoning our important duty to educate and reassure the traveling public of an independent  transparent  credible investigation after a tragic accident of national scope  Higgins and Hersman continued  The full text of the letter is below  March 25  2008 The Honorable Mark V  Rosenker  Chairman  National Transportation Safety Board 490 L  Enfant Plaza  SW Washington  DC 20594 Dear Mr  Chairman  The sudden collapse of the I 35W Bridge on August 1  2007 resulted in thirteen tragic deaths and 145 injuries  The tragedy interrupted one of our state s busiest thoroughfares used by over 140 000 vehicles per day  creating an estimated  113 000 a day reduction in the state s economic output  Given the enormity of this collapse and the resulting understandable concerns of citizens throughout our country about the safety of our bridges and roads  I believe that the National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  should use every tool at its disposal to gather complete information to determine not only how this tragedy occurred  but to avoid future failures and reassure the public  As such  I urge you to reconsider your earlier decision and hold public hearings as part of your investigation  The bridge collapse presented this country with innumerable questions regarding the condition of our nations infrastructure  The newly released photos of the I 35W bridge  showing gusset plate damage as early as 2003  as well as the recent closure of the bridge on Minnesota State Highway 23 in St Cloud  Minnesota  highlight the need to address these serious questions in a transparent manner  with the input and understanding of the public  A detailed public hearing will serve that purpose  In the opinion by Vice Chairman Sumwalt  in which you joined  he wrote that a public hearing would be counterproductive to the timely investigative process  Time is of the essence  While timeliness is important  it cannot come at the cost of a thorough investigation  As board members Higgins and Hersman wrote in their dissent  This is one of the rare accident investigations the Board has undertaken that has involved the total collapse of a major interstate highway bridge  Given the number of interstate bridges that exist in this country  the age of those bridges  and the use of those bridges  there is a significant need to explore whether this accident is likely to remain rare in the future  Given the growing public concern in my state due to the recent revelations about the four year old photos as well as the closing of the St  Cloud bridge  I urge you to reconsider your decision not to hold a public hearing  Sincerely   s Amy Klobuchar
