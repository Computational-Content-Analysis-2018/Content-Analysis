Washington  D C   Today  U S    D MN  testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources  Energy Subcommittee  Klobuchars testimony highlighted how Minnesotas leadership in developing renewable fuel infrastructure can be a national model  The testimony underscored the positive impact that policies  like Minnesotas  can have in achieving Americas energy security    To

you  Mr  Chairman  for holding this timely hearing on the topic of renewable fuel infrastructure  and for inviting me to testify  As you know  ethanol and biodiesel are near and dear to Minnesota  but my interest in them goes far beyond that  Our ability to produce a reliable  low cost  domestic source of energy has become a question of national security     The United States spends more than  400 000 per minute on foreign oil  That money is shipped out of our economy  adding to our enormous trade deficit  and leaving us vulnerable to unstable parts of the world to meet our basic energy needs    There are those who would have us believe that energy security is decades away  but any Minnesota farmer can tell you that renewable fuels are here and ready to use today  However  in spite of the clear advantages of renewable fuels to our rural economy and our energy security  we face a chicken and egg type of problem when it comes to the challenge of making them available to more drivers  The auto makers are reluctant to promote flex fuel vehicles in areas where there are no E 85 pumps  and gas stations dont want to put in E 85 pumps where there are no flex fuel vehicles     So we need to tackle both ends of the problem  On the issue of vehicles  Mr  Chairman  I was proud to work with you to include provisions in the Senate passed energy bill that would require automakers to equip 50 percent of their new vehicles with alternative fuel technology by the year 2015    On the other end of the problem  the ability to find gas stations that sell E 85 and biodiesel    it is crucial that Congress act to provide more American drivers with access to renewable fuel pumps    As you know  Mr  Chairman  Minnesota ranks first in the nation in E 85 infrastructure  we have 320 pumps out of 1250 in the nation  far more than any other state  And I know  Mr  Chairman  that its a question of particular interest to you  how did Minnesota come to be the leader in this area  The answer  I believe  comes down to leadership    Leadership in state government in setting statewide ethanol standards and providing grants for E 85 pumps    Leadership of the Minnesota Corn Growers  who formed a coalition with the American Lung Association of Minnesota  the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition  and others to promote E 85 across the state     Finally  leadership on the part of the ethanol producers  who have developed innovative marketing arrangements  whereby they sell E 85 directly to gas stations  and cut out the oil company owned middleman  In Minnesota  about 2 3 of the gas stations that sell E 85 purchase it directly from the ethanol producer  and thats why they can afford to sell it at a price thats attractive to consumers    So what can we  at the federal level  learn from Minnesotas example  First  wherever possible  we should encourage ethanol producers to sell directly to gas stations  Outside of Minnesota  ethanol is generally sold under long term contract to blending terminals  which are part of the oil company owned pipeline system  The terminals then re sell the ethanol to gas stations  In essence  the price that consumers pay for ethanol is usually set by ethanols biggest competitor  the oil companies  When ethanol producers sell ethanol directly to gas stations without a middleman    drivers get the benefit of a low cost fuel    the ethanol producers collect the 51 cent per gallon federal blenders credit instead of the oil companies     and Americas energy dollars come right back to our rural communities    We have seen this model work well in Minnesota  pioneered by the Chippewa Valley Ethanol Company in Benson  They currently supply roughly a hundred gas stations that sell E 85 at 60 cents below the price of gas  Thats why I have introduced a bill that would help other states follow Minnesotas lead    the Ethanol Education and Expansion Act would provide tax credits for ethanol producers to install the kind of equipment they need to sell directly to gas stations  and I would like to thank you  Mr  Chairman  for cosponsoring this legislation    Second  we should not allow oil companies to block their franchised gas stations from selling renewable fuels  I have heard from gas stations in Minnesota that their franchise contracts make it so difficult to sell ethanol and biodiesel that many of them just cant do it  They have reported cases where    theyre not allowed to sell renewable fuels under the main canopy that bears the oil companys brand name    they cant convert the pumps and tanks they already have  because of a requirement to sell all three grades of gasoline    and theyre not even allowed to put up signs to let customers know they have renewable fuel for sale  where the pump is  or how much it costs    I offered a Right to Retail Renewable Fuel amendment to the Energy Bill that would prohibit oil companies from placing restrictions on where and how renewable fuels can be sold at gas stations  Im pleased to report that similar language was passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee  which will give us an opportunity to examine this issue in conference     The third and final thing we can learn from Minnesotas example is that a modest investment of federal dollars can yield big results on the ground  The coalition in Minnesota that raised  9 million for E 85 pumps was started with a grant of just  250 000 from the Department of Energy     In closing  I would simply state that the scarcity of pumps  caused in part by the oil companies unwillingness to allow for competition  is the single greatest factor limiting the positive impact that renewable fuels can and should have on our nations energy security  If we are serious about finding alternatives to foreign oil  we should ensure that drivers in every state have access to E 85 and biodiesel  Thank you  Mr  Chairman
