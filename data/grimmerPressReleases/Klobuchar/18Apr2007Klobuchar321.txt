                                                                                                            Senator Klobuchar Pushes for Lower Prescription Drug Prices for Seniors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Klobuchar pushes the issue on the Senate floor and speaks at press conference where Families USA report shows that drug prices skyrocketed by 9  in last year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    April 18  2007  Washington  D C   U S   today voted to move forward legislation that would empower Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drugs for America s seniors  A motion to start debate on the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007   S 3   failed by a vote of 55 to 42  Democrats and a handful of Republicans voted in favor of the motion  But  under Senate rules  60 votes were required  Today the Senate had the opportunity to remedy this problem and politics won out over providing affordable prescription drugs to our seniors  said Klobuchar  The Medicare prescription drug program was a major issue in last year s Senate campaign in Minnesota  When it created the Medicare Part D prescription drug program  which took effect last year  Congress banned Medicare from bargaining with drug companies to secure lower prices  As a result  Klobuchar said  Congress saddled seniors with inflated prices for their medications  while handing a huge financial windfall to the pharmaceutical industry  Klobuchar went on to say that in the first six months after Part D was implemented  the profits for the top 10 drug companies increased by over eight billion dollars   a 27 percent jump  Klobuchar said the ban on negotiating lower prices should be lifted  This is a matter of fairness for our seniors  who deserve affordable prices for their prescription drugs  And it is a matter of fairness for America s taxpayers  who pay 75 percent of the bill for Medicare Part D  Senator Klobuchar also discussed the issue off the Senate floor at a press conference highlighting a Families USA report showing that the top 15 commonly used medications have increased in price by an average of nine percent in the last year  Klobuchar said  Banning the government from negotiating with the prescription drug companies imposes substantial and unnecessary costs on America s taxpayers and seniors  who   as Families USA clearly reveals in their report today   are paying excessive prices for prescription medications  A copy of the report can be accessed here  Full text of Senator Klobuchar s Senate floor speech is below  When Congress passes a law  the American people have every right to expect that their elected representatives will do what s best for them  But the country did not get a fair deal in 2003 when Congress passed the Medicare Part D prescription drug program  Today the Senate had the opportunity to remedy this problem and politics won out over providing affordable prescription drugs to our seniors  Providing prescription drug coverage to millions of seniors is a very important benefit   and I very much support it  But Part D got off to a very rocky start  seniors were overwhelmed and confused  Many were not enrolled in a timely fashion  When they were enrolled  there were serious   even life threatening   delays in getting the medications they needed  A number of states   including my own   declared public health emergencies and had to step in to fill the gap  At the time  my mom   a former second grade teacher   told me that Medicare Part D got the letter grade it deserved from the beginning  Since then  many of these early problems with implementation have been remedied  Even today  however  Medicare Part D remains needlessly complex and confusing   with dozens of insurance companies involved  hundreds of different plans  and countless benefit structures  pricing tiers and drug formularies   not to mention the  doughnut hole   which each year eats a deep hole in the wallets and pocketbooks of millions of seniors  But  by far  the most serious flaw in the original law is the  non interference  clause that expressly prohibits Medicare from negotiating lower prices from pharmaceutical companies  This prohibition is contrary to how Medicare handles its purchases of others goods and services  It is contrary to how both Medicaid and the Veterans Affairs purchase medications for their beneficiaries  It is contrary to good business practices and to good government  This prohibition has imposed substantial   and unnecessary   costs on America s taxpayers and seniors  who are paying excessive prices for prescription drugs  An analysis last year by Merrill Lynch found that  after Part D took effect  prices on popular brand name drugs increased by 8 6 percent  And this week there is a new analysis from Families USA  It finds that the prices charged by the largest Part D plans for the 15 most commonly prescribed medications increased by an average of 9 2 percent during the past year  This increase is almost four times the general inflation rate  And it is nearly three times the cost of living adjustment that seniors received this year for their social security income  By banning the government from negotiating discounts  Congress saddled seniors with inflated prices for their medications  while handing a huge financial windfall to the pharmaceutical industry  As I travel throughout my state  Minnesotans tell me they are mystified and frustrated that the government has tied its own hands when it comes to achieving huge cost savings with prescription drugs  The people of my state repeatedly tell me that they want Medicare to use every possible tool to get the best prices  It is a simple principle of economics that consumers strike better deals when they band together and exercise their bargaining power  the power of the many has much more power than the power of the few  Congress rejected this sound  common sense principle when it barred Medicare from negotiating lower prices  This is just plain wrong  When appropriate  the government should be empowered to harness the collective bargaining power of 43 million Americans on Medicare to deliver low cost medications to seniors  We are now poised to give the government the power to negotiate  The House has already passed a measure to do so  Now it is our turn and it is our responsibility  Price Fairness This is a matter of fairness for our seniors  who deserve affordable prices for their prescription drugs  And it is a matter of fairness for America s taxpayers  who pay 75 percent of the bill for Medicare Part D  Under current law  only individual insurance companies can negotiate Medicare drug prices  The pharmaceutical industry has tried to reassure Americans that this will inevitably produce the lowest prices because of competition  This explanation is unconvincing  Evidence and experience show us that the present system often does not produce the fairest prices  The pharmaceutical companies like to say that Part D program costs are lower than projected  But beating artificial projections has not resulted in lower prices  Numerous studies show that Part D prices are significantly higher than prices for drugs in programs where negotiation is permitted  For example  a review of drug prices in Florida last October reported that the lowest retail price   the price you get by just shopping around   is usually cheaper than the Medicare price for popular drugs  In January this year  a study by Families USA found that the top five Medicare Part D insurance companies  serving two out of every three Medicare enrollees  charged prices at a median rate that was 58 percent higher than the same drugs provided to veterans through the VA  The study compared the lowest price available under part d and the lowest VA price for the 20 most common medications prescribed to seniors      Celebrex   for Arthritis   was 50 percent more expensive under Medicare Part D      Lipitor   for cholesterol and heart disease   was 51 percent more expensive      Nexium   for heartburn and acid reflux disease   was 65 percent more expensive  And if these aren t bad enough  consider these    Fosamax   was 205 percent more expensive under Part D and that s for osteoporosis      Protonix   for heartburn and acid reflux disease   was 435 percent more expensive      And Zocor   for cholesterol and heart disease   was over one thousand percent more expensive  With this tremendous disparity in drug prices  it simply defies common sense to assume that Medicare is giving our seniors a good deal  They should be negotiating for better prices  Maybe the discounts would not be as great as the VA gets  because of differences in how the program is run  But  how can anyone be satisfied when Medicare is paying prices that are  on average  58 percent higher  Can t we at least try to get a better deal  Can t we even allow the possibility of negotiation by Medicare  Yet  this administration and its Secretary of Health and Human Services have shown absolutely no interest in the potential of negotiation  In fact  the Secretary has been aggressively defiant about even the idea of it  This needs to change  Government negotiation There s another reason we should not trust the assurances of the pharmaceutical industry that America s seniors are already getting the lowest prices possible  The government can often negotiate bigger discounts than insurance companies  which represent smaller numbers of seniors  There is no good reason to arbitrarily foreclose this opportunity for gaining a price cut  By Medicare s own calculations  Part D private plans are negotiating prices that are 73 percent of the average wholesale prices  But Medicaid pays only 51 percent  And the VA pays only 42 percent  The Congressional Budget Office also agrees that the government could be more effective than private plans in negotiating prices for unique drugs that have no competition  Even limited savings on popular drugs could translate into billions of dollars  Consider Zocor and Lipitor  two top selling prescription medications  If Medicare could negotiate prices in line with what the VA gets  the savings from just these two drugs would be more than  2 8 billion each year  Even a fraction of this amount would still represent substantial savings  That would mean cheaper drugs for seniors  a better deal for taxpayers  and less government spending  Pharmaceutical companies The only real winners from a prohibition on negotiation are the pharmaceutical companies  They vigorously lobbied for the ban  knowing it would boost their profits while denying fair prices to seniors and taxpayers  They paid big money to make sure that they got a Medicare drug program that prohibited price negotiation  And now they re spending big money to keep that profitable ban in place  Since 1998  the pharmaceutical industry has spent over  650 million on lobbying  In just the past year and a half  they have spent a record  155 million  What are America s seniors supposed to think all that money goes for  The drug industry employs some 1 100 lobbyists  That is two drug lobbyists for every member of the United States Senate and House of Representatives  The pharmaceutical industry has fired up its lobbying machine again to oppose efforts to lift the ban  The industry s lobbying organization has been running a massive advertising campaign in opposition to negotiating lower prices  It includes full page ads in newspapers across the country  They ve been buying these ads in my state  too  The most recent full page ad appeared earlier this week in the Minneapolis Star Tribune  It tells Minnesotans how they are supposed to think   it uses quotes from the Washington Post  USA Today and the Atlanta Journal Constitution  Well  with all due respect to these good newspapers  we Minnesotans know how to think for ourselves   and we know how to reach our own conclusions  When it comes to Medicare Part D  the people of Minnesota have made up their minds  A statewide survey earlier this year found that fully 93 percent of Minnesotans want Medicare to have the power to bargain for lower prescription drug prices  But the drug industry keeps using scare tactics  throwing out words like  rationing  and  price controls   It ignores promising negotiation approaches that do not limit the drugs available to seniors and that do not involve price setting  I have dealt with this before  During my campaign last year  I was accused of trying to ration Lipitor  That simply isn t so  My mom takes Lipitor  If people think I would advance a proposal that would take my mom s drugs away  they don t know my mom  Allowing negotiation would not mean rationing  But lifting the ban on negotiations would cut into the hugely profitable windfall that the drug industry has enjoyed thanks to Medicare Part D  In just the first six months after Part D went into effect  the profits for the top 10 drug companies increased by over eight billion dollars  a 27 percent jump   It should be no surprise  Medicare Part D has provided the drug companies with a surge of new government subsidized customers  And Congress has allowed the drug companies to charge excessive prices  This has been especially true with the more than six million Americans who were transferred from Medicaid to Medicare under the new Part D law  They are known as  dual beneficiaries  or  dual eligibles  because they are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare  They now account for more than 25 percent of all Part D enrollees  Before the Part D law took effect  Medicaid was already buying prescription drugs for these individuals under a  best price  rule  This meant that the price a drug company offered Medicaid could not exceed the lowest price it received for that same drug in the private market  These  dual eligible  individuals are now covered only under Medicare Part D  which has no  best price  rule   and  of course  no negotiating power either  Two economists have analyzed last year s financial filings from the top drug companies  In a study released earlier this month  the two economists concluded that these companies have gained substantial new profits because they no longer had to provide the rebates and discounts previously demanded by Medicaid  That s great for the drug industry but it s not so great for the rest of us  You know  I grew up believing that every dollar  every quarter  every penny counts  I remember saving all my quarters from babysitting in a box in my room  But I also believe that s true for our government  for our taxpayers  and  especially  for our seniors  The average income for a retiree is about  15 000   with most living on a fixed income  Seniors need medications more than any other age group  For those over age 75  they depend on an average of almost eight prescription medications  So  for seniors  money and medication are a very serious matter  And it must be a serious matter for us  too  By lifting the ban on price negotiations  we will continue to give seniors access to the medications they need and the same broad range of plans  The difference is that the federal government   representing all 43 million Medicare beneficiaries   will also be at the bargaining table  It is time to lift this useless ban  It is time to negotiate with the powerful drug companies  And it is time to help our seniors get the lower  fairer prices they deserve for the life saving and life enhancing medications that they need
