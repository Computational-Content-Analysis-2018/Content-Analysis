Parity Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Historic legislation takes one more step toward making mental health coverage a reality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          March 5  2008 Washington  D C   Today  U S   spoke on the Senate Floor about the House of Representatives mental health parity bill that will honor the legacy of Senator Paul Wellstone and provide fair and equal access for mental health and chemical dependency treatment  Klobuchar said that the House bill marks a significant step towards making the legislation law  This is a watershed moment for this legislation  said Klobuchar  Today we are one step closer to fulfilling the dreams of Paul and Sheila Wellstone  This legislation will be a victory for millions of Americans living with mental illness who face unfair discrimination in their access to affordable health care treatment  Senator Klobuchar also recognized the efforts of Rep  Jim Ramstad  R MN   Rep  Patrick Kennedy  D MA   Senator Pete Domenici  R NM  and Senator Ted Kennedy  D MA  who have fought for years to pass strong legislation that will remove the barriers to mental health and chemical dependency treatment  Last fall  Klobuchar was successful in helping to pass mental health parity legislation in the Senate  With the House action today  the bill now moves towards a conference committee to work out the differences  Klobuchar said she prefers the House bill and will advocate for strengthening the Senate passed version so that the final bill will reflect the dream of Paul and Sheila Wellstone and the untiring efforts of others who have long championed the legislation  The bill passed the Senate unanimously on September 18  2007  The House passed their version of the legislation today  The text of Klobuchars full remarks as prepared for delivery are below or can be viewed by clicking  I rise today to commend the House for bringing our nation one step closer to achieving long overdue fairness for people suffering from mental illness and chemical dependency  We are now one step closer to realizing the dream of my friend  the late Senator Paul Wellstone  who championed equality for those with mental health needs until his untimely death in 2002  If this law finally passes  as it should  we can thank the persistence of leaders like Reps  Jim Ramstad and Patrick Kennedy  Sens  Pete Domenici and Ted Kennedy  and David Wellstone  who continues to carry the torch lit by his father  While federal law may not alleviate the stigma that surrounds mental illness  it can bring us closer to ending insurance discrimination and easing the unfair financial burden borne by patients and their families  Most health care plans currently have barriers to mental health and chemical dependency treatment  Individuals seeking treatment for these health problems face higher co payments and deductibles  as well as arbitrary limits on the number of office visits or inpatient days covered  These people pay the same premiums as everybody else  but when they get sick their insurance doesnt cover them The House and Senate proposals build upon the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 by mandating that if an insurer offers mental health and chemical dependency coverage  the treatment limitations can be no more restrictive than for medical benefits  My state of Minnesota is proud to have one of the strongest mental health parity laws in the country  But this law only goes so far  Federal action will expand mental health parity protections to those covered by self insured plans  117 million people  and move us toward real equity for those needing vital services  It is appropriate that this legislation is named in honor of Paul Wellstone  an inspiring figure whose ceaseless motion and tireless pursuit of a better world was brought to a stop only by a tragic and fatal plane crash  Many in this body  including myself  counted Paul as a friend  We all know that Paul was a crusader and a man with many passions  But anyone who ever met or talked with him quickly found out that he had a special passion for helping those with mental illness  This deep and abiding concern was shaped by the suffering of someone in his own family  Many of you may know Paul s story about his older brother  Steven  As a young child  Paul watched his brother s traumatic dissent into mental illness  As a freshman in college he suffered a severe mental breakdown and spent the next two years in mental hospitals  Eventually he recovered and graduated from college with honors  But it took his immigrant parents years to pay off the hospital bills  Writing about this  Paul recalled the years that his brother was hospitalized  For two years  he said  the house always seemed dark  even when the lights were on  It was such a sad home  Decades later  Paul knew there were far too many sad homes in our great nation  too many families devastated by the physical and financial consequences of mental illness  Paul knew that we can and we should do better  For years  he fought to allocate funding for better care  better services and better representation for the mentally ill and for years he fought for mental health parity in health insurance coverage  For Paul  this was always a matter of civil rights  of justice  and of basic human decency  And  of course  on this issue  as every other issue  Sheila and Paul were together  We should all care about securing mental health and chemical dependency treatment equity for the same reasons that Paul did  We should care  because of the suffering and stigma that individuals and families endure due to mental illness and addiction  We should care  because its cruel when people with mental health or addiction problems receive lesser care than those with physical health problems  We should care  because of the enormous financial cost of these diseases for our society and because the economic research shows how cost effective good treatment can be  I saw that firsthand as chief prosecutor for my states largest county  I cant tell you the number of violent crime cases I remember where the right treatment would have prevented a horrible crime  and the later costs of imprisonment  Untreated mental illness and substance abuse adds an enormous burden to the criminal justice system every day  Thats why we created a mental health court that has had many successes  as well as a drug court  But it would better to prevent people from getting into the system in the first place  Thats why this legislation is so important  Finally  we should care because we know that people who are suffering  54 million Americans suffer from mental illness or substance abuse    Almost 15 million suffer from depression    Over 2 million suffer from schizophrenic disorders    Over 20 million Americans need treatment for alcohol or drug abuse  These numbers are staggering  But ultimately what convinces anyone of the importance of this issue is when we see how real people close to us suffer  whether its a son or a daughter  a mother or father  a brother or a sister  a neighbor or a co worker  Patrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad have been brave enough to talk about their own struggles  I saw it with my dad  a larger than life dad who Ive seen climb the highest mountains  but also plunge to the lowest valleys of despair because of his battle with alcoholism  My dad got the treatment he needed and Ive never seen him so happy as in the past ten years  Other families deserve to be  as my dad puts it  pursued by grace  This legislation offers crucial support for people in need  Several months ago  the Senate unanimously voted in support of mental health equity  The House has now passed its legislation  It is somewhat stronger and I prefer it over the Senate version  But I trust these two bills will be reconciled and signed into law  This will be a victory for millions of Americans living with mental illness who face unfair discrimination in their access to affordable health care treatment  Again  I thank my colleagues in the Senate  Sens  Domenici and Kennedy  for their steadfast and persistent work  And I thank Patrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad for their continuing leadership to bring this historic legislation to a successful vote
