                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Legislation Would Help Prevent Wading Pool Incident That Severely Injured a Twin Cities Girl July 17  2007  WASHINGTON  D C   Saying that everything possible must be done to prevent horrific incidents like the one that severely injured a six year old Twin Cities girl at a local wading pool  U S   spoke on the Senate floor this morning and urged her colleagues to quickly vote for legislation to strengthen safety standards for the nations swimming pools and spas    Klobuchar said the bipartisan legislative proposal is scheduled for a Committee vote in the Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday this week  Klobuchar serves on the Committee    The legislation is named the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act in memory of the granddaughter of former Secretary of State James Baker     Klobuchar met earlier today with Graemes mother  Nancy Baker  Five years ago  seven year old Graeme drowned in a hot tub at a graduation party when the drains powerful suction trapped her underwater  It took two adults to pry her body free from the drain    Were currently in the midst of the summer swimming season  said Klobuchar  This is a time when children of all ages are having fun in the water  But along with the fun is a little known danger in our nations swimming pools that can cause serious injury or death for our children    Late last month  Abigail  Abbey  Taylor of Edina was severely injured at a wading pool in St  Louis Park when she sat over an open drain hole where the cover had apparently come loose or been removed  The drains powerful suction force tore out most of her small intestines    Nearly three weeks later  Abbey remains hospitalized after undergoing several surgeries  She will survive  but is expected to need a feeding tube for the rest of her life    Klobuchar said she has talked with Abbeys father     It never even crosses a parents mind that at the bottom of a kiddie pool is something with enough force to cause death or severe injury  she said  When first reported  this seemed like a one of a kind freak event  It turns out this type of incident has happened too many times before    In 2005  the U S  Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a report saying that  since 1990  at least 130 people  mostly children  have been entrapped by the suction force of pool and spa drains  resulting in 27 deaths and many more emergency room visits and hospitalizations     These incidents are preventable  said Klobuchar  There are simple protections available that can literally save childrens lives  The purpose of this legislation is to reduce the possibility that any other child will end up like Graeme Baker or Abbey Taylor    The legislation Cosponsored with Senators Mark Pryor  D AR   Chris Dodd  D CT   and Ted Stevens  R AK  would      Prohibit the manufacture  sale or distribution of drain covers that do not meet anti entrapment safety standards established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission      Create an incentive grant program for states to adopt comprehensive pool safety laws requiring certain water safety devices to protect children     Establish a National Drowning Prevention Program within the Consumer Product Safety Commission     When we take our kids to a pool  Klobuchar said  we should be able to trust that its equipped with basic safety features to prevent serious injury or death  This legislation is meant to ensure that those protections will be there    The full text of Senator Klobuchars floor speech is below    Mr  President  the Senate is in its second week of debate on the future of the U S  Military engagement in Iraq  Its a very timely and momentous debate which reflects the American people s concerns with events in Iraq and I am hopeful that more of my colleagues will join those of us who have voted over and over again to limit the U S  engagement in Iraq     I opposed this war from the start  Mr  President  and I have long advocated for a responsible change of course in the Administration s policy  I believe the best thing that we can do for our troops  for our national interest  and for the Iraqis themselves is to begin transitioning to Iraqi authority and to begin bringing our troops home in a responsible way by removing the bulk of U S  Combat forces by the spring of next year     I remember  Mr  President  being at the funeral for one of our brave fallen soldiers in Minnesota and hearing the priest say that this young man was a strong  strapping boy and he was over six feet tall  He said the kids we re sending over there may be over six feet tall  but theyre still our children  And  if they re over six feet tall  then our leaders must be eight feet tall to make these difficult decisions  I hope this week  Mr  President  that this Congress stands tall that the United States Senate stands tall and makes the right decision     Mr  President  Im here today to talk about another subjectan accident that happened in Minnesota over the 4th of July break  It brought home to me and many people in my state that there are many ways that government must act to protect its citizens  Some of them are larger than life  a debate over the strategy in Iraq  and others are smaller and quieter  a little girl lying maimed in a hospital bed after an accident that a simple law could have prevented     We are in the midst of a summer swimming season in our state and all over the countrytime when children of all ages take to the swimming pools  as they should  And today I want to speak about the terrible injuries suffered by a young girl in my state only weeks ago  This little girls story gives me a sense of urgency about moving the legislation that is currently pending in the Senatelegislation that is going to be considered by the Commerce Committee this weekwhich would help prevent serious injury or death for other children in the future     Abigail Taylor  known as Abby  is a 6 year old girl from Edina  Minnesota  a girl with big brown eyes and a dazzling smile  who loved to swim  Last month  Abby went swimming at a local pool  She was in a shallow wading pool when she sat over an open drain hole and had most of her intestines torn out by the drain s powerful suction  Somehow  this little 6 year old girl managed to stand up and take a few steps before collapsing along the side of the wading pool     Now  nearly three weeks later  she remains hospitalized after undergoing several surgeries  She will survive  thanks to a miracle  but doctors expect she will need a feeding tube the rest of her life     All of this simply because she spent a sunny  summer day at a pool     What happened to this little six year old girl is horrific  My own daughters name is Abigail and hearing about this incident brings chills to any parent  When I first saw the story in our local newspaper  I had to stop reading because the details of it were so disturbing  They would be for any parent  You look at this first as a mother  your daughter is enjoying a beautiful summer day having fun playing at the local pool  it is not even the deep pool  its just the kiddy pool   but suddenly something terrible happens and your life is changed forever     When it was first reported  like everyone else  I thought this was a freak one of a kind incident  I never thought I would spend time talking about it on the Senate floor  But then I learned that unfortunately this is not the first time this has happened  As it turns out  although most pools are safe and well maintained  this type of incident has happened too many times before  resulting in the death of several dozen children over the past fifteen years     It even has a name  pool entrapment  It occurs when a child becomes stuck on a drain and is unable to escape due to high velocity and pressure of the water being sucked into the drain  Another scenario occurs when hair or jewelry gets sucked into the drain making it difficult for a child to pull free  According to the Consumer Products Safety Commission  the pressure on some pool drains can be as strong as 300 pounds per inch  In fact  several years ago the Commission produced an educational video on this danger  It showed a muscle bound man trying to pull a ball off of a swimming pool drain using both arms and all his might and he could not do it  The suction force was too powerful     Two years ago  the Consumer Products Safety Commission issued a report saying it was aware of at least 27 deaths and many more emergency room visits and hospitalizations  due to this entrapment  Most of these victims were children  It is unclear how many actual entrapment incidents there have been that have not resulted in death but severe injury because entrapment is a little known risk and it is possible that many swimming pool drowning deaths or other injuries have not been classified as caused by entrapment     I think it curious I know of three of these incidents  the one in Minnesota  the one Im about to talk about involving Jim Baker s granddaughter and another one in which former Senator Edwards represented a family involving a drain     You know it never even crosses a parents mind that at the bottom of a kiddy pool is something that enough force will cause death or severe injury  It should never have happened  We must do everything we can to make sure it never have happens again we must do everything we can to make sure that it never happens again to any child  because it is preventable     There are several simple ways as we will discuss in the Commerce hearing this week for manufacturers to reduce entrapment risks at pools  installing anti entanglement and anti entrapment drain covers  installing multiple drains to decrease the force of each drain  installing a gravity flow or a safety vacuum release system that prevents entrapment by automatically shutting off the pool pump     These anti entrapment measures are simple and inexpensive and they can literally save children s lives  I saw a drain today  Mr  President  that costs  50  that plus adequate monthly inspections can save lives  There are also reasonable measures that congress can take to help strengthen pool safety standards and prevent this kind of terrible incident from ever happening again to another child     The Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over product safety  It is led by two of my colleagues  Senators Inouye and Stevens who have been leaders on this issue  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the legislation introduced last week by Senators Pryor  Stevens  Dodd and myself which would strengthen the safety standards for America s swimming pools and spas so we can prevent the kind of incident that happened to six year old Abbey Taylor  As chairman of the consumer subcommittee Senator Pryor has pushed to have this legislation included on the agenda for the senate committee markup  This legislation is called the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act named in the memory of the seven year old granddaughter of former secretary of state James Baker     It was an honor to meet this morning with Graemes mother  She was here in her daughter s memory to meet members of congress  Several years ago graham died of suction entrapment in a spa  Her body was held underwater by the force of the suction and it took two adults to help pry her free from the drain but it was too late she had already drowned  This tragedy occurred at a graduation party that was well supervised by scores of adults     The purpose of this legislation is to reduce the likelihood that any other child will end up like Graeme Baker or Abbey Taylor  This same bill was introduced last year and the Senate passed it by unanimous consent but in the closing days of the last Congress it failed to pass the House of Representatives by a narrow margin  Now what do you say when you talk like I did to the father of this little girl  of Abbey Taylor  who is laying  maimed in a hospital bed losing her intestines  You tell him that  well  we got it through the Senate but the House just did not have the votes to do it  These parents are so courageous that they have moved on from that and they want her severe injury to be discussed today  They re not afraid to have us talk about what happened to their little daughter because they want it never to happen to another child again     This year  this legislation must pass  The legislation has several important provisions  It would take Consumer Product Safety Commission standards for pool drains which are now voluntary and make them mandatory  It would prohibit the manufacture  sale or distribution of drain covers that do not meet the standards established by the Commission  It is important to strengthen the legislation to make sure that not only new pools but all public pools meet the same standard  The legislation would also provide incentives for states to adopt their own comprehensive pool safety laws regarding certain water safety devices that they be installed to protect children  It also would contain grants to create these incentives  There s a saying that when an accident happens  Mr  President  if I could just have one more minute  Thank you      There is a saying that when an accident happens that could reasonably have been prevented then its not really accurate to call it an accident  Its actually a failure  In case of injuries and deaths caused by pool entrapment its not a failure by children or by their parents  Its really a failure of our product safety laws  This means its also a failure that is within our power to correct  a problem that can be faced through reasonable measures and fixed by legislation  We deal  Mr  President  with issues larger than life as we will today as we debate the war in Iraq but sometimes a simple small change in the law will save the life of a small child  Let us never forget what happened to the innocent children like Abbey Taylor and Graeme Baker  For the health and safety of all our children  I urge the Senate to take quick action to improve this legislation  Thank you  Mr  President and I yield the floor
