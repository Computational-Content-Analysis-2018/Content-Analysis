                                                                                                            Senator Klobuchar Votes in Support of College Cost Reduction Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Makes college more affordable for students through increased grants and lower interest rates September 7  2007 Washington  D C   Today    D MN  cast her vote in favor of the Higher Education Act  slashing student interest rates in half and increasing the Pell Grant program  The College Cost Reduction Act  S  2996  sponsored by Senators Edward Kennedy  D MA  and Mike Enzi  R WY   will provide more than  20 billion to help students and families pay for college  In addition to increasing access to higher education for Americans  the legislation aims to improve our K 12 schools by promoting effective teacher preparation programs    Todays passage of the Higher Education Act is a victory for all Americans  providing important resources to expand educational opportunities for millions of hardworking  determined students  We must ensure the next generation of American leaders has the necessary preparation to succeed in a global world  said Klobuchar    The cost of college has nearly tripled in the past 20 years  but federal financial aid has not kept up  Todays bill will make college more affordable by     Increasing access for low income students by raising the maximum Pell Grant to  5 100 and  5 400 by 2012 and implementing the Promise Grant program      Protecting borrowers by capping monthly loan payments at 15  of discretionary income      Interest Rates  student loan interest rates for subsidized Stafford Loans  for undergrads  will be cut nearly in half to 3 4  by 2011      Encouraging public service by providing loan forgiveness for public service employees who continue in public service for 10 years including employees of non profit organizations     In addition  reforms will be made to the student loan system  through protecting students and cleaning up the student loan industry so it works to benefit students  not lenders    This year  nearly 80 000 Minnesotans received Pell Grants  at a maximum of  4 310  next year they will be able to receive  5 100 by the 2008 2009 year and  5 400 by 2012 2013 year    What the Bill means for Minnesota    In 2007  Minnesota received 185 5 million in Pell Grant dollars     Under the bill  Minnesota will receive an additional 26 8 million in need based grant aid next year     Over the next 5 years  MN will receive 291 8 million in additional need based grant aide     These numbers will increase the average grant in Minnesota by  350 in 2008 to  2 790     What the bill does for Minnesotans    A social worker with one child in Minnesota earning  47 880  with average student loan debt of  20 560  would have his or her monthly payments reduced by  28  from  237 to  209  This is a reduction of 12     Under this bill  a starting teacher in Minnesota earning  31 632 with the state average loan debt of  20 560 could have loan payments capped at 15    reducing their monthly payments by  69  from  237 to  168  a reduction of 29   After 10 years of teaching  all remaining debt would be forgiven  in this case  a benefit worth  11 729     The costs of higher education are soaring  blocking many qualified students from attending college and forcing many others to end their education prematurely  Student loan debt has become a crippling financial burden for students  both during and after their studies  The College Cost Reduction Act will provide significant help directly to students and their families  said Klobuchar    In addition to supporting todays bill  Senator Klobuchar is a sponsor of the Middle Class Opportunity Act  which aims to expand access to college by consolidating three major tax deductions and credits into a single  2 500 annual credit to cover tuition  fees and textbooks    The College Cost Reduction Act increases access to higher education through a reallocation of federal education money and a reauthorization of programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965  Congress first passed the Higher Education Act more than 40 years ago  guided by the principle that no qualified student should be denied the opportunity to attend college because of the cost  The amendments to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act not only ensures that all qualified students have the opportunity for higher education but it also holds colleges accountable for rising tuition costs by creating a nationwide watch list  simplifies the financial aid process by reforming the Free Application for Federal Student Aid  FAFSA  and makes certain that lenders and colleges follow high ethical standards    The bill passed the Senate today by a vote of 79 to 12 and the House is expected to vote on the same legislation later today  If the House passes the bill  it then moves to the Presidents desk for approval
