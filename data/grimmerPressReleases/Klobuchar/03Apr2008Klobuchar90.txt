                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Call for  45 million in emergency supplemental April 3  2008 Washington  D C   As congressional leaders draft emergency supplemental legislation  Senators Amy Klobuchar  D MN  and Senators Barbara A  Mikulski  D Md   today led a bipartisan coalition of their colleagues to fight to include  45 million to support reintegration initiatives for National Guard members and Reservists returning from combat  In separate letters to Appropriations Chairman Robert C  Byrd  D W V   and Ranking Member Thad Cochran  R Mo    and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Daniel K  Inouye  D Hawaii  and Ranking Member Ted Stevens  R Alaska   the Senators noted that the Presidents fiscal year 2009 budget provides no funding for reintegration initiatives for National Guard members and Reservists  including the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program  which was authorized as part of the fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization bill  H R  4986   This is about putting our nations heroes first  said Senator Klobuchar  As Americans  we are all proud of the men and women who serve in our nations armed forces and risk their lives every day  We must make sure that we give our troops the resources they need both in the field and at home when they return  Minnesotas National Guard  along with all Guard members and Reservists  continue to serve us all proudly both at home and abroad  these brave men and women are always there when we need them most and we must honor their sacrifice  The Guard is treated like a step child when they fight abroad  and when they return  It is unacceptable that returning members of the Guard and Reserve dont receive the same care as returning active duty Soldiers  even though we are asking them to make the same sacrifices  said Senator Mikulski  a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  We know that the stress of combat and long deployments away from home can wreak havoc on our troops well being and family life in the months after their return  The brave men and women in our Guard and Reserve have been fighting side by side with our active duty troops in Iraq and Afghanistan so that we may live in freedom  they deserve the same support from the government when they return to their civilian lives  While President Bush continues to ask for billions of federal dollars every week for the war  his administration has not fully funded a national reintegration program for National Guard and Reserve personnel to assist their transition from combat to civilian life  The Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program  which establishes paid reintegration events at 30  60 and 90 day intervals upon return  will also provide counseling and services for members and their families  The program is especially crucial because  unlike active duty soldiers who live and work with their military units and have ready access to counseling and care  Guardsmen and Reservists are with their units only during their short post deployment processing window  After this point  it becomes increasingly challenging for them to access the services they need  Without a fully funded national reintegration program  some states  including Minnesota and Maryland  have had to either fully or partially fund their programs  Adequate federal funding is critical to ensuring this programs implementation nationwide to meet our obligation to provide the benefits our soldiers earn during their time in harms way  Last year  Senator Klobuchar was a leader in the fight to pass the Defense Authorization amendment which created the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program  based on the highly successful Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program of the Minnesota National Guard  She has called for more equitable benefits for deployed Guard members and secured additional federal support for Minnesotas innovative Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program  With approximately 1 500 members of the Maryland National Guard returning from overseas deployments in the next six months  Senator Mikulski and Maryland Governor Martin O Malley held a roundtable discussion in March with members of the National Guard and their families  At the event  she pledged to fight for the supplemental funding  and to continue efforts to fully fund the program for fiscal year 2009  Senators signing the letters include  Max Baucus  D Mont    Sherrod Brown  D Ohio   Benjamin L  Cardin  D Md    Saxby Chambliss  R  Ga    Norm Coleman  R Minn    Johnny Isakson  R Ga    Blanche L  Lincoln  D Ark    Bernie Sanders  I Vt    Gordon H  Smith  R Ore    John E  Sununu  R N H    Jon Tester  D Mont   and Ron Wyden  D Ore    The Senate is expected to consider the emergency supplemental spending bill in late April
