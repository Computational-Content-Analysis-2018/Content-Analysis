middle class Americans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 April 24  2008 Washington  D C   With gas prices at an all time high of  3 51 per gallon  today U S   called for the creation of a Department of Justice Oil and Gas Market Fraud Task Force to look into skyrocketing energy prices in the oil and gas sector  Klobuchar wrote U S  Attorney General Michael Mukasey urging him to immediately create the task force  as part of the Presidents Corporate Fraud Task Force  as one step in helping middle class families cope with the drastic increase in energy prices   With oil soaring well over  100 a barrel and oil companies raking in record profits by drilling into middle class pocketbooks  its time American families had someone to look into what is going on  said Klobuchar  Gas prices are at an all time record  and the onset of Lake Season in Minnesota is near  so we must look for every possible opportunity to help our families save their hard earned money in these difficult economic times    Klobuchar said it is no longer sufficient to say that high energy prices are simply the result of supply and demand  Energy market experts and states attorneys general have testified before Congress that the current high price of oil and gas cannot be explained by market forces     Earlier this month  an executive from Exxon Mobil testified under oath that the price of oil should be  50 to  55 per barrel based on supply and demand fundamentals  In October 2007 the CEO of Marathon Oil  Clarence Cazalot Jr  said   100 oil isn t justified by the physical demand in the market  It has to be speculation on the futures market that is fueling this     Klobuchar has joined Senator Maria Cantwell  D WA  in proposing that the task force be part of the Corporate Fraud Task Force at the Department of Justice  which was established after the collapse of Enron and other revelations of corporate scandal  Since its establishment  the task force has produced more than a thousand convictions by aggressively prosecuting corporate fraud under existing laws  Creating this new division to oversee the oil and gas sector would help protect consumers from price gouging by oil companies    The full text of the letter is below     The Honorable Michael Mukasey  Attorney General  Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20530     Dear Mr  Attorney General     I write to urge you to establish a new Oil and Gas Market Fraud Task Force under the Department of Justice to protect Americans from price gouging and market manipulation     The affordability of energy is central to the economic health of our country  and the prosperity of our families and businesses  Their already tight budgets are being further squeezed by the skyrocketing cost of oil and natural gas  prices have tripled since 2002  In my state of Minnesota  farmers are paying record high prices for fertilizer and fuel  The timber and chemical industries are suffering from the rising cost of natural gas  And families are being forced to make increasingly difficult budget choices  for example  between filling prescriptions and heating their homes  These are choices no family should have to make      It is no longer sufficient to say that high energy prices are simply the result of supply and demand  Energy market experts and state attorneys general alike have testified before Congress that the current high price of oil and gas cannot be explained by market forces  A major oil company executive has testified that the price of crude oil should be approximately  50 to  55 given market fundamentals  but the current price is more than double that amount     Following the collapse of Enron and other revelations of corporate scandal  a Corporate Fraud Task Force was established at the Department of Justice  The Task Force has since produced more than a thousand convictions by aggressively prosecuting corporate fraud under existing laws  Creating a new division of the Corporate Fraud Task Force  with the specific mission of overseeing energy markets  would allow us to apply its considerable resources to protecting consumers from oil and gas price gouging     Oil companies have been quick to dismiss the possibility that market manipulation is taking place  However  when Congress directed the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the price increases following Hurricane Katrina  the FTC found 15 instances of price gouging     The cost of energy affects Americans from all walks of life and businesses in every sector of our economy  The federal government has a critical role to play in conducting aggressive oversight of changing energy markets  History has shown us that when enforcement is lax  consumers ultimately pay the price  I am therefore proud to join my colleague Senator Cantwell in urging you to create the Oil and Gas Market Fraud Task Force to put an end to market manipulation and fraud in energy markets        Sincerely        Amy Klobuchar      United States Senator
