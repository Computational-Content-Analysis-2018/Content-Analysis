                                                                                                                November 9  2007 Washington  D C     D MN  marked the start of Veterans Day weekend by announcing that she will introduce two new initiatives on behalf of Minnesotas veterans  the Rural Veterans Mobile Support System and a bill expanding access to mental health care for Guard and Reserve families  As a nation  we have an obligation to wrap our arms around the soldiers and families who serve and sacrifice for us  said Klobuchar  As they return to communities across Minnesota  we owe it to our soldiers to ensure they have access to the health care  education  and resources they need for a smooth return to civilian life  Klobuchars bill would expand and ensure access to mental health care for the family members of deployed Guard and Reserve soldiers  This legislation addresses concerns Senator Klobuchar has heard across Minnesota from Guard and Reserve families who face challenges in coping with the absence of their deployed family members  The bill will require TRICARE plans to cover mental health care or substance abuse treatment at any state accredited facility enrolled for family members of deployed Guard and Reserve soldiers  Currently  mental health care resources for military families are largely limited to care provided on major military installations or through TRICARE designated facilities  Klobuchars Rural Veterans Mobile Support System is a pilot program that will mobilize VA resources to bring them directly to veterans in rural communities  The program would bring VA doctors  nurses  and caseworkers directly to veterans in areas where access to VA facilities is limited  Its services would include the ability to prescribe  fill  and deliver necessary medication to veterans  regular mental health screenings to identify potential mental health disorders such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or substance abuse  and job placement assistance and information on employment or training opportunities  The Mobile Support System would also offer assistance with paperwork and counseling on available benefits  such as pensions or tuition assistance  Both bills will be introduced in the Senate next week  Senator Klobuchar has pursued a number of initiatives on behalf of the Minnesota National Guard and all of Minnesotas veterans  Supported Minnesotas Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Program  securing increased funding for the program as part of the FY08 Defense Appropriations bill and co sponsoring with Senator Coleman an amendment creating a national reintegration program based on Minnesotas successful model    Secured  3 5 million for the construction of a Joint Force Headquarters and Emergency Operations Center at Arden Hills Army Training Site and  17 45 million for the Collective Training Facility at Camp Ripley  The funding passed as part of the H R  2642  the 2008 Appropriations bill for Military Construction  Department of Veterans Affairs  and Related Agencies  which passed the full Senate yesterday and is headed to the President for signature   Co sponsored amendment on behalf of National Guard Certified Nurse Aides to allow nursing aides who have served on active duty an additional 24 months after returning from active duty service to perform nurse or nurse related services before expiration of their certifications  This amendment came at the request of Minnesota National Guard members in Iraq   Supported the Coming Together for Guard and Reserve Families Act  Provides support and assistance for families of members of the Selected Reserve who are undergoing deployment   Co sponsor of the Total Force Educational Assistance Enhancement and Integration Act  which would provide more equitable educational benefits to the Selected Reserve  National Guard members and Reservists who are most ready and first to be mobilized     Introduced the National Guard and Reserve Education Benefit Fairness Act to provide educational benefits to members of the Selected Reserve based on the length of their actual Active Duty service  not the service date printed on their orders  The bill comes as a direct response to the case of the Minnesota National Guard members of the 1 34th Brigade Combat Team  in which about half of the soldiers returning from a 16 month deployment in Iraq were denied full educational benefit packages  Our promises to our nations soldiers shouldnt be wrapped in red tape  said Klobuchar  What has happened to our Minnesota Red Bulls should never happen to another returning unit  Many of these soldiers have put their education on hold  their lives on hold  and their families on hold to honor their duty and serve our nation  By awarding these benefits  were doing something for them in return  In October  Klobuchar also brought together leaders of Minnesotas veterans community  including VA officials  MN National Guard commanders  representatives from veterans service organizations  and concerned citizens to who are actively working to repay the debt we owe our states veterans at a Veterans Summit  The summit led to an engaging discussion of how we can better address the challenges our soldiers face when they return from the battlefield  and how we can deliver on our long term commitment to support our veterans  Senator Klobuchar will
