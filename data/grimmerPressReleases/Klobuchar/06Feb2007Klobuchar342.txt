                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Klobuchar from senate floor   I do not support what I saw take place in these chambers yesterday   February 6  2007  Washington  D C   U S   this morning took to the U S  Senate floor  speaking out against the decision to halt progress on the bipartisan resolution opposing the President s plan to send more troops to Iraq  Last night  the Senate voted against moving forward on the bipartisan resolution  S 470  introduced by Senators John Warner  R VA  and Carl Levin  D MI   Senator Klobuchar s speech on the Senate floor is as follows  Mr  President  for the last few weeks  a bipartisan group of Senators has worked to bring to the floor a resolution expressing opposition to the President s proposal to increase American troops in Iraq  In an effort to have an honest  thoughtful and productive debate  they put aside their differences  only to be run over by partisan politics  I support the bi partisan resolution opposing the escalation  I support an honest and open debate on a policy that clearly needs to change  But I do not support what I saw take place in these chambers yesterday  Our soldiers and their families have sacrificed too much to accept the political obstructionism that s keeping this body from having a debate on the most critical issue  Our troops have given so much  and they deserve much more than what they got from the United States Senate yesterday  The least we can do is to have this debate and the best we can do is to get this policy right for our troops  I d like to thank those who worked on these resolutions   Senators Levin and Warner and Senators Biden and Hagel and others  Throughout their careers they have shown how much they care for the men and women in uniform  In crafting these resolutions  they showed us that when principled individuals from opposing parties care strongly about an issue  politics doesn t always have to win out  Unfortunately  some in this body still don t want to have a debate about Iraq  It s long past time to have this debate  The American people have called for it  our troops have earned it  and we should be big enough to have it  Over three thousand American soldiers are dead  More than twenty thousand have been wounded in combat  Over two thousand have lost their limbs  More than 350 billion dollars in taxpayer money has gone to Iraq  Scores of Iraqis are killed every day in what has essentially devolved into a civil war  All across my state  I have heard a strong and clear message from Minnesotans  Change the course in Iraq  And push for the strategy and solutions that will bring our troops home  We need a surge in diplomacy Mr  President  not a surge in troops  It is a message that was echoed all across this country   from Montana to Minnesota  from Pennsylvania to Virginia  Unfortunately  there were those in this chamber yesterday who did not listen tot hat message  who would prefer no debate  This bipartisan resolution expresses the strong opposition of this body to the President s decision to stay the course and send an additional 21 000 American troops to Iraq  I strongly support this bipartisan resolution  and implore my colleagues to allow this resolution its due course  The people of Minnesota  like their fellow citizens around the country  recognize what is at stake in Iraq  Of the twenty two thousand troops involved in the surge  nearly three thousand  Mr  President  are from Minnesota  As I travel throughout our state  I have spoken with many families who have paid a personal price in this war   and I think of them often  I think of Claremont Anderson from Hoffman  Minnesota who would drive hundreds of miles to attend public events in the last two years  I just saw him and his wife Nancy just this weekend who braved 70 degree below zero wind chills to come to an event in Glenwood  Minnesota And when I see Claremont  anytime anyone even talks about the war he starts to cry  That s because his son  Stuart  an Army Reserve major  was killed in a helicopter crash in Iraq  I think of Kathleen Wosika from St  Paul  Minnesota  Just last month  her son  James Wosika  Jr   was killed while he was patrolling on foot in an area near Fallujah  He was a sergeant with the Minnesota Army National Guard 1st Brigade   the same unit whose current duty will be extended under the President s escalation  Sergeant Wosika was the third member of his unit to die within a six week period  He was the seventh member of the brigade to be killed since their deployment last spring  I also think of Becky Lourey of Kerrick  Minnesota  that s near Duluth  She is a mother of twelve and a former state senator  Her son  Matt  was killed when the Army helicopter he was piloting went down north of Baghdad  I watched this Gold Star mother  a woman who has adopted eight children  comfort her grandchildren  hold her shaking husband  and stand tall for hours in a high school gym in Finlayson  Minnesota where hundreds of people came to gather for her son s memorial service  Claremont Anderson  Kathleen Wosika and Becky Lourey are parents whose children made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country  And they are among the many Minnesotans who told me  without apology  that they want to see a change of course in Iraq  They pray that others will not have to experience their pain  Although I opposed this war from the beginning  I recognize that many did support it  But  four years later  we are now dealing with a dramatically different situation  What we know now about the events and facts leading up to the war has changed dramatically  The conditions inside Iraq have changed dramatically  Our role there has changed dramatically  Last November  citizens in Minnesota and across the country voted for a new direction in Washington  Americans made clear at the ballot box that they were tired of the politics as usual partisan bickering and that they wanted a meaningful and bipartisan change of course in Iraq  To the country s bewilderment  the President responded with a plan to escalate the number of American troops in Iraq  That is not the change in course that the American people voted for Mr  President  It is not the change of course that the Iraq Study Group recommended  It is not the change in course that Iraq needs to halt its civil war  It is not the change in course that our military forces deserve  And now  distinguished Senators from both sides of the aisle are seeking ways for this body to bring about the right kind of change  The bi partisan resolution proposes a strategy that recognizes the facts on the ground in Iraq  It incorporates many of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group  For years we have heard from administration officials  from military officials and from the Iraqis themselves that there can be no military solution in Iraq  Stability can only be achieved through diplomatic and political solutions  This resolution calls on the administration to engage other nations in the region to create conditions for the compromises between Iraqi Shiites  Sunnis and Kurds that will be necessary for peace  Furthermore  the resolution calls on the administration to apply pressures on the Iraqis themselves to stand up and take responsibility for their country  By following the recommendations of this resolution  the President would send a much stronger signal to the Iraqis that we are not going to be staying there indefinitely  As of last Thanksgiving  this war has now lasted longer than World War II  And after nearly four years of intensive military involvement in Iraq  including more than 3 000 American deaths  we have to be focused on reducing our troop presence in Iraq instead of putting even more American servicemen and women in harm s way  Haven t we asked our men and women to sacrifice enough  Recently  at the funeral for a fallen soldier  I heard a local priest say that our leaders have an obligation to do right by our children when we send them to war  He said that our children may be over six feet tall when we send them to war  but they are still our children  If the kids we are sending to Iraq are six feet tall  he said  then our leaders must be eight feet tall  I would add that  if these soldiers are willing to stand up and risk their lives for our country  then those of us in Congress must be brave enough to stand up  and ask the tough questions and push for the tough solutions  Claremont Anderson  Kathleen Wosika  and Becky Lourey are standing tall Mr  President  The parents who I met with this weekend whose kids are supposed to be coming home this month but are now staying much longer  they are doing everything to be brave and stand tall  The 400 members of the Minnesota Air National Guard whose deployment ceremony I attended Sunday in Duluth  Minnesota  they are standing tall  The teenage brother and sister I met with there  who will see not only their dad  but also their mom be deployed in the next two weeks  Those two kids are standing tall  My friend  Senator Webb  whose son is serving bravely  is going to speak with us briefly  He s over there and he s not afraid  he s standing tall  The injured soldiers in the VA hospital in Minnesota  recovering from traumatic brain injuries and in their wheelchairs  with their strength and their spirit  they too are standing tall  And I would say to my friends across the aisle  by having an honest and open debate on this war and on this resolution  we in Congress can also and finally stand tall  Our Constitution says that Congress should be a responsible check and balance on presidential power  Congressional oversight of our Iraq policy is long overdue  Now we have been seeing this bipartisan resolution and bipartisan work challenging the President s proposal for an escalation of American troop levels in Iraq  Even as commander in chief  a president does not enjoy unlimited power  On behalf of the public  members of this body have a responsibility to exercise our own constitutional power   in a fair minded  bipartisan way   to insist on accountability and to demand a change of course  Ultimately  the best way to help our soldiers and their families is not only to give them the respect they deserve  but also Mr  President to get this policy right  I would hope that my friends across the aisle would see the merits of this resolution and the urgency of having an open and honest debate on this issue  Our troops and their families deserve nothing less  Thank you very much
