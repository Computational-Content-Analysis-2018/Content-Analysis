                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Klobuchar Emphasizes the Extraordinary Accomplishments of Minnesota s Arctic Explorers  Will Steger and Ann Bancroft  who  inspire action on global warming  January 30  2007  Washington  D C   U S    D MN  today delivered remarks to the Senate Environment and Public Works  EPW  Committee s meeting about global warming  Klobuchar  a member of the EPW Committee  discussed the effect global warming had on Minnesota s environment and also highlighted the work of arctic explorers Will Steger and Ann Bancroft  Klobuchar s remarks as delivered are below  Madam Chair  I m honored to be here with you to talk about this important subject  I m especially glad to be here at a time where this discussion has advanced beyond whether or not global warming exists but to what the solutions are to solve it  I respect the leadership of so many of my colleagues on this issue  the work that s being done on a bipartisan basis  Especially my friend  the new Senator Sanders who showed his usual chivalry by allowing me to go first today  Thank you  As a member of this committee  as well as the Agriculture and Commerce committees  I look forward to being very engaged in seeking positive bipartisan solutions to global warming  These solutions should build on our efforts to develop homegrown energy sources  so we can move away from our dependency on foreign oil  Every day  Congress makes decisions that have a great impact on the American people and people throughout the world  But our decisions on global warming may well be the ones that have the most profound impact on our future generations and on the very fate of the earth  Madam Chair  in Minnesota  we love the outdoors and we take pride in the richness and beauty of our natural resources  We protect our forests and our prairies  our lakes and rivers  our diverse wildlife and abundant farmland  It s January now in Minnesota   and this past weekend the temperatures in my state were below zero  We ve had the Winter Carnival going on  Ice Box Days in International Falls   we always welcome you to visit  But many people here might wonder why Minnesotans would be concerned if it warmed up a few degrees  Well  we are concerned   we re deeply concerned  We are concerned for ourselves and for the rest of the world  We are concerned for the impact of global warming and the effect it s already having  Global warming is on the rise  with enormous consequences for our world and our economy  2006 was the hottest year ever in this country  capping a nine year streak unprecedented in the historical record  December in Minnesota felt more like October  Our ice fishing seasons are shorter and our skiers and snowmobilers haven t seen much snow  Worldwide  glaciers are rapidly melting  Just last week  it was reported that glaciers in the European Alps will be all but gone by the year 2050  Experts worry that within 25 years  there won t be a single glacier in Glacier National Park  We ve seen record storms all across the world  Globally  sea levels have risen 4 to 10 inches over the past century  The frequency of extremely heavy rainfalls has increased throughout much of the United States  The impact is especially dire in Greenland and the Arctic region  The temperature changes there have been the greatest  resulting in widespread melting of glaciers  thinning of the polar ice cap and rising permafrost temperatures  In Minnesota  stewardship for the environment is a part of our heritage and it has been an especially important part of preserving our economy  So global warming is an issue that strikes us close to home  That s why I want to mention several notable Minnesotans who are trying to draw attention to global warming and its impact on our planet  They are adventurer explorers who have gone   literally   to the ends of the earth  Not just to pursue adventure  but also to pursue greater knowledge and an understanding of our place in the world   for the benefit of all of us  Will Steger is one of these Minnesotans  and he is a good friend of mine  He has led the first dogsled expedition to the North Pole and the first dogsled crossing of Antarctica  Next month  he embarks on a new expedition   a four month  1 200 mile trip by dogsled through the Canadian Arctic  And later this year  he plans to kayak around masses of melting sea ice in Antarctica  I figure if he can do this  we can get a bipartisan bill  At age 62  why is Will Steger doing these things  It s to promote greater public awareness of global warming and the urgent need for action  He says his many journeys over the past four decades have shown him firsthand the effects of global warming  During the past year  he has been in practically every church basement and every community center meeting room in Minnesota to talk about this subject  A friend says that Will s new determination is rooted in sorrow   He s watching the places he loves melt away    literally  But Will s message is ultimately one of hope  He knows it is within our power to do something about it   Some people still don t believe this is happening   he says   But the even bigger danger is that some think we can t do anything about it   Another notable Minnesota adventurer explorer who feels the same way is Ann Bancroft  She was a member of Will Steger s North Pole expedition in 1986  She was also the first woman to cross both polar ice caps to reach the poles  and she was the first woman to ski across Greenland  In 2001  Ann and Norwegian adventurer Liv Arnesen  captivated millions of people worldwide as they fulfilled their childhood dream and became the first women to ski across Antarctica  And next month  she  too  is embarking on a new adventure  Ann and Liv are now preparing for an arduous 530 mile journey by foot across the frozen Arctic Ocean to the North Pole  Schoolchildren around the world will be able to follow them online  with a Web site charting their daily progress with videos  photos and audio postings  Ann Bancroft s mission  like Will Steger s  is to inspire action on global warming  She acknowledges that climate change is a major challenge that can t be solved easily or overnight  but her goal is to prove that small steps add up  Finally  there is one more Minnesota adventurer and outdoorsman I want to mention  He s not quite in the same league as Will Steger and Ann Bancroft  But he s in a class by himself  His name is Jim Klobuchar   and he s my dad  For 30 years he was sportswriter and columnist for the Minneapolis Star Tribune  He s also an avid mountain climber and hiker  Now in his 70s  he continues to operate an adventure travel club that  among other things  takes people to what he calls  the high places of the world    including the Himalayas  the Alps and Mount Kilimanjaro  My dad has been to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro five times  And he has told me that  each time he goes  he sees clear and dramatic signs of global warming there  The snow crown is visibly shrinking  Where he once trekked through snow  it is now dry land  And it keeps getting worse  Three decades ago  he went to the village of Gletsch in the Swiss Alps  He stayed at a hotel right on the very edge of the famous Rhone Glacier  But this glacier has already retreated hundreds of feet since the time he saw it  And now tourists come to watch it melt in front of their eyes  The stakes are high as they get  The American people are hoping this new Congress will  at last  confront the challenge of global warming  This is going to call for bipartisan  ambitious  comprehensive effort on the part of this Congress and also for an enlightened response from the business community who are already starting to see what the call to action that the other senators have mentioned  There is much work to be done and many stakeholders to consider  My colleagues here in the Senate that have begun this work have advanced a number of thoughtful proposals  There are several key elements that I hope to see in the final result      First  strong limits on economy wide emissions of greenhouse gases      Some version of a cap and trade system      Strong renewable fuel content standards for cars and trucks      Incentives for both the manufacture and purchase of hybrid and flex fuel vehicles      Strong renewable energy standards for electricity generation  so we can make greater use of wind  solar and other renewable energy sources      Aggressive federal support for research and development to build a new Manhattan Project for new energy sources      Finally  we need to stop to the giveaways and special favors for the big oil companies  One of the best things we can do both to respond to global warming and to achieve energy independence is to develop our homegrown renewable energy  We should be investing in the farmers and the workers of the Midwest instead of the oil cartels of the Mideast  Like most Americans and you Madam Chair  I m an optimist  I believe in the power and promise of science  technology and innovation when we need to solve a problem  I believe in the intelligence and ingenuity of the American people when we are confronted with a challenge  And I believe in the capacity of our democratic system of government to make the right decisions for the good of our country  I think of the tremendous courage and determination of explorers like Will Steger and Ann Bancroft  With a single minded focus  they overcame the most difficult hardships and obstacles imaginable to reach their destinations  That s the American spirit  I believe we  too  can reach our destination  We can turn the corner on the devastating effects of global warming  and we can take giant strides toward energy independence  As you know  former Vice President   and former Senator   Al Gore has been a strong voice on the need to address the urgent challenges of global warming  He has stressed the importance of far sighted  forward looking leadership to tackle this issue  He recalls the words of General Omar Bradley at the end of World War II  when America was confronted by the challenge of building a new post war world  The general said   It is time we steered by the stars  not by the lights of every passing ship   We  too  must now steer by the stars  And like explorers Will Steger and Ann Bancroft  we must do so with the determination to surmount the obstacles in our way to reach our goal  Thank you very much
