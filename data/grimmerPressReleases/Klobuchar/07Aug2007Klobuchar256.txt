Durbin  sent a letter to the Acting Chairman of the U S  Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC   citing yesterdays New York Times report on safety inspections that indicated more than twenty percent of toys manufactured in China posed a potential poisoning hazard  They requested the inspection reports  an explanation of how the failures occurred  and the CPSCs immediate action plan to ensure childrens products are lead free    This summer alone has seen more than 2 5 million toy recalls  toys removed from our homes and our stores because they have been coated with poisonous and lethal lead paint  said Klobuchar  We must get to the bottom of how this is happening and stop these unsafe toys from reaching our store shelves and our kids hands  To get there  the CSPC needs to be more forthcoming about information regarding their investigations    Klobuchar  who sits on the Senates Commerce Committee  led the charge for Congressional hearings on Chinese imports  which were held on July 18th  Klobuchar also hosted a toy safety forum in Minnetonka  Minnesota to examine the effects of tainted products from China    The CPSC gets a passing grade for the dedication of it s staff in protecting Americans  Durbin said  But when it comes to CPSC s ability to stop unsafe products from reaching the market  they fall short  All of this summer s recalled products have one thing in common  China  The CPSC needs more authority and more resources to protect consumers from dangerous products manufactured both overseas and at home    Last month  Durbin introduced the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act  will dramatically expand CPSCs ability to protect American consumers  This bill increases the authorized funding level for the agency over the next five years  repeals the requirement that the CPSC have a quorum to engage in regulatory actions  decreases the amount of time that firms have to respond to the information CPSC releases  institutes a civil penalty for retailers that knowingly sell a recalled product  and increases maximum fine for violations    Full text of the letter is below    August 7  2007   The Honorable Nancy Nord  Acting Chairman  U S  Consumer Product Safety Commission  4330 East West Highway  Bethesda  Maryland 20814    Dear Chairman Nord    We are writing in response to yesterdays story in the New York Times on the widespread presence of lead in childrens products and the Consumer Product Safety Commissions  CPSC  efforts to test for lead and pursue regulatory solutions to solve this problem  According to the article  in recent testing of childrens jewelry products  CPSC officials found levels of lead exceeding federal standards in one out of every five samples collected  We are concerned by these findings and we hope you can answer several questions below that will allow us to better understand the scope of this threat to child safety     The case cited in the article of the death of a four year old boy from Minnesota who ingested a toy contaminated with lead demonstrates the risks of childrens products that do not meet federal lead standards  The child died  not from choking on the toy  but because the charm was composed almost entirely of lead  enough to fatally poison him  In fact  the charm contained so much lead that tests later revealed that his blood lead level was three times higher than what health officials consider dangerous     For this reason  in multiple places  federal regulation and statute bans the use of lead paint in childrens toys  For example  Title 16  Chapter II  Part 1303 of the Code of Federal Regulations  16 CFR 1303  bans toys and other articles intended for use by children that bear lead containing paint  In addition  the Hazardous Substances and Articles Administration and Enforcement Regulations  15 CFR 1500  bans the use of surface paints containing more than  05 percent lead in toys or other articles intended for use by children  These regulations are referenced in the American Society for Testing and Materials  ASTM  F963 Standard  Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety     Given this risk profile  we were alarmed to learn from the New York Times article that 20 percent of the toys inspected by the CPSC in recent tests posed a potential poisoning hazard  Parents have every right to expect that the toys they purchase are safe  If the current federal lead standards and compliance and enforcement mechanisms are not sufficient to curb this public health issue  we believe the CPSC should implement tougher standards and penalties through a federal rulemaking or inform Congress of the need for legislation in this area     We were further alarmed to learn that these unsafe toys were produced by Chinese manufacturers  This summer alone  more than 2 5 million toys manufactured in China have been recalled due to lead contamination  It is becoming clear that the Chinese regulatory system is not taking the dangerous risks lead poses to children seriously  In fact  the Deputy Director General of Chinas General Administration for Quality Supervision  Inspection and Quarantine  AQSIQ  has publicly disputed the scientifically proven fact that lead in childrens products poses a danger  Given the Chinese governments weak regulatory environment and the fact that over eighty percent of toys sold in the U S  are manufactured in China  it is incumbent upon the CPSC to exercise greater regulatory authority to ensure that these toys do not make it to store shelves  It is also vital that the CPSC continue to make it a priority to work with its Chinese counterpart to reiterate the importance of product safety     In addition  we ask that you provide us with following information    1  Copies of the inspections report s  and results and all related documents referenced in the New York Times article     2  A detailed explanation of the industry and regulatory failures that have allowed such a large volume of childrens products contaminated with lead to enter into the stream of commerce  and   3  CPSCs action plan to ensure that childrens products are lead free  including specific steps the Commission is taking to prevent the production of these hazardous products  increase awareness of the federal standard  require third party testing and verification of product safety  and impose penalties and other enforcement actions on violators      We ask that you respond to this inquiry within two weeks  Please contact Tamara Fucile of Senator Klobuchars staff  or David Lazarus of Senator Durbins staff if you have any questions    Sincerely   Amy Klobuchar  Richard J  Durbin
