Information  Call in number  1  800  511 0763 Code  8778 The full text of Senator Klobuchar s speech is below  Madam President  I come to the floor today to express my deep disappointment   and the disappointment of so many people of my state   with the President s expected decision to veto the supplemental funding bill delivered to him by a bipartisan majority in Congress  This bill provided our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with all of the equipment and resources that they need to continue the duties that they have been so bravely performing for more than four years  The amount appropriated by Congress rose well above the amount the President requested to give our soldiers on the battlefield  And let it be clear  Congress has given our soldiers in the battlefield all the funding they need  It is the President who will be now blocking it  A few weeks ago I was driving in Minnesota  it was a beautiful spring day outside of Ortonville  Minnesota  And for what has happened too many times in my short time as United States Senator I called one of the mothers of the Minnesota soldiers who have died in this war  Of the 22 000 troops that the President has included in this surge  3 000 of them are Minnesota Guard and Reserves who are expected to come home in January and February and now have been extended  Now the mom s I am calling are the mom s of these soldiers who would ve been home in January or February  And when I asked this mother  how are you doing  she said  you know people keep asking me that and I don t really know what to say   she said  do you have any ideas about what I should say   And I told her  well I can tell you what all the other mothers have been saying   They ve been saying that they wake up every morning and they try so hard to hang together for their family and then something happens   they see a picture or they remember something   and they are never the same for the rest of the day  And they have their good moments but their lives will never be the same  I told her that her son stood tall and that now is the time for the people in Washington to stand tall  After four years of extensive American military involvement in Iraq  the president refuses to accept the prudent change of course recommended by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and supported by a clear majority of the American people  By passing this bill  we in Congress fulfilled our Constitutional duties to first  continue funding for America s armed forces in harms way  and second  to ensure that our government pursues policies in the best interests of our soldiers and our nation  As we work with the President in the days and weeks and months to come  we must continue to advocate for the necessary changes in our strategy in Iraq  It is with this spirit that we in Congress continue to reach out to the President for a responsible change of course in Iraq  Iraq Visit  Last month  I visited Baghdad and Fallujah and I saw   firsthand   the bravery and the commitment of our troops  The very best thing that we can do for these young men and women is not only give them the equipment they deserve but to get this policy right  This means sending a clear message to the Iraqi government that we are not staying there indefinitely  This means  as recommended by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group  that we begin the process of redeploying our troops with the goal of withdrawing combat forces by next year   while acknowledging that some troops may remain to train the Iraqi police for special forces  to provide security for those who remain  and to conduct special operations  This means not a surge in troops but a surge in diplomacy  economy and Iraqi responsibility  When I was over in Baghdad and Fallujah I saw many things  I saw the bravery of our troops and I was struck a few weeks later when another delegation of people from Congress went over there  And one Congressman who returned and he had been visiting a market over there and he said that it reminded him of a farmers market in Indiana  Those are my enduring memories of my trip to Iraq  My most enduring memory is standing on the tarmac in the Baghdad airport with nine Duluth Firefighters with the Duluth National Guard called me over to stand with them while they saluted as six caskets draped in the American flag were loaded onto a plane  And as every casket was loaded on  they saluted  They were standing tall for their fallen soldiers that day  And now it is our time in Congress to stand tall  Our troops have done what they ve been asked  They deposed an evil dictator  They gave the Iraqi people the opportunity to vote and establish a new government  It is now the Iraqi government s responsibility to govern  But stability and progress in Iraq depend on the political reforms that Iraqi leaders have promised many times and failed to deliver  After four years  despite many promises  Iraq has yet to approve a provincial election law  After four years  despite many promises  Iraq has yet to approve a law to share oil revenues  After four years  despite many promises  Iraq has yet to approve a de Baathification law to promote reconciliation  After four years  despite many promises  Iraq has yet to approve a law reining in the militia  Our men and women in uniform cannot deliver these kinds of reforms to Iraq  This is up to the Iraqis themselves  As the bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommended  Iraqi leaders must pay a price if they continue to fail to make good on key reforms that they have promised the Iraqi people  After four years  what have we gotten  Benchmarks without progress  promises without results  claims of accountability without any consequences  And why should we expect the Iraqi leaders to do any better when they know that the president continues to accept their excuses for inaction and fails to impose any penalties for their lack of progress  That is why the bipartisan Iraq Study Group made clear that  and I quote   if the Iraqi government does not make substantial progress toward the achievement of milestones on national reconciliation  security and governance  the United States should reduce its political  military or economic support for the Iraqi government   That report was issued five months ago  Meanwhile  the President has simply stayed the course that he has continued to pursue for the past four years   and  not surprisingly  little progress has been achieved in Iraq  The Iraqi government will understand and finally take responsibility only when it is crystal clear to them that our combat presence is not indefinite and that American combat troops are going to leave  That is the responsible change of course that we in Congress are seeking  And the American people are looking to their leaders in Washington   at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue   to work together to get this policy right  Two weeks ago  I went to the White House and met with the President   along with three other senators  including two Republicans  I appreciated the time he took to honestly discuss our points of agreement and disagreement on the war  I told him that now is the time to forge cooperation with our Democrats in Congress  But the President has chosen instead to veto this bill  As we move forward on funding this war  we in Congress will do nothing to threaten the safety of American soldiers in the field  But we must continue to fulfill our Constitutional duty to exercise oversight of American policies in Iraq  Oversight A critical part of this oversight must be demanding accountability for the way in which funds are spent on the reconstruction projects in Iraq  For the past four years  the administration has demanded   and received   a blank check to spend in Iraq  Now we are seeing the consequences of this lack of planning  management  and responsibility  On Monday  the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction released a report that details widespread failures in the most basic reconstruction projects  The report finds that in many cases  Iraq s infrastructure and utility systems are worse off than they were before the war  On closer inspection  it turns out that even projects that were declared  success stories  were considerably less than that  In fact  seven out of eight of these projects which were called  success stories  were not operating properly due to plumbing and electrical failures  improper maintenance  possible looting and the fact that expensive equipment was available but never used  Prior to the 2003 invasion  Iraq s power system produced 4 500 megawatts a day  Today  the same system produces only 3 832 megawatts a day  In Baghdad  the city enjoys an average of 6 5 hours of electricity a day  A year ago  Baghdad averaged eight hours of electricity a day  And before the war  the city received an average of 16 to 24 hours a day  Congress has provided  4 2 billion for reconstruction of Iraq s power system  and the result has been a more than 50 percent decrease in the length of time the citizens of Baghdad have access to electricity on any given day  Congress has provided nearly two billion dollars to provide clean drinking waters and repaired sewer systems  But  according to the World Health Organization  70 percent of Iraqis lack access to clean drinking water  The Defense Department has estimated that the unemployment rate in Iraq is anywhere from 13 6 percent to 60 percent  In a recent survey  only 16 percent of Iraqis said their current incomes met their needs  So  after four years  we are facing a security situation that continues to deteriorate  an economic situation that continues to stagnate and a reconstruction effort that cannot provide even the most basic services  My colleagues and I have been asking the difficult questions and demanding answers from this administration  The supplemental bill demonstrates that Congress is reclaiming its rightful role setting Iraq policy  and  more broadly  in our system of government  The President s veto only strengthens our resolve  Emergency Spending Bill  Madam President  I also want to speak briefly in support of a few other provisions in this bill that I believe respond to critical challenges our nation faces  and that the administration has deemed unnecessary  The White House and many of my friends on the other side of the aisle have argued that this bill should not contain funding for anything other than the current wars  And if we were sacrificing funding for our troops in order to meet domestic priorities  I would agree  But having given our troops all they need  continuing to ignore crises at home would be irresponsible  Veterans Funding  Veterans funding is one of the key parts of this bill  This bill amounted to an increase in veterans funding that was long overdue  Over the last two years when I got around my state veterans would come up to me  particularly veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars  and they would tell me about how they had difficulty getting treatment   they clearly had mental health issues  I didn t know if there was any truth to this  I wasn t sure because of the state of their minds whether this was true  Then I got here and I started looking at the numbers  In 2005  the Department of Defense estimated that about 24 000 soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan would need health care  The actual number is four times that amount  Last year they were 87 000 soldiers short in their estimate of how many soldiers would need help coming back from this war  Now I know why those pe3ople were wandering around asking for help  it s because they weren t getting the help that they deserve  Agriculture Disaster Relief  Another critical problem that has been ignored by this Administration  and one that is particularly important to the people of my state  has been the tremendous damage recent natural disasters have been inflicting on farmers and ranchers in this country  The supplemental spending bill was a culmination of a two year effort to secure disaster assistance for America s farmers  Minnesota farmers have been hit with heavy losses for two consecutive years   storms and flooding in 2005  and again by drought in 2006  All told  they lost more than  700 million in crop and livestock losses  The supplemental funding bill would have provided  3 5 billion to compensate farmers for a portion of their crop and livestock losses over the past two years  Our farmers have waited too long for this disaster relief and I am deeply disappointed that the President has turned his back on the urgent need for their assistance  Conclusion  Madam President  the bill we sent to the President of the United States provided the resources and support our soldiers need  on the battlefield and after they return home  A few months ago I attended a funeral of one of the brave men that was killed in the line of duty  And the priest stood up and he said to the thousand people that were in the cathedral  He said   you know this was a good kid  And he was six feet two tall but he was still our child  And when we send our kids to war and they re six feet tall  they re still our kids and they re standing tall and we need to stand tall   The traumatic brain injury victims that I ve seen at the veterans hospital in Minnesota  even in their wheel chair  they re standing tall  Those moms that I talked to on the phone as they struggle every day just to get out of bed to deal with their loss of their kids that were killed in this war  they re standing tall Well now it is time for the President of the United States to stand tall  Thank you Madam President
