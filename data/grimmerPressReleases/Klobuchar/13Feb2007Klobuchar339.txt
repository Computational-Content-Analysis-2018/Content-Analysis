global warming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      February 13  2007  Washington  D C   U S    D MN  today exercised her unique role as a key player in the global warming discussion by outlining the initiatives she seeks to be included in the upcoming farm bill  In preparing to introduce a climate change incentive program that she will work to include in the Farm Bill  Senator Klobuchar today sent a letter to the head of the Agriculture Committee  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   outlining her proposals and pushing for action  Klobuchar s initiatives would mark the first time the Agriculture Committee  which is scheduled to consider the 2007 farm bill by September 30  2007  would consider climate changes provisions as part of the farm bill  Klobuchar said  Global warming and oil dependency are among the greatest challenges we face for our future  These two problems are interrelated  and our solutions need to be interrelated  too  With forward looking farming practices  America s heartland holds great promise for homegrown solutions to global warming  Senator Tom Harkin  Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee said  Senator Klobuchar is proposing practical  common sense policies for curbing global warming  These pragmatic ideas will help farmers adopt stronger conservation practices  promote more production and use of renewable biofuels and enhance our nation s energy security  while increasing farm income  economic growth and jobs in rural communities  To help farmers lower their energy costs and reduce the consumption of fossil fuels  Klobuchar proposed to provide assistance for farmers seeking to make improvements to the energy efficiency of farm equipment and buildings  and seeking to increase their use of renewable resources to meet on farm energy needs  Klobuchar also emphasized that the Farm Bill should include incentives for farmers to grow perennial grasses and other biomass crops suitable for cellulosic ethanol production  Cellulosic ethanol refers to ethanol made from cellulosic plant material including grasses  wood chips  corn stalks and agricultural residue  Senator Klobuchar holds a distinct position in advocating for climate control initiatives as a member of three committees currently addressing the issue of global warming  the Environment and Public Works Committee  EPW   the Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee  and the Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee  The text of Klobuchar s letter is below  February 13  2007 The Honorable Tom Harkin Chairman Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry United States Senate Washington  DC 20510 Dear Mr  Chairman  Global warming and oil dependency are among the greatest challenges we face for our future  These two problems are interrelated  and our solutions need to be interrelated  too  With forward looking farming practices  America s heartland holds great promise for homegrown solutions to global warming  As a member of both the Committee on Environment and Public Works and the Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  I respectfully request that agriculture s role in fighting climate change be made a major new focus of the next farm bill  In the coming months I plan to introduce a package of incentives that would allow farmers to improve the carbon sequestration of their farm operations  reduce fossil energy consumption and produce a new generation of carbon neutral biofuels  To allow farmers to reduce consumption of fossil energy  my proposal will include assistance for farmers seeking to make improvements to the energy efficiency of farm equipment and buildings  and to increase their use of renewable resources to meet on farm energy needs  These practices are encouraged to some extent under existing USDA programs  but too often these programs have been curtailed due to lack of funding  My proposal will also include incentives for farmers to grow perennial grasses and other biomass crops suitable for cellulosic ethanol production  These crops would also assure the nation a sufficient supply of cellulosic feedstocks for the coming generation of biofuels facilities  And  because these crops are less fossil energy intensive to produce  the biofuels made from them can dramatically reduce carbon impact compared to gasoline  since the carbon released in the burning of the fuel is taken out of the air when the crop grows  Finally  my climate change initiative would provide funding for the carbon sequestration research and extension projects created in the 2002 Farm Bill but never implemented  These projects were intended to allow USDA to work with universities to examine how agricultural and forestry practices affect the sequestration of carbon in soils and plants  and to implement on farm demonstration projects  The information provided by this research will be vital in our ongoing efforts to encourage farmers to expand practices that store carbon in the soil  In conclusion  I urge the Committee to use the opportunity offered by the farm bill reauthorization to examine the positive impact that agriculture can have on climate change  I look forward to working with you to craft meaningful legislation to this end in the coming months  Sincerely  Amy Klobuchar United States Senator
