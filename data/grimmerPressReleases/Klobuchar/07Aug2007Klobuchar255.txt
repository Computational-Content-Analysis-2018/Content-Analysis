letter to Transportation Secretary Mary Peters and the Federal Transit Administration  FTA  Administrator James Simpson  urging them to continue their efforts to help Minnesota recover from the collapse of the I 35W bridge in Minneapolis  The letter requests the Department to immediately recommend the Northstar Commuter Rail Corridor for a Full Funding Grant Agreement  FFGA  to help begin immediate construction of the project  The letter also seeks to establish an interim Twin Cities Recovery Office in Minneapolis  modeled after the Lower Manhattan Recovery Office in New York  which would enable enhanced short term cooperation and technical advising between the FTA and the Metropolitan Council  Third  the letter urges the Department to approve the Minnesotas Urban Partnership Agreement grant application submitted by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Council to help with congestion mitigation    The Senators letter seeks expeditious and favorable consideration of the three proposals in order to ensure the vitality of commercial interests downtown  increase the mobility of commuters  mitigate traffic congestion  and fund alterative transit projects to relieve the strain on Minnesotas infrastructure brought on by last weeks disaster    Full text of the letter is below    August 6  2007   Mary E  Peters  Secretary   United States Department of Transportation  400 7th Street Southwest  Washington  D C  20590   Mr  James S  Simpson  Administrator  Federal Transit Administration  1200 New Jersey Ave  SE  Washington  DC 20590   Dear Secretary Peters and Administrator Simpson    We write today to offer our sincere appreciation for all of your efforts in responding to the unprecedented catastrophe that struck Minnesota on Wednesday  History will measure us by our actions in this time of urgent need  and you have proved that effective leadership can overcome many of the challenges that arise in the aftermath of such great tragedy     After reviewing the impact site and meeting with local officials on the ground this weekend  we would like to ask three specific requests of the Department of Transportation that we believe will drastically improve transportation conditions for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area in the near term     First  we ask the Federal Transit Administration  FTA  and the Department of Transportation to immediately establish an interim Twin Cities Recovery Office in Minneapolis in the model of FTAs highly successful Lower Manhattan Recovery Office in New York City  By including technical experts from FTA and DOT regional and federal offices  a Twin Cities Recovery Office will provide technical assistance and guidance on needed transportation projects to ensure the mobility of commuters and vitality of commercial interests in downtown Minneapolis    Second  we urge you to provide expedited consideration of the Minnesotas Urban Partnership Agreement application submitted by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Council  The innovative approach to congestion mitigation outlined in this application would provide Bus Rapid Transit on the I 35W corridor  enhancing the transit network of the region and easing the burden primary transportation arteries as bridge construction moves forward     And finally  we ask the Federal Transit Administration  FTA  and the Department of Transportation to immediately recommend the Northstar Commuter Rail Corridor for a Full Funding Grant Agreement  FFGA   Northstars application for an FFGA was submitted earlier this summer and is currently under review  The collapse of the I 35W bridge has placed an enormous strain on the transportation infrastructure of the Twin Cities  Northstar represents one of the most readily available alternatives to ease the congestion and delays caused by the bridges collapse     The timing of Northstars approval has never been more critical  We plan to work with our colleagues to limit or waive the mandatory 60 day Congressional review period which will begin upon FTAs favorable recommendation of Northstars application  Each day that passes without approval of Northstars FFGA slows construction of the project and its positive impact on the metropolitan areas transportation network  Immediately approving Northstars Full Funding Grant Agreement will allow state funding to flow to the projects construction immediately while reimbursing local entities as they pursue additional transportation solutions in the wake of the bridge collapse    The recovery and rebuilding efforts have only just begun for the Twin Cities  We have no doubt that in the coming days and weeks we will find additional areas where state and local officials will require our assistance at the federal level  including the Northstar project  and we look forward to partnering with you as we move forward with necessary actions     Thank you in advance for consideration of these requests     Sincerely     Amy Klobuchar Norm Coleman
