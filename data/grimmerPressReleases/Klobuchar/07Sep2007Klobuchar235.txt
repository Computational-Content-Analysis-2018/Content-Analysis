                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Empowers consumers to get the best wireless service for their needs and budget September 7  2007 Washington  D C   Senators Amy Klobuchar  D MN  and Jay Rockefeller  D WV  today unveiled legislation aimed at empowering the 200 million cell phone customers nationwide to make informed choices about a wireless service that best fits their needs and their budget  The Cell Phone Consumer Empowerment Act of 2007 will require wireless service providers to share simple  clear information on their services and charges with customers before they enter into long term contracts  a thirty day window in which to exit a contract without early termination fees  and greater flexibility to exit contracts with services that dont meet their needs  The rules governing our wireless industry are a relic of the 1980s  when cell phones were a luxury item that fit in a briefcase instead of a pocket  said Klobuchar  Early termination fees are a family budget buster  families should be able to terminate service without outrageous fees  know if their cell phone will work on their drives and in their home and office  and understand what to expect in their monthly bills once you pile on charges and fees  Its a simple matter of fairness  Anyone whos looked at a cell phone bill knows its a hodge podge of fees and surcharges that supposedly cover regulatory or administrative costs  said Rockefeller  The reality is  often these are nothing more than operating costs that the companies are passing on to the consumer disguised as fees and taxes  Its high time to protect cell phone users from these deceptive billing practices  Among the bills provisions are  detailed data on coverage areas and dropped calls provided to consumers before committing to a long term contract  pro rated early termination fees for those who exit their contract after thirty days  the ability to exit a contract within thirty days without a termination fee when wireless service is found to be unsatisfactory  and transparency in contracts and billing  including explanations of taxes and fees  The legislation also calls upon the FCC to study the practice of locking phones  making them exclusive to one service provider and requiring consumers to purchase a new phone when changing carriers  The Cell Phone Consumer Empowerment Act will be introduced in the Senate on Friday  Earlier this week  Senators Klobuchar and Rockefeller sent a letter to Chairman Inouye requesting a hearing before the Commerce Committee    THE CELL PHONE CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT ACT OF 2007 Summary EARLY TERMINATION FEES  ETF     The FCC shall set forth regulations to pro rate ETFs  At a minimum  the ETF for a 2 year
