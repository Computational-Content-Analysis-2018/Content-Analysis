reform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    October 25  2007 Washington  D C   U S   voted in support of the 2007 Farm bill that passed the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee today  The bill includes a stronger safety net for Minnesota farmers  permanent disaster relief  and a groundbreaking energy title  thanks to several initiatives that Klobuchar pushed for  This bill builds on the success of the 2002 farm bill and strengthens the safety net for Minnesota farmers  said Klobuchar  We have a strong  bipartisan bill and I will continue to push for more reform as we move to the Senate floor  Since taking office  Klobuchar has taken the lead on several initiatives to invest in the next generation of renewable fuels and worked successfully with the committee to include her first of its kind initiative to encourage American farmers to produce cellulosic crops  Klobuchar also secured a provision to help increase consumer access to renewable fuels that was modeled after a bill she introduced this past spring  At the hearing  Agriculture Committee Chairman Harkin  D IA  recognized Sen  Klobuchars work in the energy area stating  The farm bills energy title provides important investments in farm based energy  programs to help farmers to transition into biomass crops and support the construction of biorefineries from cellulose ethanol  said Sen  Harkin  Senator Klobuchar from the beginning advocated strong new incentives for farmers to produce energy crops and support for rural energy facilities and biorefineries  It was obvious she was listening to Minnesotans and carrying their message to our Senate Agriculture Committee  The cellulosic provision in the farm bill was modeled after Sen  Klobuchars Farm to Fuel Investment Act  which aims to reduce American dependence on foreign oil by providing transition assistance for farmers to grow dedicated energy crops  crops like switchgrass grown solely for the purpose of producing energy   Looking into the future  farmers are going to be a key part of our nation s ability to achieve energy independence  Klobuchar said  Producing these cellulosic energy crops could completely alter the way we look at energy  just like ethanol and biodiesel already have  The farm bill also includes Klobuchars Ethanol Education and Expansion Act of 2007 that would work to reduce prices at the pump for consumers by providing grants through the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to farmer owned ethanol producers to install additional E 85 pumps at rural gas stations as well as the equipment needed to sell E 85 directly to gas stations  This language will help ensure that more drivers across the country have access to home grown ethanol  and the lower prices that come with it  My goal is to ensure hard working Americans arent spending all of their money at the pump while oil companies rake in profits  said Klobuchar  By dramatically increasing the availability of E 85  Americans would be able to choose domestically produced fuel  while helping farmers invest in homegrown renewable energy  and reducing our dependence on foreign oil  The Agriculture Committee also accepted Klobuchars amendment to increase funding for The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program which would create opportunities for Farmers and Ranchers in developing markets like organic farming and energy production   The amendment will provide mentoring and outreach for new farmers  and training in business planning and credit building  the skills they need to succeed and stay on the land  The legislation would also increase funding for the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Individual Development Account  IDA  Pilot Program  This initiative will support matched savings accounts to help new farmers invest in land  buildings and equipment  and start building equity in farming operations  The bipartisan bill includes many reforms to provisions Klobuchar sees as vital to improving Americas farm policy and investing in farmers  In addition to a strong energy title  the bill includes long overdue permanent disaster assistance for farmers and strong conservation provisions  Permanent Disaster Assistance is particularly important to Minnesota and neighboring states that have seen droughts and flooding and everything in between for years  The provision would help family farmers keep operating after suffering natural disasters such as the drought affecting Minnesota the last two years  The Farm bill also strengthens programs for dairy and sugarbeet producers  restoring the safety net for dairy farmers and protecting sugarbeet producers from a possible surge of imports in the coming years  The permanent disaster program will mean a great deal to all ranchers and farmers in the Midwest facing financial hardships  said Klobuchar  For years weve seen hard working farmers and ranchers fighting severe cycles of drought and flooding  This aid will help struggling family farmers trying to stay in business  The Farm bill increases funding for conservation programs by more than   4 billion to improve the effectiveness of programs that will significantly help Minnesotas environment and ensure that Minnesota farmers will continue to have rich and productive farmland  Im very proud that we have provided the necessary resources to increase the effectiveness of our conservation programs to protect our water quality and provide habitat for wildlife  said Klobuchar  Minnesota has more land enrolled in the Wetlands Reserve Program than any other state  and this funding will preserve the habitat for migratory waterfowl  Senator Klobuchar has been a strong advocate of reforming the 2007 Farm bill and a leading proponent of payment limit reform  Klobuchar has stated that she will continue to push for stronger payment limit reform as the bill moves to the Senate floor for debate in the coming weeks  We need to put reasonable limits on payments to the largest farms  in order to ensure that resources are targeted to hardworking family farmers  said Klobuchar  We must to ensure that were helping active family farmers  not urban millionaires  I believe we can do more  and I will continue to push for more reform on the Senate floor
