                                                                           FIGHT TO END HATE CRIMES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Tuesday  September 18  2007      Mr  President  only 2 weeks ago this Nation marked the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1957  That landmark legislation  signed into law on September 9  1957  was Congress  first civil rights bill since the end of Reconstruction    It established the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and empowered Federal prosecutors to obtain court injunctions against interference with the right to vote  It also established a Federal Commission on Civil Rights with authority to investigate discriminatory conditions and recommend corrective measures    In the Judiciary Committee  under the leadership of my distinguished colleague  the senior Senator from Vermont  we held a hearing to commemorate this milestone  to talk about our Nation s progress over the past half century and how we must move forward if we are to live up to the ideals enumerated in the Constitution  My former colleague from the House and an American hero  John Lewis  shared his recollections and his hopes for the future with us    Today  however  it is with great sadness that I come to the Senate floor to talk about a rash of incidents that have occurred over the past month in this region of the country  These incidents are a painful reminder of just how far we have to go    At the College Park Campus of the University of Maryland  fewer than 10 miles from here  students found a noose hanging in a tree near the University s African American Cultural Center  It is believed that the noose had been hanging there for almost 2 weeks before the assistant editor of the school s African American newspaper noticed it and notified the police    University President C D  Mote has denounced the incident  as have student leaders and faculty  It is under investigation as a possible hate crime and may be connected to the trial of six African American teenagers in Jena  Louisiana  In that case  three nooses were placed in the so called white only tree on campus after black students sat under it  The ensuing altercations led to charges of attempted murder against only the black teenagers  charges that have since been dismissed    In Montgomery County  Maryland  three separate acts of vandalism were reported at Jewish centers in Rockville  Gaithersburg  and Silver Spring   In two of those cases  vandals defaced banners declaring the synagogues  support for the State of Israel  scrawling anti Semitic slurs on them  Police are investigating all three acts as possible hate crimes    Then  in the hills of Big Creek  West Virginia  a 20 year old African American woman was held captive in a shed for more than a week  During her ordeal  she was beaten  choked  stabbed  sexually assaulted  and forced to perform inhumane acts  Throughout  she was called racist slurs and was told she was being victimized because of her skin color  She was rescued by police responding to an anonymous tip  A local Sheriff described this as something that would have come out of a horror movie  Six people  all white  have been arrested in connection with the assault and kidnapping  and police are still searching for two more  The young woman is recovering in a hospital from her ordeal    In Gaithersburg  Maryland  a Muslim family was again the victim of vandalism  Over the years  the family had been victimized multiple times  beginning in 1994 when they moved to the area  Their house and automobiles were broken into  garbage and dead animals were strewn in their yard  and racist notes were taped to their door    This time  on September 11  tires on both of the family s vehicles were slashed  The mother has worked hard to counteract anti Muslim and anti Arab sentiment in America  speaking at schools and libraries about Islam and Arab American culture and teaching a cultural sensitivity class  Police are continuing to investigate this incident as a possible hate crime    In Manassas  Virginia  the Ku Klux Klan recently began distributing leaflets urging white Christian America to stand up for its rights  The neighborhood has recently begun a demographic shift as older residents moved out and younger Latino families moved in    Finally  Mr  President  last Friday  it was reported that the Metropolitan Police Department here in Washington is investigating a series of hate crimes targeting gay and transgender people  The latest attack happened seven blocks from here near the Verizon Center  where reportedly a group of young men threw a 16 year old male to female transgender person through a plate glass window  Police reports indicate that the suspect had been arrested twice before for similar attacks against gay men    The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported that in 2005 there were approximately 7 100 incidents classified as hate crimes  The FBI uses voluntary reports from local law enforcement agencies across the country to determine the totals  but the actual number could be far higher    The Southern Poverty Law Center has analyzed data compiled and reported by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics  That November 2005 report  based on data from the biannual National Crime Victimization Survey  NCVS   found that fewer than half of hate crimes are reported to the police and others are not counted by the FBI  This is because they are not recorded as hate crimes  or because some police departments do not report statistics to their State offices  The NCVS estimates that the United States averages about 191 000 hate crimes each year    The report also found that hate crimes involve violence far more than other crimes  The data showed that four out of five hate crimes were violent  involving a sexual attack  robbery  assault or murder  as compared to 23 percent of non hate crimes   Mr  President  the situation is even direr than most Americans imagine  The Southern Poverty Law Center s Intelligence Project counted 844 active hate groups in the United States in 2006    Hate crimes  tentacles reach far beyond the intended targets  They bring a chill to entire neighborhoods and create a sense of fear  vulnerability  and insecurity in our communities  They poison the well of our democracy and strike at the very heart of the American spirit    Our local law enforcement agencies need help in investigating and prosecuting these crimes and this help must come from the United States Attorney General and the Department of Justice    I am a cosponsor of the Mathew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act  S  1105  to strengthen existing Federal hate crime laws  I want to thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this issue    While the responsibility for prosecuting hate crimes primarily rests with the individual States  this new measure will give local law enforcement additional tools to combat violent hate crimes  It also will provide Federal support through training and assistance to ensure that hate crimes are effectively investigated and prosecuted  In addition  it will ensure that Federal investigations and prosecutions are carried out when local authorities request assistance or are unwilling or unable to effectively prosecute cases    It is important that the Federal Government have the ability to take aggressive action against hate crimes in States where current laws are inadequate  For example  only 31 States and the District of Columbia include sexual orientation based or disability based crimes in their hate crimes statutes  This law will help ensure that all hate crimes are fully investigated and prosecuted    This measure  which has strong bipartisan support  would strengthen existing law in two ways  First  it would eliminate a serious limitation on Federal involvement under existing law  namely  the requirement that a victim of a hate crime was attacked because he or she was engaged in federally protected activity such as voting or attending school  It also would authorize the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on sexual orientation  gender  gender identity  or disability  Current law does not provide authority for involvement in these four categories    Hate crimes are un American  They cannot be tolerated  When individuals are targeted and attacked because of who they are  entire communities suffer and we are all diminished by it    S  1105 would give us the tools we need to be more effective in combating crimes of hate  The House passed its version of hate crimes legislation on May 3 and now the Senate must do our part  I call on my colleagues to support S  1105 and I urge its passage without further delay
