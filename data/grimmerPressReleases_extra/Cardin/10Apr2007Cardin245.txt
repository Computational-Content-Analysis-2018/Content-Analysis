 202 224 524  Susan Sullam  410 962 4436   WASHINGTON   Sen  Benjamin L  Cardin  D MD  today issued his strong support for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007  S  5   which will expanding embryonic stem cell research and help our nation s scientists develop treatments for medical conditions that affect more than 100 million Americans       I believe we have a moral responsibility to appropriately advance embryonic stem cell research to help millions of suffering Americans   said Sen  Cardin   Doctors and medical institutions right here in Maryland are bringing us closer than ever to finding real treatments for chronic diseases   We need to help these world renowned doctors expand this life saving research  not stand in their way      Speaking on the Senate Floor  Sen  Cardin also highlighted the importance of embryonic stem cell research to the state of Maryland  its people  and its economy   In addition to the thousands of Marylanders who suffer from diseases for which embryonic stem cell research may unlock cures and weaknesses  the state is also home to leading stem cell research institutions such as the National Institutes of Health  Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland     The following is Sen  Cardin s prepared floor statement    STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF S 5  THE STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007  SENATOR BENJAMIN L  CARDIN  APRIL 10  2007  Mr  President  rarely does this body have a chance to cast a single vote that can offer so much hope to millions   This week  we will have that opportunity with legislation introduced by Majority Leader Reid     I rise in strong support of his bill  S 5  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act   This bipartisan legislation will enhance existing stem cell research and help our nation s scientists develop treatments for conditions that affect more than 100 million Americans    But this vote is not just about the health and lives of Americans   For years  the United States has led the world in medical advancements  and people from around the globe travel here for medical education and to perform research that will be used to save lives around the world         This bill  S  5  will make available new lines of research  research that will help the United States retain its place as a world leader in this burgeoning new field  while helping to alleviate the pain and suffering of patients here and in other countries       Right now  American scientists receive limited federal funding for stem cell research    It has been nearly six years since President Bush issued his stem cell policy in August 2001        It permits federal funds to be used to support research only on the stem cell lines that existed as of the date of his executive order   August 9  2001            The Bush compromise seemed reasonable to many in the scientific community at the time  as researchers at NIH believed between 60 and 78 stem cell lines would be available for use  In fact  only 22 lines were available and some of these were found to have been contaminated from contact with mouse   feeder   cells  In addition  the 22 available lines were developed using science that has since seen significant improvements  Scientists at NIH say that these lines lack the genetic diversity necessary to perform  research for diseases that disproportionately affect minorities      In short  there are real deficiencies in the President s policy  His policy has reduced the opportunities available for our scientists  and they have undermined progress in the   field   America s policy has discouraged scientific exploration       I believe that it is wrong for the President of the United States to tie the hands of our scientists while millions of Americans suffer from diseases that stem cells have the potential to treat      Since the President s policy took effect  I have heard from hundreds of Marylanders who have debilitating illnesses  including leukemia  diabetes  Parkinson s disease  Alzheimer s  and spinal cord injuries  They are grateful for the federal research funding that Congress has provided in past years       But they know  as I do  that we are capable of accomplishing so much more   I join them in looking to the future with hope that more effective treatments and someday  cures  will be forthcoming      The most powerful case for stem cell research does not come from legislators or scientists  It comes  from the patients themselves  Last summer  I had the privilege of hiring as a summer intern a young man named Josh Basile  An accomplished tennis player in his teens  he was paralyzed in a swimming accident at the beach nearly three years ago  This situation would present great difficulty for any of us   As an athletic teenager  the challenge was particularly daunting   First  Josh had to adjust to his new life as a quadriplegic        Since that time  he has steadily regained movement throughout his body  including movement below the level of his injury  which was considered impossible  Now Josh has taken on yet another role  as a national advocate for spinal cord injury research and stem cell research  working with the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation Action Network and the Student Society for Stem Cell Research   His determination and courage are an example for us all     I have also heard from the academic medical centers across America  These are the places where the most complex medical procedures are performed  where medical school graduates from around the world are trained  where our most groundbreaking research is conducted        Two of the finest academic medical centers in the world are located in Baltimore at the University of Maryland Medical Center and at Johns Hopkins University   At Johns Hopkins  Dr  John Gearhart and Dr  Douglas Kerr are two of the foremost stem cell researchers in the nation   Their groundbreaking work has been recognized internationally and is bringing us closer than ever to finding treatments for life threatening diseases   They and thousands of other researchers support this bill and know that the federal government should be supporting  not hindering  this progress       Mr  President  I would like to quote another of my constituents who supports federally funded embryonic stem cell research       His name is Dr  Elias Zerhouni  and he is the Director of the National Institutes of Health and a resident of Baltimore  Last month  Dr  Zerhouni reiterated his support for lifting the current ban  stating that   from my standpoint  it is clear today that American science will be better served  and the nation will be better served if we let our scientists have access to more stem cell lines      Some of my colleagues have raised ethical concerns about stem cell research  and that the legislation before us effectively addresses these concerns  This bill does not encourage the creation of human embryos for research or for any other purposes  Rather  it stipulates that all embryos used for research must have been originally created for in vitro fertilization and are in excess of clinical need  it requires that the embryos would not have been implanted and would have otherwise been discarded  and it requires donors to provide written consent before embryos may be donated for research      These guidelines are ethically sound  they help ensure that enhanced research will not come at the expense of respect for human life      Because there is so much misinformation being spread about embryonic stem cell research  it s important to look at the facts   Embryonic stem cells are derived from 4 to 5 day old embryos   At this stage  they are known as blastocysts   Each blastocyst contains an outer layer of cells  and a cavity that contains about 30 pluripotent cells   This group of 30 cells is called the  inner cell mass   and it forms all the cells of the body     Scientists create embryonic stem cells by transferring this inner cell mass into a culture dish  where they divide and eventually yield millions of embryonic stem cells       If after six months  the cells keep dividing and are genetically normal  they are referred to as a stem cell line       The blastocysts that scientists are using come from eggs that were fertilized in IVF clinics  but never implanted   Instead they were frozen  and with the consent of the donors  they are donated for research purposes   Right now there are hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos in fertility clinics across this country      Scientists have derived more than 150 stem cell lines from these embryos already  but cannot receive federal funding for research on them because of President Bush s executive order   This week  with this vote  we have the power to change that     It is not certain that embryonic stem cell research will result in cures  but it is fairly certain that if we close off promising avenues  such as stem cell research  finding those therapies and cures will take much longer      The issue of embryonic stem cell research is a controversial and emotional one   It touches on questions of human suffering  medical ethics  and scientific potential  the role of government  moral considerations  and life itself   S 5 strikes the right balance      It encourages research  but it does not encourage the creation of embryos for research purposes   It allows us to support the efforts of the brilliant scientists in our research institutions who have dedicated their careers to alleviating the suffering of others  It allows us to honor the wishes of in vitro fertilization donors who want to make a contribution toward medical advancement       In June 2001  two months before President Bush issued his stem cell policy  Sue Stamos and her daughter  Faith  came to visit me in my House office   At the time  Faith was three years old  a very brave little girl who had been diagnosed with juvenile diabetes  Sue asked for my support for federal research to help find a cure for Faith  and I promised to do everything I could to help      Back in 2001  our knowledge of stem cell research s potential was nowhere near what it is now  and we did not yet know what the President would propose      Today  six years later  we have much broader and deeper knowledge about the scientific possibilities of stem cells  but much less capacity to research stem cell lines than we had anticipated   Last year  I voted to keep my promise to Sue and Faith Stamos and to the thousands of other Marylanders who are waiting for cures   Today  again  for Faith  Josh  and thousands of other Marylanders  I will vote to expand the stem cell lines available for federally funded research    I hope that my colleagues will join me in sending a message to Americans that this Congress will not stand in the way of medical progress     Both the House and Senate passed this bill in the 109th Congress  only to watch it face the first veto of George Bush s presidency   Now  in this Congress  in the first 100 days  our colleagues in the House of Representatives have done the right thing by passing this legislation   It is time for the Senate to follow suit  and send this bill to President Bush  this time for his signature       I urge my colleagues to pass S  5 overwhelmingly
