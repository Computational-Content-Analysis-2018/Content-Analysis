                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Friday  May 25  2007      Mr  President  today I rise to introduce the Voluntary Medicare Quality Reporting Act of 2007  I thank my good friend  the gentleman from Pennsylvania  Mr  Specter  for joining me in this effort  This is an important bill for tens of millions of Medicare beneficiaries  for the physicians  nurse practitioners and allied health professionals who treat them  and for the future of the Medicare program      At the end of this year  providers will again face the prospect of an across the  board cut in their Medicare reimbursements  The scheduled cut for 2008 is the largest ever 9 9 percent  These cuts are the result of a flawed reimbursement system created in 1997 that uses the Sustainable Growth Rate formula  or SGR  to determine an acceptable increase in the growth of provider expenditures      Medicare reimbursements increase when the previous year s payments do not exceed a target level that is based on the growth of our economy  However  when the previous year s payments exceed that target level  reimbursements are cut  According to MedPAC  the SGR formula would reduce Medicare provider reimbursements by 40  over the next eight years if Congress does not act  MedPAC is also concerned that over the next several years these reductions  would threaten beneficiary access to physician services over time  particularly those provided by primary care physicians   MedPAC recognizes the importance of provider participation in the Medicare program  particularly in our rural and underserved urban areas where the decision to not accept new Medicare patients can make all the difference in seniors  access to medical care      Congress recognizes this as well  and so we have intervened to prevent scheduled cuts resulting from SGR from taking effect  For all except the newest members of this body  this process of enacting a  physician fix  is a familiar scenario  For the past four years  Congress has acted to prevent these cuts to providers  usually through a last minute provision added to a must pass bill      In the I09lh Congress  J introduced bipartisan legislation implementing MedPAC s recommendations and calling for Congress to repeal the SGR formula and update provider reimbursements by the cost of care  Replacing SGR will require a thoughtful and protracted process involving the input of lawmakers and the provider community  and it is costly  but it is something that we must do      The most recent  fix  was made to the 2006 Tax Relief and Health Care Act    P L  109 432  That law froze payment rates  staving ofT an across the board cut of 5 1  percent  Congress also added a quality reporting system called the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative program  PQRJ   which made providers eligible for a bonus payment of 1 5 percent of their total allowed Medicare charges if they report to HHS on certain quality measures starting in July 2007      This new system is also known as  pay for reporting   and it is based on the concept that physicians should receive an increase in Medicare reimbursement only once they have participated in extensive quality reporting  Across my state  I have heard serious concerns that this will lead to a mandatory reporting system in the near future  and that we will soon see an untested  p ay for performance  system in place      Now  I think all my colleagues would agree that our seniors deserve the highest quality care  But in our quest for improved quality  we must answer two questions here  should proceed with an untested system of reporting requirements just for the sake of reporting  and will we actually achieve better care for our seniors via the PQRI      I am very concerned about implementing reporting requirements that have not been tested  J believe that we must have the right process in place for defining a quality reporting system for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries by health care professionals  We should not be establishing reporting requirements for health professionals just for the sake of reporting  and we should not be moving forward with this system until we have adequate time to evaluate each stage of its development      Current law does not provide sufficient time to assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of this new system  Nor do they take into account the fact that most physicians and other health professionals have no experience in quality reporting and do not have in place the necessary health infonnation technology and administrative infrastructures to participate in a reporting system      The bill I am introducing today will assure that health professionals will be at the center of the process for defining areas where quality measures are needed  as well as for defining the relevant measures themselves  Why is this important  Health professionals must be actively engaged in developing and implementing an effective reporting system because they are on the front lines of health care delivery  and they best understand the nexus between care delivery and quality measurement  The development process for quality measures must be transparent and consistent for all health professionals because they are the ones who will determine its successful implementation      Additionally  quality measures should be tested across a variety of specialties and practice settings before they are included in a reporting system because measures must be clinically valid to be relevant for defining quality  and because physicians and health professionals practice in a variety of settings  for example  small vs  large practices  urban vs  suburban vs  rural locations  office based vs  hospitalabase practices      Most importantly  we should not be using hastily devised quality measures to justify reimbursement cuts  There are some who advocate pay for performance as a way to slow the growth of physician spending  They think we can accomplish lower physician expenditures by setting arbitrary standards and then cutting payments to physicians who fail to meet them  But across America  there are practices that would face tremendous obstacles in meeting such standards  they lack of the information technology necessary to document and report standards in a timely manner  they see patients with economic and language barriers that will result in higher noncompliance rates  they treat a patient population for whom ethnic and racial differences require different clinical interventions than for other patients  Ignoring these considerations will not only fail to dramatically improve quality  it will significantly penalize providers who treat traditionally underserved populations      This bill provides an opportunity to thoughtfully and carefully develop effective quality measures that reflect differences in practice patterns  to share our findings  and to determine and encourage the most cost effective methods of providing the highest quality care      Rather than moving forward precipitously in 2008 with a permanent Medicare quality reporting system after a transitional 6 month period this year  as current law requires  our bill  the Voluntary Medicare Quality Reporting Act of 2007  instead would establish a more realistic timeline for quality measure reporting by health professionals  It does so by     requiring the Secretary first to evaluate the 6 month transitional reporting system and reporting findings to the Congress by June I  2008   requiring the Secretary to undertake demonstrations for defining appropriate mechanisms whereby health professionals may provide data on quality measures to the Secretary through an appropriate medical registry   allowing physicians and other eligible professionals to continue reporting to the Secretary quality measures developed for 2007  in order for the Secretary to refine systems for reporting quality measures   after completion of the evaluation  phasing in a permanent Voluntary Medicare Quality Reporting Program  with implementation beginning January 1  2010  based on a consistent set ofrules that define an orderly and transparent process of quality measure development   requiring that the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement of the American Medical Association be the beginning point for the designation of clinical areas where quality measures are needed   having the Consortium  in collaboration with physician specialty organizations and other eligible professional organizations  develop and propose quality measures to a consensus organization  such as the National Quality Forum  for endorsement  and  prohibiting the Secretary from using any measures that have not been recommended by the Consortium and endorsed by the consensus organization     I am confident that with all of these measures we will achieve a successful and effective quality reporting system that will truly make a difference in the quality of care that our Medicare beneficiaries receive  At the end of this year  as Congress moves forward to address the physician reimbursement issue  I urge my colleagues to support this rational approach to promoting quality and guaranteeing access to care
