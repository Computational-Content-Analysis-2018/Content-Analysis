                                                                               Thursday  April 19  2007      Oren Shur  202 224 4524  Susan Sullam  410 962 4436     WASHINGTON   Sen  Benjamin L  Cardin  D MD  today introduced the Colon Cancer Screen for Life Act in order to remove some of the barriers that too often stand in the way of patients receiving lifesaving screening for colon cancer   Joining Sen  Cardin as original co sponsors are Senators Joe Lieberman  I CT   Susan Collins  R ME   Ben Nelson  D NE   and Lindsey Graham  R SC          It is always tragic when a life is lost to cancer  but it is perhaps even more tragic when that loss could have been prevented   said Sen  Cardin    Modern technology has given us the tools to save lives  but we must ensure that people have access to these life saving services  This bill not only increases access to colon cancer screenings for millions of Americans  but will also save the Medicare system millions of dollars that would otherwise be spent on treating late stage colon cancer      This bipartisan bill would restore reimbursement for colorectal cancer  CRC  screening and diagnostic tests closer to the level established by Medicare in 1997 when the screening benefit was enacted   Payment rates for this procedure have decreased by more than 33 percent since Congress enacted this life saving benefit   It would also clarify that CRC screening procedures are exempt from the customary Medicare deductible requirement regardless of the outcome of the screening  and provide Medicare coverage for a preoperative visit or consultation prior to a screening colonoscopy        Colon cancer affects millions of Americans   said Sen  Lieberman   It is the second most common cause of cancer related death in America  The key to defeating this disease is by detecting it early  Therefore  we are introducing this bill to remove any barriers our seniors face in obtaining the early prevention and screening services they need       Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States for both men and women   said Sen  Collins   The sad irony is that cancer of the colon is probably the most treatable and survivable of all cancers  but only if it is caught early   I am therefore pleased to join my colleagues in introducing this legislation which will not only help to ensure the safety of colorectal cancer screenings  but it will also increase Medicare patient s access to this life saving procedure       One of the major problems with Medicare  and health care in general  is we focus too much on treatment and not enough on early detection and prevention   said Sen  Graham    Colon cancer is a perfect example of a disease where early detection could save lives and also save money on medical care  I want to thank Senators Cardin  Collins and Lieberman for their leadership on this issue   I hope this bill will set an example for future improvements in health care delivery      Colon cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women and the second most common cause of cancer related death in the United States   It is also perhaps the only cancer that can be prevented through regular screening   In 1997  then Rep  Cardin authored legislation to establish the colorectal screening benefit under Medicare   However  recent studies show that patients are not fully utilizing coverage of CRC preventive screenings   According to the Government Accountability Office  GAO   since the implementation of the benefit in 1998  the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries receiving either a screening or a diagnostic colonoscopy has increased by only one percent      As physicians  we are trained to do everything we can to save lives   Regular screening via colonoscopy can prevent colon cancer or help doctors to diagnose it at an early stage when it can be most effectively treated   Too many people are not taking advantage of this lifesaving measure   said David Johnson  M D   President of the American College of Gastroenterology     v   We applaud these Senators for their leadership in introducing the Colon Cancer Screen for Life Act   It is an important first step toward giving patients the tools they need to fight against this deadly disease   said Maryland physician William Stern  M D      The Colon Cancer Screen for Life Act has been endorsed by the Digestive Disease National Coalition  which has more than 20 member organizations  including the American College of Gastroenterology and the Crohn s and Colitis Foundation of America
