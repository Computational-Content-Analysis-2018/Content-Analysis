for domestic priorities for Maryland and the nation in the fiscal year 2008 omnibus package that has been passed by Congress  The bill now heads to the President for his signature   President Bush refuses to cooperate with Congress by threatening to veto the bills that fund Americas priorities here at home  while continuing to ask for more money for the war in Iraq  The omnibus spending package tells President Bush we will not shoulder the cost of his war by sacrificing our safety  security and everyday needs on the home front  said Senator Mikulski  I told Marylanders I would fight for their day to day needs  My promises made are promises kept  despite the Presidents refusal to come to the table to discuss how we can help Americans with their priorities at home  education  health care and keeping their communities safe   Nearly a year ago when I first came to the Senate  my pledge was to work as a partner with Senator Mikulski to push forward key domestic  economic and

Americas priorities  especially support for our veterans  homeland security  education  healthcare and research  the environment and key infrastructure  said Senator Cardin  I recognize that there is much more left to accomplish and I will continue fighting to right this countrys course   The fiscal year 2008 omnibus package combines 11 spending bills that fund domestic priorities and have not yet
