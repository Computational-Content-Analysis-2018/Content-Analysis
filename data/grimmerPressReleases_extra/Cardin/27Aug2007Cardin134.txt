bipartisan group of senators in urging the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  to modify a Department of Homeland Security  DHS  proposal to impose burdensome regulations on propane use by rural farms  homes and businesses  The DHS has proposed requiring those who store propane in quantities greater than 7 500 pounds register with the agency    Based on the DHS proposal  rural users who in aggregate store more than 7 500 pounds of propane would have to undergo a costly screening process to determine if the facility is high risk for a terrorist attack  DHS estimates that the screening would cost between  2 300 and  3 500    The letter to Acting Director  Deputy Direct of OMB Stephen S  McMillin urges OMB to provide an exception from the 7 500 pound limit on propane storage for rural users who depend on propane for their heating and cooking needs    Rural areas have limited access to natural gas and many rural users have large propane tanks to supply their heating and cooking needs  said Senator Cardin  This DHS regulation places an undue and unjustified burden on rural communities and should be amended to focus attention on those facilities that pose a true threat to our security   Weve got to be smart about regulation  Securing our nations chemical facilities should be one of DHSs top priorities  said Senator Cardin  But I have seen no justification that focusing scarce resources on family farms and rural businesses brings us closer to that goal   On August 9  Senator Cardin joined with Senators Barbara A  Mikulski  D MD  and Tom Carper  D DE  in urging Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff to reconsider the agencys decision to impose additional regulations on rural users who depend on propane     The text of the letter is below       August 24  2007  Mr  Stephen S  McMillin Acting Director and Deputy Director Office of Management and Budget Executive Office of the President 725 17th Street  NW Washington  DC 20503  Dear Acting Director McMillin   As members of the United States Senate  we write today to highlight concerns we have with an administrative rule recently issued by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  that will regulate stored quantities of propane  If implemented  this regulation threatens to place a significant regulatory burden upon rural homeowners  farmers  and small businesses  Accordingly  we ask that you modify these regulations to exclude amounts of stored propane that are commonly used by individual homeowners  farmers  and small businesses that operate in rural areas  DHS published the Chemical Facility Anti Terrorism Standards Interim Final Rule  herein CFATS or Final Rule  on April 9  2007  and it became effective on June 8  2007   The Final Rule sets standards for sites that store chemicals of interest above a threshold quantity and requires their registration with DHS  Under the rule  these sites must register with DHS and conduct a Chemical Security Assessment Tool  CSAT  consequence assessment known as Top Screen  Once the Top Screen is completed  DHS will categorize all facilities into tiers based upon proposed vulnerability with facilities above a determined threshold required to complete a Security Vulnerability Assessment  SVA   Facilities that DHS determines are at high risk after completing the Top Screen and the SVA will then be required to file a Site Security Plan  SSP  to certify that the chemicals on site are secure   Attached to the Final Rule is Appendix A which lists the chemicals of interest and the threshold quantities that triggers the initial Top Screen requirement  Currently  Appendix A lists propane as a chemical of interest when stored in quantities greater than 7 500 pounds  Based upon this threshold  any individual or business that keeps quantities greater than or equal to 7 500 pounds of propane would be required to complete the online Top Screen within 60 days of enactment  According to DHSs own regulatory analysis  this Top Screen requirement would likely cost between  2 300 and  3 500 per survey depending on the size and type of facility  Once this survey is completed  solely at the cost of the individual or business  DHS will make a determination whether the facility is high risk for a terrorist attack   While we agree that protecting chemical facilities across the country should be one of the highest priorities for DHS  we are concerned with the scope of these regulations and the undue burden it may place upon rural Americans  Propane tanks are used by virtually all rural homes  farms  and rural small business across the country in areas not commonly supplied by natural gas  Given the current listed aggregate propane threshold of 7 500 pounds  approx  1 785 gallons   many rural homes that have more than one 1 000 gallon propane tank that provides heat and cooking fuel would be required to fill out the Top Screen analysis  Further  many rural small businesses and agricultural facilities that use propane to heat their businesses and for agricultural uses such as drying grain will also be required to complete a Top Screen analysis  As such  this Final Rule and proposed Appendix A places an undue regulatory burden that disproportionately impacts rural homeowners  farmers  and small businesses across the country just because they store propane as opposed to receiving pipe supplied natural gas   We believe the Final Rule is overly burdensome for three reasons  First  it imposes a registration requirement upon rural homeowners  farmers  and small businesses that costs thousands of dollars as a preliminary step to determine whether or not they are high risk  Second  the Final Rule provides DHS the authority to impose civil fines and orders to cease operations for failing to register without offering exemptions for low risk targets  Finally  the registration requirement will include complex and detailed communications requiring back and forth between DHS and the regulated individuals potentially increasing the cost above the projections estimated by DHS  For instance  an elderly family farmer in rural Iowa who has stored propane for years and lives at least 10 miles from the nearest neighbor could be subject to these regulations and required to hire an attorney just to ensure that the registration is completed properly  All this would be required prior to DHS finding and determining that such facilities are a threat to homeland security   An additional concern that arises as a result of the CFATS Final Rule is the potential increase in propane tankers that will be traveling our highways  DHS has acknowledged that the safest point in the propane distribution network is stationary storage and the weakest is product transfer  Given the current listed threshold of 7 500 pounds  many individuals that currently have capacity greater than 7 500 pounds may choose to limit the amount of propane they store below the threshold level  Consequently  these individuals may require more trips from propane distributors to keep their tanks full during the winter heating season  As a result  the rule may have an unintended consequence of creating more vulnerable targetspropane tanker trucksthat will travel our highways and roads with increased frequency to meet this new demand for more frequent fillings   Appendix A is not yet finalized and DHS still has time to amend the threshold quantities of propane in Appendix A to reduce this impact on rural Americans  Allowing Appendix A to become a final addendum to the CFATS Final Rule with the current threshold of 7 500 pounds of propane would place a serious hardship upon thousands of law abiding Americans who use propane to heat their homes and run their businesses  The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs  OIRA  at OMB concluded a review the CFATS on April 2  2007  However  as Appendix A remains incomplete  the full burden of the CFATS regulations has not been felt  Accordingly  as the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget  we ask that OMB review the impact Appendix A of the CFATS Final Rule will have and ensure that DHS includes a limited exemption for rural home  agricultural  and small businesses uses   Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter and for considering the disproportionate impact this CFATS Final Rule and Appendix A may have on rural American homeowners  farmers  and small businesses
