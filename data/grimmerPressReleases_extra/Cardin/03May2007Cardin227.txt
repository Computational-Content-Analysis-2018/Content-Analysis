                                                                              Thursday  May 3  2007      Susan Sullam  410 962 4436   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Benjamin L  Cardin today joined Senator Olympia J  Snowe  R ME  in introducing bipartisan legislation to create a group of highly qualified  master teachers  who will receive a break on their federal income taxes for teaching in a school that fail to meet standards defined under the No Child Left Behind Act      In agreeing to teach in an under performing school  the Master Teacher Act would exempt  master teachers  from paying federal taxes on 25  of their income for up to a four year period    An under performing school is one that fails to meet the Adequate Yearly Progress  AYP  as defined in the No Child Left Behind Act  NCLBA        Education is the key to success in our global economy  and it s time that we do more to ensure our children can compete   said Senator Cardin    We must commit to improving under performing schools and we can do that by recruiting highly skilled teachers who will work for at least four years in a school that needs significant improvement as defined by the NCLBA          This legislation is critical to ensuring that our country continues improve the education of America s children by investing in the very individuals who dedicate their lives to them  their teachers   said Senator Snowe   It is imperative that we do more to motivate the nation s finest teachers to bring their skills to all learning establishments  especially the lowest achieving schools who need it most   By providing students in all corners of the country with the best resources  we are offering them greater opportunities to achieve their full potential       Senator Cardin s bill defines  master teacher  as someone who has had five years of teaching experience in a public elementary or secondary school  holds a master s degree  meets the definition of Highly Qualified as defined by the NCLBA  and has obtained advanced certification in their state licensing system or is certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards if their state does not have an advanced certification designation     As currently designated by the NCLBA  100  of our nation s students must meet the AYP standards in reading  math and science by the 2013 14 school year   Currently  out of Maryland s 1 420 public schools  311 failed to meet the AYP standards     Summary of the bill is below    The Master Teacher Act  Summary   The Master Teacher Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income up to 25 percent of the wages earned by a certified master teacher in certain schools identified as in need of improvement or in a Head Start program   The Act defines  certified master teacher  as a teacher who   1  has at least five years teaching experience in a public elementary or secondary school   2  is highly qualified as defined by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965   3  has a master s degree  and  4  has advanced certification in the applicable State licensing system  The exclusion ends after 2013    Goals   To establish a class of  Master Teachers  that would have extensive experience and training and would be willing to teach for an extended period of time in schools that need them the most   To close student achievement gaps by improving the quality experience of their teachers  and  To make obtaining advanced training and experience in teaching more desirable   How the Program Works   In order to attract  Master Teachers  to the lowest performing schools in the country  the Master Teacher Act would allow 25  of these teachers  salaries to be tax exempt for the four years they work in a school that has been identified as not meeting Adequate Yearly Progress  AYP  and eligible for school wide programs as defined by NCLB   Each state would have a cap of 10  of public school teachers eligible to receive Master Teacher tax treatment at a time   The program would go into effect in 2007 and end with the 2013 2014 school year  when NCLB requires that 100  of students perform at the proficient level   Even when a school is found to be meeting AYP standards during a teacher s four years in the Master Teacher program  they will continue to receive the full tax benefit until the end of their four year term     Definitions   Master Teacher  A teacher who holds a masters degree  has 5 years of public school teaching experience  meets the definition of  highly qualified  as defined by NCLB  AND has advanced certification in his her state licensing system OR is certified by the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards if his her state does not have an advanced certification designation   Highly Qualified  As defined by NCLB  a teacher who has full state certification or has passed the state licensing exam  and holds a degree to teach in that state   Adequate Yearly Progress  As defined by NCLB  every state is required to identify which schools have made AYP   According to the Department of Education   a State s definition of AYP is based on expectations for growth in student achievement that is continuous and substantial  such that all students are proficient in reading and math no later than 2013 2014    All schools  and all students within each school  must meet their state s standard of proficiency in reading  math  and science by the 2013 2014 school year   Use of Funds for School Wide Programs  A local educational agency may use funds for school wide programs is 40  or more of the school s students are from low income families   Advanced Teacher Certification  The highest level of teaching certification in a state licensing system
