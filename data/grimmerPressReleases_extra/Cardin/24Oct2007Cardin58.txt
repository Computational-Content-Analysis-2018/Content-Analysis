programs  as well as critical increases for the National Institutes of Health  NIH   the National Institute on Aging and the National Cancer Institute   STRENGTHENING NURSING PROGRAMS  America is facing a nursing shortage  and it is only getting worse  The shortage affects every state  every city  every town  and it affects our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq who rely on the care of our military nurses  said Senator Mikulski  a long time champion of nursing programs  Increasing our nursing workforce is essential for our hospitals and for our patients  I will continue to fight to make nursing a priority in the federal law book and the federal checkbook  Nurses are the backbone of our health care system  said Senator Cardin  The nursing shortage in America has reached a critical state  The outlook becomes even more grim as the population ages and health care resources are further strained  I applaud the Senate for funding programs that address this important issue   The bill provides  169 million for nursing programs  a  20 million increase despite the President s budget request of only  105 3 million  Senators Mikulski and Cardin also fought for an additional  1 45

discoveries for womens health  I will continue to stand sentry to make sure women are taken care of across the country  said Senator Mikulski  We must make sure women have the information they need

today are living longer  healthier lives  We must do what we can to help them be as independent and active as possible  and provide the resources necessary to meet new challenges  said Senator Mikulski  who is also the Chairwoman of the Retirement Security and Aging Subcommittee of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  By passing the Older Americans Act  OAA   we honored one of our responsibilities to our seniors  I will continue to make sure we provide a federal investment in these programs  America is graying  The population of Americans over age 65 will nearly double over the next 20 years  said Senator Cardin  We have a responsibility to ensure that seniors have every resource available to remain vital  The Older Americans Act does that by helping seniors live healthier  more productive lives  The OAA  which was reauthorized by Congress and signed into law last year  is essential for the delivery of social and nutritional services for Americas seniors  including the information and referral services that are the backbone of OAA programs  senior nutrition programs  and elder abuse programs  The bill provides a total  1 4 billion  a  58 5 million increase over fiscal year 2007  and  106 4 million above the Presidents budget request  This years spending bill also includes funding for the following Maryland projects      500 000 for
