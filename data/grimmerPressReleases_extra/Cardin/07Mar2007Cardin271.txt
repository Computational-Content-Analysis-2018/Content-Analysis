 D MD  testified today before the House Judiciary Committee on the need to combat voter deception and election irregularities that have occurred in Maryland and across the nation in recent elections  disproportionately affecting minority communities   He was joined on a panel with Sen  Barack Obama  D IL   and Reps  Loretta Sanchez  D CA  and Rahm Emanuel  D IL        Last weekend  we honored the anniversary of the March from Selma to Montgomery  a historic day when civil rights activists took to the streets and demanded that every American have the right to vote   said Sen  Cardin    Yet voter intimidation and suppression still exists in America today  and it disproportionately targets minority communities   In recent elections in Maryland and across the nation  we ve seen deceptive literature handed out in minority communities  notices telling voters the wrong election date  and other blatant campaign tactics for the purpose of suppressing minority turnout   We can do better as a nation      In order for democracy to work  every American who wants to vote must be able to cast their ballot for the candidate they wish   When a candidate or campaign committee intentionally tries to mislead voters  suppress turnout or tamper with polling place operations  we all lose   Democracy loses  We must take action to protect the voters and the integrity of our system   said Sen  Cardin      In the days leading up to last November s election  two state wide candidates in Maryland distributed blatantly deceptive literature at the polls in minority communities and there were additional instances of voter intimidation and mismanagement by election officials   Similar incidents of deception targeting minority communities occurred in other parts of the nation      Last month  Sen  Cardin co sponsored the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007  a bill introduced by Sen  Obama in order to criminalize voter intimidation and gives individual voters the right to take action   The House Judiciary Committee is considering similar legislation      The following excerpts are from Sen  Cardin s prepared testimony                 After having served in elective office in Annapolis for 20 years and in Washington for 20 years  I understand that campaigns are a rough and tumble business   I expect that candidates will question and criticize my record and judgment  and voters ultimately have a right to choose their candidate   What goes beyond the pale is when a campaign uses deceptive tactics to deliberately marginalize minority voters                 Sadly  the tactics we saw in Maryland are not new  and in previous years deceptive practices in Baltimore City  the State of Maryland  and throughout the United States involved handing out false and deceptive literature in African American neighborhoods   In previous elections we have seen deceptive literature distributed which gave the wrong date for the election  the wrong times when polling places were open  and even suggested that people could be arrested if they had unpaid parking tickets or taxes and tried to vote   My colleagues on the panel  I am sure  will discuss other such tactics designed to suppress minority turnout                 I reject that this is the way we do business in 2006 in Maryland and in the United States of America   To me this is clearly an organized pattern and practice of attempting to confuse minority voters and to suppress minority turnout                 It has been 137 years since Congress and the states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1870  which states that  the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race  or  color      The Amendment also gave Congress power to enforce the article by  appropriate legislation    African Americans suffered through nearly another 100 years of discrimination at the hands of Jim Crow laws and regulations  designed to make it difficult if not impossible for African Americans to register to vote due to literacy tests  poll taxes  and outright harassment and violence   It took Congress and the states nearly another century until we adopted the Twenty Fourth Amendment to the Constitution in 1964  which prohibited poll taxes or any tax on the right to vote   In 1965 Congress finally enacted the Voting Rights Act  which once and for all was supposed to prohibit discrimination against voters on the basis of race or color                 It is time for Congress to once again take action to stop the latest reprehensible tactics that are being used against African American voters to interfere with  a  their right to vote or  b  their right to vote for the candidate of their choice  as protected in the Voting Rights Act   These tactics undermine and corrode our very democracy and threaten the very integrity of our electoral process                Today we have the obligation and duty to fulfill the promises made by Congress and the states nearly 140 years after the end of the Civil War  and over 40 years after the enactment of the Voting Rights Act   I urge you to pass this legislation that would stop the use of false and deceptive practices designed to disenfranchise and suppress minority voter turnout   Let us make it crystal clear that it is illegal to use these types of campaign tactics to deliberately try to suppress and intimidate minority voters from casting their hard won and precious right to vote in an election
