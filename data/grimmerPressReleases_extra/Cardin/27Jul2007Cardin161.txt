                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Friday  July 27  2007       WASHINGTON  D C   Senators Benjamin L  Cardin and Barbara A  Mikulski  both D Md   today announced the Senate has approved the 2008 Department of Homeland Security spending bill  which includes key funding for Marylands security assets  The legislation addresses several high priority items  including grants for firefighters  first responders  port security and a major project for the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay in Baltimore  providing no additional funding from last year   and for years my challenge was fixing the twists and turns in our channels that were a safety risk  Today  its threats that were unthinkable years ago  Keeping our ports and our people safe from terrorism is one of my top priorities  This legislation gets us one step closer to keeping our nation safer  standing up for our first responders  and making sure that if terror strikes measures are in place to protect and save lives  said Senator Mikulski  I will keep fighting to make sure there are resources in the federal checkbook for our homeland security  Americas security begins at home and this bill strengthens our ability to protect our neighborhoods  the Port of Baltimore  and our coasts  said Senator Cardin  It is an important contribution to the safety of the people of Maryland and the nation  FIREFIGHTER GRANTS The spending bill includes  560 million  an increase of  13 million  in federal funding for our nations firefighters through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program  AFGP   This competitive program awards one year grants directly to local fire departments nationwide  Fire departments can apply for federal assistance for training  equipment  staffing  fire education and awareness programs  or firefighting vehicles  It also includes  140 million  an increase of  25 million  for Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response  SAFER  grants  also under the AFGP  President Bushs budget cut federal support for the AFGP nearly in half  requesting only  287 million  It also eliminated funding for SAFER grants for the second year in a row  I know these are tight times  but we must do better for our first responders  The federal government has a responsibility to protect our protectors  providing them with the best equipment  training and resources they need to do their job safer and smarter  said Senator Mikulski  Helping our firefighters is not a political issue  it is a safety issue  If you are willing to put your life on the line every day  you should never feel short changed by your government  I am so proud to announce this increase in a federal investment in the safety of our first responders  Our first responders are the linchpin of our nations emergency response network  said Senator Cardin  Whether a natural disaster  an act of terrorism or a man made catastrophe  our first responders must have the training and resources they need to get the job done  Our lives may one day depend on it  This year  18 160 departments nationwide applied for funding  requesting more than  2 3 billion  This includes 189 Maryland applicants  who requested nearly  34 7 million  So far this year  Maryland departments have received nearly  11 2 million  making it among the top five states nationwide  PORT SECURITY GRANTS The bill also includes increased funding for the Port Security Grant program at  400 million  a  190 million increase from last year  These funds are granted to localities to finance security enhancements at critical national seaports  The Presidents budget only requested  210 million Ports are high threat targets for terrorism  We need to make sure the Port of Baltimore and all ports across America are safe  secure and growing  said Senator Mikulski  I have been fighting to upgrade the Port of Baltimore for more than 20 years We must do more to secure our nations ports  The Port of Baltimore is one of the most important economic engines in our state and region  Its close proximity to Washington and its high volume make it a target  and I am pleased that it will receive additional resources to improve security  said Senator Cardin  Approximately 11 million containers come into the United States each year  including 19 000 containers daily  The Port of Baltimore  which is the 14th largest port for foreign cargo  currently has to compete with 16 other ports for a share of a tiny  40 2 million pot for federal grants  Having recently celebrated its 300th anniversary  the Port of Baltimore is an economic engine for Maryland and America  supporting more than 42 000 maritime related jobs in Maryland and almost 20 000 direct jobs  COAST GUARD YARD This years spending bill also includes  75 million for maintenance and repair projects at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay  This will extend the service life and increase mission performance for the Coast Guards aging fleet of boats  The bill also includes language that recognizes the Yard as a critical component of the Coast Guards core logistics capability that directly supports fleet readiness  For 108 years  the Yard at Curtis Bay has built  repaired and renovated ships that are critical to the Coast Guards core missions  Theyve done it on time  under budget and at a competitive rate  said Senator Mikulski  I want to ensure that we have the worlds best equipped Coast Guard  Thats why I have continued to fight for the Coast Guard Yard  I am pleased that the bill recognizes the key role that the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay has played for more than 100 years in ensuring the Coast Guards core logistical capabilities  This bill recognizes the important contribution of the Yard and recommends that its continued use for maintenance and repair  said Senator Cardin  Senator Mikulski is a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee  Senator Cardin is a member of the Budget Committee  In the next step of the legislative process  the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the two versions of the bill  The Conference report will then be voted on by both Houses of Congress  Once passed by the House and Senate  the spending bill will go to the President for his signature
