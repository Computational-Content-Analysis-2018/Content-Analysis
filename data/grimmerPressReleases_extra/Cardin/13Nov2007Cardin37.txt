announced the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education 2008 spending bill has been sent to the President for his signature  and includes increased funding for federal Impact Aid and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA  programs  In meetings with Marylands local leaders to discuss the impact of the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commissions 2005 recommendations  both Senators pledged to fight for increases to these programs that could dramatically ease pressure on local and state government budgets  and allow more funds to support BRAC implementation efforts  My promises made to BRAC impacted communities are promises kept  BRAC brings opportunities  but it also brings great challenges  We must now work together to help Maryland address the increased demands on our communities  said Senator Mikulski  I will continue to focus on how federal dollars can help our counties  and fight for an increased federal investment in these priorities  Maryland was chosen through the BRAC process for an expanded military and intelligence presence  We are proud of this new mission and excited about the opportunities it brings  At the same time  we also realize that an influx of new residents requires increased infrastructure  said Senator Cardin  I am pleased the federal government has recognized the challenges faced by Maryland communities during the ongoing BRAC process and I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure continued federal support  The spending bill includes  1 3 billion for the federal Impact Aid program  a  34 7 million increase over the Presidents request  The program provides federal funding to school districts that have increased enrollment due to federally connected children  These are students with a parent who is either a member of the Armed Forces living and or working on a military base  or who is a civilian contractor working on a military base or other federally owned land  This also includes children residing on Indian lands or federally owned  low rent housing facilities  Impact Aid funds can be used for school construction  hiring new teachers  and updating technology  The Department of Defense estimates that Maryland will receive at least an additional 4 000 federally connected students between 2007 and 2011  with Harford and Anne Arundel County school districts being the most heavily impacted   The spending bill also provides  12 3 billion in increased funding for IDEA  despite the Presidents budget request of only  10 49 billion  The IDEA program entitles children with disabilities to a public education and provides federal funds to help schools with the cost  In theory  the federal government pays 40 percent of a states special education costs  with the rest subsidized by the state and local governments  However  the Bush Administration has not made good on its commitment  despite Congress efforts every year to increase funding and accountability  At its height  the federal government has never paid more than 18 percent to Maryland  This means local districts must make up the difference by skimping on special education  cutting from other education programs  or raising taxes   I dont want to force states and local school districts to forage for funds  cut back on teacher training  or delay school repairs because the federal government has failed to live up to its commitment to special education  said Senator Mikulski  I will continue to fight for funding of IDEA  because I dont want special education to be a hollow promise  Because IDEA required states to provide disabled children with a quality public education  millions of children in Maryland and the nation now have a much brighter future  said Senator Cardin  But that federal imperative came with costs  and the federal government has never paid its promised share  These added funds will allow states and school districts to meet their commitment to disabled children without cutting other essential programs and services  Senator Mikulski is a member of the Appropriations Committee  Senator Cardin is a member of the Budget Committee
