224 4524  Susan Sullam  410 962 4436   WASHINGTON   In a speech today on the Senate Floor  Sen  Benjamin L  Cardin  D MD  expressed his condolences and personal outrage about the death of Deamonte Driver  a 12 year old boy from Prince George s County who died last week from a brain infection brought on by a tooth abscess   The Senator described Deamonte s death a national tragedy and called on Congress to make sure that dental coverage for children in included in this year s State Children s Health Insurance Program  S CHIP  reauthorization bill       As reported by The Washington Post on Wednesday  the Driver family had been living in a homeless shelter and was unable to find a dentist to remove Deamonte s infected tooth before it led to brain damage       It is outrageous that today in America  a young boy can die because his family can t find a dentist to remove an infected tooth   said Sen  Cardin    Any time we lose a child  it is a tragedy  But Deamonte Driver s death is particularly devastating because it was easily preventable   I give my heartfelt condolences to the Driver family  but it is not enough simply to mourn Deamonte s death  We must learn from this failure of our health care system and take action to make sure it never happens again   Congress must act to make sure every child in America has access to quality dental care  which starts by including dental coverage in S CHIP       This year  Congress is scheduled to reauthorize S CHIP  which provides health care coverage to millions of American children   Sen  Cardin strongly believes the reauthorization must include basic dental coverage for children      The following excerpts are from Sen  Cardin s prepared speech          Deamonte s death  the result of a brain infection brought on by a tooth abscess  is a national tragedy   It is a tragedy because it was preventable   It is a tragedy because it happened right here in the United States  in a state is one of the most affluent in the nation   It happened in the state that is home to the first and one of the best dental schools in the nation  the University of Maryland s   It happened in Prince George s County  whose border is less than six miles from where we are standing in the United States Capitol         It is not enough for the community  the state  or even the Senate to mourn Deamonte s death   We must learn from this appalling failure of our broken health care system and we must fix it  Our former Surgeon General C  Everett Koop  once said   There is no health without oral health   The sad story of the Driver family has brought Dr  Koop s  lesson home in a painful way           Our medical researchers have discovered the important linkage between plaque and heart disease  that chewing stimulates brain cell growth  and that gum disease can signal diabetes  liver ailments and hormone imbalances    They have learned the vital connection between oral research and advanced treatments like gene therapy  which can help patients with chronic renal failure But without real support for government insurance programs such as SCHIP and Medicaid  all this textbook knowledge will do nothing to help our children         Overall appropriations for the Health Resources and Services Administration are declining   That agency s principal responsibility is to assure that primary health care services and qualified health professionals are available to meet the health needs of all Americans  particularly the underserved      But the President s FY 2008 budget cuts HRSA by  251 million dollars         President Bush once again proposes to almost wipe out programs that educate non nurse health professionals  And it is happening at a time when more than 20 percent of dentists are expected to retire in the next decade    The 2008 Bush proposal would also cut more than  135 million from health professions training programs          Programs that help prepare minority high school and college students for dentistry would be shut down  as would grants to help support training of primary care doctors and dentists  Scholarships for minority and disadvantaged students would be cut significantly           Dental reimbursement for programs within the Ryan White CARE Act  which help dental schools train people to care for HIV patients  is not increased sufficiently to meet our communities  needs  We cannot let this happen  These health professions training programs provide critically important  training and health education services to communities throughout the country  including those in my state of Maryland         We need to do more to make the public and the Administration understand that dental care must be part of a comprehensive medical approach in this country  and we need to find new ways to dental coverage part of  health insurance plans    This comes back to a fundamental question  what should the role of the federal government be in these matters   We cannot end these vital health  education  and research programs   We must strengthen them          Deamonte s death should be a wake up call for all of us in the 110th Congress  This year  we will be called upon to make important decisions about Medicaid funding  and we will reauthorize the S CHIP program    We must ensure that the S CHIP reauthorization bill we send to the President for his signature includes dental coverage for children         I call on my colleagues  as we begin these debates in the spring  to remember Deamonte  I also ask them to remember his brother  DaShawn  who still needs dental care  and the millions of other American children who rely on public health care systems for their dental care
