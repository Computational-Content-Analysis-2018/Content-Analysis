Senators Benjamin L  Cardin and Barbara A  Mikulski today sent a letter to the U S  Army Corps of Engineers urging rejection of the permit application to build a liquefied natural gas  LNG  facility at Sparrows Point        It is a poor decision to locate a LNG facility in such a densely populated area of Baltimore City and Baltimore County   said Senator Cardin    I join other members of the Delegation in opposing this facility  and I urge the Army Corp to reject AES s application   This facility is not in the best interest of Baltimore area residents       I am deeply concerned for the safety of communities surrounding the site and the potential environmental impact of the facility  Residents need more time to make sure their voice is heard before a LNG site is built in their neighborhood   said Senator Mikulski   I need to know that all of Maryland will be secure      Also joining the Senators on the letter to the Army Corps were  U S  Reps  Elijah E  Cummings  D 7   C A  Dutch Ruppersberger  D 2  and John Sarbanes   D 3   The letter contains specific objections to the permit application submitted by AES Sparrows Point LNG to dredge an entrance channel and turning basin to construct a dredged material recycling facility to support the LNG facility      The full text of the letter is below     Colonel Peter W  Mueller  Commander and District Engineer  U S  Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore District  PO Box 1715  Baltimore  Maryland  21203 1715    Dear Col  Mueller     We are writing to urge you to reject the permit application recently submitted by AES Sparrows Point LNG  LLC and Mid Atlantic Express  LLC to dredge an entrance channel and turning basin and to construct a dredged material recycling facility to support the proposed liquefied natural gas  LNG  import storage terminal  pipeline and related facilities       Over the years  the Maryland congressional delegation and state and local officials have worked very hard  individually and collectively  to sustain and improve the Port of Baltimore  its maritime commerce  and the vitality of the local community   We have worked closely with the Maryland Port Administration and the Baltimore District  U S  Army Corps of Engineers to ensure the maintenance of and improvements to the Port s shipping channels and anchorages to facilitate the movement of commercial vessel traffic and the environmentally sound management of the dredged material from those channels   In our judgment  AES  proposed LNG facility and the associated dredging project would undermine these activities        Specifically  AES  permit application fails to address how the company plans to dispose of up to 4 million cubic yards of dredged material   including contaminated material    for the project  in an environmentally sound and viable manner   Existing and proposed dredged material containment sites do not have the capacity to handle this volume of material and the Harbor s Dredging Material Management Plan does not account for and can not accommodate this material   Moreover  we are deeply concerned that the LNG terminal and LNG tankers would  negatively impact commercial and cruise ships utilizing the Port of Baltimore s navigational channels  as well as recreational boaters and commercial watermen in the surrounding waters  due to the 1500 foot safety exclusionary zone   Recreational and commercial vessels would be constrained from free movement in the Port s channels and area waters by the security zone for LNG tankers and the terminal  resulting in delays and congestion problems  as well as economic loses to the Port and recreational maritime industries   In addition  local and state authorities have raised serious concerns that the location of the LNG plant at Sparrows Point is inconsistent with the economic redevelopment plans for Baltimore County and would hamper future use of the site as a potential marine terminal serving the needs of the Port of Baltimore       As you know  the Corps  regulatory review process requires the careful weighing of all factors relevant to the public interest including the project s potential impacts on the environment  Port related and recreational industries  local land use plans as well as the needs and welfare of citizens in the surrounding communities    Our area Congressional Delegation  Governor O Malley  Baltimore County Executive Jim Smith and other local officials and community leaders believe this project poses unacceptable public safety  economic and environmental risks and does not serve the public interest   In view of the substantial issues and concerns that are being raised by the proposed LNG terminal and associated dredging project  we urge you to reject this permit application
