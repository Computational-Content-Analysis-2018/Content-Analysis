                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    SENATOR CARDIN LOOKS AT THE SENATE AGENDA AHEAD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Thursday  December 27  2007      During this holiday period  the Senate will hold a series of pro forma session rather than a single  lengthy recess  I will be one of list of senators who will preside over the Senate during this period  This unusual step will preclude the administration from making recess appointments that circumvent the Senates responsibility of advice and consent of senior government officials  including judges    Shortly after the full Congress reconvenes  the President will deliver his State of the Union address followed by his budget for the coming year  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee  I will join with my colleagues to carefully review the proposal and make improvements that best reflect the priorities of Marylanders and all Americans  Well also strive to complete work on some unfinished business from 2007  including dedicated funding for the Washington Metro System  expanding healthcare for children  CHIP   guidelines for federal wiretapping through FISA  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act   support for farmers and conservation measures to protect the Chesapeake Bay  payments to physicians and other health care providers who treat Medicare patients  and important funding to support the influx of new jobs and families to Maryland thanks to the Base Realignment  BRAC  recommendations  More details on the progress of each of these vital issues as legislation progresses through the Senate    Among the key legislation working through the Senate is the Lieberman Warner Climate Security Act  which I voted for as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  This landmark bill to combat global warming establishes a cap and trade system for reducing carbon dioxide  CO2  emissions  CO2 is one of the principal greenhouse gases  I am pleased that the bill set to be debated by the full Senate includes my provision dedicating 1 percent of the revenue raised by this bill for mass transit  In addition  I will continue to pressure the administration and EPA Administrator Johnson to reverse their decision that prohibits Maryland and other states from following Californias stricter emissions guidelines to better protect our local environment  The administration used the signing of an historic energy bill that raised emissions standards as an excuse to stop more than a dozen states from getting tougher  This is unacceptable    As a member of the Judiciary Committee  I will closely follow the investigation into the CIAs destruction of interrogation torture tapes  Ill also be involved in hearings and legislative activity related to a number of civil and human rights issues  Some of these include  passing the Employment Non Discrimination Act  ENDA   pushing for floor passage of legislation addressing deceptive practices against voters  ending racial profiling  and finally passing the Matthew Shepard Act  also known as the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act  The Judiciary Committee also will seek to end the gap that exists in access to legal services in civil cases and we will work to restore a balance between prevention and enforcement of juveniles accused of crimes  I will hold Attorney General Mukasey accountable for the action  or inaction  of his staff  particularly when it comes to mediating within communities touched by hate crimes    There are many other issues of importance in the coming year  Look for details on education initiatives  healthcare and more in the weeks and months to come    I wish you and your family a happy and healthy new year filled with peace and laughter
