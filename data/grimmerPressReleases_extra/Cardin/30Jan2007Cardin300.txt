Contacts   Oren Shur  202 224 4524  Susan Sullam  410 962 4436   WASHINGTON     Sen  Benjamin L  Cardin  D MD  highlighted Maryland   s unique vulnerability to global warming at today   s hearing before the Committee on Environment and Public Works  EPW   The Senator  a member of the committee  also spoke out for the need to address global warming by enacting a comprehensive energy policy that will lead our nation to energy independence        The impact of global warming is real and right before our eyes     said Sen  Cardin     Maryland is particularly vulnerable to flooding and our sea levels are rising at a rapid pace   If we don   t do something to address global warming now  thousands of Marylanders living along our coasts will need to change their way of life in a major way   Global warming is not a partisan issue  it   s a crisis that affects every human being on this earth and we must take action now         According to a 2005 report of the Maryland Emergency Management Agency  MEMA   Maryland is particularly vulnerable to the threat of global warming because such a large part of the state consists of low lying coastal areas   The report also states that Maryland is the third most vulnerable state to flooding and has the fifth longest evacuation times during tropical storm activity      More than 12 percent of land in Maryland is designated under the National Flood Insurance Program as a Special Flood Hazard Area and an estimated 68 000 homes and building are located within the state   s floodplain   Allstate Insurance Corp   one of our largest insurers  recently announced that it will stop writing new homeowners    policies in coastal areas of the state  citing concerns that a warmer Atlantic Ocean will lead to more and stronger hurricanes hitting the Northeast       At today   s EPW hearing  Sen  Cardin also outlined his plan for a comprehensive energy plan that would bring our nation closer to energy independence  reduce America   s dependence on fossil fuels and help address global warming        America   s current energy policy is unsustainable and reckless     said Sen  Cardin      We depend on nations that are openly hostile to our government for oil  while at the same time our reliance on fossil fuels is destroying our environment at home   It is absolutely critical that we put into place a policy that will put on us a fast track towards energy independence  We have the technology  we just need the political will power         The following is Sen  Cardin   s prepared statement for the Congressional Record       Global Warming Statement   Senator Benjamin L  Cardin    January 30th EPW Hearing    For the sake of our security  economy and environment  America needs an energy policy that is independent from foreign energy sources and weans America off of fossil fuels     America   s current energy policy is simply unsustainable     We all know the security issues   The U S  imports over 65 percent of our oil from foreign countries     many of them openly hostile to our country   American consumers are literally financing extreme anti American groups that we fund through our oil dollars   Our petroleum habit creates national security risks and causes long term energy price instability for American consumers   a price or supply change by OPEC can directly affect our economy   We are currently spending billions of dollars a year to subsidize oil companies  while their profits have increased dramatically     Exxon Mobil is on track to break its own record breaking  36 billion dollar profits from 2005     America   s energy policy has also had a serious impact on our economy   Five years ago  the average American family spent  3 300 on gasoline  home heating  and electricity  Average U S  households paid nearly  5 000 to power their homes and vehicles in 2006     32 percent greater than just two years ago   Households with incomes under  15 000     about one fifth of all households     spent about one tenth of their income in 2006 on gasoline   Leading economists noted after the release of monthly economic reports in September  2006  that energy prices are rising much faster than wages and becoming  increasingly difficult for consumers to absorb      While each of these is important  this hearing is about global warming  and about how our energy policy can deliver reductions in global warming     I introduced legislation in the 109th Congress with many rigorous goals to get us on the right path  but there are many ways to accomplish these goals   At its heart  America   s energy policy needs to address energy independence  fossil fuel reduction  and global warming     It is reasonable to establish the goal of meeting 90 percent of our energy needs from domestic sources by 2017   America imports 30 percent of its overall energy needs  but imports over 13 million barrels of oil each day     more than 65 percent of U S  oil needs   The majority of our imported energy is oil  and the largest consumption of oil in the U S  is for transportation   84 percent of U S  imported energy in 2005 was petroleum  representing 28 9 quadrillion Btu   U S  transportation consumption accounted for 28 1 quadrillion Btu  mostly in petroleum       It is reasonable to establish a goal to meet 90 percent of our energy needs from non fossil fuel sources by 2027   Fossil fuels   coal  oil  and natural gas   are America s primary source of energy  making up over 70 percent of our electricity generation   Fossil fuel fired electricity generation is the single greatest source of air pollution in the United States  and power plants are the leading U S  source of carbon dioxide emissions   a primary contributor to global warming   U S  conventional oil production peaked in 1970  and only produces enough oil to meet 35 percent of its oil needs   We have an abundance of coal  but we lack the technological ability to use coal in an environmentally secure manner       It is reasonable to establish the goal of reducing our emissions of global warming causing greenhouse gasses by 26 percent by 2030   With only 5 percent of the world   s population and 6 percent of the world   s land area  the U S  is the number one emitter of carbon dioxide in both tons and in per capita emissions  in the world   Greenhouse gasses are emitted primarily by the burning of fossil fuels and the clearing of forests   Carbon dioxide  along with other heat trapping gasses  remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries  and have been melting ice  making Earth   s water warmer  and increasing extreme weather events  such as higher intensity tropical storms   By 2012  cuts in greenhouse gas emissions required under the Kyoto Protocol will be swamped by emissions from new coal fired plants built in China  India  and the United States   These 3 countries are expected to emit an extra 2 7 billion tons of carbon dioxide   The Discovery Channel has produced a couple of stellar programs outlining our global warming problems  Addiction to Oil     with Tom Friedman  and Global Warming     with Tom Brokaw   I   d like to introduce these programs into the record at this point     Global warming poses an especially serious threat to my own state of Maryland  with a large part of our state consisting of low lying coastal areas that would be inundated if global temperatures keep rising   Global warming pollution in Maryland is up by 55 percent from 1960       More than 12 percent of land in Maryland is designated under the National Flood Insurance Program as a Special Flood Hazard Area     An estimated 68 000 homes and buildings are located within the floodplain in Maryland  These structures represent nearly  8 billion in assessed value        According to 2005 report of the Maryland Emergency Management Agency Maryland is the 3rd most vulnerable state to flooding and has the 5th longest evacuation times during a tropical storm event       Tide gauge records for the last century show that the rate of sea level rise in Maryland  is nearly twice the global average   Studies indicate that this rate is accelerating and may increase to two or three feet along Maryland   s shores by the year 2100     The effects are already evident  about a third of the marshes at Blackwater Wildlife Refuge on Maryland   s eastern shore have been lost to sea level rise over the past 70 years   Smith Island  the only inhabited island community in Maryland and the subject of a recent documentary on global warming  has lost 30 percent of its land mass to sea level rise since 1850   Lloyds of London is reportedly the only company that will insure homes on Smith Island and the premiums and high deductibles are unaffordable to most residents   Allstate Insurance Corp   one of our largest insurers  recently announced that it will stop writing new homeowners    policies in coastal areas of the state  citing concerns that a warmer Atlantic Ocean will lead to more and stronger hurricanes hitting the Northeast   Hurricane Isabel in 2003  which was a modest hurricane  underscored how vulnerable Bay communities are to coastal flooding from storm surge   Maryland   s premier beach resort     Ocean City     representing more than  4 billion in public and private investment     remains especially vulnerable to sea level rise unless our beach renourishment projects are continued and expanded   The combination of sea level rise and warmer temperatures as well as increased salinity levels could have tremendous ecological impacts on the Chesapeake Bay      Clearly sea level rise will have devastating effects not only on the hundreds of thousands of Marylanders who live in low lying areas but on our economy  our environment and our quality of life        Our first goal must be to conserve energy   This conservation effort needs to start w  transportation   The U S  must increase Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency  CAF    standards significantly over the next ten years   The Ford Model T got 25 mpg  yet our current CAF   standard calls for 27 5 mpg for passenger cars  and 21 6 mpg for light trucks      In 1981  the last time gas prices breached  3  adjusted for inflation  the average car got 21 miles to the gallon   Jump ahead 24 years  a period when there have been huge advances in automotive fuel efficiency  and the average passenger vehicle on the road gets   21 miles to the gallon         CNN 9 14 05    Under federal fuel economy standards  automakers equip new vehicles with tires that have a lower rolling resistance  which leads to higher fuel efficiency   By requiring replacement tires to be as efficient as new car tires  we could rapidly begin gasoline savings  and save more than 7 billion barrels of oil over the next 50 years   These changes would particularly aid lower income drivers  who are more likely to drive used cars with replacement tires     There is no one solution to our energy problems  other conservation examples include increasing Energy Star funding  and adding solar water heaters to the list of products that wear the Energy Star label   The Energy Star program brings consumers energy efficient choices in appliances  light bulbs  and other goods   This vital program helped Americans save enough energy in 2005 to prevent greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 23 million cars     while saving  12 billion on utility bills      According to the DOE  commercial buildings account for 35 percent of America   s electricity consumption   An upfront investment of 2 percent in green building design  on average  results in life cycle savings of ten times that upfront investment   I would increase the Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings deduction     to encourage business owners to look forward and plan ahead by using buildings that will save money and electricity over the long run     Transportation costs accounted for 58 percent of federal energy consumption in FY 2002   The federal government would decrease energy costs by both requiring that the federal fleet exceed CAF   standards and requiring that at least 10 percent of the motor vehicles purchased by an Executive agency in any fiscal year will be high efficiency vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles     America   s energy policy must encourage energy efficient communities and behavior   Congress should encourage smart growth through funding transit oriented development corridors with upgrades in transit facilities  bicycle transportation facilities  and pedestrian walkways     America should promote energy efficiency in all communities by increasing funding for weatherization assistance   In the 27 years since its founding  DOE   s Weatherization Assistance Program has served over 5 3 million low income families   Low income families spend an average of 14 percent of their annual income on energy costs  while other households spend only 3 5 percent   Weatherization reduces greenhouse gas emissions by one ton per weatherized home  and decreases U S  energy consumption by the equivalent of 15 million barrels of oil every year     Congress should create federal tax incentives for employers who provide telecommuting to their employees   Telecommuting has successfully reduced both transportation and energy use  and the EPA reports that if just 10 percent of the nation s workforce telecommuted just one day a week  Americans would conserve more than 1 2 million gallons of fuel per week     The U S  needs to enact mandatory  tradable emissions caps   Not only is this a policy that enjoys the broad support of businesses  environmental groups  scientists  and Members of Congress  it is the right thing to do for our Country   s future  and for the well being of our children and grandchildren     America must make renewable energy commercially viable  and make the up front investment in renewable energy infrastructure that will bring renewable energy to the marketplace     The U S  needs a federal renewable portfolio standard to ensure consumer access to renewable energy  by requiring electric utilities to get a larger portion of the energy they provide to Americans from renewable sources      America needs to find new ways to move renewable energy     by creating electricity transmission lines designed to carry electricity from renewable sources     Congress must make the renewable energy production credit permanent  to provide long term incentives to increase private infrastructural investment in the production of renewable energy     America has lagged behind Europe in using biodiesel as one way to reduce our use of oil   Maryland Biodiesel  owned by James and Virginia Warren  is the only plant of its kind in the state  and will use plant and animal oil byproducts that are currently thrown away   More than 600 000 cars capable of running on alternative fuels have been produced each year since 2000   The U S  must dramatically increase the federal commitment to alternative fuels and vehicle technology programs  and increase the use of alternative fuels in federal and state fleets  by developing biofuel plants in every region of the country  and speeding development of standards that are needed to promote alternative fuels use     We need to increase the renewable energy use and energy efficiency of the Federal Government     the Federal government should lead the country in energy efficiency   All new federal buildings should be required to live up to green building LEED  Leadership and Energy in Environmental Design  standards  set by the United States Green Building Council   Energy used in buildings in FY 2002 accounted for 38 percent of the total Federal energy bill   Total Federal buildings and facilities energy expenditures in FY 2002 were  3 73 billion   This federal investment in green building will save the treasury millions while reducing overall electricity consumption     The federal government should ensure that at least 20 percent of the electricity consumed by non defense activities of the government will be generated from renewable sources or zero emission fossil fuel energy sources by 2017     America should establish a program of grants  low interest loans  and loan guarantees for the commercialization of new renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies     The U S  must dramatically increase federal energy research and development commitments     Increasing America   s energy research dollars will help bring technologies that hold great promise but are not feasible today     such as hydrogen powered automobiles  cellulosic ethanol  and nuclear fusion energy     to the marketplace faster     Congress should implement the changes suggested by the National Academy of Sciences    Report  Rising Above a Gathering Storm     to ensure U S  competitiveness in research and scientific development  including marked increases in The Department of Energy   s R funding      Finally  we should create a Blue Ribbon Energy Commission  which would meet every 2 years starting in 2008  to evaluate our progress in efforts to become energy independent and the impact of provisions of new policy  and to recommend additional changes to be made in reports to Congress     so that our energy policy remains focused on our 3 goals of energy independence  fossil fuel independence  and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions     For the sake of our security  economy and environment  America needs a comprehensive energy policy that is independent of foreign sources and weans America off of fossil fuels
