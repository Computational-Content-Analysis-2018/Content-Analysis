MD   a Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  today demanded accountability from the Bush Administration for the questionable firings of eight U S  Attorneys      Speaking on the Senate Floor  Sen  Cardin expressed outrage about reports that officials at the Justice Department  with guidance from the White House  may well have politicized the hiring and firing of U S  Attorneys in an effort to interfere with pending public corruption cases   He also expressed his support for legislation  S  214  to reinstate the Senate confirmation process for the appointments of all U S  Attorneys      Last week  the Senator voted to issue subpoenas to current and former Justice Department officials and federal prosecutors to require them to appear before the Judiciary Committee to defend their role in the firings   Sen  Cardin also believes that White House advisers Karl Rove and Harriet Miers should testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee  If they do not agree to testify willingly  the Senator supports issuing subpoenas   The Judiciary Committee will vote later this week on whether to subpoena Rove and Miers       The following excerpts are from Senator Cardin s remarks delivered today on the Senate Floor      On March 6th  former U S  Attorneys appeared before the Judiciary Committee and their testimony was chilling   They talked about being intimidated and pressured by the Department of Justice and by the White House   They were fired  despite the fact they had received excellent performance evaluations by the Department of Justice   In several of these cases  the U S  Attorney was involved in high profile political investigations  some of which the Administration was not happy about    The Judiciary Committee is continuing its work   I know that there were a lot of documents made available last night to the Judiciary Committee   What we need to have is the personal appearance of those who were directly involved  Ms  Miers  Mr  Rove  and Mr  Sampson  Those testimonies need to take place in the Judiciary Committee in the open  under oath  so we can get the information as to what exactly did happen with regard to the dismissals of the U S  Attorneys    The U S  Attorney is the chief federal law enforcement officer in our states   The U S  Attorney must work independently   The U S  Attorney must carry out his or her responsibilities for the entire country   He is not the attorney for the President   The Department of Justice must maintain that independence   A U S  Attorney has enormous power to determine who should be investigated and who should be prosecuted and what type of punishment should be recommended   It s a tremendous amount of power that must be exercised with total independence    The manner in which these eight U S  Attorneys were removed from office raised many concerns       about the independence of the U S  Attorney    It raises concerns as to whether the Department of Justice or the White House was trying to influence the independent judgment of a U S  Attorney in a specific investigation   It raises concerns as to how Congress was kept informed as to how the removals were being handled   The information that was made available to us has been inconsistent   It raises questions as to whether Congress  itself  was being misled by the Department of Justice    This legislation would restore that appointment of our interim U S  Attorneys to how it was prior to the passage of the PATRIOT Act   The PATRIOT Act included       a provision that affected the appointment of interim U S  Attorneys   Prior to the passage of that provision  the Department of Justice had the ability to appoint interim U S  Attorneys for up to 120 days without the confirmation of this body     This legislation will restore the right balance between the Executive and Legislative branches of government   It will encourage the Department of Justice to work with this body so that interim U S  Attorneys and permanent appointments can be considered timely and the confirmation process can be moved forward   More importantly  this legislation is necessary because of the recent actions of the Department of Justice
