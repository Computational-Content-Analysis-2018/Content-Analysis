January 4  2007      WASHINGTON  D C    Just hours after being officially sworn in as Maryland s 62nd U S  Senator  Sen  Benjamin L  Cardin  D MD  introduced legislation to fix the flawed Medicare Part D program  which has left millions of Americans without adequate prescription drug coverage   Sen  Cardin was a national leader on health care in the House of Representatives and looks forward to bringing his expertise and experience to the U S  Senate      On my first day in the U S  Senate  I am taking action to help the millions of American seniors who are struggling to make ends meet   said Sen  Cardin   Too many seniors cannot afford their prescription drugs  but the Medicare prescription drug plan benefits the pharmaceutical companies more than our seniors   We need to improve access to health care in America  and we can start by fixing the broken Medicare Part D program   I will be reaching out to Senators from both sides of the aisle because I believe we must work together to give seniors the real prescription drug benefit they deserve      Sen  Cardin s bill  The Preserving Medicare for All Act of 2007  will allow the federal government to negotiate the price of prescription drugs under Medicare  which will bring down the cost for millions of seniors   The Senator s bill also will require Medicare Part D to cover benzodiazepines  an entire class of anti anxiety drugs that are now excluded       As a Member of the House  then Rep  Cardin opposed the law creating Part D  calling it a  raw deal for seniors    Following are provisions of Sen  Cardin s bill      Lowering Prescription Drug Costs  Current Medicare Part D Program  Specifically prohibits the government from negotiating for the best price possible for prescription drugs  allowing prescription drug companies to charge U S  consumers and taxpayers two to three times the fair price for prescription drugs       Sen  Cardin s Plan  Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for American seniors   This provision allows the government to benefit from the free market bargaining power of 40 million Medicare beneficiaries and pay far less for prescription drugs      Providing a Guaranteed  Universally Available Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Option  Current Medicare Part D Program  There is no guaranteed prescription drug benefit for America s seniors  Under this flawed plan  private insurance companies can design the drug plans they offer  including the the monthly premiums  copay levels  participating pharmacies  and the drugs that are covered   The 2003 law also allows insurers to change their lists of drugs at any time  even though seniors can only change plans once a year       Sen  Cardin s Plan  Guarantees that all seniors will be able to choose   in addition to the options offered by the Republican plan   a universally available  defined prescription drug benefit plan administered through Medicare  This provision will provide seniors with the option of a plan with a set premium  deductible  and copay levels that will be established by law  not by private insurance companies       Encouraging Employers to Continue Providing Coverage for Retirees  Current Medicare Part D Program  Will likely lead to employers dropping their prescription drug plans for retirees because it does not fully reimburse employers for the drugs they currently cover and it fails to count employer contributions towards seniors  out of pocket cost limitations      Sen  Cardin s Plan  Fully reimburses employers for the cost of retiree drug coverage that would have been covered by Medicare and permits benefits provided by employers to count towards seniors  out of pocket cost limitations   This will give employers an incentive to continue providing retired employees with prescription drug coverage       Eliminating Overpayments to Private Health Plans  Current Medicare Part D Program  Offers  12 billion to private health insurers who previously dropped their Medicare plans to resume their participation in Medicare   Evidence has shown that private plans already receive more than 120 percent in fee for service costs         Sen  Cardin s Plan  Eliminates these overpayments to private health insurers and uses the funds to strengthen the traditional Medicare program for seniors       Covering Important Anti Anxiety Drugs  Current Medicare Part D Program  Completely excludes coverage for an important class of medicines called benzodiazepines  which include frequently used drugs such as Xanax  Ativan and Valium  These drugs are used for a variety of disorders  including severe anxiety  panic attacks  seizures  skeletal muscle disorders and insomnia        Sen Cardin s Plan  Requires Medicare Part D to cover benzodiazepines  including Xanax  Avitan and Valium  The Secretary of Health and Human Services would review all prescribing protocols to ensure safety
