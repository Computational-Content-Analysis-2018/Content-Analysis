                                                                           We Must Protect Maryland s Unique Environment   Wednesday  April 4  2007      Oren Shur  202 224 4524  Susan Sullam  410 962 4436     WASHINGTON   Sen  Benjamin L  Cardin  D MD   a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  today secured the authorization for a host of federal projects to preserve and improve Maryland s unique environment and assist the Port of Baltimore   The projects  which will benefit communities across Maryland and increase efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay  are included in the Water Resource Development Act of 2007  WRDA   which passed in committee today       Sen  Cardin will work with Sen  Barbara A  Mikulski  D MD  in gaining final approval and funding of these Maryland projects when they go before the Appropriations Committee and full Senate in the coming weeks       In Maryland  we take a lot of pride in our environment   said Sen  Cardin    From the western mountains to the Eastern Shore and the Chesapeake Bay  our state is home to one of the nation s most unique and pristine environments   But in Maryland  our environment doesn t just provide us with nice scenery  it is also a major economic engine  Thousands of jobs in our state depend on our ecosystems and natural resources   It s important for everyone to realize that our environment is a gift  not an entitlement  and we need to protect it   I will continue to fight to make sure Maryland gets its fair share of federal dollars to protect and preserve our unique environment        Sen  Cardin successfully fought for the authorization of the following programs to be included in WRDA to protect and restore Maryland s unique environment  expanded descriptions below        30 million for Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program  50 million for Chesapeake Bay oyster restoration  192 1 million for the expansion of Poplar Island  off the coast of Talbot County  16 7 million for the Cumberland Flood Mitigation Project  9 4 million for the Smith Island Ecosystem Restoration Project Calls for a 10 year action plan for restoration of Anacostia River   Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program  The bill authorizes  30 million for the Army Corps of Engineers to assist state and local authorities in a variety of projects to help restore the Chesapeake Bay s water quality and living resources  including  sewage treatment plant upgrades  making beneficial use of dredged materials  removing impediments to fish passage  mitigating the impacts of shoreline erosion and restoring wetlands and oyster reefs     Chesapeake Bay Oyster Restoration  Oyster populations in Maryland and Virginia are on the decline  WRDA increases funding for critical oyster restoration programs to  50 million   By restoring the physical oyster habitat  creating new oyster reefs and planting disease free oysters on these reefs  the Army Corps of Engineers can increase oyster populations and ultimately help ensure the economic and environmental revival of the bay   Oysters are currently at just one percent of their historic abundance     Expansion of Poplar Island  The bill authorizes  192 1 million for the expansion of Poplar Island  which sits off the coast of Talbot County  by 575 acres  This expansion was recommended by the Army Corps of Engineers in order to address the dredged material created by keeping the channels into the Port of Baltimore open in an economically and environmentally sound manner   The Poplar Island Restoration Project had been on track to create almost 200 acres of wetlands  and it serves as breeding habitat for Maryland terrapins   Because of natural and man made canals  the shipping channels must be dredged regularly to keep traffic moving into and out of the Port of Baltimore  one of the largest ports on the East Coast    Cumberland Flood Mitigation Project  The bill authorizes  16 7 million to continue the Cumberland Flood Mitigation Project  which provides for the restoration of a 1 2 mile section of the C   O Canal in Cumberland  MD  The project will restore the integrity of the historic canal and assist in revitalizing the area as a major hub for tourism and environmentally sound economic development   The Army Corps of Engineers investigated the feasibility of reconstructing and re watering the turning basin and Canal near its terminus and determined that it is feasible to re water the canal successfully without compromising the flood protection for the City of Cumberland      Smith Island Ecosystem Restoration Project  The bill authorizes  9 4 million in federal funds for the Smith Island Ecosystem Restoration Project to stop or reverse the tremendous loss of underwater bay grasses around parts of Smith Island in Somerset County   An Army Corps of Engineers report found that severe erosion was causing numerous water resource problems at Smith Island  including  the loss of over 3 000 acres of valuable wetlands in the last 150 years  the loss of 2 400 acres of bay grasses between 1992 and 1998 alone  shoaling in the navigation channels  sedimentation  and endangerment to populated areas   The authorized funding would be used to construct off shore segmented breakwaters and back filling to create additional wetlands along the coastline of Martin National Wildlife Refuge in order to address these environmental concerns around parts of Smith Island  Bay grasses provide essential habitat for blue crabs and other species     Anacostia River Restoration  The bill instructs the federal government  in coordination with the Mayor of Washington D C   Governor of Maryland  and the county executives of Montgomery and Prince George s counties  to develop a 10 year action plan to provide restoration and protection of the Anacostia River and its tributaries   The Anacostia River is currently one of the most degraded rivers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and in the nation
