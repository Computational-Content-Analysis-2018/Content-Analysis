The club isn't the best place to find a loverSo the bar is where I goMe and my friends at the table doing shotsDrinking fast and then we talk slowCome over and start up a conversation with just meAnd trust me I'll give it a chance nowTake my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukeboxAnd then we start to dance, and now I'm singing likeGirl, you know I want your loveYour love was handmade for somebody like meCome on now, follow my leadI may be crazy, don't mind meSay, boy, let's not talk too muchGrab on my waist and put that body on meCome on now, follow my leadCome, come on now, follow my leadI'm in love with the shape of youWe push and pull like a magnet doAlthough my heart is falling tooI'm in love with your bodyAnd last night you were in my roomAnd now my bedsheets smell like youEvery day discovering something brand newI'm in love with your bodyOh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—II'm in love with your bodyOh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—II'm in love with your bodyOh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—II'm in love with your bodyEvery day discovering something brand newI'm in love with the shape of youOne week in we let the story beginWe're going out on our first dateYou and me are thrifty, so go all you can eatFill up your bag and I fill up a plateWe talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sourAnd how your family is doing okayLeave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseatTell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing likeGirl, you know I want your loveYour love was handmade for somebody like meCome on now, follow my leadI may be crazy, don't mind meSay, boy, let's not talk too muchGrab on my waist and put that body on meCome on now, follow my leadCome, come on now, follow my leadI'm in love with the shape of youWe push and pull like a magnet doAlthough my heart is falling tooI'm in love with your bodyAnd last night you were in my roomAnd now my bedsheets smell like youEvery day discovering something brand newI'm in love with your bodyOh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—II'm in love with your bodyOh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—II'm in love with your bodyOh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—II'm in love with your bodyEvery day discovering something brand newI'm in love with the shape of youCome on, be my baby, come onCome on, be my baby, come onCome on, be my baby, come onCome on, be my baby, come onCome on, be my baby, come onCome on, be my baby, come onCome on, be my baby, come onCome on, be my baby, come onI'm in love with the shape of youWe push and pull like a magnet doAlthough my heart is falling tooI'm in love with your bodyLast night you were in my roomAnd now my bedsheets smell like youEvery day discovering something brand newI'm in love with your bodyCome on, be my baby, come onCome on, be my baby, come onI'm in love with your bodyCome on, be my baby, come onCome on, be my baby, come onI'm in love with your bodyCome on, be my baby, come onCome on, be my baby, come onI'm in love with your bodyEvery day discovering something brand newI'm in love with the shape of you
