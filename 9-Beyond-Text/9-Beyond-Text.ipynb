Lossless files save all information the microphone recorded. Lossy files, by contrast, drop sections humans are unlikely to notice. Recorded frequencies for both types are then typically compressed, which introduces further loss. To work with audio files, we want a format that is preferably lossless or minimally compressed. We will work with `wav` files here. Note that `mp3` is not acceptable. If you do not have `wav` files, we can use python to convert to `wav`."

Most recording systems use a $2^{16} = 65536$ bit system. Quantisation is a rounding process, where high bit quantisation produces values close to reality with values rounded to a high number of significant digits, and low bit quantisation produces values further from reality with values rounded a low number of significants digits. Low quantisation can lead to impaired quality signal. <img src=\"../data/bitrate.png\"> This figure illustrates how digital sounds is a discrete process along the amplitude scale: a 3 bit, $2^3=8$, quantization (gray bars) gives a rough approximation of the sin wave (red line)."

    "\n",
    "Recall our earlier use of scikit-learn for machine learning. Now we will use scikit-image to do some simple image processing. Here we will perform three operations for 'blob' of simple object detection. In computer vision, blob detection methods aim to detect regions in a digital image that differ in properties, such as brightness or color, compared to surrounding regions. Informally, a blob is a region of an image in which some properties are approximately constant or similar to each other. We will do this in three ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will take the Laplacian of an image, which is a 2-D isotropic (applying equally well in all directions) measure of the 2nd spatial derivative of an image. The Laplacian of an image highlights regions of rapid intensity change and is therefore often used for edge detection. This Laplacian is taken of the image once a Gaussian smoothing filter has been applied in order to reduce its sensitivity to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laplacian $L(x,y)$ of an image with pixel intensity values $I(x,y)$ is given by: $L(x,y)=\\frac{\\delta^2x}{\\delta x^2} + \\frac{\\delta^2y}{\\delta y^2}$. A Gaussian smoothing filter takes a 2 dimensional Guassian, $G(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma^2} e^\\frac{-x^2 + y^2}{2\\sigma^2}$, which looks like: <img src=\"http://www.librow.com/content/common/images/articles/article-9/2d_distribution.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This Gaussian *kernel* is applied to the pixel intensities of the image via *convolution* -- the kernel is multiplied by the pixel intensities, while centered on each pixel, then added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blob detector computes the [Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.feature.html#skimage.feature.blob_log) images with successively increasing standard deviation and stacks them up in a cube. Blobs are local maximas within this cube. Detecting larger blobs is slower because of larger kernel sizes during convolution. Bright blobs on dark backgrounds are detected."

The determinant is the scaling factor of each patch. This approach is fastest and detects blobs by finding maximas in this matrix (of the Determinant of the Hessian of the image).

To learn more about deep learning and convolutional neural networks, spend some time with Andrew Ng's excellent [tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/). Because such algorithms require substantial computing power, none of the high-quality classifiers or detectors currently available are implemented in python, although many can be called via api. The most popular open source image object detector is UC Berkeley's [*caffe*](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) library of trained and trainable neural nets written in C++. (Check out the [python api](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/python/caffe/pycaffe.py)). Scene classifiers can be built on top of caffe, such as MIT's [Places](http://places.csail.mit.edu). "

    "<span style=\"color:red\">Construct cells immediately below this that report the results from experiments in which you place each of images taken or retrieved for the last exercise through the online demos for [caffe](http://demo.caffe.berkeleyvision.org) and [places](http://places.csail.mit.edu/demo.html). Paste the image and the output for both object detector and scene classifier below, beside one another. Calculate precision and recall for caffe's ability to detect objects of interest across your images. What do you think about Places' scene categories and their assignments to your images? What would be improved labels for your images? Could you use image classification to enhance your research project and, if so, how?"
